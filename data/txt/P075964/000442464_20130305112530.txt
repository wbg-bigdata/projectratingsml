1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1. Context at Appraisal

Country Issues

1.      After having experienced substantial economic growth up until the early 1980s,
Cameroon suffered an economic crisis that lasted nearly ten years and resulted in a decline
of its GDP until1994. From a social point of view, difficulties reached a climax when the
salaries of civil servants were cut by one-half in 1993 and when the FCFA was devalued in
early 1994. After that, the situation gradually improved: between 1994 and 2002, GDP
increased regularly at a fairly strong rate of 4.6%, while the GDP per capita increased by
2% per year in real terms. Yet, in 2002, the GDP per capita was still 15% lower than that of
1990 when holding price constant.

2.     In 2000, the high level of external debt had qualified the country to become a
“Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)? and eligible for corresponding financial
provisions. Since that time, macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment served
to improve the fiscal situation and provided a framework for development. From 1996 to
2003, poverty declined by 13 percentage points; nevertheless, an estimated 40 percent of
the population was below the poverty line. Cameroon graduated from the HIPC program in
2007.

Sector Issues

3.      The education system performed well in the 1980s and then deteriorated
significantly in the 1990s as a consequence of the economic crisis. This crisis caused
significant erosion in teachers’ salaries and resulted in a failure by the Government to
invest adequate resources in infrastructure and materials. This then played a role in
generating widespread corruption among teachers and administration officials and led to a
significant decline in enrollment in primary education.

4.     In 1999, taking advantage of the HIPC initiative and in a bold effort to reverse this
downward trend, the Government of Cameroon decided to remove primary education
school fees and to implement an action plan to revitalize the sector. This action plan was
described in an official paper entitled, Stratégie du Secteur de l’Education 2000, which
called for a substantial increase in public funding to education, the stepping up of
government efforts in the Zones d ’Education Prioritaire (ZEP: North, Far North, East, and
Adamawa and slums around Yaounde and Douala) and a crackdown on corrupt practices to
which the loss of as much as 30 percent of the total sector resources had been attributed.

5.      These measures allowed for significant progress as suggested by the following
indicators. Government recurrent expenditures on education. After reaching an all-time
low of CFAF 21,000 in 1995, expenditures per primary education student had increased to
                                          1
CFAF 45,000 in 2001 (in 2001 CFAF). Gross enrollment rates: The primary education
Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) increased from 87.7% in 2000 to 105.4% in 2002, signifying
over-age students enrolling in the system. The elimination of primary education school fees
in 1999 was partially instrumental in achieving this progress. Regional equity. The action
plan in favor of the ZEP has contributed to a rapid increase of enrollment in the North, Far
North and Adamawa, where virtually all 6 year old children currently start school.

6.     Despite this encouraging recovery and despite the fact that universal access to grade
1 had virtually been achieved, only 63% of students completed six years of primary
education.1 This poor completion rate was attributable to repetition rates which, depending
on the grades, hovered between 15% and 30%. This in turn resulted in high drop-out rates
among children. These repetition rates were much higher than the Sub-Saharan African
(SSA) average. Further, the national ratio of girls to boys, that had been improving, slowed,
and stabilized at about 85% in 2002.2

7.      To meet the related Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the education system
had to take three important steps to address existing challenges. It had to: (i) increase
internal efficiency by reducing repetition and dropout rates, (ii) narrow social disparities
between regions and gender in education outcomes, and (iii) strengthen administrative
capacity and governance to ensure better and more transparent use of limited public
resources. Moreover, the Government had become increasingly aware of the need to
diversify post-basic education and make it more responsive to labor market demand by
improving the quality and relevance of instruction and by further developing the capacity
of local universities to generate knowledge.

8.      The United Nations Development Indicators for Health revealed that Cameroon’s
Health Index (defined as life expectancy at birth expressed as an index using a minimum
value of 20 years and observed maximum value over 1980-2010) for 1990, 2000, and 2005,
was respectively .525, .475, and .464, and so was worsening, even if figures for infant
mortality were improving (results for 1990, 2000, 2005 show that the deaths per 1000 were
90, 84, 80, respectively). Given this, action was needed to improve child health, so the
project included School Health Cards which would be one way to act through schools.

9.      Also of note here is that sector governance became fragmented at the time the
project was being designed. Following the elections in December 2004, the Ministry of
Education divided into three ministries: the Ministry of Basic Education (MINEDUB), the
Ministry of Secondary Education (MINESEC), and the Ministry of TVET (MINEFOP).
The Ministry of Higher Education (MINESUP) remained unaffected. The consequences of
this division will be discussed in detail in paragraphs 88 and on below, but it is enough to

  In comparison, completion rates for 2010-11 are 88.4 % (from RESEN 2012). For more information, see the
   RESEN 2012.
2
  In comparison, this ratio for 2010-11 remains at 86% (from World Bank Data).
                                                   2
mention here that coordination requirements, and therefore risks, increased as a result of
this new configuration.

10.     Finally, there was an FTI project prepared and launched (the Education for All-Fast
Track Initiative (P116437) of 08/25/2010 concurrently with the present project under
review.

Rationale for Bank assistance

11.     The rationale for IDA’s involvement in the education sector resided in its capacity
to help prepare sector analyses, develop new policies and improve coordination among
donors. With respect to sector analyses, IDA played a key role in the development of the
2003 education sector Country Status Report (CSR) by a national team, which received
technical assistance from France. The CSR became a key reference in policy decision-
making and enabled the national team to gain a better understanding of sector-related
analytical methods and to develop financial simulation and medium-term budget
frameworks. With respect to policy development, IDA facilitated policy dialogue (from the
year 2000 on) by organizing and funding workshops that brought together various branches
of the Government, key stakeholders and donors. These activities contributed to the
adoption of new policies and laws such as the private education law, the textbook
publishing and distribution policy, and the school management and decentralization
decrees. With respect to improving coordination among donors, in February 2005, IDA
initiated a dialogue between the Government and the key donors which aimed to harmonize
aid procedures in the education sector and coordinate future aid, with a view to move to a
Sector-Wide Approach in the following years. As a result of this process, the Government
launched the preparation of a long term sector strategy and investment program, which
would build on the results of the CSR and would develop collaboratively all technical and
financial partners in education. By adding a lending operation to its activities at that time,
IDA believed it would be in a better position to pursue the above-mentioned activities,
while focusing on capacity-building and assisting the Government in implementing reforms
that had already been adopted.

12.     At the same time, the Bank had not worked in the basic education sector in
Cameroon for some time before this project (though it was working in tertiary education).
By all accounts, corruption was acknowledged to be a major challenge in the country, one
that would threaten the success of projects. To understand the rationale for Bank assistance,
despite this threat, it is also important to see the project within the context of a ‘new
beginning’: at the time, Cameroon had accepted to carry out a number of structural
adjustments to obtain debt-relief in the context of the Highly Indebted Poor Country
program (HIPC), a joint venture of the World Bank and the IMF. Some of these changes
were in the education sector, where the elimination of school fees was perhaps the most
notable. The Government’s commitment to reform signaled to the donor community a
‘new beginning’ and provided the Bank with the assurance it sought to begin an education
project in good faith.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the project was “to increase the efficiency and equity of primary and
secondary education, with a focus on disadvantaged areas, and to increase capacity for high
quality training in targeted disciplines in higher education? (from Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) dated May 5, 2005).

Key Indicators

    A. Lower degree of randomness in teacher allocation from 45% to 25%;
    B. Primary repetition rates reduced from 25% to 15%;
                                                                                                           3
    C. Female to male primary enrollment ratio in the Project Intervention Area
       increased from 0.58 to 0.90.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

13.    The objective of the revised project was “to develop and apply management and
learning tools for use by government and communities to improve efficiency and
accountability of the Cameroon education sector.? (from Restructuring Paper dated April 6,
2010).

Key Indicators

    A.       Preparation of budgets at the primary, secondary and higher levels of the
             education system based on statistical analysis;
    B.       Improved efficiency and equity in teacher deployment;
    C.       Biennial update of the ESS based on analytic work conducted during preceding
             two years;
    D.       Beneficiary participation in school functioning and school accountability in 86
             selected schools in the Zone à Education Prioritaire (Priority Education Areas).

Reasons for change

14.    The revised PDO aimed to support strategies and actions of the new Education
Sector Strategy (ESS) the objective of which was aimed at reinforcing management of the
education system. The ESS, established by the Government in 2006, had four objectives,
improvements in: (i) access and equity, (ii) quality and efficiency; (iii) private sector and
partnership; and (iv) management and governance. The ESS aimed to reach this fourth goal
through improved strategic management, evaluation capacity and planning of the education


3
  These include primarily Education Priority Areas in the country (zone à éducation prioritaire (ZEP)) found
in Adamaoua, the North, the Far North, and the East where most educational challenges, in terms of access,
retention, equity and quality, are confronted.
                                                     4
system. The original project was restructured to better align the PDO with the new ESS,
and to contribute to the fourth objective of the ESS.

15.     Specifically, the restructured project aimed to provide tools, training and other
forms of support to various key stakeholders including but not limited to education
authorities, communities and the general public to: (i) continually hone the strategic vision
for the education system through analysis, knowledge sharing and dissemination; (ii)
improve the education information system to ensure greater accountability and better
decision making; (iii) improve sector monitoring by education authorities, the government
and the public; and (iv) provide opportunities for greater participation of beneficiaries in
education decision making, thus increasing accountability.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

Project Beneficiaries (by Component)

Comp. 1        All key Ministry of Basic Education (MINEDUB) officials at the central,
               provincial and departmental levels, and those officials working within each
               of these levels, who will have been trained to utilize and apply the manuals
               and guides intended to reinforce the capacity of the internal auditing
               division (Inspection Générale des Services - IGP) and the Observatoire de
               la Governance.
Comp. 2        Those staff in the MINEDUB HR unit, at the central and decentralized
               levels, concerned with teacher management who will receive training in
               improved teacher allocation methods. Indirectly, beneficiaries are also those
               who benefit from the improved allocation of teachers to available posts: that
               is, teachers, students and the communities concerned.
Comp. 3        Those in the planning department who will receive training in improved
               planning methods.
Comp. 4        The practitioners in the public sector, scientific professionals, especially
               those who operate between academia and the public sector, and those
               working for the private sector and NGOs.

Project Beneficiaries (Revised, by Component)

Comp. 1        Those who will benefit from the improved management of the education
               sector, through: regularly updated documentation used to support the
               development of the sector; updated action plans for the education sector
               strategy; analytical tools; and tools that facilitate knowledge exchanges and
               participation in the international dialogue on education (CITI and GDLN).
Comp. 2        Those benefitting from regular data collection that will lead to improved
               monitoring of the system at every level via strengthening of the information
               systems and improved planning capacity, notably through the annual

                  school health cards for primary and secondary education.4
Comp. 3           Those benefitting from improved internal monitoring from the preparation
                  and dissemination of institutional audits.
Comp. 4           Beneficiaries in 86 identified Priority Education Areas who will gain from
                  improved participation in the education sector.

1.5. Original Components

Comp. 1           Reinforcing administrative management
                  The objective of this component was to improve the administrative
                  management, personnel management, and planning of the education system.
                  These planned improvements are founded on the Government’s orientation
                  in favor of decentralization in the sector.
Comp. 2           Reinforcing pedagogic management
                  The objective of this component was to improve pedagogic management in
                  order to make the teaching and learning process more efficient. The key
                  outcome was to reduce repetition from 25 percent to less than 15 percent, in
                  addition to renovating the structure and curricula of secondary education.
Comp. 3           Supporting enrollment and reducing the gender inequity in the
                  Education Priority Areas (ZEP)
                  This component aimed at increasing the demand for primary education and
                  promoting gender equity in the Adamawa, Far-North, East, and North
                  provinces. The main outcome of this component was to increase Gross
                  Enrollment Rate (GER) from 84.4% to 100% and the Gender Parity Index
                  from 0.58 to 0.90 in the target areas.
Comp. 4           Building the Capacity of the higher education institutions
                  The objective of this component was to raise the overall quality and
                  relevance of teaching, research and professional development by improving
                  the system’s ability to internally generate a critical mass of high quality
                  academics, researchers and professionals, particularly in disciplines critical
                  to the country’s development.

  School health cards were introduced at the school level to help begin to counter the worsening health of the
student population. See section 1, Sector Issues.

                                                      6
1.6. Revised Components

16.     The project was restructured twice. On April 6, 2010, the project was restructured
significantly, as explained below; secondly, on August 23, 2012, a level II restructuring
took place to re-allocate funds across eligible expenditure categories. No other changes
were made, and the closing date of September 1, 2012 also remained the same as the
original project closing date.

Revised Project

17.     The revised PDO focused on supporting the Education Sector Strategy (ESS) that
aimed to strengthen and improve management of the education system. The restructured
project included four components that target four key areas of education planning and
management. All existing activities in the original design were reorganized under the
restructured components to facilitate coherence in project design and to improve project
monitoring. The revised project objective resulted in a significant shift in focus from the
original project.

Comp. 1 Develop and update the strategic vision for the education sector.
        Specifically, this Component aimed “to create capacity for continuous
        development of Cameroon’s Education Sector Strategy by supporting
        knowledge exchange and the production of relevant studies.? The activities
        planned under Component 1 include: (i) the preparation of studies relevant to
        the improvement of the education sector’s strategic vision; (ii) capacity building
        activities for the sector; and (iii) establishment of the Global Development
        Learning Network (GDLN) and the Inter-University Resource Documentation
        Centers (Centre Inter-Universitaire des Ressources Documentaires, CIRD). The
        intended outcome of these activities is the capacity to continuously update the
        education sector strategy, based on the most recent qualitative and quantitative
        data and enhanced by international knowledge sharing.
Comp. 2 Strengthening the education information system and planning capacity.
        The objective of Component 2 was: “to improve management of the education
        system at all levels by reinforcing the information systems and planning
        capacity for the production of timely and accurate statistical data and the
        production of sector action plans.? The activities under Component 2 include
        the development of management that improve the collection, compilation,
        analysis and dissemination of statistics to support decision making and
        accountability of the primary, secondary and higher education levels of the
        education system. This includes the acquisition of equipment and training in
        relevant technical areas. The intended outcomes are the improvement in the
        efficiency of the education sector’s information system, production of education
        monitoring tools of current education status, and a school health map to inform
        the preparation of a new school health policy.
Comp. 3 Reinforcing sector monitoring. The objective of Component 3 was: “to
        reinforce sector norms, improve capacity to monitor compliance with norms and
                                            7
        regulations and to improve education resource management at the primary and
        secondary levels.? This component includes activities that reinforce the
        capacity to evaluate management reforms. They include training, workshops,
        and technical assistance. The component will also provide tools and
        instruments in the form of technical support to improve the implementation of
        the new private education law.
Comp. 4 Improving public participation. The objective of Component 4 was: “to
        increase the public accountability of the education system.? This component
        includes (i) public awareness campaigns and governance workshops to increase
        public accountability of the education system; and (ii) a school rehabilitation
        program in the Priority Education Areas (ZEP, Zones d'éducation prioritaires)
        regions aims to increase accountability of government financed actions to
        beneficiary communities

18.     The restructured project was to have the following new outcome indicators: (i)
preparation of budgets based on statistical analysis at every level of the education system;
(ii) improved efficiency and equity in teachers’ allocation; (iii) biennial update of the ESS
on the basis of analytical studies; (iv) increased beneficiary participation in school
functioning and school accountability in 86 selected schools in the Priority Education Area
(Zone à éducation prioritaire (ZEP)).

1.7. Other significant changes

19.      Three other complementary changes because of restructuring were also made: First,
coordination structures were streamlined and strengthened. Two changes were made in the
institutional arrangements of the project to improve the coordination between Ministries
and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). First, a representative of the Presidency was
added to the Project Steering Committee. Second, the membership of the Operational
Monitoring Unit (OMU) in each Ministry was streamlined. Second, new implementation
arrangements for School projects under Component 4 came into effect. School projects
under Component 4 were to be implemented through a delegated management arrangement
(Maîtrise d’Ouvrage Délégué – MOD) in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.
Third, the project was required to follow/adhere tothe provisions of the new Anti-
corruption guidelines (“Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in
Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants?, dated October 15, 2006).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Lessons of earlier operations taken into account for the original project design

20.      A health project in Cameroon that closed in 2001 (Health, Fertility and Nutrition
Project (P000411)) provided some relevant lessons: (i) that it is important to be realistic
concerning expectations and that systems must be in place for measuring performance; (ii)
project design should be simple, especially in sectors without prior experience with Bank
operations; and (iii) institutional assessments must be carried out on implementing bodies.
The Higher Education Technical Training Project (LIL-Credit 3110), that was completed
just prior to this project under review, also provided some worthy lessons: first, legal and
institutional reforms can be derailed at the last moment, even when consensus exists and
when they are technically sound. Consequently, major decrees -- such as those related to
the creation of autonomous institutions under component 4 of the current project -- should
be enacted before the start of the Project. Second, replication of high-quality technical
institutions is hampered by the system’s inability to replace human resources which are
regularly lost through brain drain and lack of cost-efficient alternatives to studying
overseas. All lessons above were considered useful and reflected in project design.

Quality Enhancement Review

21.     The recommendations of various specialists were also sought during a Quality
Enhancement Review (QER)5 in order to gather lessons relevant to the issues of repetition
and dropout. Most OECD countries did not believe that repetition improves education
outcomes and so have adopted automatic, or quasi-automatic, promotion policies. In
Africa, there is a consensus among specialists that students who repeat a grade tend to drop
out of school earlier than those who don’t. However, while there are strong technical
arguments in favor of curbing repetition rates (as most developed countries have), such
policies are controversial in Cameroon. They tend to be rejected by both parents and
teachers. The teachers worried that they will be sending students forward who are
unprepared and will not succeed later. 6 In this project, a compromise approach was
adopted whereby only within-cycle repetition would be eliminated at first. More extensive
changes were to be envisaged once a broader sharing of research evidence had been carried
out, and parents and teachers were convinced of its validity.

  Note that this is also used as an excuse to charge students additional tuition for extra classes. It becomes a
source of corruption, in other words. 
                                                       9
Risks and mitigations

22.     In the original project design, critical risks and possible controversial aspects
(identified in the PAD) were the following.

23.     Political risk. Although the government was already putting in place an impressive
reform agenda, the concern was that the pace of the reform process would decline
following the elections in December 2004, which had divided the Ministry of Education
into three ministries: MINEDUB, MINESEC, and MINEFOP. The MINESUP existed as a
separate entity. Coordination requirements, and therefore risks, increased as a result of this
new ministerial configuration. However, steps were being taken to improve coordination,
in essence through workshops associating donors and the government and the launch of the
preparation of a sector-wide strategy.

24.      Economic risk. The Government had increased its education expenditures from
1.7% of GDP in 1995 to 2.7% in 2002 and was planning for further increases reaching up
to 4.0% by 2010. At the time, it was believed that it was perhaps not possible to reach this
goal for expenditure if economic growth slowed as a result of exogenous risks, such as
adverse terms of trade shock or lower-than anticipated levels of external financing. This
risk was analyzed in the PRSP, and a scenario was developed. In it, the policy framework
remained unchanged but the sector goals were no longer consistent with the MDG 2015
targets.

25.    Weak implementation capacity and shortcomings in financial management.
This risk was to be mitigated by ensuring that the PCU staff and the implementation
manuals were in place before the project implementation commenced.

26.      In the revised project design, no new risks were identified.7 While it seemed that
no ‘new’ risks were identifiable because the risks identified in the original project appraisal
document (PAD) continued to be pertinent, a reevaluation of the risks in the context of
institutional changes was necessary, as were new measures to mitigate them in light of the
critical assessments during the mid-term review, early aide-memoires, and the Quality
Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP).

Adequacy of participatory processes

27.     Much emphasis was put into developing the Logical Framework for the original
project and its translation into a Monitoring and Evaluation framework. The indicators
were developed in a participatory manner with Government units and other stakeholders
and were put in place early on to give each team an opportunity to revisit and change their
targets if necessary.

2.2. Implementation

28.     The original project was approved on May 31, 2005. Implementation was slow to
begin. Although the first ISR ratings were optimistic, it became evident that there were
difficulties in implementation of the project.8 The implementation rating in the second ISR
of January 2006 was rated MU. Over the next year, disbursements rose very timidly,
reaching just a little over 10% by Q2 2007, almost two years into the project
implementation period. However, the ISRs 3 and 4 registered MS as the implementation
rating.9 Disbursement continued on sluggishly, nevertheless, reaching just 36% by Q4 2009
– two and a half years later. As a result, both DO and IP ratings remained MU throughout
that time (in five ISRs, #5-#10).

29.     A significant restructuring of the project was approved on April 6, 2010, 10
(discussed at greater length in section 5.1 below) which altered the PDO and revised the
components, with the underlying idea of streamlining implementation and strengthening
project monitoring. Outputs and targets were revised and there was a new results
framework. The overall project cost remained, nevertheless, the same. 11 Despite the
restructuring, the next two years, July 2010 – July 2012, saw an increase in disbursement of
just 16.2%. However, with implementation picking up significantly over the April-
September 2012 period, disbursements surged by 30 percent in the four months of grace
period, finishing at 86.97%.

30.     A hard line was taken as the project neared closing: no further extension was
      12
given, although construction activities (notably latrines and wells) remained incomplete.13
Instead, these activities were transferred to another project in the portfolio that could accept
them. It should also be mentioned that the CMU had to become involved at this point in the
project.



8
   These were due in large part to the suspension of the first project coordinator and the time required in
   replacing him, all of which created delays in project execution.
9
  In ISR #3, the IP was upgraded from MU to MS due to completion by Government of a major strategy
   document and the launch of a large number of bids after March 2006. In ISR#4, the rating remained
   unchanged (MS) because there was evidence that disbursement would increase substantially when the
   bunching at the procurement level would have been cleared.
10
   Even if restructuring was discussed as early as 2008 (see ISR #7), the decision to move to restructuring and
   the process of designing a new project took some time. This was because the Government was reluctant to
   entertain the idea at first, after having invested so much, politically, into the initial project design.
11
   Principally because the government was reluctant to give up any donor funding and, more particularly,
   because the different Ministries concerned were unwilling to allow any of their original funding to be
   reallocated to another Ministry.
12
   This refusal to extend was to demonstrate that the project could not drag on. It could be argued that the WB
   could have shown a little more flexibility here and offered a limited two month extension to allow just
   these construction activities to be finished. There may be good reasons why it didn’t: it needed to send a
   firm message to Government that the project could not go on and on.
13
   Misinformation from Plan Cameroon regarding the actual state of implementation of latrines and wells
   forced the team to hire a consultant to travel to the sites to establish the facts of the matter.
                                                     11
31.     Weak disbursement characterized the project in its initial and restructured forms. 36
percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, are shown on the datasheet to have been disbursed
in these two phases, for a total of approximately US$10.2 million out of US$18.2 million.
In addition to this, however, approximately 34.7 percent not captured in the datasheet or the
final ISR, was disbursed in the four month post-project close grace period, bringing the
post-restructuring disbursement to approximately 51%. In all, the total project
disbursement amounts to approximately 86.97 percent (as of Jan 24, 2013). Government
agreed to cancel US$2.65 million or approximately 14.6 percent of total funds.

32.     Project disbursement delay flags were raised on several occasions (more than 5
times) during the life of the project. These implementation difficulties and delays can be
explained in large part by three sets of factors, some subject to government, some to
implementing agency, and some to World Bank control. A brief summary is given here, but
these are also developed in other sections of the ICR.

33.     First, in terms of factors subject to government control, endogenous ones of several
kinds stand out. There was: (i) little or no unified de facto leadership of the project; (ii)
poor ownership and commitment; and (iii) weak functional capacity caused by difficult
inter-ministerial coordination, onerous administrative structures and procedures, and
inefficient procurement and disbursement processes. These are discussed in section 5.2.

34.      Another important confounding factor, subject this time to Implementing Agency
Control, was weak project management.14 The first two project coordinators were replaced,
due essentially to non-performance, while the mandate of the third cannot be characterized
by proactive project management. Indeed, when the World Bank found that actively
managing the execution of project activities on a week by week basis was helpful, this was
still not adopted by the project management unit. It is not clear why. Rather, an in-country
World Bank intermediary had to pursue project implementation serving as a de facto
assistant to the PCU coordinator.

35.     The factors the World Bank might have better controlled include project design
(and re-design) and, arguably, project management and supervision. The project design had
not anticipated, at least not realistically enough, the challenges of working with a newly
fragmented Government (one with four newly created Ministries dealing with education) in
a new sector-wide approach. Then, the project restructuring design did not manage to find a
corrective measure for the challenges of working in this new administrative context and so
disbursement continued to be slow and implementation difficult. In addition, there was
high task team leadership turnover -- five in seven years – which did not lend itself to
finding the best approach to supervising the project. What was found to work, at the end of
the project, was intensive hands-on supervision, with a focus on strict adherence to set
deadlines, follow-up, and careful monitoring of implementation activities. This involved


14
     Even the costly recruitment of an international procurement specialist did not lead to decreases in
     procurement delays.
                                                    12
significant effort on the part of the World Bank task team, which signaled ultimately an
absence of adequate government commitment to and ownership of the project. 15

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Original Design

36.     The Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) rated the original project as
Unsatisfactory with the most important criticism being that it was poorly designed, without
clear links between activities, indicators and objectives and thus making the PDO unlikely
to be met. The results framework was not appropriate for a project concerned for the
greater part with technical assistance (TA) whose main objective was capacity-building.
There were two additional confounding factors: (i) data were unavailable or unreliable
(Plan Cameroon, for instance, as mentioned in footnote 15, furnished misleading
information); and (ii) the distance from Headquarters made it difficult to obtain actual
implementation progress.

Revised design after restructuring

37.      The restructuring needed to pay significant attention to (i) improving project
management; and (ii) ensuring that the project objectives and associated indicators were
realistic, clear, and aligned with activities as well as ensuring appropriate linkages between
activities to ensure synergies. The revised project’s results framework was more in line
with a TA project, although not all activities in it were purely TA-related and, because
many activities were qualitative in form, they did not lend themselves to sharp monitoring
and evaluation.

Capacity-building

38.      An important intended outcome of the components of this project devoted to
capacity-building was a more streamlined education administration better able to manage
its mandate through more efficient procedures and a more effective agenda. While this was
a crucial objective at the heart of the project, it is not clear how the capacity building
program was organized logically- and pedagogically- speaking so that the numerous
activities within it would work together to achieve the objectives. The absence of a
coherent plan was apparent. There were a huge number of workshops, 114 in all, but it is
unclear how these were meant to advance the capacity-building agenda. The training plans




15
     The process also revealed that during the final three months of the project implementation period, with the
     growing certainty that the project would be closed as originally envisaged on September 1, 2012, project
     staff (especially fiduciary staff—financial management specialist and the accountant) resigned to take on
     longer term and more secure assignments. The attrition weakened the project secretariat’s ability to ensure
     full compliance with the financial management and accounting requirements in a timely manner.
                                                       13
(‘plan de formation’) that were submitted to the World Bank 16 list workshops of various
sorts, but it is unclear to what extent these would be productive. For instance, it is difficult
to know what could be accomplished in a ten-day workshop on language. The point is that
these activities, perhaps of some importance in capacity building, needed to be monitored
(over and above attendance being taken) to show what impact they have had in concrete
terms. 17 Otherwise it is not clear how they would result in behavioral change leading staff
to work differently because of the new knowledge gained, and how capacity would have in
fact been strengthened. During the last year of project implementation many of the
activities were reviewed and rejected as being unnecessary. This came at a significant cost
in terms of repeated negotiations to keeping versus eliminating activities.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance

39.     The initial project triggered safeguard policy OP 4.0 1 Environmental Assessment
(with the safeguard screening category being S2, and the environmental screening category
B). These ratings were due to the construction of the CITI and the provision of water wells
and latrines within the compounds of existing, active schools. Potential safeguard-related
issues also included soil and water pollution, soil erosion, noise, air pollution, loss of
vegetation, and crop losses. An Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP), prepared to address
environmental and social impacts under components 3 and 4, was made available in
Cameroon on November 19, 2004, and at the Bank’s Infoshop on November 22, 2004. It
was also determined that OP 4.12 would be triggered, even though there would be very
limited social impact of the CITI construction. At restructuring, the proposed changes were
deemed not to change the environmental category of the project or trigger new safeguard
policies. A supplemental EMP was prepared to clarify actions needed to be taken to ensure
compliance of school projects financed under Component 4, such as school rehabilitation,
latrines and water wells.

40.     The project was rated ‘satisfactory’ in these two areas -- compliance with the
safeguards OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement -- a
rating that did not waiver over the course of the project. No other safeguard was triggered
by the project.

Fiduciary Issues



16
    Submitted as Excel worksheets, these list the objectives of each workshop, their date and time, number of
participants, costs and the per-diem expected, but no M&E of the activity.
17
    The capacity development plans were not carefully directed to link up with specific outputs and outcomes
     that would pave the way for real change in the Ministries. The fragmentation in the plans clearly indicates
     that the activities were intended to placate individual Ministries and their staff to get a fair share of the
     external financing support. It is impossible to carry out impact evaluations on myriad small value capacity
     development activities. The sum of the parts does not add up to the whole.  
                                                       14
41.     Financial and procurement assessments were conducted as the initial project was
prepared. All issues and risks related to procurement were identified and corrective
measures were agreed upon. The overall project risk for procurement was considered high.
A series of corrective measures were agreed on and included the recruitment of an
additional part-time procurement expert, the provision of adequate procurement trainings to
the members of the procurement commission of MINEDUB, MINESEC and MINESUP,
improvement of procurement record-keeping and preparation of a procurement plan prior
to negotiations. The project financial management risk was considered substantial.
Financial management arrangements satisfied the World Bank’s minimum requirements
under OP/BP10.02 and an action plan to further improve these arrangements has been
agreed upon, including the elaboration of an accounting procedures manual, the
reinforcement of internal controls and the purchase of an integrated accounting and
financial reporting software.

42.      An intensive Post Procurement Review (PPR) was conducted in May 2009 to
determine what needed to change in terms of procurement practice to process the
government’s request for restructuring. In October 2009 an assessment mission concluded
that all major recommendations had been implemented, except for the recruitment of a new
procurement specialist (who was hired in January 2010). A number of key changes 18 were
made to improve procurement.19 Furthermore, the government drafted a new procurement
plan, which was approved by the task team.

43.     Project supervision has shown that the (original and restructured) project’s financial
management arrangements, when found inadequate, were made to be compliant with the
Bank’s financial management requirements. There were nevertheless ongoing concerns
regarding weak procurement. This weakness was due to a number of factors: (i) as
discussed later in section 5.2(a), procurement was a complex and onerous affair 20; (ii) poor
inter-ministerial communication and coordination caused delays and bottlenecks (dossiers
sent between Ministries, for instance, were not easily traceable); and (iii) complications
caused by missing staff or staff turnover hampered efficient procurement execution. The
World Bank and the Project Secretariat teams remained flexible in the face of these
challenges by restructuring the project substantively once and by reallocating funds across
eligible expenditure categories a second time to try and refocus the project on essentials



18
   The April 2010 mission included a senior procurement officer in order to improve procurement. The
    mission proposed significant changes in procurement processes, and some indicators linked to quality
    control inside the PIU. However, while these changes seemed logical, they have not been able to deeply
    improve the situation.
19
   These included: (1) Better and more transparent processes for requesting price quotations from potential
    suppliers; (2) Regular publication of the results of bidding processes; (3) Implementation of a system for
    receiving and validating reports produced by consultants; (4) Recruitment of an internal auditor; (5)
    Acceleration of payment of overdue bills; (6) Better filing of documents, particularly with regards to cross
    filing of procurement and financial management documents.
20
   There was much back and forth between agencies, because National and Bank procedures seemed to those
    working with them in Government to be sometimes irreconcilable.
                                                      15
and to extend deadlines so that the implementing agencies could overcome accumulated
delays.

Audits and Disbursements

44.     Four kinds of audits were used in this project: internal, technical, external, and a
final transactions-based audit. Internal. Following conditions laid out in the restructured
project, an internal auditor, a private consultant, was hired to work with government. In
rare cases where projects are at risk, like this one, the terms of reference call for internal
audits to include recommendations to help improve the financial management of the project
within government.21 These audits were late in 2012, judged to be unsatisfactory by World
Bank review (as they too closely resembled external, not internal audits), and their
recommendations were never acted upon by the project secretariat. Technical. Technical
audits, used to ensure that construction projects were in fact completed, were undertaken by
the World Bank team that closed the project within the framework of the restructured
project. The technical audit was not part of the restructured project design. For reasons
linked to difficulties in the procurement process, contracts for these kinds of audits had
never before been signed. External. External financial audits were carried out throughout
the project. As the record in the ISRs reveals, these were often qualified, occasionally
having accounting issues, though in the last three ISR, no problem was highlighted.
Transactions-based audit. In addition, as more than three times as much disbursement
took place as the project ended than usual, the task team took steps to mitigate the risk of
inefficient and/or inappropriate use of resources by having a third party transactions-based
audit of project activities take place.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     The follow-on project is not an IDA project. It is a Global Partnership for Education
(GPE) project. It is the follow-on to the EFA-FTI project mentioned in paragraph 13
above), which closed on December 31, 2011. The link between the two projects is that the
fiduciary due diligence for the EFA-FTI project was being undertaken by the EDCB
Secretariat.

46.    Preparation for the follow-on GPE project will commence around February or
March 2013. The lessons from the EDCB project and the EFA-FTI ICRs, as well as the
lessons from the design and implementation experience of the projects recently financed or
in progress by other development partners (specifically, the Agence Française de
Développement (AFD)), will be taken into consideration in designing the new GPE
operation.



21
     Anecdotal evidence suggests that this audit arrangement was largely unsuccessful. The internal auditor was
     ineffective in passing recommendations on in a manner that elicited positive action from the project
     secretariat. Further, there appears to have been a clear lack of willingness in the project secretariat to act
     upon the recommendations of the heavily qualified internal audits.
                                                         16
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Original Project

Relevance of Original Objectives

47.     The original project was expected to contribute to putting Cameroon back on track
to reach the MDG of ensuring that by 2015, all children, boys and girls alike, would be able
to complete a full course of primary education (100 percent completion rate). It was
grounded in the country Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that was presented to
the Board in July 2003, which emphasized the dual role of human development as an
engine for broader social development and a pillar for capital formation and growth. It was
also consistent with the first pillar of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS):
“strengthening the institutional framework for improved pro-poor economic management
and service delivery.? The Education Sector played a prominent role in this CAS, which
covered the period from 2004 to 2006, and showcased policies intended to promote better
governance and the sound use of public resources. The objectives were, in short, clear and
important for the country and sector and furthered the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) and MDG goals. And, it should be added, these remain important goals for the
sector.22

Relevance of Original Design

48.     The project design exhibited several strong points. After arguing convincingly for
the need to improve the management of the education sector, the design put forward a
coherent framework that focused on a series of key objectives that, if successful, were
likely to contribute in a significant way to the greater PDO (see below). In this sense, it was
very ambitious. The PDO, however, was articulated quite broadly, which left room for
interpretation. Being so defined in fact, it focused on an outcome for which the operation
could not reasonably be held accountable. In addition, the design, being so ambitious,
included numerous and, to some extent, diffuse activities and so was not responsive to
borrower limitations.




22
     The latest education sector CSR (2012) argues as much, repeating lessons put forward by its authors eight
     years earlier in the technical background report for the original project.
                                                      17
Relevance of Original Implementation

49.     There is no doubt that it would have been difficult to anticipate how changes in
governmental structure – the dividing up of the Ministries of Education -- would affect the
project’s implementation capacity. The functional capacity of the government was known
to be weak, so working with one that was newly restructured must have been challenging.
The Government and the Bank must be commended for tackling this project in this new
context.

Revised Project

Relevance of Objectives

50.     The PDO of the restructured project focused on those strategies and actions of the
Education Sector Strategy of 2006 that aimed to improve the strategic management,
evaluation capacity and planning of the education system, which was an excellent initiative
as it concentrated on the central underlying problem confronting the sector. More
specifically, it was expected to provide tools, training and other forms of support to
education authorities, communities and the general public to: (i) continually hone the
strategic vision for the education system through analysis, knowledge sharing and
dissemination; (ii) improve the education information system to ensure greater
accountability and better decision making; (iii) improve sector monitoring by education
authorities, the government and the public; and (iv) provide opportunities for greater
participation of beneficiaries in education decision-making, thus increasing accountability.

Relevance of Design

51.     The strong point in the revised design is found in its introduction of strong financial
management measures. What confounded the design however was the commitment to the
restructuring of the project on the part of the Borrower. As explained elsewhere (see
section 5 on Borrower Performance), the Government, having made pledges to several sets
of stakeholders, was averse to changing the project and so, as a consequence, the revised
design retained almost all the original design’s activities, though classifying them
differently under new components. It was inconsequential in reducing their burden, in other
words, and since the restructured project was planned to be only two years in length, this
left a questionably short period for so much activity. And indeed Government did take
some time to change stride in order to find adequate traction to engage with the new
contours of the project. Nevertheless, what the restructured design did achieve -- and this is
something that should be underlined – is that it led to improvements in project execution,
thanks to its insistence on focusing on accomplishing only the essential in the project. Proof
of this comes finally at the end of the project when disbursement finally surged to 87
percent.


Relevance of Implementation
                                              18
52.     The revised design attempted to streamline the original project, but did not
adequately assess the country’s existing institutional capacity, most notably, the ministries’
inability to effectively implement the project activities. Knowing what had already
transpired in the initial phase of the project before restructuring, this was some oversight.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Original Project 23

53.    The last measures of the PDO and Intermediate Indicators of the Original Project
were taken in March 2009, revealing the following.

PDO Indicators

54.    The Development Objectives of the original project – “to increase the efficiency
and equity of primary and secondary education, with a focus on disadvantaged areas, and
increase capacity for high quality training in targeted disciplines in higher education? –
were achieved to some extent. Progress had been made in the sector.

55.     In terms of retention, the target was exceeded. The primary completion rate
attained 83 percent as of March 2009, already bypassing the September 2010 end of project
target of 80 percent. The abolition of school fees at project onset most probably contributed
significantly to this result. Primary Repetition Rates, which at baseline were 25.8 percent,
had dropped to 20 percent by March 2009 and may have just reached the 15 percent target
at end of project.

56.     In terms of equity, the target was close to being met. Improvements in female to
male enrollment rates in target areas were noted: from a baseline of 0.58, the rate had
climbed to 0.82 by March 2009, 8 points shy of the end of project target of 0.9, and so it is
likely the target would have been met.

57.     In terms of improved management, the randomness in primary teacher allocation,
estimated at baseline to be 45 percent, had dropped just three points to 42 percent by March
2009 (after four years), but was unlikely to attain the end of project target of 25 percent the
next year, suggesting either that: (i) project interventions were having limited success in
rationalizing the baroque process of teacher deployment; or (ii) the project target was too
ambitious. For a more in-depth discussion of the teacher deployment issues, see the
Implementation Completion and Results report (World Bank document No.00002369) for


23
     see ISR #9 for a summary.

the “Cameroon Education for All-Fast Track Initiative support to the Education Sector?
project.

58.     Intermediate outcome indicators. Only two of the eight intermediate indicators
had been measured by March 2009. First, repetition rates, recorded at 25 percent at
baseline, were expected to descend to 15 percent by project end. Instead, the rate climbed
to 28.1 percent in Francophone areas, while it declined to 17.4 percent in Anglophone
areas, by March 2009, (for an average of 20%), a reflection perhaps of differing
interpretations and responses in these sub-systems of the policy changes related to
repetition. Second, the ratio of girls to boys, targeted to be at .9, reached .82.

Revised Project

59.     The Development Objectives of the revised project – “to develop and apply
management and learning tools for use by government and communities to improve
efficiency and accountability of the Cameroon education sector? – were achieved in some
measure, most markedly in the last stages of the project.

Revised PDO Indicators (There are four indicators)

60.     Preparation of budgets at the primary, secondary and higher levels of the
education system based on statistical analysis. The target was partially met. While the
final target was for budgets to be fully aligned with strategic goals of the sector and to be
based on relevant statistical data, challenges persisted in respect to the availability of
reliable data, even if the data verification and cleaning exercises had been undertaken. The
development of a methodological guide providing guidelines to better align budget with
strategy continues to be a work in progress after the closing of the restructured project. The
process, however, commenced prior to project closing.

61.     Improved efficiency and equity in teacher deployment. The target is partially
met. Government states that as a result of addressing the teacher deployment issue through
the hiring of contract teachers at primary school level, the deployment issue is being
progressively resolved. Equitable teacher deployment remains a challenge. Again, for a
more in-depth discussion of this issue, see the Implementation Completion and Results
report (World Bank document No.00002369) for the “Cameroon Education for All-Fast
Track Initiative support to the Education Sector? project.

62.     Biennial update of the ESS based on analytic work conducted during
preceding two years. The target has been largely met. The revision of the ESS, based on
analytical work launched over preceding months, was underway at project close and will
inform the 2013 budget cycle.

63.    Beneficiary participation in school functioning and school accountability in 86
selected schools in the ZEP. The target has been met. The activity was partially
completed by the executing agency Plan Cameroon, though it is important to note that,
                                             20
while the number of schools initially envisaged was 86, 29 were either being already
rehabilitated by other development partners, or by the government through the BIP (Budget
d'investissement public). The IDA project financed the sensitization program and
rehabilitation of works in the remaining 57 schools.

Intermediate Indicators

64.     There are eleven indicators: five of which were met or exceeded, three were
expected to be met after project closing, while four were partially met. (Please note that in
the datasheet at the beginning of this ICR, these indicators are given in the order found in
the restructuring paper; here, they are grouped by achievement, so as to give a clearer idea
of what has been accomplished).

Those that were met include:

   1. The publication of annual, statistical yearbooks for three levels of education.
      This target has been met. However, some years of the publication for MINESEC are
      missing and challenges concerning data credibility and validity remain to some
      extent.

   2. System for learning assessment at the primary level. The target has been met: a
      summative evaluation of student achievement/assessment system after primary
      education exists. Further, early grade reading assessments are being administered
      through financing from other partners. These are proposed to be regularly
      administered over time.

   3. The target number of direct project beneficiaries (students, teachers, parents,
      communities, education administrators) of 75,000 was exceeded. As of project
      close it was estimated to be 93,761.

   4. Number of projects implemented with the participation of beneficiary
      communities in the PEA (ZEP). The target number of 57 projects was met. The
      number of additional classrooms built or rehabilitated at the primary level resulting
      from project interventions was targeted to be 430. This was achieved to the extent
      that 405 were completed through the project while the remaining were completed
      through other partner-financed projects, and had been double counted towards the
      project target.

   5. The setting up of the infrastructure for GDLN. Target met. The GDLN will be a
      means to facilitate higher education learning and policy dialogue.


Those expected to be met after project closing:


                                             21
   1. Regularly updated documentation. The work is ongoing and will be completed
      after project closing. Although the work commenced prior to project closing, due to
      the complexities of: (i) the government’s focus on preparing a program budget for a
      three-year period; (ii) efforts being placed by government to complete a sector
      strategy linked to their vision document; and (iii) coordination between multiple
      education ministries resulted in the process taking far longer than anticipated to be
      completed.

   2. Production of updated action plans for the education sector strategy. The work is
      ongoing and will be completed after project closing. In keeping with the
      intermediate indicator assessment above, the action plans will be produced after
      project closing since the analytical work has already commenced. These plans will
      be developed based on the completion of the revised education sector strategy in the
      context of preparing the follow-on Global Partnership for Education (GPE;
      formerly EFA-FTI) project.

   3. Production of analytical tools (ex: simulation models). The work is ongoing and
      will be completed after project closing. This is due to the fact that the preparation of
      the program budget for three years took precedence over the completion of the
      simulation model for education. Through the project interventions, a team of
      representatives drawn from each ministry has been trained to produce and use this
      tool, and the preparation of the simulation model exercise continued after project
      closing. These tools will be used to inform the budget preparation in each sub-
      sector during the 2014 budget cycle, and towards preparing the follow-on GPE
      project.

Those partially met or not met include:

   1. Production of tools that facilitate knowledge exchanges and participation in the
      international dialogue on education (CITI and GDLN). The target of having 1,000
      documents consulted has only been partially met. Following some delays in the
      procurement of the GDLN equipment, the tools have now been received and are
      installed and await a Government decree putting the center into operation. With
      respect to the CITI, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the achievement of
      the target.

   2. Institutional audits prepared and evidence of the implementation of
      recommendations. The target has not been met: the action plan for implementing
      recommendations is still under preparation. These institutional audits were to be
      disseminated to a large audience through 5 workshops.

   3. Percentage of subsidies allocated to private schools in compliance with the criteria
      laid out in the operations manual. Target not met, because there is limited evidence
      on the percentage of subsidies allocated to private schools.

                                             22
       4. The publication of school health cards for primary and secondary education was not
          initiated.

3.3. Efficiency

65.     Unit costs. Before the 2000/1 school year, fees were abolished for all students in
primary school, leading to a surge in first grade enrolment. Fees were replaced by block
grants paid to schools. However, these were insufficient to cover costs: parents had to pay
for additional teacher recruitment, school functioning, and frequently contributed to school-
related construction projects. Further, they still had to pay for textbooks, and sometimes for
uniforms.

66.     The CSR of 2012 offers a comparative perspective of unit costs for figures recorded
in 2002 with those recorded in 2011.24 Relatively significant changes are observed with an
overall pattern moving downward over the period. Within that trend, however, primary
education unit costs increase by +18% over the period. This appears to be the result of the
removal of locally hired temporary teachers and their replacement with better
(contractually) paid teachers. In general, this is a promising sign of reform because the
Government has recruited i) better paid ii) better trained and iii) state-paid teachers instead
of parent-paid teachers. In comparison, the first years of lower secondary education (post-
elementary) saw a decline in unit cost of as much as 42% over the period, while there is a
17% increase in the unit cost of upper secondary schooling. This can be explained,
ironically, by the massive recruitment of locally hired (parent paid) teachers in lower
secondary school.

67.     Internal efficiency. At project outset, the overall internal efficiency coefficient for
the whole education system was estimated to be 0.7125, indicating a waste of education
resources of close to 30%. 26 It is the primary education system that is most severely
inefficient, notably in the French speaking sub-system.

68.    At project outset the frequency of class repetition (25.8% in the primary schools,
15.3% in lower secondary education and 26.2% in upper secondary education) was very
high and was at the root of the inefficiency. Class repetition was much more noticeable in
the French-speaking subsystem (28% in the French-speaking primary schools against 17%
in English-speaking schools).

69.     Meanwhile, at project end, estimates for internal efficiency are given in the latest
education sector CSR 27: taking into account the cumulative frequency of repetition and
drop-out in the current situation (for primary education in the school year 2010-11) leads to
an estimate of the overall index of efficiency being 79.8 per cent. This means that about
20% of the resources mobilized for this level of education are in fact wasted. In terms of
international comparisons, the waste in resources observed in Cameroon is more favorable
than that observed on average in the francophone countries of sub-Saharan Africa (33%).
In terms of change over time, we note that the situation in the country has improved quite
substantially. The internal efficiency coefficient, which stood at only 63% in 2003 and
71% at project outset, is now at project close, 79.8%, even if the comparability of the three
figures is probably not perfect.

70.     To what extent the EDCB Project contributed to these results is an important
question. The objective of the original project was ‘to increase the efficiency and equity of
primary and secondary education, with a focus on disadvantaged areas, and increase
capacity for high quality training in targeted disciplines in higher education.’ However, as
we saw in section 3.2, while progress was made on several counts (in terms of retention
and equity), in terms of improved management, the target for reduced randomness in
primary teacher allocation was not attained by project end. In the restructured project, the
targets of ‘developing and applying management and learning tools for use by government
and communities to improve efficiency and accountability of the Cameroon education
sector’ were met to some measure, though not altogether.

71.     Conclusion. Over the project period, it is true that (i) the general pattern seen in
unit costs is one that decreases (though the unit cost of primary has in fact risen28); and that

27
      CSR, 2012, p. 84.
28
      Though, as we saw, this is a promising sign of reform because the Government has recruited i) better paid
      ii) better trained and iii) state-paid teachers instead of parent-paid teachers.

(ii) the internal efficiency of the system had improved. While the EDCB had contributed to
this net positive effect, the full attribution of the results to the EDCB project alone would
not be an accurate assessment. Therefore, the efficiency of the project can only be rated
conservatively as having been modest.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

72.     The overall outcome rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is meant to reflect
contrasting aspects of this project: (1) The original and revised project were relevant
because they were aligned with the Government’s overall education program, a fact borne
out by the positive reactions found in the Beneficiary Survey (see Annex 5); (2) the PDOs
were achieved to some extent; (3) project efficiency was modest -- due to two factors: (i)
the improvements in internal efficiency of the system could not be wholly attributed to the
project, while (ii) implementation, that was slow to begin, surged in the last year of the
project.

                           Unsatisfactory                                 Unsatisfactory


3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

73.     Satisfactory progress towards gender equity was seen in the Northern areas (the
education priority areas) under the project through: (i) the sensitization of parent-teacher
associations regarding girls’ attendance in school. The sensitization program was
successfully implemented. The social development element was fully achieved. Parents
have become more actively involved in the school management process in the project
regions. A good proxy for measuring gender equity is access to latrines. The design of the
restructured project, however, had not included the construction of latrines and wells.
Therefore, these sub-activities were included in the school rehabilitation component about
6 months prior to project closing. However, by the end of project implementation,
although the contract for the latrines had been signed, the Works was not completed by the
executing agency. A fraction of the envisaged 37 wells had been completed by that time. As
a result, the gender impact of the project cannot be fully measured.

(b) Institutional Change / Strengthening

74.    Institutional strengthening was only modestly achieved. As seen in section 2.3, an
important intended outcome of this project was capacity-building, the objective being to
                                             25
create a more streamlined education sector administration better able to manage its
mandate through more efficient procedures and a more effective agenda. While this was a
crucial objective at the heart of the project, it is not clear to what extent it was successful.
One important point to underline is that this project did help to bring four newly-formed
Ministries of Education together to work in a Sector Wide Approach. For instance, the
activity of constructing the simulation model, like other activities in the project, seems to
have had a net positive effect as it brought many governmental players together on a
regular basis and so helped them coordinate their approaches.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

75.     Combined with the positive impacts of the EFA-FTI project that resulted in
financing contract teachers, the schools rehabilitation and the supply of school desks and
chairs undertaken through the EDCB project is beginning to have some positive impact.
School directors and teachers are reporting that classrooms are less crowded, students are
attending schools more regularly, and that the overall schooling environment has improved.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Please refer to Annex 5.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

76.      The greatest risk to development outcome has been internal, related to the
suitability of the operation’s design to its operating environment. This operational context,
characterized by imperfect Ministerial coordination and fluctuating project management by
the implementing agency, has not been one in which the project could easily succeed. In
the last eighteen months of the project, this environment began to improve through various
initiatives, most notably through better governance offered by the selection of the Ministry
of Economy, Planning, and Territorial Activities (MINEPAT) to help lead sector strategy.
This will most likely have some impact on the operation’s development outcomes
materializing, and so the risk to development objectives is rated as moderate.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
77.     As this project was significantly restructured, both in terms of PDO and
components, Bank and Borrower performance will be assessed in the project’s initial and
restructured phases with each period being weighted following the calculations in
Appendix B of the ICR guidelines. As 36% and approximately 51% were disbursed before


                                              26
and after restructuring, respectively, the initial period will receive a weight of 3 while the
restructured period a weight of 4.29

5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78.     While it is more usual in an ICR to assess just the Quality at Entry at project
inception, in this project it will be valuable to evaluate the Quality of Entry at restructuring
as well because of the scope of that restructuring. The rating is calculated in the following
way: as we will see, the Quality of Entry of the original project is determined to be
Moderately Unsatisfactory (with weight of 3), while the Quality of Entry of the Revised
Project is Moderately Unsatisfactory (with weight of 4), which together combines to give
a final Quality of Entry rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.

79.     Original Project. As examined in detail in section 2.1., the Bank ensured quality
at entry in the original project in the following four ways:

           Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis supporting the
           project was generally good, lessons learned were incorporated into the project, and
           the rationale for Bank intervention was sound.

           Assessment of project design: it could be said that the project design was and was
           not relevant in the following senses: while it was aligned with World Bank country
           and Government of Cameroon (GoC) strategy, it was not perfectly designed given
           the project context: it is true that in the original project, the choice of the four
           project components seemed logical. However, the design could not easily
           anticipate what the effect of the newly divided Ministries would be. With hindsight,
           the project now appears to have been ambitious: it was complex, calling on many
           actors to work in coordination on many activities carried out in a short
           implementation period of, initially, three years.

           Adequacy of government commitment. The Government worked closely with
           donors to prepare the project, demonstrating evident commitment in doing so.

           Assessment of risks. Three risks were identified in the PAD (see section 2.1).
           Although none were rated as substantial, two have proved to have been detrimental
           to the project (i) the political risk of poor government coordination (arising from the
           Ministerial restructuring) was meant to be mitigated by holding dedicated
           workshops; and (ii) the risk of weak implementation capacity and shortcomings in


29
     The ratio of 36 to 51 being roughly 3 to 4 (36 to 48).
                                                         27
           financial management was to be mitigated by ensuring that the PCU staff and the
           implementation manuals were in place before the start of implementation.

80.  For these reasons, the rating for Quality of Entry of the Original Project is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

81.     Revised Project. The Bank, proactive in urging the Government of Cameroon to
restructure the project,30 ensured quality at entry of the restructuring in the following four
ways:

           Soundness of background analysis. The restructuring paper reveals that (i) some
           background analysis was undertaken to support the restructuring, (ii) lessons
           learned from the original project implementation were presented, which were to be
           incorporated into the new project design, and (iii) the rationale for Bank
           intervention continued to seem sound.

           Despite this, the greater question is why the project was restructured at all, given
           that implementation of the original project had proceeded so slowly. Why not close
           it? It took a long time to restructure the project because the Bank procurement and
           financial management staff expressed a number of concerns that required clearance
           from their managers before the project team could move to the next step. There
           were in addition some compelling reasons that resulted in the restructuring, not
           closing, of the project: (i) this was the only project the World Bank had in the basic
           education sector and the new design was intended to strengthen relationships with
           the different education Ministries; (ii) the government was putting into place an
           education council headed by the Ministry of Planning that was supposed to work on
           education strategy and planning (a key part of the project); and (iii) it was up to the
           Government to decide to restructure or to close. Given that the Ministries concerned
           all had stakes in the project, both material and political, there would have been
           considerable difficulty for the Bank project team to convince them to in fact close.

           Assessment of project design: it could be said that the project design continued to
           be more or less relevant in the following senses: (i) while it continued to be aligned
           with World Bank country and Government of Cameroon (GoC) strategy, it was not
           perfectly redesigned given the new and emerging project context; (ii) the new
           design attempted to streamline the project, but it did not fully succeed in
           overcoming what were by then known difficulties, most notably the weak
           functional capacity of the Borrower; and (iii) it is also unclear why the restructured
           project did not take into account the procurement advances initiated through the
           Investment Lending reforms.




30
     As early as 12/20/2007, this was brought up (in ISR #6).
                                                       28
       Adequacy of government commitment. Each Ministry worked to retain its
       original share of the project, but the Ministries did not re-engage together on this
       project in a unified and coherent manner; their commitment had in effect become
       diffused among the Ministries. There were no incentives for inter-ministerial
       cooperation.

       Assessment of risks. No new risks were identified in the restructuring paper, as
       most of the risks had already been identified in the original PAD. Nevertheless, in
       hindsight the restructured project would have benefited from a re-articulated focus
       on risks and related mitigation framework given the new context of the
       restructuring and new measures introduced to help mitigate these.

Nevertheless, and in spite of these issues, project implementation was managed
successfully, resulting in the disbursement of a significant amount in the final stages of the
project. For these reasons, the rating for Quality of Entry of the Revised Project is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

82.     The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, which is
calculated by combining the quality of supervision of the original project (Moderately
Unsatisfactory) with the quality of supervision of the revised project (Moderately
Unsatisfactory) and attributing to each the appropriate weights (of 3 and 4 respectively).

83.     Original Project. In the Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports covering
the original project, comments about project supervision are of two sorts: (i) those that
commend the Bank team for having addressed the various minor challenges to the project
that cropped up; and (ii) those that encourage the Bank team to place particular emphasis
on the supervision of certain aspects of the project. These latter comments, from Bank
Management, are repeated occasionally (in four out of nine ISRs), but this is not to say that
supervision was found wanting. The Bank proactively identified and resolved difficulties
related to the achievement of the project development outcomes, as both the ISRs and the
aide-memoires clearly demonstrate. Comments in these reports about poor project progress
do not typically implicate project supervision as a single cause, but rather cite other factors
to do with administrative procedures, the implementing agency or government. Seen within
this logic, supervision was acceptable.

84.     And yet, there could have been greater awareness and execution of collective
responsibilities among the actors (the government, project implementing agency, the task
team and Bank management). A set of factors can be cited for weak project performance in
the absence of the right conditions for a successful operation. Supervision held a central
place in this. So, for instance, there had been limited efforts up to 18 months prior to
project closing to use the procurement plan as the principal tool to manage the number of
project activities and, indeed, it is unclear if the procurement plans were systematically
reviewed and approved. Further, project implementation delays were due in part to the
                                              29
significant lag time in the provision of non-objections by the Bank for the myriad activities
of the project. At any given time there might have been no less than 20 ongoing activities,
both big and small, in various procurement stages. These needed to be reviewed and re-
reviewed by procurement staff. In addition, there was high task team leadership turnover --
five in seven years – which did not lend itself to finding the best approach to supervising
the project.

85.     Revised Project. After the slow disbursement rate following restructuring, during
the final 18 months of the project implementation period there was recognition of the need
to: (i) revise the procurement plan to retain only those activities relevant to address
component objectives and action was taken to implement the activities; and (ii) supervise
the project extremely closely in order to ensure greater project execution. It was
understood that keeping track of all the procurement activities alone required dedicated
staff. Commendably, the task team expended significant energy to devise innovative
approaches and to enter into time-sharing agreements with the other Bank project TTLs
who had hired the education project secretariat FM Specialist and the Project Accountant.
What was found to expedite project execution at the end of the project -- the proactive daily
management of the project through active and proactive support from full-time Bank staff
members, and an in-country operations officer -- augmented the cost of supervision.
However, this was a trade-off that the final Bank teams had to make, given the
circumstances. (The amount the World Bank allocated to project supervision in the last
year bears testimony to this. See Annex 3, the economic and financial analysis).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

86.    The rating for Overall Bank Performance is therefore Moderately Unsatisfactory,
which is calculated by combining the rating for Quality at Entry of Moderately
Unsatisfactory with the rating for Quality of Supervision of Moderately Unsatisfactory.


5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.     The rating is given for the following reasons. Aside from the back-loading of
disbursement before project close, a post-project evaluation of implementation suggests
several plausible explanations for the slow rate of project disbursement. Chief among these
are the leadership, commitment, and functional capacity of the government.

88.    Before 2004, there were two Ministries of Education: the Ministry of Education
(Ministère de l’éducation nationale) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MINESUP). In
2004, a Presidential decree split the former into three to become the Ministry of Basic
Education (MINEDUB), the Ministry of Secondary Education (MINESEC), and the
                                             30
Ministry of Vocational Education and Training (MINEFOP); the MINESUP remained
unaffected.

89.      The EDCB project, which was designed to encompass the education sector in its
entirety (all education sub-sectors), included transversal activities concerning two or more
(or all four) of these Ministries. In such a case, the administrative procedure would call for
three administrative levels in government to work together. In order of importance, these
were (i) the Steering Committee, (ii) the Technical Steering Sub-committee, and (iii) the
Subcomponent Management Unit. It also entailed the implementing agency, the Project
Management Unit, which also added a fourth layer of bureaucracy to this.

90.     For the project, leadership of the steering committee was given to the MINEDUB,
as the project focused to a great extent on basic education. For other matters, a Ministry
seen to be external to the four education Ministries, the Ministry of Economy, Planning,
and Territorial Activities (MINEPAT) was chosen to lead the steering committee. So, for
example, it is MINEPAT’s Secretary General who leads the technical steering committee
on questions of sector strategy. This demonstrated the readiness to take action and a
commendable problem-solving attitude on the part of the Government.

91.     For each transversal activity in the EDCB project, one unique set of terms of
reference had to be agreed upon by all Ministries concerned. The inter-ministerial
coordination required (at the various implicated administrative levels) did not lend itself to
celerity – just convening meetings where every central actor was present was time-
consuming. If a complication of some kind arose, which was quite possible and quite
common, this already onerous process could then involve even greater delays. In addition,
inter-ministerial meetings were at first very infrequent, as little as once a year at the
beginning of the EDCB project, though with much encouragement from the Bank, they
became more regular.

92.    The division of the sector between four Ministries did not favor the adherence to
and implementation of strategic directions for education policies,31 and the distribution of
roles and responsibilities in the administration was often unclear. There was little
accountability. This partition led to another significant consequence: weak government


31
     Another serious consequence was the direct impact this state of affairs had on the drive for reform itself.
     Consider the hypothetical causal chain, on which reform was based: the Government’s needs were
     expected to be translated into terms of reference meant to define an activity that would have an effect on a
     set of beneficiaries and in so doing produce the desired reform. However, given the project’s ineffective
     modus operandi, the relevance of each of these steps became adulterated. For instance, if the Ministries
     had to negotiate the terms of reference of each activity, there was already some loss of exactitude in those
     terms. If the beneficiaries had to be picked by consensus, they, too, may not have been exactly the right
     ones, and so on, to the point where the intended reform may not have been accomplished fully, but only
     partially and out of sync with the initial conception of the reform. This, it could be claimed, occurs in all
     projects; but in this project, the desired impact was particularly out of line. In addition, the onerous
     character of the procurement process also led to a loss of greater vision because the project was lost in the
     details of the procurement procedure to a very significant extent and very often.
                                                        31
ownership of the project. The numerous project activities were perceived to be scattered
across the Ministries and as little leadership was apparent -- even if some came from
MINEDUB -- the project activities were not actively managed in each Ministry and so
there was no clear alignment across Ministries. Put another way: had government
commitment been greater, some way forward would have been found to drive all these
activities forward in a concerted manner in all concerned departments.

Procurement

93.     As Annex 10 (An Analysis of Project Procurement Activities) reveals, procurement
assumed a significant place in this project. Not only did it cause fundamental delays, but
the procurement-centric nature of the project itself, since it caused almost all stakeholders
to be lost in some detail or another to do with procurement, caused them to lose sight of the
bigger picture – the impact the project was meant to have. In the original project phase,
there were numerous procurement activities of varying values ranging from small to large
procurement that were all being undertaken at the same time, such that each activity was at
a different procurement stage. This was challenging for all parties to follow-up
consistently and in a timely manner. In addition, the elapsed time for each procurement
activity was inordinately long. The agreed procurement plan could have been used as an
effective tool to streamline implementation, but it was not. Rather than being an education
project, the project became a set of procurement-centered activities (see foot note 33 for
consequences). In the revised project phase, if the restructuring was ineffective at first in
terms of improving disbursement, in large part due to weaknesses in procurement having
not been addressed at restructuring, the approach of the final two Bank project TTLs – to
lessen the onerous character of procurement procedures and to refocus only on the essential
in project activities – led to a surge in disbursement in the run up to project close.

Other delays

94.    Administrative delays also arose because of the technical weakness of evaluator’s
chosen by Government, a fact which can only be explained by the prevalent political
economy in force. Some technical activities required particular kinds of expertise (for
instance post-basic or education sector CSR studies), and yet the government frequently
committed directors of government units to be these evaluators instead of true specialists,
which lead to incoherent or low quality evaluations, systematically rejected by the Bank
TTLs with critical comments.32

95.   By all accounts, the administrative procedures described here, combined with weak
government ownership, and excessive procurement-centric activities slowed
implementation significantly in the initial and restructured project. If this last point is


32
     For instance, after a first poor evaluation for the CSR study, the World Bank had no choice but to insist on
     having an external evaluator from another development partner agency sit on the evaluation committee.
     The evaluation was thus reorganized. The PIA team received guidance, and a clear evaluation was
     eventually rendered to the Bank for Non-Objection.
                                                        32
underlined, it is to stress the fact that the nature of the project design itself (suggested by
the World Bank) contributed much to the delays on the part of the Borrower.

96.     The successive Bank teams’ attempts to reduce the numbers of small value and
largely tangential activities to the PDO demonstrate this. These attempts were, however,
met with resistance from the Borrower. This was particularly the case for the capacity-
development activities because these included per-diems, which were seen as supplemental
income, an incentive of no small measure, for undertaking project implementation. Indeed,
they largely served as a reason to multiply the number of capacity building activities (there
were 114 in all). Consequently, the Project Secretariat made significant efforts to include
small-value procurement that went around formal Bank non objection requirements for this
reason. The TTLs were inundated with requests for non-objections; in addition, improving
disbursements was not in the overall interest of the project secretariat that had assured
counterpart financing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

97.     In the original phase of the project, this agency’s commitment to achieving
development objectives seemed to depend too heavily on the staffing challenges it was
facing. As noted previously, the first two coordinators were replaced due in essence to
non-performance. In addition, there were persistent fiduciary difficulties: supervision
missions 33 indicated that the project unit should have been more diligent in terms of
reporting, record-keeping and following procurement and financial management practices
acceptable to the Bank. Indeed, it was recommended that a financial or a procurement
specialist be hired. Another reason for delays was also given; there was a lack of
communication and coordination between the agency and the various departments in the
Ministries of Education.

98.      At restructuring, the PCU significantly strengthened its implementation capacity by
(i) streamlining the coordination structures to improve the coordination between Ministries
and the PCU, (ii) hiring additional qualified personnel, in the areas of financial
management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation and putting in place better
tracking systems for procurement and financial reporting; and (iii) adopting new
procedures to simplify the implementation of training activities (which represent a
significant share of the project activities). However, despite these measures, disbursement
remained extremely feeble. Of course, the government, project coordination team, the task
team and Bank management all share a responsibility to ensure that the right conditions are
brought together for a successful operation. Nevertheless, an assessment of this agency’s
commitment to achieving the PDOs remains guarded. It was only when project execution



33
     See ISR #7 & #9.
                                              33
was closely monitored by the last two project teams towards the last year of the project that
disbursement rose significantly at the end of the project.

99.     Finally, a lack of transparency within the Project Implementing Agency was noted
by its own members, a fact which also contributed to its relative inefficiency.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

100. As discussed in greater detail in earlier sections of this report, borrower
performance was affected by issues to do with commitment, management, administrative
procedures, procurement and disbursement, and M&E. In the PCU, these included
questions to do with commitment and project management. However, that said, the
multifaceted character of the project design itself contributed to the challenges faced by the
Borrower, a design that compromised their effectiveness to some extent.


6. Lessons Learned
101. A systematic assessment of the political economy environment for project
development and implementation is a sine qua non in countries where political decisions
are likely to lead to the creation of multiple Ministries of Education resulting in weakening
government commitment to full engagement with project implementation. The preparation
of a risks and mitigation framework to accompany the political economy assessment is also
important.

102. The rationale, timing, and the imperative to restructure rather than close a project
need to be more closely examined. Criteria could be put in place for this. The World Bank
should have reacted more forcefully, to the challenges encountered at project onset caused
by Ministerial fragmentation, by insisting that restructuring take place rapidly.

103. The World Bank must find ways to deal with the challenges of implementing
projects in contexts where multiple Ministries are involved, like those that will be found in
Sector Wide approaches. This project did not know how to respond to this institutional
landscape. The design should be simplified when the administrative context is complex.

104. In the future, a Permanent Technical Unit equipped with a minimum amount of
resources and appropriate human resources should be put in place in country for the
implementation of similar projects.
105. Adhering to an agreed-upon procurement plan is indispensable for the success of
the project.



                                             34
106. More prominence must be placed on the supervision of projects by the Bank. TTLs
should be commended for designing projects but also in equal measure for staying with a
project and seeing that its implementation is successful. Further reflection on how this
might be carried out is required. The Bank could establish an “Exemplary Supervision?
Award like VPU Team Awards, for instance.

107. Institutional capacity-building requires a coherent plan with measurable indicators.
It must be pedagogically relevant in terms of learning objectives, designed in
comprehensive, cumulative sequences over the life of the project, be output and outcomes
based, and must include a robust monitoring system. Best practices and lessons learned
from other projects should be sought.

108. Lending Instruments in relation to Project Context. Undertaking pilot interventions
prior to instituting full-fledged lending would be most cost efficient in environments with
political economy challenges. Further, disbursement linked indicators (DLI) bolstered with
specific investment lending (SIL) for technical assistance would likely be the most
appropriate instruments. Finally, appropriate governance and anti-corruption measures to
accompany the lending instruments would enable timely and efficient monitoring of
fiduciary challenges.

109. Using the private sector to execute certain activities may make good sense for two
reasons. First, they may be more efficient. For example, the CMAs (MOD) used for
construction activities in this project demonstrated that they have greater regional reach and
experience than government, and so can do things quickly and cost-effectively. A second
more general lesson is that they may be much more cost-efficient from a transactional point
of view, as well. If, as we have seen, transactions between the World Bank and
Government (especially when this involves working with more than one Ministry) have
been onerous from a procurement point of view, it makes sense to avoid these whenever
feasible.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners

Borrower/implementing agencies

110. Towards January 2012 it had become apparent that project implementation was not
progressing well. Decisions had to be taken to review the possibility of implementing the
remaining activities within the very short time (8 months) prior to project closing in end-
August 2012. The decision to include the construction of latrines and wells in the project
was intended to serve a proxy for the outcome measure on improving gender equity.
Extensive discussions had been held with the PCU to include or exclude them, timelines
had been reviewed, and the feasibility within the remaining timeline for implementation

                                             35
had been carefully assessed. It was on the basis of the assurances provided by the PCU and
the executing agency that the activities were finally included in the project. Regretfully, the
combination of delayed signing of contracts with decentralized agencies in the regions and
more importantly, the onset of uncharacteristically inclement weather during the final
month of project implementation that led to flooding in the project areas prevented the full
implementation of the construction activities. Efforts were undertaken to accommodate the
remaining activities as part of an ongoing World Bank sanitation project.

111. The Bank team's hesitation to provide non-objections during the final eight months
of project implementation was directly related to: (i) the complexity of the project with
myriad procurement activities, having to acquire a full understanding of the significant
implementation problems that the project had suffered in the preceding six years; (ii)
determining the best way forward to: (a) ensure that the remaining project financing could
be disbursed fully based on a thorough assessment of what activities were feasible or not in
the run up to the project closing date of August 31, 2012; and (b) ensure that sufficient due
diligence was exercised in providing non-objections. The delays in granting non-objections
were directly linked to these aspects.

112. Further, the request by the PCU to the Bank task team to make direct payments on
the majority of the final activities forced the Bank team to exercise its due diligence
responsibility towards making a sizeable payment. This included having to seek
documentation, clarify complex spreadsheets with numbers that had significant errors in
them, cross-checking information with the PCU and with executing agencies, and ensuring
that a technical evaluation was undertaken for the school rehabilitation sub-activity. It was
on the basis of the evaluation report that the direct payments were effected. The Bank task
team's efforts were directed towards ensuring that the amount of ineligible expenditures
was kept to a minimum.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The project design, consisting of four main components in both its initial and re-structured
forms, does not lend itself to cost-benefit analysis. This is because, in the initial project design,
while cost estimates for each component were allocated, the relatively timid disbursement levels
and, correspondingly, the weak results in terms of achievement of PDOs, do not allow a systematic
evaluation of costs against benefits of each of these components. In addition, in the restructured
project design, the components are essentially qualitative in nature and so difficult to quantify.
Despite this, some of the components can nevertheless be evaluated for their efficiency, as we will
see below.

Initial Project Design

Component 1 – reinforcing the administrative capacity and improving the governance of
the education system.

2.      At project outset, this component aimed to reduce randomness of teacher allocation in
primary schools from 45 per cent to 25 per cent. Because teacher salaries represent 66 per cent of
total expenditure in primary education, achieving this objective would represent significant
economic benefits. Reducing the degree of randomness in the distribution of teachers would not
only generate significant savings in terms of resources, it would also engender improvements in
educational outcomes. Indeed, given that the degree of randomness in allocation in Cameroon is
one of the highest of all Sub-Saharan African countries, it represents a major distorting factor in
budget allocation.34 However, just prior to restructuring of the project, the actual value achieved (as
of 03/09/2009) represented an improvement of only 3 percentage points in this ratio.

Restructured Project

Components 1 & 3

3.       The project targeted to improve the internal efficiency of the primary and secondary
education systems. At project outset, the PAD estimated an internal efficiency of 0.71 at the
primary level, indicating a waste of education sector resources of close to 30 per cent.35 At the close
of the project, the internal efficiency stood at 0.798, indicating close to a 10 per cent improvement
in resource utilization, which represents significant savings. The benefits reaped from a more
efficient utilization of resources are likely to be significant both in cost terms and educational
outcomes. However, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the project contributed to these
latter outcomes.

4.       In its restructured format, continuous capacity building was a major objective of the project
as evidenced through the establishment of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) and
the Inter-University Resource Documentation centers to enhance education sector capacity through
international knowledge sharing. While this upfront expenditure represents significant investment
at the outset (sunk cost), benefits are likely to accrue in the medium- to long-term in terms of
enhanced capacity in the education sector in the future.

Workshops and Seminars

5.      Also as part of the capacity strengthening component of the project, workshops and
seminars were organized, incurring a total cost of FCFA 1,239,475,825 (US$ 263, 158.00)36 over
the course of the project cycle. A total of 114 training events and workshops were organized,
bringing the approximate average unit cost for such workshops to FCFA 10,872,594.96 (US$
23,041.50).37

6.       The benefits for such workshops are difficult to assess empirically -- especially without
good M&E to assess to what extent participants have learned skills that were meant to be acquired.
With or without this, it should also be noted that capacity is likely to take a long time to build and
costly to assess over a long period. The involvement of administration in terms of decision making
capacity as well as planning for the sector could serve as subjective proxies for this purpose. For
instance, staff from the Ministries could be assessed on the job to evaluate whether they were able
to better execute program budgeting as a result over the course of the project.

Restructured Project

Component 4 -School Rehabilitation costs

7.      The cost of school construction in Cameroon is expensive -- the highest in fact in
comparison to costs in other Sub-Saharan African countries – to the point where it becomes
a binding constraint. According to government estimates, the cost of constructing a
classroom in the North-West and Adamaoua provinces 38 runs around US$ 16,000.00
whereas the average unit cost in neighboring West African countries (Chad, Togo, Mali,
and Niger) is around US$ 10,250.00. As a result, the project opted for the alternative of
rehabilitating some 405 schools in 57 different sites in Priority Education Areas (ZEP,
Zones d’education prioritaires), which include the provinces of the North, Far North, East,
and Adamawa as well as the slums around Yaoundé and Douala.

                                                      50
8.      The approximate unit cost of school rehabilitation under this project of FCFA
2,400,000 (approximately US$ 5,086.00) 39 is similar to average unit costs of FCFA
2,500,000 (US$ 5,298) - 2,800,000 (US$ 5,934) for classroom rehabilitations carried out by
the EU in the extreme north and north western provinces of Cameroon respectively.40 It
should, however, be noted that the comparison is probably imperfect due to lack of
comparable data on unit costs from the Bank and other partners – as well as differing
standards for construction/rehabilitation. Benefits from school rehabilitation are likely to
accrue from higher quality of learning environment as well as lower maintenance cost in
the future.

Project implementation/supervision Costs

9.      Project implementation and supervision cost the bank a total of US$ 1,189,128.01
in BB expenditures and complementary trust fund expenditures of US$ 432,555.48, for a
total of US$ 1,612,683.49. This corresponds to 205.27 staff weeks, US$ 612,119.71 in
travel costs, and an additional US$ 254,438.85 in variable costs.

10.    Disbursement levels prior to the restructuring of the project (i.e. in the first five
years of the project) stood at 36 per cent and cost, in terms of supervision US$985,832.64.
Two years post-restructuring of the project saw 16.2 per cent in disbursement and then 35
per cent during the four-month project grace period. This period cost US$203,295.37 in
supervision costs.

Financial Analysis

11.     Public spending (current expenditures) on the education sector in Cameroon
experienced strong growth from FCFA 178.9 billion (2011-prices) in 2000 to FCFA 348.2
billion (2011-prices) in 2011, which corresponds to 95per cent increase (a near doubling) in

budgetary allocation. Furthermore, per capita current expenditures on the population group
of 6-16 year olds has increased from FCFA 47.105 (2011-prices) to FCFA 65.537 (2011-
prices).41 So, in aggregate terms, public spending on education has kept an upward trend
over the project period.

12.    Whereas resource allocation to the education sector in the year 2011 accounted for
close to 2.7 per cent of GDP (2011-prices), it made up 16.3 per cent of government
expenditure (2011-prices) in the same year. This compares with a resource allocation in
the year 2000 of 2.7per cent of GDP (2011-prices) and a 22.9 per cent share of total
government expenditure (2011- prices) in the same year.42

13.     The decline in percentage terms should however be viewed in the context of the
overall budgetary repositioning which could occur following the debt relief that Cameroon
received under the HIPC initiative. Total expenditure for the education sector has
increased from FCFA 75 billion in 1995 to FCFA 383 billion in 2011 – a three-fold
increase in constant terms. Prior to debt relief, almost fifty percent of the government’s
budget was used to service debt.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      Introduction. The objective of the survey was to collect the views of beneficiaries
of the Education Development Capacity Building (EDCB) project in order to gauge its
impact on them. Specifically, this evaluation sought to: (i) test the awareness of
communities regarding the project; (ii) collate their reactions to the various project
components; and (iii) gauge the impact of it on them. As will be seen, the results are
positive.

2.      Beneficiaries. Several sets of beneficiaries were surveyed: as section 1.4 of the
main ICR document reveals, there were different groups of beneficiaries in the original and
the restructured project – and indeed some of the same groups in both. More particularly,
the groups considered in this survey, chosen because they represented a solid cross section
of the beneficiary population, are the following:

   1. Administrators in Government having participated in capacity-building workshops;
   2. Administrators of the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) and the Inter-
      University Information Technology Center (CITI, le Centre Inter-universitaire des
      Technologies d'Information);
   3. Communities in the Priority Education Areas (the ZEP) having benefitted from
      sessions that were part of the project’s awareness campaigns in these areas.

3.      Methodology. The survey involved a mixed methods approach. To reach a wider
sample, generation of statistical data through closed-ended questions was favored,
complemented by limited open-ended questions, some in-depth interviews, complemented
as well by records kept of awareness campaigns sessions. The results are as follows.

    1. Capacity-Building Workshops. A link to an online survey was sent to more than
       seventy government officials known to have recently participated in one of the 114
       workshops given in the context of the capacity building component of the project.
       In addition, the same survey was given in hard copy form to a focus group that
       attended a dedicated survey session at the World Bank offices in Yaoundé. These
       two sets of responses were compiled and the results are given here.

              All respondents had participated in one or more EDCB workshop and had,
               in equal measure, been left with either a good or quite good general
               impression. Most (more than seventy per cent) felt it had been acceptably
               organized, if not well organized. Almost all felt the objectives had been met,
               except two who felt that few objectives were met and one that not enough
               objectives had been met at all.

              The presenter was found by all respondents to have been motivated and
               taken enough time to present the material acceptably (although two

                                             55
             respondents found that there had not been enough time). For some, more
             time for discussion was needed because the subject was new and rich.

            The majority of respondents (more than 64 percent) felt the workshop was
             very useful, while the rest felt it had been ‘quite useful.’ No respondent felt
             that it had not been useful or not useful enough. Almost universally,
             respondents felt that they had retained much from the sessions (though one
             said s/he had retained only ‘a little’).

            When asked how they used what they had learned, responses were almost
             unanimously positive (except for two discussed below). To give an idea of
             their tenor, these included for example: “the session was useful for my work
             as a teacher trainer?; ‘useful for my auditing work?; ‘very useful material
             that I use daily?; “I use what I learned in the administration I work in?;
             “useful information for whenever we work on World Bank projects.? The
             two discordant voices explained that they were disappointed because one
             found the material uninspiring and found that s/he returned to her/his usual
             ways of working after the workshop, while the other felt that whatever was
             gained was lost because only a little time after the workshop s/he was
             transferred.

            In general, almost all respondents had found the workshops useful
             professionally and one even added, “I found it satisfying professionally and
             personally, for are not the two domains linked??

            Finally, when asked about the per-diem received for attending the
             workshop, forty percent felt it was sufficient, forty percent felt it was more
             or less sufficient, while twenty percent did not feel it was enough.

2. GDLN and CITI. The directors and staff of these institutions, who were
   beneficiaries of the project, also received links to online surveys. Their responses
   were compiled and the results are given here.

           In general, the capacity strengthening workshops for staff were appreciated
            when they were well organized and the presenter was dynamic and motivated.
            In most cases the objectives were attained and the respondents had the
            impression that the workshops had been useful since the takeaways continued
            to be of relevance after the sessions. This was not always the case. One
            respondent commented that the workshop s/he attended was poorly organized
            and few of the intended objectives were met, even if she/he did retain certain
            lessons from the session and continued to draw upon them in the work she/he
            did today. This respondent felt that the workshop was of some use,
            nevertheless.


                                           56
                In a side note, one respondent added that he appreciated the workshops and
                 looks forward to putting to use what he learned with the true beneficiaries of
                 the GDLN – those who will use and profit from it -- when the decree
                 legislating its opening comes into effect.

        3. Education Priority Areas (ZEP). The objective of the EBCD component in the
           Education Priority Areas consisted of: (i) the rehabilitation and equipping of
           classrooms with benches; (ii) mobilizing and sensitizing the local communities
           (Children, Parents, School Communities); the reinforcement of capacity; and (iv)
           putting in place the Environmental and Social Management Plan. It is all these
           objectives that interest here, but most particularly the second and third.

                Two methodologies were exploited to gain an understanding of the impact on
                 beneficiaries of the project in the Education Priority Areas (the ZEP). Given
                 the imposing geographical area involved, (1) direct interviews were carried
                 out with the twelve program facilitators working in the Education Priority
                 Areas via email and/or telephone 43 ; (2) a comparative review of the
                 facilitators’ reports (written and submitted monthly) was undertaken. Their
                 responses were compiled and the results are given here.

Interviews with facilitators

4.      On average four meetings were held per month per school with the educational
community (parents, school representatives, and students) with the objective of maintaining
good relations, to carry out awareness within the schools and communities of the project
goals, and to mobilize the community around the project.

5.      Facilitators report that the communities as a whole were informed of everything that
was happening, that most activities were very well received in each area, and that good
relations were created and maintained. The communities were satisfied with the activities,
especially the rebuilding of classes. Indeed, many communities were enthusiastic and
participated (as they had traditionally done in the past) by setting to work themselves to
help.

6.      Many facilitators note that the project was necessary and has had an important
impact. For instance, in this academic year (2012/13), the number of female pupils
registered in the various schools has greatly increased. In addition, they are enthusiastic

     These EPAs are found in Adamaoua, the East, the North, and the Far North.




                                                      57
about going to school. The rehabilitated classrooms and new benches have had a great
effect in this.

7.      A few minor complaints were voiced: Delays occurred because rain made roads or
river crossings impassable and so the community would have preferred building to have
been done with this seasonal issue in mind. In a similar vein, another concern voiced by
some communities was that they could not attend the meetings because they were busy
with the imperatives of the manually-intensive agricultural cycle (planting or harvesting).
One facilitator mentioned the poor effect on the community of the abrupt end at the project.

8.     Fuller, more complete information offered to the beneficiaries regarding the project
as a whole (start and end dates and so on) would have ensured a more comprehensive
response from them.

Review of Facilitators Reports

9.     The reports, submitted monthly to the regional level throughout the project life
cycle by all twelve facilitators (from approximately January until September 2012),
included an account of activities undertaken in each of the four sub-components, as
follows.

10.      Supervision of rehabilitation. Each monthly report details the progress of
construction and rehabilitation, etc., and points outs any current issues to be addressed. A
common theme seen in the reports is that a respect for community authorities helps
facilitate work on the ground. Always informing them, and the community, before any
decision concerning them is taken is critical.

11.     Awareness campaign and social mobilization. The approach Plan Cameroon uses
is known as Child-Centered Community Development (CCCD). CCCD is Plan’s right-
based approach, in which children, their families and the communities are active and are
leading participants in their own development. That is, they are involved in the
identification, planning, implementation and evaluation of programs and projects. In this
sub component, progress reports outline how the objectives of local workshop were
attained, whether participation was good or not. In general, communities have drawn up
school management plans for the improvement of their respective schools. A lesson
repeated in many reports is that, in order to obtain desired goals, awareness campaigns
touching on all issues (of the four sub-components) are essential. In addition, sensitization
should not concern a select few, but should try to reach as many stakeholders as possible.
Secondly, helping the community to draw up a calendar to help them coordinate school
development is another useful recommendation.

12.     Capacity-strengthening. Meetings were organized to sensitize communities to the
importance of educating girls, protecting school infrastructure, and improving the school
social and environmental setting. In general, communities understood the importance of
these issues: parents promised to enroll their daughters in school, pledged to work in school
                                             58
community organizations (PTAs) to improve their respective schools, and understood the
importance of paying PTA fees. One important lesson drawn from the reports is that these
meetings should respect community time tables.

13.    Social and Environmental. To improve the school setting, trees and flowers
would be planted. Most schools have carried this out, although one or two reports mention
that the teak trees chosen were not always best suited to some school climates.
Nevertheless, the growing sentiment understood by all is that the protection of the
environment is essential for good school management as it provides a healthy learning
context and in turn enhances student well-being and ultimately performance in school.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      A Stakeholder Workshop was convened in Yaoundé, Cameroon (and linked to
Washington by audio connection) on February 12, 2013 to review the draft Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) of the Education Development Capacity Building
(EDCB) project which closed on September 1, 2012 with the goal of gathering information,
discussing the experience, and deriving lessons learned. It was chaired by Simon Thacker,
Education Specialist, MNSHD, who also presented the ICR, being its principal author. The
workshop was attended by Mr. Apollonaire Tchameni, Director, and Mr. Anton Bieteke,
FM coordinator of the Project Management Unit; Shobhana Sosale, TTL of the project, and
Mr. Vincent Perrot, consultant, both of the World Bank Africa Region. Representatives
from Government were unfortunately not available to participate in the workshop due to
scheduling issues. The results of a beneficiary survey carried out just prior to this workshop
were also mentioned, thus allowing other opinions – in government and in communities --
to be presented nevertheless.

Presentation

2.      Mr. Simon Thacker gave a general overview of ICRs, explaining how the project
would be evaluated in terms of (a) the extent to which it had achieved its development
objectives and produced the results specified in the program documentation; (b) other
significant outcomes and impacts; (c) the prospects for its long-term sustainability; and (d)
the performance of the Bank and the borrower, including compliance with applicable Bank
policies. He also stressed how the ratings would be generated, following ICR guidelines,
from the indicators established for the initial and restructured phases of the project and, to
some extent, actual project disbursement levels.

3.      Mr. Thacker first presented a graph of the level of disbursement over the life of the
project, explaining how there had been 36% disbursement in the initial 5 year phase of the
project followed by 16% disbursement in the restructured two year phase and 35%
disbursement in the run up to project close and during the four month grace period. He then
presented tables of Project Development Outcome indicators comparing baselines, goals,
and actual achievements in the initial and restructured phases of the project, noting whether
the targets had or had not been met and, where possible, why or why not. Finally, he
summarized his main findings by presenting the strong and weak points of the Project and
the roles of the World Bank, the Project Coordination Unit, and the Government. He
explained how these informed his evaluation of the project in the ICR.

Main Observations of the Workshop

4.      The rating scale. Participants asked for explanations about the ICR rating scale.
Mr. Thacker explained the scales out of 4 and out of 6 for, respectively, project relevance
and efficiency, and for PDO achievement and Overall Project evaluation. He also explained
how restructured projects, such as this, were weighted according to ICR guidelines.

                                             60
5.       Updating data. Mr. Bieteke commented that more up to date data were now
available for certain indicators, thanks in large part to the recently available Country Status
Report. So, for example, repetition rates in primary school, which were targeted to fall to
15% in the initial project, had only reached 20% in March 2009. Two points were made: (i)
reform may take some time to take effect and so (ii) rates should also be given for the end
of project in September 2012 at which time the rate stood at 12%, demonstrating that the
initiative was in fact bearing fruit. In addition, two comments were made about the second
and fourth indicators in the restructured project: that these could also be nuanced now with
updated information. In response, the ICR author thanked the participant for these
observations and explained that he would indeed update the data, where possible, to reflect
these changes.

6.       Strong and Weak Points. A table, compiled by Mr.Thacker, proposing the
strengths and weaknesses of the project and/or the roles of the actors involved (the World
Bank, the PCU, and Government) was presented to the workshop for comments. These are
listed in the table directly below.

There was general agreement with the table from most participants, though the following
points were made during the ensuing discussion.

7.      Strong points. The project was credited with bringing all actors in the sector
together; it was an occasion that helped coordinate their efforts. Those working in
government were not used to working in a sectorial manner, something that was
exacerbated after the division of the Ministry of Education into three new Ministries as the
project opened, but the project helped to formalize the new relationship that needed to exist
between them.

                                                             61
8.     Weak points. The mobility of personnel in government, the project coordination
unit and the Bank was mentioned as a weak point. Legitimate or not, transfers of personnel
away from the project caused delays in project execution. Turnover in government, in
TTLs, in FM specialists assigned to the project was lamented. It is not clear how this can be
resolved easily.

9.      Comments on behalf of other parties. The question of the role of procurement in
this project was raised on behalf of the Government. The project was overly dependent on
procurement and indeed too much time and effort was spent on the procurement process,
most notably in securing non-objections from the World Bank. The ICR author mentioned
that this fact was commented on more than once in the ICR and that one lesson learned
would be to try to limit reliance on this method of procurement in future development
projects in Cameroon.

10.    Evaluation of the project in terms of ICR ratings. Following the M.Thacker
explained how he had attributed the rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory, in accordance
with ICR guidelines, to the Bank and the Borrower and how the Overall Rating of
Moderately Unsatisfactory had been calculated.

11.     Conclusion. In concluding remarks, M.Tchameni expressed his hopes that after
what he and others had added during the Stakeholders Workshop that the project might be
rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ because, from where the project stood to where it stands
today, this rating would reinforce the idea of the growing coordination between the WB,
the PCU, and within Government, a point that needs to be encouraged in the new strategy.

12.     Next Steps. M.Thacker explained that the next steps entailed an External Review of
the ICR to be held on Feb 21, 2103, which would include the CMU, the Development
Effectiveness Unit of AFTOS, and the Sector Leader. From there, the necessary revisions
would be made before the document would be submitted.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.      The 15 page Government report on the project is divided into the following main
parts: (1) Implementation issues; (2) Risks and mitigating measures; (3) Lessons learned
and recommendations; and (4) The performance of stakeholders in Government and at the
World Bank.

Implementation Issues

2.      The implementation of the initial phase of this project encountered major
difficulties due to the absence of a logical framework for preparation.

3.     At the institutional level, the initial project was to be run by two departments: the
Ministry of National Education (MINEDUC) and the Ministry of Higher Education
(MINESUP). In December 2004, following a government reorganization, MINEDUC was
divided into three new Ministries. It was suddenly imperative that the World Bank develop
a sectorial education approach. In addition to this major change, before the preparation
phase had finished, the project began to be implemented, which resulted in inconsistencies.

4.     As the risks inherent in the implementation of complex projects had not been
thoroughly anticipate, mitigation strategies were not always found in time. In general, the
implementation of the project was hindered by:

   - Difficulties in mobilizing funds from the government during the preparation phase
     and start-up activities;
   - The absence of a local shelter for the Program Coordination Unit (PCU) resulting in a
     late start of activities. After implementation took place in 2005, the first activities
     were actually only started in 2006;
   - Instability of the officials in charge of coordinating the program: three Coordinators
     General, three Technical Coordinators, four Procurement Specialists, three
     Administrative and Financial Managers, four Accountants succeeded one another in
     the past seven years of the program while five World Bank Task Team Leaders all of
     whom resided in Washington, DC changed as well;
   - Mobility of officials in charge of implementing the project in the ministries, who were
     regularly transferred. This resulted in problems of ownership and in the understanding
     of the logic behind implementation of the program;
   - Implementation of the activities of certain components and sub-components, which
     began to be delayed or lagged due to the absence of regulatory measures or the
     inappropriateness of planned activities, resulting in their removal with the consequent
     depletion of certain expenditure categories and the need for the reallocation of these
     funds by categories.

5.     More specifically, problems of implementation were seen in three major areas of
the project, namely: in (i) capacity building activities, (ii) the operationalization of the
Continuing Education and Distance, (iii) micro-projects in Contract Management Agencies.
                                            63
Risks and mitigating measures

6.     Risks in the implementation of activities can be assessed through their impact on
the achievement of objectives, the technical quality and operational results as well as the
duration and cost of operations, and finally by measures used to mitigate their effects, as
demonstrated in the following summary:

Lessons learned and recommendations

        The project created a sector-wide approach and provided a framework for the
         meeting of all Education Ministers. It also supported the at-the-time new education
         sector strategy through specific activities in each of the various components. It also
         helped to create a culture of internal evaluation of the education system through
         audit training.
        Many procedures have been codified. This is thanks to the workshops and seminars
         that produced a more effective management of funds, specific procedures for the
         management of micro-projects and CMAs, and in the production of various media
         (instruments and evaluation guides, manuals procedures for managing audits,
         training materials on a variety of topics ...).
        Minimizing the risk of establishment of DCC equipment through AACED for the
         establishment of the first Centre for Continuing Education Distance Learning in
         Central Africa, which highlights the benefits of South-South cooperation in the
         design and monitoring, and the technical implementation of this technical solution.


                                                       65
      The formation of a national team for elementary and secondary school competence-
       based curriculums. This training has enabled the development of South-South
       cooperation.
      Specifically, the lessons learned during the implementation of CMAs micro-
       projects can be summarized as follows:

           o The constitution of the project team should focus on skills related to the
             construction of infrastructure and not on skills education;
           o The recommendation of the World Bank in collaboration with civil society
             organizations is essential for training procedures;
           o Resizing projects and reducing implementation time should be avoided;
           o Interference of any kind and influence peddling in the production of various
             reports are sources of errors and frustrations;
           o The flow of information is essential. Clear communication plans should be
             developed to ensure that all stakeholders are informed of the progress of the
             project, something which ensures transparency and avoids frustrations
           o The organization of a clarification meeting (at the start of technical work /
             activities) starting with the Enterprise and supervision consultants and
             communities, helps aligns all stakeholder views.
           o Effective communication between all stakeholders is also very important for
             tracking and project success
           o The involvement of local authorities in the beginning of the project is very
             important for the success and management of potential conflicts with the
             beneficiaries.
           o The requirement of guarantees from corporations can reduce the high
             number of companies submitting unreliable offers for projects.
           o In terms of the rehabilitation of classrooms:
             a. technical evaluations of the work is crucial to the success of
                 rehabilitation and should be closely monitored;
             b. Despite assessments done before work begins, some problems appear
                 only when the rehabilitation work has started. This can cause additional
                 work which must be covered to be fair to businesses.

7.      The performance of stakeholders. After a discussion of the roles of each unit, a
brief appreciation of each is given.

8.      The Steering Committee was chaired by the MINEDUB, MINESEC and
MINESUP vice-presidents and included among its members, representatives of the Prime
Minister, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, and the Secretaries General and Focal
Points in each Ministry of Education. The General Coordinator of PASE is the Rapporteur.
The Steering Committee met six times in accordance with the timetable and three times in
special sessions to consider specific issues. It fulfilled its mandate satisfactorily, using a
given framework for addressing issues relating to the operation of the overall education
sector.

                                             66
9.     The Sub-Committee Technical Coordination and Monitoring was restricted to
the Project’s Coordinator General and three Project Focal Points within ministerial
departments. This unit suffered from the unavailability and lack of capacity of some of its
members who were often conspicuous by their absence.

10.    Operational Monitoring Cells (COS) were chaired by the Secretaries General of
Ministries together the Heads of components and sub-components involved in the
implementation of the project. COS experienced delays in implementation. In some
departments, funds were budgeted annually for the operation.

11.    The Project Coordination Unit, under the authority of a General Coordinator and
comprising experts in project management, procurement and financial management, was
responsible for fiduciary aspects and tasks of daily management of the project. It saw high
turnover in key personnel, including the recruitment of some to other World Bank projects
while their contract within the Project was still running, which broke the continuity of
service and had a negative impact on the implementation of the project. The PCU
accompanied the implementation of the project with happiness. In general, instances of
supervision, coordination and implementation of the project had to be relegated behind the
overwhelming imperatives of procurement and financial management. This was one of the
weaknesses of the PCU management.

Performance of the World Bank

12.     The Bank team included five Task Team Leaders. The first TTL had the foresight to
bring all those responsible for the education sector to work together to develop a program.
He helped the Government develop a vision for education in Cameroon. He was very active
and did not hesitate to meet with the various Ministers to advance project implementation.
Because of his determination to start the program even in the absence of a sectoral strategy,
his only oversight was not developing a logical framework for the project. The second TTL
started operations. However his unavailability to respond quickly to requests for non-
objection was a hindrance to the progress of completion. The third TTL had the merit to
have done an in-depth analysis of the problems in the project. In restructuring the project,
he added a logical framework and removed activities that had no longer any link with the
objectives assigned to the project. However, his availability created delays in the project
(delays in non-objections). The strength of the fourth TTL was that she helped to monitor
the project before taking office as TTL. Unfortunately, her leadership was of short
duration. The fifth TTL monitoring activities were undermined by some hesitation in
making decisions. However, it was during her tenure that the largest disbursements were
made: those to do with the CMA and the equipment for the Distance Learning Center.
However, it should also be noted that delays in the granting of non-objections did not favor
the execution of a number of planned activities which had to eventually be removed.
