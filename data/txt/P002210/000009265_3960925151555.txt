FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1345-RW)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Water
Supply Project in Rwanda, for which Credit 1345-RW in the amount of SDR
12.0 million was approved on April 12, 1983. The Credit was closed on June
30, 1988, as originally scheduled. It was fully disbursed (except an
outstanding balance of SDR 14.06 which was canceled) and the last
disbursement was on December 16, 1988.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations
Division of the South-Central ar.d Indian Ocean Department, Africa Regional
Office (Preface, Evaluation Sunr.ary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower
(Part II).
Preparation of this PCR wai started during the Bank's fi.nal
supervision mission of the project in October 1987, and is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REP3RT
RWANDA
FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CREDIT 1345-RW)
EVALUATION SUMMAQY
Obiectives
1.       The project's major objectives were to improve: (i) the capability
of ELECTROGAZ, the national water, gas and electrici   compar- 'n the
planning, administrative, financial and technical areas; (ii,
efficiency of its operation and maintenance; (iii) the level _, service in
five secondary centers ; and (iv) the institutional and financial
arrangements for the rural water supply sub-sector (para. 3.01).
Imlementation Exverience
2.       At the start of the project, ELECTROGAZ was responsible for the
implementation of the whole project. When the General Directorate of Water
(GDW) was created, in January 1984, it took over the rural water supply
component: engineering studies for the Lava Region and institutional and
financial study for the rural sub-sector (para. 4.02).
3.       On the technical side, ELECTROGAZ' performance was very good.  All
the works were completed two months before the original schedule, and
within the appraisal cost estimate (para. 5.02). The bid documents were
very well prepared and ready on time. There was no problem in the bid
evaluation process and all the construction contracts were signed six days
after the credit effectiveness (para. 5.03). Supervision of works was done
smoothly with the help of the same consulting firm which prepared
preliminary studies and final design. The performance of the contractors
was also excellent. When one of them, AIDR, went bankrupt at the beginning
of the works, its associate, ABAY took over successfully the entire
contract (para. 5.04).
4.       on the institutional and financial side, the performance is less
significant. After an important tariff increase at the time of appraisal,
in 1982, there was no more increase during the project life, but a decrease
in nominal terms by governmental decree of 14% from January 1, 1988, for
electricity (para. 6.08). In addition, Government arrears were not reduced
to four months of billing, as required by the Credit Agreement. This
deteriorated the liquidity position of ELECTROGAZ, which has been unable to
meet its obligations to the Government (para. 6.10). ELECTROGAZ requested
the Ministry of Finance to revise the terms of the subsidiary loan, which
were: repayment period of 20 years including a five-year grace period, an
interest of 10.97% per annum and the assumption of exchange risks by
ELECTROGAZ. Nonetheless, the Ministry did not respond to this request
(para. 6.11).
Results
5.       Overall, the project was successful in meeting its objective of
improving access to potable water in the five secondary towns of the
project (para. 6.01). In addition, the credit financed for ELECTROGAZ an
institutional study, an organization study and a tariff study. Even if the
recommendations of these studies have not yet been implemented, they helped
the Rwandese Government and ELECTROGAZ identify problems and their possible
solutions. The third water supply project, in the lending program for
FY93, should address the institutional and financial issues (para. 6.07).



( iii )
6.       The institutional and financial study for the rural water supply
sub-sector, financed by the project, had a substantial impact. It helped
tha Government adopt a sound policy aimed at giving full responsibility for
operation and maintenance of the water schemes to the beneficiary
population, under the supervision of the communes (local governments), and
guidancei of the GDW (para. 6.01).
Sustainability
7.       The project helped ELECTROGAZ strengthen its management and
organization, and increase the number of house connections by 80% during
the project life. This is expected to be continued under the proposed
Third Water Supply Project. For the rural sub-sector, the project prepared
the groundwork for the Second Water Supply Project (Credit 1783-RW) which
covers the whole country and involves six other cofinanciers. Lack of
adequate cost recovery still remains a major problem, and is addressed for
the rural sub-sector under the ongoing Second Water Supply Project. The
proposed Third Water Supply Project should address this problem for the
urban sub-sector (para. 7.02).
Findinas and Lessons Learned
8.       As in many other developing countries, the technical department of
ELECTROGAZ performed in an effective and timely manner, but the financial
managers were unable to improve the situation, owing to the absence of
managerial and financial autonomy. The administrative supervision of the
Government is heavily interventionist and overrides the statutory authority
of ELEC.ROGAZ' director (para 9.01).
9.       The main lesson learned is that without an adequate cost recovery
system, the projects of this type cannot be sustainable. Lack of funds for
maintenance and renewal will tend to reduce production to the detriment of
health, social, and more generally economic impacts. This risk can be
avoided by either decontrolling tariffs and assisting the expansion of the
enterprise by allowing it to re-invest profits in its own expansion, or by
doing the same outside the central government administration, i.e. by
privatizing the services. Privatization is becoming increasingly a
possibility for public utilities in African countries and needs to be
recognized as such in future operations of this nature as an expression of
foreign debt/equity trade-offs possibilities. Another important lesson of
this PCR evaluation is the need to attempt to measure directly the economic
benefits of the project in the course of project preparation. The
revenues' proxy is not always the most appropriate one, at least taken
alone, and social and health benefits should also be considered. In the
case of the First Water Supply Project in Rwanda this was not accomplished,
to the extent of raising questions about the economic justification of the
project itself (ERR of 2.44%), (para. 6.03).
Overall Proiect Assessment
10.      The project under review has clearly achieved its social, health
and economic goals. The financial problems incurred by ELECTROGAZ because
of the lack of complianc;~e on the part of the Government to its obligations
to pay arrears to ELECTROGAZ and to allow tariffs increases, can not
diminish the actual impacts provided by the improvements of the water
service in the five centers. Preparation of the subsequent Second Water
Supply Project has also been largely successful. Overall the project can
be considered as satisfactory.

Sector             : Water Supply and Sanitation
2. Background
2.01     Water supply in urban areas is the responsibility of the state
corporation, ELECTROGAZ, established by Decree Law No.18 of 1976. It also
produces and distributes electricity in the country and operates a pilot
plant extracting methane from Lake Kivu. ELECTROGAZ reports to the
Ministry of Public Works and Energy (MINITRAPE).  According to the above
Decree Law, ELECTROGAZ was responsible for water supply in rural areas as
well as in urban areas. Nonetheless, management and organization
constraints precluded assumption of rural water responsibilities until its
capacity to operate adequately the urban water and electricity systems had
been demonstrated. In January 1984, a General Directorate of Water was
created within the Ministry of Public Works, with a Rural Water Department
responsible for rural areas.
2.02     The First Water Supply Project was the first project financed by
IDA in Rwanda for the water and sanitation sector. At the request of the
Government, the Bank sent a mission to Rwanda in September 1977 to identify
a possible project in the water supply and sanitation sector. Following
the mission's recommendations, the World Health Organization (WHO) carried
out in 1978 a water supply and sanitation sector study and a water tariff
study, under the WHO/IBRD Cooperative Program. This helped in defining the
project.
2.03     In the rural sub-sector where the situation was deteriorating as a
result of decreasing budget allocations for operation and maintenance , the
lack of institutional and financial arrangements precluded any Bank
involvement. However, an institutional study was included in the project
for the rural sub-sector. When the recommendations of this study were
endorsed by the Government, in 1986, the Second Water Supply Project,
concentrated in the rural sub-sector, was appraised and Credit 1783-RW, of
SDR 11.9 million, was approved on April 28, 1987.
2.04     There were no public sewer systems in Rwanda, and construction of
such a system for part of Kigali, where poDulation density is high, was a
Government priority. Nevertheless, prerequisites to development of
sanitation in Kigali were Government decisions concerning institutional
arrangements and cost recovery. To help the Government define its
sanitation policy, IDA financad through the Study Fund (under a separate
project managed by the Planning Ministry) a norms and standards study,
followed by stormwater and wastewater studies for Kigali.
3. Prolect Obiectives and Description
3.01     Proiect Objectives:  The major project objectives were to improve:
(a) the capability of ELECTROGAZ in the planning, administrative, financial
and technical areas; (b) the efficiency of ELECTROGAZ operations and
maintenance; (c) the level of service in five secondary cent.ars; and (d)
the institutional and financial arrangements for the rural water supply
sub-sector. The project, together with works financed by African
Development Bank (AfDB) in Kigali and Butare, by Kreditanstalt fdr



2-
WiederaufbaL (KfW) in Nyabizindu, and by Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration
Economique (CCCE) in four ether secondary centers, covered the main urban
areas and constituted an integral part of the rehabilitation and
development programt of ELECTROGAZ.
3.02     Proiect Description:  The project consisted of six physical
components:
(a)   rehabilitation, reinforcement and extension of production
and distribution facilities for potable water in the five
secondary centers of Cyangugu, Kibungo, Kibuye, Ruhengeri
and Rwamagana; and
(b)   construction of a training center in Kigali.
3.03     The project also included: (i) a training program for ELECTROGAZ
staff covering both water and electricity, abroad and locally; (ii)
external audits of ELECTROGAZ; (iii) detailed engineering studies for
rehabilitation and extension of rural water schemes in the Lava Region; and
(iv) an institutional and financial study for the rural water supply sub-
sector.
4. Project Design and Organizatinn
4.01     The project concept had been developed, with inputs from Bank
staff, by the participating institutions/ministries over a four-year period
of time (09/77 to 05/82), with the help of a consulting firm. The project
was well prepared. Its timing and scope were appropriate.
4.02     ELECTROGAZ was responsible for the implementation of the whole
project, including the studies for the rural sub-sector. This was due to
the fact that, at the time of appraisal, there was no agency responsible
for rural water supply in the Government. Although the Ministry of Natural
Resources was responsible for water resources, it had no department
specialized in water for human consumption. In addition, this ministry
disappeared in January 1984. Since then, the new General Directorate of
Water (GDW) took over these studies, which were the basis of the Second
Water Supply Project presently implemented by GDW.
4.03     Reinforcement of ELECTROGAZ was provided by CCCE through a
technical assistance team of five persons, which was in place in January
1985.  This assistance aimed at compaterizing accounting and consumer
departments. In addition, IDA financed an institutional study for
ELECTROGAZ, and CCCE an organization study. The recommendations of these
studies have been only partly implemented, and their full implementation
could be an excellent basis for a third water supply project.
S.   ;oact Implementation
5.01     Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Start-uv:  The Credit was
approved on April 1? 1983 and signed on July 7, 1983. The initial date of
effectiveness was Oct_..er 12, 1983.  It was twice postponed, to December
30, 1983, then to March 31, 1984. The only conditions of effectiveness
were the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and ELECTROGAZ, and the submission of the audit report on the financial
statemetits of ELECTROGAZ for 1981. Due to delays in publishing the law
ratifying the subsidiary loan agreement, the Credit was declared effective
on February 14, 1984.
5.02.    Imolementation Schedule:  The project was originally scheduled to
be completed by June 30, 1987. All the works were completed in April 1987,
and at the end of June 1987, 93.8% of the credit was disbursed. The only
remaining activity was the technical assistance for the start-up of the
training center and the training abroad of ELECTROGAZ trainers.
5.03     Procurement:  Procurement action proceeded on time and
satisfactorily. The bidding process for the major works _.n the five
secondary towns was started in August 1983, and bids were received on



-3-
November 28, 1983. TAe woeks had been divided in three lots: (i) supply of
pipes; (ii) laying of pipes, treatment plants and civil wurks; and (iii)
construction of the training center. The bid evalmation report proposed to
award lots 1 and 2 to the consortium ABAY-AIDR, and lou 3 to a local
contractor, CONZTAR. The original contract prices were about 20% below the
appraisal estimates.. IDA approved by telex on rebruary 20, 1984, only six
days after credit e_fectiveness.
5.04      The main problem faced during the construction period was the
bankruptcy of AIDR, which occurred in 1985. After a few months of
wavering, its associate, AMAY, took over the contract alone and made up for
lost time.
5.05     Proiect Costs:  The comparison be%ween appraisal estimates and
actual costs of the project 'q i. m. in Part III.  The appraisal cost
estimate was USS 16.9 milli(  -bout SDR 15.6 million) and the final cost
was USS 15.8 million (at an uva-Age :ate of exchange equal to the rate of
1986).
5.06     Disbursements:  Actual disbursements from the Credit by year
compared with appraisal estimates and Rwenda profile are given in Part III,
table 3. Disbursements took place over x ve years, as estimated at
appraisal, while the Rwanda profile extends over a period of six years.
The actual disbursement period was rather four and a half years, because of
the six month delay of Credit effectiveness. The original closing date of
June 30, 1988 was respected, and disbursements against commitments were
made till December 16, 1988 and an outstanding balance of SDR 14.06 was
canceled. A graph shown in Part III also gives a comparison of the
di&bursement performance of this project with the disbursement profile for
Rwanda.
5.07     Credit Allocation:  The original and revised allocations, and
actual disbursements for Credit 1345-RW are shown in table 5, Part I11.
Planned and actual expenditures by component are also shown in separate
tables. The original allocations were revised on September 7, 1984,
following a request from ELECTROGAZ to raise the percentage financed by IDA
from 60% to 80% for the civil works and from 65% to 80% for the supply and
laying of pipes. IDA proposed to make at the same time reallocations
between categoriea, because the categories as defined in the Credit
Agreement did not correspond to the contracts which had been signed.
6. Prolect Results
6.01     Proiect Obiectives:  Overall, the project was successful in
meeting its principal objectives of improving access to potable water in
the five secondary towns of the project. The project also assisted in
strengthening the management and organization of ELECTROGAZ. Together with
the other components of the program, financed mostly by CCCE and AfDB, the
project has contributed to the overall development of the water supply
sector in Rwanda. In particular, the institutional and financial study for
the rural water supply sub-sector had a substantial impact on the sector
development. It helped the Government adopt a sound policy giving full
responsibility for operation and maintenance of the water schemes to the
beneficiary population, under the authority of the Ccmmune, and therefore
paved the way for the Second Water Supply Project (Credit 1783-RW) which
covers the whole country with the assis *nce of six cofinanciers, in
addition to IDA.
6.02     Physical Results:  The physical targets of the project were
achieved substantially as planned. The overall water supply service in the
five centers is detailed in table 6 of Part III. On the whole, the water
production reached 3,742 m3/day in 1988, at the end or the project,
compared to 1,190 m3/day in 1980 and to an appraisal estimate of 3,356
m3/day for 1988.
6.03     Economic Rate of Return:  The ex-post economic rate of return
(ERR) of the project was computed as 2.44% using the same methodology shown



-4-
in the appraiaal repo-t. Appraisal estimate of the ERR was 4.90%. This
result below expectations is in no way re'ated to project economic
benefits, but to the failure of the Government of Rwanda to allow
ELECTROGAZ to adjust tariffs. It underscores the weakneas of using
financial revenues as a proxy for economic benefits under conditions of
controlled tariffs. It amountB to an ineffectual proxy, since it is not a
reflection of a "willingnees to pay" in a competitive environment, which,
in turn, coull be equated to the "utility", i.e. benefits, to be perceived
by users. These benefits may be: (i) direct casn savinge if water is being
purchased from other sources (norm4lly in Africa at 3 to 10 times the
tariff which would recover all costs); (ii) time savings where fetching the
water from the point of purchase is necessary, i.e. reduction of household
members' productivity; and (iii) health benefits, quite possibly the single
most important economic/productivity-related source of benefits. There is
no reason whatsoever to infer that these types of benefits either did not
exist, or were somehow "reduced" by lower tarifie, in light of the physical
accomplishments of the project. Tn fact, this seems to be a clear
illustration of the methodological weakness of the approach - 'lowed in the
economic evaluation at appraisal, in that it shows that the proxy utilized
in this case had no relation to the measurement being attempted.
6.04     Institutional Performance:  ELECTROGAZ is a public enterprise
(6tablissement public). However, owing to the absence of managerial and
financial autonomy, it is in reality little more than an extension of the
Ministry of Public Works and Energy (MINITRAPE). Administrative
supervision by this ministry and the Ministries of Finance and Economy
(MINIFINECO), and Civil Service (MINIFOPE), is heavily interventionist, and
hampers the authority of ELECTROGAZ' director to: (i) manage the
enterprise's operations in accordance with standard utility practice; (ii)
prepare and execute an operating budget based on the enterprise's needs;
and (iii) recruit, reward or terminate the 40% of his personnel with civil
servant status. ELECTROGAZ' Board of Directors, comprised of
presidentially appointed high level civil servants from five mtnistries, is
equally ineffective in its role; it examines, notes and advises only,
deferring decision making to the appropriate ministry.
6.05     With regard to its water activities, ELECTROGAZ is responsible for
investments and operation in the urban sector, leaving the rural water
supply to the General Directorate of Water (GDW), of MINITRAPE, under an
arrangement judged satisfactory by IDA. For electricity operations, the
rationale for the distribution of responsibilities is less clear.
ELECTROGAZ acts as the technical operator of the entire network, but
exerciees a planning and implementation function only for projects at the
distribution level. Planning and execution of power network,investments
for generation and transm-':aion are de facto responsibilities of MINITRAPE,
which has the option of appointing an ELECTROGAZ agent to participate.
This is the case even when the external and local funds are generated from
ELECTROGAZ' own resources. The arrangement has resulted in: (i) the
exclusion of ELECTROGAZ from the planning and programming process; (ii) the
delivery to ELECTROGAZ of projects with a higher political than technical
rationale; and (iii) a lack of coordination in network operation resulting
from the administrative division of the power network into
production/transmission on one hand, and distribution on the cther.
6.06     ELECTROGAZ' ability to function as a normal utility ia also
constrained by MINITRAPE and MINIFOPE control over key staffing decisions.
Hiring of all staff except unskilled labor is based on candidates
preselected by MINIFOPE. Engineers and other skilled technicians are paid
the same low salaries as civil servants which results in high losses to the
private sector.
6.07     To remedy the situation, a CCCE/IDA financed study, completed in
1986 by the consulting companies SAUR/CEGOS/EdF, reviewed the
institutional, structural and personnel issues, and made detailed
recommendations for reform. For ELECTROGAZ to operate as a commercial
utility, its general and personnel statutes will need reform. With regard
to the former, ELECTROGAZ must be given the autonomy necessary to manage



-5-
its day-to-day water, power and gas operations, including a fully empowered
director and board. As for its personnel statute, ELECTROGAZ should be
separated from the civil service, and the company's management given full
control over human resources policy (recruitment, termination, training).
The most important proposal is to privatize part of ELECTROGAZ' activities.
However, up to now, the Government has not reacted to the study's
proposals.
6.;8     Financial Performance:  The financial statements, including both
apjraisal estimates and actual results for 1982-88 are given in Part III.
Th, financial performance of ELECTROGAZ was comparable with the appraisal
estimates durir.g 1984-86 period, but afterwards, in 1987 and 1988, there
was a stagnation of the revenues (because of a 14% decrease of electricity
tariffs in noninal terms in 1988 by governmental decree) and of the
expenses.  The following table gives the water and electricity tariffs from
1984 to 1988, compared to appraisal estimates:
1984  1985  1986  1987  1988
(FRW)
Water. Average price per m3;       64.5  64.5  64.6  60.9  64.9
Appraisal Estimates:       66.6  82.9  91.3  114.3 114.3
Electricity.   Price per KwH:    10.2  10.3  10.6  10.0  7.9
Appraisal Estimates:    10.9  13.6  15.0  18.8  18.8
Ae a matter of fact, there was almost no inflation in Rwanda during the
project 1ife, whereas appraisal estimates used inflation escalators. This
would reduce the difference of FRW 49.4 in 1988 water tariff by FRW 38.2,
and of FRW 10.9 in 1988 electricity tartff by FRW 6.3.
6.09     ELECTROGAZ has little control over its own financial soundness.
Power and water rates are approved by MINIFINECO without a rational pricing
policy linked to the economic costs of service or f nancial soundness of
the company. For the electricity side, rates were not adjusted from 1981
to 1987, a period during which ELECTROGAZ received substantial subsidies
from donors for equipment and from the government development budget to
finance local counterpart funds for investment projects. High rates and
subsidie- put ELECTROGAZ in a sufficiently comfortable cash position to
undertake force account construction of non-productive assets such as
houses, offices and warehouses at the consumers' expense. However, a water
and electricity tariff study completed in 1987 showed that by 1988, even
after operating cost reduction measures, debt accumulated in the early
1980's would become due, necessitating an average rate increase of 15%. In
January 1988, the Government chose to ignore the recommendations of the
study and lowered power rates by an average of 14%, judging that this would
make electricity more affordable. The lower rates, combined with a
decrease in government subsidies and continued accumulation of government
receivables (see para. 6.10 below), have instead decreased ELECTROGAZ
ability to meet its debt obligations to the Goverrment.
6.10     The Credit Agreement specified that total amount of receivables
should not exceed four months' billings, and three months for governmental
customers. This covenant has never been met. The following table shows
the number cf months' billings for private and governmental customers from
1984 to 1988:
Receivables in months' billings          1984  1985  1986  1987  1988
Private and public enterprises           7      8.9  8.9    7.4   9.8
Governmental customers                   7.5   12    7.6   20.2  16.4
Total Customers                          7.2   10    8.6    9.9  11.8
The consequence waa that ELECTROGAZ did not pay what it owed the Government
for debt service and certain taxes. Periodically, a committee reviewed the
problem of arrears, requested the writing off of disputed amounts, and the
Government paid ELECTROGAZ the difference between what it owed ELECTROGAZ



-6-
or vice versa. Although it is not a sound practice, this was done in 1986
and 1988, under Bank pressure. The amounts involved in these offaets were
FRW 480 million in 1986 and FRW 1143 million in 1988. In addition, the
Government had to write off an ELECTROGAZ debt of PRW 138 million in 1988.
This illustrates the deteriorating liquidity position of ELECTROGAZ.
6.11     The Development Credit Agreement specified the onlending terms of
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement as followss repayment period of 20 years
including a five-year grace period, an interest of 10.97% per annum and the
assumption of exchange risks by ELECTROSAZ. It also stipulated that this
interest rate would be subject to revision if the parties, following an
exchange of views, agreed that such rate would threaten the financial
position of ELECTROGAZ. While ELECTROGAZ' financial situation has
deteriorated since the beginning of the project, this is due to several
complex factors, among which weak financial management and questionable
policies.
6.12     Health Education:  To complement ongoing activities under the
sanitary education and integrated hygiene program of the Ministry of
Health, as well as under other programs delivered by NGOo including
COFORWA, the project financed the preparation, publication and distribution
of 10,000 copies of a handbook giving pedagogical advice to school teachers
and inspectors on the application of health and sanitary education
recommendations already prepared by the Information and Education Office of
the Ministry of Health.
7. Project Sustainabilitv
7.01     The project has had the following significant benefits:
(a)   an increase both in the quality and the coverage of potable water
services to secondary towns which had been previously neglected;
(b)   strengthening the management and organization of ELECTROGAZ to
enable it to attain sustained growth in annual new house
connections with successive percentage increases of 11.1% in 1985,
12.6% in 1986, 12.3% in 1987 and 15.8% in 1988, represer:ing 80%
over the project life;
(c) preparing the implementation of new institutional and financial
arrangements for the rural water supply sub-sector, giving full
responsibility to the beneficiary population for operation and
maintenance of the rural water schemes, under the supervision of
the communes, introducing cost recovery ana, therefore, supporting
the durability of the facilities;
(d)   helping in the construction and start-up of a national training
center for both water and electricity specialized staff throughout
the country.
7.02     To further improve the benefits, ELECTROGAZ and the Government
need to focus on continued institutional development and on an appropriate
tariff policy, both in terms of structure and level. The institutional
study financed by Credit 1345-RW (see para. 6.07 above) recommended to
change the relationship between the Ministry of Public Works and
ELECTROGAZ, in order to prevent the ministry from interfering in the day-
to-day management of the company. In addition, the study proposed to
privatize ELECTROGAZ operations throuigh a lease contract: ELECTROGAZ would
continue to be a public corporation, the owner of the investments and
responsible for repaying the loans and making new investments, but it would
entrust the facilities to a private company on a lease basis (affermage),
giving it full responsibility for operation and maintenance. The rates
would be set at a level that allowed the payment of a royalty by the
private company to ELECTROGAZ. The third water supply project, in the
lending program for FY93, would provide a good opportunity to implement
such a privatization policy.



-7-
7.03     To ensure continued financial viability of ELECTROGAZ and enable
it to financially support the necessary sustained growth there is a strong
need to improve the billing and collecting systems, to review the existing
tariff policy (levels and structure, see para. 6.09 above), and to
establish a mechanism for periodic adjustments of tariffs to reflect the
economic cost of providing the services. This should be done along with
the efforts made by ELECTROGAZ, with the help of a consulting firm, to
reduce the cost of its operations and increase productivity.
8. Bank Performance
8.01     IDA supervision was relatively continuous, as only one change in
project officer occurred during the life of the project. During the
implementation period, a total of eight supervision missions visited
Rwanda, but only three with a financial analyst.   The number of staff-
weeks spent on this project, by task, is given below:
FY       1978  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985  1986  1987  1988
LOP      0.2   0.7   1.6           0.4   7.9
LENP           3.5   6.5   5.1    4.1
LENA                              11.3  11.7
LENN                                      1.6
PAD                                       1.9  0.5   0.3   0.4
SPN                                       2.8  4.6   9.4   5.3   5.3   3.8
TOTAL    0.2   4.2   8.1   5.1   15.8  25.9  5.1   9.7   5.7   5.3   3.8
This represents a total of 88.9 staff-weeks for the whole cycle o' the
project. The detail of the missions is given in Part III.
8.02     IDA performance has been satisfactory.  The project was well
prepared, appraised and supervised. The only negative comment would be the
insufficient involvement of financial analysts during supervision.
Nevertheless, it was the opposite for the IDA-financed power projects also
executed by ELECTROGAZ and the results were the same. In the institutional
and financial field, IDA's impact has been useful for the preparation of a
follow-up project. As regards the rural water supply sub-sector IDA was
instrumental in helping the Government adopt sound institutional and cost
recovery policies.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     On the technical side, ELECTROGAZ' performance was excellent: the
bidding process and bid evaluation reports were prepared on time, without
any procurement problem, and within the appraisal cost estimates. On the
financial side, the results are less good, but this is due mainly to the
Government interference. With the help of a CCCE financed technical
assistance team, management and accounting procedures improved during the
project implementation. However, this effort should be continued over a
longer period of time.
9.02     Quarterly reports were submitted by ELECTROGAZ to IDA in a timely
manner. An independent auditor was retained by ELECTROGAZ for its own
accounts. Audited accounts were prepared regularly through 1988. Delays
occurred at the beginning, but generally the audit reports were received
within one year after the end of the fiscal year, instead of six months as
required by the Project Agreement (section 4.02.b).
9.03     ELECTROGAZ' contribution to the PCR consists of reports on the
hardware component of the project and statistical data, which have been
used for Part III. Part II reflects the Borrower's perspective on the
design and implementation of the project, its development impact and
lessons to be learned.



10. Proict :elationsbio
10.01    IDA's relationship with ELECTROGAZ on the project has been very
good. The relationship with the Government became strained by the issue of
governmental arrears, for which IDA threatened several times to suspend the
disbursements, with some success, but only temporary. Relationships
between the Borrower and the contractors and consultants were also very
good.
11. Consulting services
11.01    The success of the construction component, carried out on a timely
and satisfactory manner, witnin the framework of the appraisal cost
estimates, could not have been attained without the quality of consultant
inputs that were provided during the project preparation and implementation
periods.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01    The legal agreements for the project provided less than forceful
and appropriate remedies of IDA to compel the Government to pay arrears to
ELECTROGAZ, and allow adequate tariffs increases, since no specific mention
of the Government's obligation to allow tariff adjustments to take place,
and pay the arrears it owed to ELECTROGAZ was made under the list of events
capable of triggering the remedies of IDA (Article IV of the Credit
Agreement). This omission is difficult to understand since the need to
have arrears not to exceed three months of billing is stated in Article
III, para. 3.02. Nevertheless suspension of disbursements could have still
been threatened pursuant to Article 6.02.(b) of the general conditions.
This possibility was indicated to the Government but not followed up. As a
result, the covenants 3.02 under the Credit Agreement, and 4.05 and 4.06
under the Project Agreement were not complied with. All other covenants,
eleven in total, were complied with.
12.02    Original documentation for the project was adequate and
appropriate. The appraisal report of the project provided a useful
framework for both IDA and ELECTROGAZ to review project implementation.
12.03    Data related to project's costs monitoring and project's
indicators were not readily available, and could have been better provided
by the Borrower's progress reports, as well as by IDA's supervision
reports. The Borrower's completion report is quite extensive rnd complete
and suggest that this ability could have been put to better use during
project implementation. However, this lack of formal reporting did not
affect adversely the implementation of the project.

PROJICT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA
FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1345-RW)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    VERIFICATION OF FACTUAL INFORMATION IN PART III
1.    Bank's credits
With regard to Credit 1783-RW, the Second Water Supply Project intended
to help the Government of Rwanda in financing a rehabilitation and extension
program for rural water supply schemes, it should be noted that the Credit has
been approved on 04/28/1987 and that the project is currently under execution.
The preparation of this project has been carried out under Credit 1345-
RW, the execution duration of which runs effectively from identification in
September 1977 to completion in April 1987, as indicated in the Bank's
completion report. The actual completion date had been fixed at 06/30/1987.
2.    Credit Disbursements
Bank's diebursements have been very timely, so that the dates of
cumulative disbursements indicated in the completion report are just a short
time after the dates of the disbursement requests sent to the Bank by
ELECTROGAZ.
3.    Proiect ImDlementation
One should congratulate oneself on the good development of the project
during which customers have increased by 76%, and by 30% in 1988, year of the
project completion. This is indicated in the yearly operation reports of the
period 1982 to 1988, which give the same results as those given in the Bank's
completion report.
The number of ELECTROGAZ personnel per thousand customers (in 1982] was
186, whereas in 1988 it is of 79 employees for thousand customers. Dates of
bids reception, of contracts' awards, of completion certificates are
authentic.
The number of employees trained during the period 1984-1987 ls correct
(470 employees).
4.    ELECTROGAZ Income Statement (Table of the reoortl
In the light of our yearly balance sheets some amendments have to be
brought.
1984
Net income is of 147 millions instead of 5 millions.



- 10 -
1985 and 1986
All factual information iu correct.
Total income is correct (2998 millions) but its apportionment is wrong
and should be:
. connections           s      146 millions instead of  371 millions
. other                        191 millions instead of  168 millions
. total operating
revenue               s      1821 millions instead of 2023 millions
. non operating income  s      466 millions instead of  462 millions
. amortization of
external subsidies    s       528 millions instead of  330 millions
1988
One can note that several figures are not consistent with what we have
in our balance sheet for 1988.
Therefore, one should find under revenues:
*total income           :     2741 millions instead of 2735 millions
. connections           :      193 millions instead of  407 millions
*total operating
revenue                :     1732 millions instead of 1946 millions
. non operating income  :      387 millions instead of  362 millions
. amortization of
external subsidies    :       425 millions instead of  233 millions
under expenses:
. total expenses              2256 millions instead of 2284 millions
. salaries              s      761 millions instead of  775 millions
. other'services        s      886 millions instead of  900 millions
under non operating charges:
. total                 :      225 millions instead of  184 millions
. other charges         s      117 millions instead of  168 millions
. exchange losses       s      108 millions instead of   16 millions
The operating income is therefore 260 millions instead of 267 millions
and the net income of 140 millions instead of 147 millions.

B.    COMMENTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIVE CENTERS PROJECT {RWANDA)
FINANCED BY THE WORLD BANK
Description of the Project (Credit 1345-RW) :
a)    rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply scheme of the
five secondary centers of the country: Cyangugu, Kibungo,
Rwamagana, Kibuye and Ruhengeri,
b)    building of a training center in Kigali.
Part I of the completion report of the World Bank describes in depth the
whole process of development of the project. ELECTROGAZ is satisfied with
this report. There are no particular comments, but suggestions for future
improvements.
Given the difficulties we experience generally in Africa and
particularly in Rwanda, for a steady maintenance of equipments
because of lack of spare parts, the project should have
strengthened the water reservoirs system, especially in those
centers where the distribution system is depending on pumping
facilities. We believe that a water reserve of more or less 48
hours of service would be more appropriate.
As water resources are slightly far-away from urban centers, in
rural areas, the project should have foreseen a small component
along water transmission mains and pumping lines in order to
provide water supply to surrounding population. This population
is in fact frustrated seeing a water main being laid down near
their dwelling without providing a water supply facility.
The Project has significantly strengthened the distribution
network in the centers. However the project should have given
more importance to rehabilitation of the old network, as its
defective status carries a great weight in the efficiency of the
global system. The case of Ruhengeri is the most conspicuous,
where we have reached an efficiency as low as 54%.
Physical results of the project are very significant.  All water
demands are covered presently, i.e. four years after
commissioning. The center of Kibungo should reach full capacity
utilization in the near future because of the extension of the
system towards rural areas: twenty public standpipes on the water
main serving the health center of Kirwa, 20 Km away from the main
pumping reservoir. The same will occur in Rwamagana if present
demands are accepted.
More detailed studies should have been carried out on the
efficiency of the treatment process of the Muhazi lake waters in
Rwamagana. Floccules are too light and do not reach the bottom of
the dacantation basin. The project should have studied the system
to eliminate algae. In Cyunyu (Cyangugu) row water is heavily
cloudy and the need in chemicals for the treatment is excessive.
One should have studied the possibility of sources catchment or
wells drilling.

C.    SUGGESTIONS FOR THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE IN THE FUTURE
The Bank has suitably supervised the Project. In a general way the
Borrower recommends the simplification of disbursement procedures, in order
not to incur in interests on overdue payments to contractors. In the same
framework, conditions of effectiveness of the credit should also be
simplified. In fact, a poor country as Rwanda, landlocked by all means,
experiences some difficulties in complying with all Bank's conditions. We
recommend therefore that those conditions be amended to fit the country's
reality.
D.    SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER IN THE FUTURE
As stated by the Bank, technically the Borrower has performed in a very
satisfactory way. However we draw the attention of the Borrower on the
following points s
Selection of consultant companies must be carried out with severity,
especially in relation to technical qualifications. In fact,
contractors have a tendency to attribute project's shortcomings to the
designer's responsibility, especially at the point of commissioning.
The Borrower should establish a mechanism which bind to the expected
results the consultant company in charge of design preparation.
.As soon as studies start, the Borrower shall appoint a project
supervision unit, the selection of which shall be based on specific
technical qualifications. Also one should avoid to change the personnel
of the unit before the project is completed. The Borrower shall endow
the project unit with the necessary work facilities.
All Borrower's interventions should be channeled through the project
unit, and if possible in a compulsory way, in order to avoid
modifications in the project's program.
B.    RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE BORROWER DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE PROJECT
The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower has been very good.
One cannot expect that it could be further improved in the future.
