MATADI-KINSHASA PORTS REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR: SETTING, ISSUES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY
A. Background
1.01      Zaire, the third largest country in Africa, covers an area of 2.4
million km2.  Nearly the entire country lies within the watershed of the
Zaire River, the many tributaries of which ramify over practically the en-
tire country.  The population of about 28 million is unevenly distributed;
some regions, such as the tropical forest, are almost deserted while others
are densely populated.   Overall population growth is about 2.7% annually.
However, the urban population is growing at 7% due to rural migration with
the result that about one-third of the people live in cities.   The main
economic activities,  agriculture and mining, are situated in  peripheral
areas of the country, sometimes as much as 2,000 km from the capital or the
nearest seaport.  All these factors explain the critical role of transport
in the economy.
1.02      For various reasons, both internal and external, the Zairian eco-
nomy has declined since 1975.   Between 1975 and 1979   GDP contracted by
3.5% p.a.; inflation, fueled by deficit financing, ran high, and arrears on
repayment of external debt mounted.   As foreign exchange became scarcer,
imports had to be curtailed resulting in acute shortages of materials and
spare parts.   This, in turn, has led to deterioration of mining, manufac-
turing and transport facilities.   Moreover, as the Government's revenues
shrank, its ability to fund recurrent operations and investments also
diminished.   This unfavorable economic environment has severely hampered
the transport sector, further constraining a possible economic recovery.
B. The Transport System
1.03       Zaire's transport system is an interconnected network of rivers,
railways and roads linked at strategic points. One of its major character-
istics is that the transport modes are highly complementary to each other
with only limited competition among them. The dominant element in the sys-
tem is the Zaire River and its tributaries which provide some 15,000 km of
navigable waterways. This network of rivers has been complemented by about
5,000 km of railways to form a rail/river system for interregional trans-
port and external access.  Most of the 145,000 km road network,  of which
about 20,700 km have been designated as national roads and only 2,300 km
are paved, was constructed to provide local access and links to the river/
rail arteries.   Because of Zaire's size, air transport plays an important
role in the long-distaace movement of passengers and high-value freight.



- 2 -
There are about 150 airfields and airstrips in Zaire of which 30 are served
by the national airline and three can handle wide-bodied  aircraft.   Two
pipelines, one four-inch and the other six-inch diameter, transport refined
petroleum products from jMatadi to Kinshasa.   River ports have been estab-
lished along the Zaire and Kasai rivers, the most important of which are at
Kinshasa and Ilebo.  Matadi is Zaire's principal seaport, while a port at
Boma handles mainly locally produced exports.
1.04        The main transport corridor is the Voie Nationale (VN) linking
the mineral-rich Shaba region to the seaport of Matadi.   Traffic, chiefly
copper, is shipped from Shaba by rail about 1,500 km to the port of Ilebo
on the Kasai River and transferred to barges for the 800 km trip on the
Kasai and Zaire rivers to Kinshasa, where it is transferred back to rail
for the remaining 365 km to Matadi for loading onto ocean-going vessels.
At present the trip requires about 50 days.
1.05        The VN is critically important to Zaire because it is the only
evacuation route for its mineral exports entirely within the country.
Minerals  account  for 60% of its foreign exchange earnings.   While Zaire
uses the VN for about 50% of its mining-related external transport, it has
been using two other routes via foreign countries for the remainder:   (i)
the southern route via Sakania through Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana to
South African ports (43%) and (ii) the Kalemie-Kigoma route via the Tan-
zanian railway  to Dar es  Salaam  (7%).   Until  its  closure  in  1975 the
Benguela railway through Angola to the Port of Lobito was the main foreign
route used by Zaire.   The following table shows the volumes  of mineral
traffic over the different routes the past eight years.

1.06       A primary aim of the Government is to maximize the use of the VN
because it is the cheapest available route and is free from possible re-
strictions or interruptions arising from capacity constraints on the for-
eign routes or external action.   This can be done at least cost by reha-

bilitating VN's existing facilities, a policy that has been pursued in the
Government's public investment programs since 1979 and supported by several
Bank Group projects.
1.07      Matadi and Kinshasa are the two focal points of Zaire's transport
network, since the internal traffic routes radiate from Kinshasa into the
interior of Zaire, and Matadi is the connection to the Atlantic Ocean.
Thus, the successful operation of the VN is dependent on these two ports.
In addition, Kinshasa is the largest city and the capital with a population
of 2.5 million and consequently generates much commercial traffic.   It is
also the terminal for the other major transport corridor extending along
the Zaire River to the northeast region of the country.
1.08       While the basic transport infrastructure exists to meet current
transport  demand,  there  are  severe  limitations  on  its  effectiveness.
Shortages of spare parts have critically impaired the use of equipment.
Insufficient investment and maintenance over many years have resulted in an
accumulation of worn out, unreliable and outmoded equipment and facilities
that translate into poor service and high transport costs.   Ongoing Bank
Group projects are assisting the Government redress this situation.   The
proposed project continues these efforts.
C. Organization of the Transport Sector
1.09        The organization of the sector, largely the result of extensive
studies prepared about a decade ago, is basically sound and for the time
being does not require major reforms.   The sector is dominated by three
large parastatal agencies: (i) the Office National des Transports (ONATRA),
details in Chapter II; (ii) the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Zairois (SNCZ), which operates Zaire's national railway network (except the
Matadi-Kinshasa line), some inland ports (the most important being Ilebo)
and transport on lakes Tanganika and Kivu; and (iii) the Office des Routes
(OR) which builds and maintains the 40,900 km of main roads.
1.10        In addition to the three principal transport organizations, the
following agencies also have key roles in the transport system: (i) Regie
des Voies Fluviales (RVF), which maintains and operates navigation aids and
services on navigable waterways;  (ii)   Regie des Voies Maritimes  (RVM),
which maintains and operates the navigational markings and pilotage ser-
vices on the Zaire estuary from the port of Matadi to the sea; (iii) Regie
des Voies Aeriennes (RVA), which builds, maintains and operates airports;
(iv) Air Zaire, the state-owned airline with scheduled domestic and inter-
national services using a fleet of two DClOs, three DC8s, three Boeings
737s and five F27s; and (v) Compagnie Maritime Zairoise (CMZ), the national
shipping company which operates five general cargo ships.
1.11       In spite of the predominance of the above agencies, the number of
private  operators  in the  transport  sector  is  increasing.    Professional
truckers, private river and air carriers, and large companies transporting
on their own account have recently been competing actively with the large
public agencies for almost any kind of traffic (besides minerals and con-
tainers).    On  the  river  system  and  in  the  Matadi-Kinshasa  corridor,
ONATRA's  share of total freight traffic has declined  to about  70%.   In
addition, about one-third of total air cargo is now handled by private
carriers.



-4-
1.12        Four ministries have administrative responsibilities over the
transport sector: the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), which is responsible
for the roads infrastructure; the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MTC), which is responsible for the infrastructure of the other subsectors
and for transport operations; the Ministry of Planning (MP) which coordi-
nates transport investments with the needs in other sectors and draws up
the overall transport plan; the Ministry of Portefeuille which oversees the
accounts of all parastatals. In general, the transport parastatals enjoy a
relatively high degree of autonomy.
D. Planning, Sector Strategy and Main Issues
Planning and Sector Strategy
1.13       Planning and policy analysis in the transportation sector is the
responsibility  of  the  Groupe  d'Etudes,   Economie   et   Planification
(GEEP),  a study unit in the Ministry of Transport.  Given the difficult
context and the lack of statistics in Zaire, GEEP has performed satisfac-
torily in the past.  In addition, its capabilities have been improved re-
cently and it receives support from both ONATRA and OR planning units, de-
veloped under previous IDA projects.
1.14      The Government's main objectives in the transport sector over the
last few years have been (i) to strengthen the management of the main
transport agencies (ii) to focus the limited financial resources available
on maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing network, and (iii) to
increase the effective capacity of the major internal transport routes,
especially the VN. These objectives, which the Bank Group agrees with, are
incorporated in Zaire's three year rolling public investment program
(PIP).
1.15       The current PIP (1981-83) allocates 27% of total investments to
transport, making it second in importance after mining (31%).  Investments
for rehabilitation constitute the bulk of the plan. Replacement and moder-
nization are included only when, as in the case of container traffic,
existing facilities have become totally inadequate.  These elements of the
plan are justified and supported by current IDA projects in the highways,
railways and river transport subsectors.   The proposed project will help
implement remaining high priority components of the PIP in the port subsec-
tor.  The plan has, however, some weaknesses.   It includes a number of
transport projects based on preliminary data and analyses for which more
in-depth evaluation should be undertaken, e.g. the electrification of the
Kinshasa-Matadi rail line. Moreover, even if financing were available for
the entire plan, its physical implementation schedule is too optimistic.
While the PIP represents an important step forward in the planning process,
better coordination is still needed between transport and the other sectors
and within the transport sector itself.  GEEP has the capability of doing
it in association with the Ministry of Planning and the main transport
agencies' economic units.
Main Issues
1.16      Dialogue with the Government on the major issues in the transport
sector has intensified during the last few years and is being pursued



through different channels:  (i) Zaire's sector strategy was the object of
a special presentation and discussions during the last Consultative Group
Meeting in Paris; (ii) a transport sector report is being prepared for dis-
cussion around mid-1983; and (iii) specific issues are being addressed
within the context of specific projects.  The major issues relating to the
transport sector are the following:
Management and Operations
1.17      The management of major transport organizations-has improved con-
siderably.   However, productivity can be increased and management in some
organizations is still weak.   A management study has recently been com-
pleted at SNCZ and studies have been included in the proposed project to
improve operations at RVF and RVM.  Improvements are expected at RVF where
the Government has recently taken the most critical steps in implementing a
reorganization plan.
1.18      While technical assistance will continue te be needed in both ad-
visory and managerial positions, this should be accompanied by training of
Zairian staff and by measures to attract and retain skilled Zairian techni-
cians and managers.   Large training programs have been included in recent
Bank Group supported projects in the sector and positive results are al-
ready being registered at OR.
Financial Resources
1.19      The financial situation and financial needs of the various trans-
port agencies vary widely according to whether or not they generate revenue
and earn foreign exchange. In general, tariffs have kept up with inflation
although delays have at times caused cashflow problems to the main trans-
port agencies.  In addition the tariff structure for both ONATRA  and SNCZ
is widely distorted, (as mineral transport is cross-subsidized) and needs a
major overhaul (para 5.05).  Government allocations to non-revenue earning
agencies, mainly OR, have been irregular, hampering orderly operations and
forward planning.   A large increase in the fuel tax earmarked for road
works has recently been implemented and should alleviate this problem.
There is also a need to improve the regularity of allocations of foreign
exchange to the main agencies so that normal operating requirements are met
-- a critical problem at  SNCZ.   While  these  issues  have usually been
tackled at the project level, dialogue should be pursued with the Govern-
ment at the sector level to improve overall budget and foreign exchange
allocation procedures.
Investment Priorities
1.20       The lack of maintenance of the transport infrastructure over a
period of two decades has resulted in dilapidated infrastructure and unre-
liable   equipment   and   facilities,   requiring   large   rehabilitation
investments.    Given  the  scarcity  of  resources,  it  is  important  that
the transport capacity of the sub-sectors be coordinated so that costly im-
balances or bottlenecks do not occur. A continuous review of priorities by
GEEP and monitoring of achievement is required.



-6-
1.21        During the last few years, the Government has shown increasing
interest in developing a deepwater, industrial port at Banana.  The project
would cost US$240 million at a minimum (based on 1980 prices without con-
tingencies) and require (a) building a completely new town, (b) extending
the transmission line from the hydroelectric installation at Inga, and (c)
a high volume of dredging.   A 150-km railway line from Banana to Matadi
would be needed in a second phase at an estimated cost of at least US$150
million to make Banana the country's main commercial port.   Studies indi-
cate that such a development is uneconomical in the near to medium term and
does not constitute a priority in view of the overdue and urgent need to
rehabilitate the existing transport facilities.  Additional studies for an
aluminum smelter to be located at Banana are being carried out by consult-
ants to review the feasibility of the whole scheme and the alternative
infrastructre investments which would be needed.  During negotiations, the
Government agreed to consult with the Association prior to undertaking any
project exceeding US$10 million equivalent in the port and railway sec-
tors. Consultations will be based on: (a) feasibility studies carried out
under terms of reference acceptable to the Association; (b) a financing
plan for the proposed investment; and (c) an exchange of views with the
Association on the findings of the studies and the financing plan.
The Development of the Private Sector
1.22      The means to encourage the development of the private sector need
to be examined. This includes improving its access to foreign exchange for
investment and operating purposes, developing adequate support services;
defining a policy framework conducive to a coherent development; and devel-
oping a simple information system on private sector activity. A study has
been included in the project with these objectives in view (para 3.27).
E. Bank Experience in the Transport Sector
1.23      The Bank's main objectives in the transport sector in Zaire have
been: (i) to restore the transport capacity on the VN, improve its opera-
tional efficiency and strengthen the institutions responsible for maintain-
ing and operating it; and (ii) to keep the main roads network in good con-
dition through the establishment of an effective road-maintenance organiza-
tion. Since Zaire's independence in 1960, the Bank has helped finance five
highway projects (Credits 152-CK, US$6 million, 1969; Credit 292-CK, US$19
million, 1972; Credit 536-ZR, US$26 million, 1975; Credit 916-ZR, US$26
million, 1979; Credit 1290-ZR, US$43.5 million, 1982), one river transport
project (Credit 255-ZR, US$7 million, 1971), one railway project (Credit
902-ZR, US$20 million, 1979), and two rail/river projects (Credits 571-ZR,
US$26 million, 1975 and 1180-ZR, US$26 million, 1982) (see Annex 1).
1.24        Project completion reports have been issued for the first three
highway projects.  The Fourth Highway Project is expected to be completed
June 1983.   Throughout implementation of these four projects significant
achievements have been made.   The most important is that a viable  road
administration (OR) has been established, which, due to a substantial
training effort, can count on an increasingly competent staff. Second, the
deterioration of the main road network, which had continued until the mid-
1970s, has been arrested and parts of this network, mainly in Bas Zaire,



- 7 -
Shaba and Bandundu, have improved.  Third, Government, becoming more aware
of the benefits of improved maintenance, began to make sizeable allocations
for road maintenance in 1979 and 1980.  Despite the successes, OR has been
faced with a number of problems arising mainly from insufficient and de-
layed budget allocations.  Work programs have frequently been interrupted,
maintenance delayed and equipment underutilized.  These problems are being
addressed in the Fifth Highway Project.
1.25       Project completion reports have been issued for the river trans-
port project and the first rail/river project.   These reports and the ex-
perience gained from the other projects have shown that in the Zairian con-
text the strategy of strengthening the large autonomous agencies in the
sector was the most efficient means to restore quickly overall capacity.
The Bank's experience has also shown the key role played by management of
the main transport agencies and the continued need for technical assistance
and training.  Under its present management, ONATRA's performance has im-
proved considerably.   The PCR of the first rail/river project also indi-
cates that the strategy of strengthening the VN capacity was basically
sound.   The revised economic rate of return on the investments was esti-
mated at 19%. No audit report is yet available on these projects.
1.26       The railway project (Cr 902-ZR) is experiencing major problems,
the most important of which are:  (i) a long delay in project effectiveness
due to the time needed to complete cofinancing agreements, (ii) the deci-
sion by some financing agencies to stop disbursements for non-project
related reasons (affecting about 30% of the foreign costs of the project),
(iii) financial problems due to the inadequacy of tariffs, especially for
copper transport and to the limited availability of foreign exchange for
operating purposes,  and  (iv) management weaknesses.   Solutions  to these
problems are under discussion with the Government, which is expected to
take action on tariff increases for mineral transport, regular foreign
exchange allocations, and management reforms.   This would permit the suc-
cessful implementation of a two-year recovery program in which several
donor agencies are willing to participate.

II. OFFICE NATIONAL DES TRANSPORTS (ONATRA)
A. Overall Organization
2.01       ONATRA was established in 1971 as an autonomous government agency
to provide transport services on rivers and lakes, railway services between
Kinshasa and Matadi, and to operate ports.   It has four operating divi-
sions--Ports, Railways, River Transport and Shipyards--plus two administra-
tive divisions--Finance and Accounting, and Administration (Annex 2).
2.02       The Ports Division operates ports on the Zaire and Kasai rivers;
the most important are at Matadi and Kinshasa which are described in detail
below.   The River Transport Division operates a fleet of about 30 high-
power tugs and about 550 barges with a total capacity of 170,000 tons.
Most of the fleet is old and in poor condition, which places a heavy burden
on the Shipyard Division's three shipyards. With help from the Association
under the ONATRA Modernization Project, ONATRA is rehabilitating its fleet
and shipyards. ONATRA's only railway is the 365 km line between Matadi and
Kinshasa (Chemin de fer Matadi-Kinshasa, CMFK), operated under a 10-year
renewable lease with SNCZ.   The Modernization Project is also helping to
renew 65 km of track on CFMK.  CFMK's locomotives are old and will need to
be replaced  in a few years.   ONATRA wants  to electrify  the  line  and
detailed engineering is under way; in the meantime it has bought four new
diesel locomotives  to carry projected  traffic.   The Association will be
consulted on the electrification project when the detailed engineering is
completed. CMFK is buying new wagons to renew its aging fleet and to carry
growing container and log traffic.
2.03        ONATRA's statutes were modified in 1978 giving it greater con-
trol over its operations and finances, and making it more commercially
oriented;  the  results  have  been  generally  satisfactory.    However,  the
Government has introduced strict measures over the last few years to meet
the country's macroeconomic problems.  Measures include controls on prices
and wages, foreign exchange and the level of public sector spending. While
the measures' objectives  made sense at the macroeconomic level, the mea-
sures were poorly designed and seriously affected the autonomy, efficiency
and competitiveness of the parastatals.   However, the Government recently
abolished or redesigned most of these measures in a more satisfactory
manner.
2.04      General procurement guidelines are included in ONATRA's statutes,
and all contracts are reviewed by ONATRA's management council and Board of
Directors; approval by the supervising Minister is required for all con-
tracts above Z 100,000 (US$20,000). In 1980, the Government instituted ad-
ditional procurement controls calling for review and approval of contracts
over Z 500,000 (US$100,000) by the ministers' council.  These controls re-
sulted in major delays in awarding contracts and involved in some cases a
need to retender.   The Government has recently abolished these additional
controls and is presently reviewing its procurement control procedures with
the aim of simplifying them and raising the approval ceilings.   In the
meantime, any contract submitted by ONATRA for approval by the supervising
minister will be deemed automatically approved in the absence of a decision
within 30 calendar days from the date of submission of such contract.

2.05        ONATRA's statutes distinguish between property which belongs to
ONATRA (identified in ONATRA's annual reports) and that which belongs to
the Government but whose management and operations are ONATRA's responsibi-
lity.  The public ports of Matadi and Kinshasa belong to the second catego-
ry.   During negotiations  agreement was  reached with the Government  and
ONATRA that (a) ONATRA will continue to have responsibility over the port
areas and (b) no changes will be made in ONATRA's statutes and "cahier des
charges" without the prior approval of the Association.
B. Management, Staff and Training
2.06        ONATRA is well managed by an expatriate chief executive, who,
since his appointment in 1977, has made significant progress in reorganiz-
ing ONATRA by placing technical assistance in key positions and by install-
ing an elaborate reporting and control system. His contract was renewed in
July 1982 for two years.
2.07      ONATRA is one of the largest organizations in Zaire with a staff
of about 20,000.   This level, which is satisfactory, has been relatively
constant during the last two years after a reduction from 27,000. Zairians
head all operating departments and hold several other important positions.
Many key management and technical posts are still filled by expatriates,
whose number has stabilized at about 120, a sharp drop from about 300 in
the early 1970s. While their number is proportionately small, they occupy
important positions and their influence is great.   ONATRA has prepared a
staffing plan related to its training program (para. 2.09) showing the
amount of available and required technical assistance needed over the next
five years.  Although this plan is merely indicative and needs additional
study regarding possible alternatives, it gives a relatively clear picture
of ONATRA's technical assistance needs.  It indicates that overall ONATRA
would require 160 to 170 technical assistance positions compared to about
120 today.  The proposed project will provide for the key positions needed
(para. 3.26).
2.08      As a result of some relaxation of the Government's anti-inflation
measures, ONATRA has been able to increase staff salaries, although they
still lag behind inflation.   Increases  granted to lower-paid staff have
been proportionately larger than to other staff to reduce the salary
spread.   While  this has improved ONATRA's competitive position vis-a--vis
the private sector, it still has difficulty recruiting skilled technicians.
2.09       ONATRA has prepared a comprehensive training program, supported
by the Bank Group under the ONATRA Modernization Project, to upgrade its
training facilities (railway, port, navigation, shipyards and administra-
tive personnel) and adequately address training needs at all levels.  The
program is based on ONATRA's organizational structure and lists the posi-
tions to be filled, the timetable, the qualifications required and the best
ways to provide them.  ONATRA has agreed to recruit consultants to assist
its training division to implement the program.

- 11 -
Although the decline was mainly caused by the slump in the Zairan economy,
the deterioration of VN's infrastructure further reduced traffic. The mild
recovery over the last two years is attributable to slightly better econo-
mic conditions in 1980 and a major improvement in VN's capacity in 1981 as
shown by a 34% increase in mineral exports.
2.11           Especially  important has been the rapid  growth of container
traffic, which increased an average of 50% annually at Matadi and Kinshasa
in the late  1970s.   ONATRA responded  to this growth by encouraging  con-
struction of a large private container terminal at Kinshasa, reorganizing
port operations at Matadi to speed the turnaround time for containers, and
setting up specialized container trains on CFMK.  The growth of container
traffic slowed in 1981; this, however, was due to temporary factors
(organizational problems limiting return container traffic and a sharp drop
in Gecamine imports due to temporary cash flow problems).
Competition
2.12        ONATRA is facing competition for traffic from private operators
(para. 1.11).  In the Matadi-Kinshasa corridor, its share of import traffic
declined from about 75% in 1976 to 60% in 1981; its river traffic has de-
creased an estimated 30% in the past five years.
2.13        This increased competition is due to three main factors:   (i)
ONATRA's low operating efficiency, reliability of services and safety of
cargo, although improving, have remained below the level achieved in the
private sector; (ii) ONATRA's tariffs have been increased substantially in
the last few years, especially in view of the need to transport mineral
products at a highly cross-subsidized rate (see para. 5.05); this has
allowed large profit margins for private operators and encouraged commer-
cial firms to invest in transport for their own account; and (iii) ONATRA's
commercial policy has so far been inadequate to cope with this relatively
new, and rapidly changing situation.  Also, the private sector, especially
on river transport, is in practice totally unregulated due to the ineffi-
ciency of Government controls and RVF.
2.14        ONATRA has become increasingly aware of this competition and has
initiated actions to regain the traffic lost and to anticipate future traf-
fic trends. To overcome its low operating efficiency due mainly to the old
age and poor condition of its equipment compared to the relatively new
equipment of the private sector, ONATRA has launched a complete and pro-
gressive modernization program of its equipment, which is partly financed
under Cr. 1180-ZR. In addition, new operating methods have been introduced
e.g. the development of a fleet of self-propelled barges for high value
cargo and the use of integrated convoys for specialized freight over long
distances (minerals, containers) on its river services, and of direct con-
tainer trains on the Kinshasa Matadi corridor.  ONATRA's police force has
been reorganized and strengthend and high value cargo is accompanied by
special security officers dispatched by ONATRA's clients.  ONATRA is also
encouraging the use of containers (para. 2.11). Much improvement, however,
still remains to be done in ONATRA's overall tariff structure, indemniza-
tion policies and in general in developing dynamic commercial policies.

D. Accounting, Auditing and Insurance
2.15         The financial situation has greatly improved since 1977 when
ONATRA was near bankruptcy, was mismanaged and used poor accounting proce-
dures. As part of its financial recovery program, ONATRA recruited consul-
tants under Belgian technical assistance to reorganize its financial struc-
ture and procedures and an economist to set up a traffic costing system (to
be completed by the end of 1983).
2.16       Three major areas still require attention.   First, although the
accounting system is computerized, it is slow and unreliable, forcing the
keeping of some manual accounts. Second, ONATRA's procurement system needs
to be reviewed with a view to set up simplified procedures aiming at rein-
forcing controls and at identifying priorities.  The proposed project will
replace ONATRA's main computer and provide technical assistance to help re-
organize the computer department and procurement procedures (paras. 3.24
and 3.26).    Third, ONATRA completed an inventory of its fixed assets in
1979, but which has not been updated, and it lacks adequate procedures to
retire old, unused assets.   Fixed assets therefore tend to be overvalued
and exceed what is required for normal operations; this affects the level
of tariffs and operational efficiency.
2.17      During negotiations ONATRA and the Government agreed to set up by
June 30, 1984 a condemnation board and institute appropriate procedures
satisfactory to the Association to dispose of over-aged and excess equip-
ment annually thereafter.  The proposed project includes the provision for
a marine engineer and a safety expert to ensure that in disposing of equip-
ment, attention will be given to safety considerations (para. 3.26).
2.18      ONATRA's budget procedures are generally satisfactory.  Its annu-
al operating and longer-term investment plans have become important manage-
ment  tools.   Managers  monitor  operating  statistics  and  cash  movements
daily; reports comparing actual results with the budgeted forecasts by
department are prepared monthly and quarterly, and year-end comparative re-
ports on the implementation of the investment plan and the operating budget
are available to ONATRA's board of directors.
2.19        ONATRA's accounting system has greatly improved over the past
several years. Technical experts have helped reorganize ONATRA's financial
structure, implement new documentation and inventory systems and proce-
dures, and are introducing cost accounting procedures.   Audits have also
been strengthened.   In the past, audit reports on ONATRA's accounts were
limited to selected accounts and included numerous qualifications.   The
scope of the audit has, however, continuously widened and qualifications
have been drastically reduced.  A clear certificate was issued on ONATRA's
1981 financial statements.   ONATRA also recently set up an internal audit
department. During negotiations it was agreed that ONATRA's accounts will
continue to be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable
to the Association and that the audit report will be submitted to the
Association no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
2.20        Insurance needs have been met primarily through self-insurance
(cargo is insured by independent agents) because adequate coverage is not
available in Zaire and the cost, if acquired from insurance companies out-



- 13 -
side Zaire, is excessive.  Considering these factors and the large size of
the ONATRA operation, self-insurance is appropriate.
E. ONATRA's Investment Plan
2.21       ONATRA prepares two investment plans:  one sets long-term goals
and strategy, and the other is a five-year rolling operational plan.  In
1981 ONATRA prepared a 20-year investment plan (Plan 2000) which in-
volves rehabilitation, a large amount of replacement of worn-out facilities
and some capacity expansion. Based on relatively realistic traffic projec-
tions, the plan provides a useful but general picture of ONATRA's long-term
development projects.  Within the framework of the Plan 2000, ONATRA annu-
ally prepares a five-year operational plan. The 1982-86 plan calls for to-
tal investments of about US$471 million allocated as follows:
Five-Year Investment Plan (1982-86)
ONATRA's department        Local   Foreign  Total        % of Total
------…US$ million-----
River Transport             61.5    113.0   174.5             37.0
Shipyard                     2.0       3.5      5.5            1.0
Ports                       54.5      59.5   114.0            24.5
Railway                     42.0    112.5   154.5             33.0
Administration              11.5      10.5    22.0             4.5
Total                  171.5    299.0   470.5             100.0
The five-year plan has several weaknesses, namely (i) costs are within a
broad margin of error and some are updates of old figures; (ii) some pro-
jects need further economic and financial justification; and (iii) prior-
ities need to be set more firmly because of the shortage of financing,
especially foreign exchange.   These problems were discussed with MTC and
ONATRA during  processing  of  the  ONATRA Modernization  Project.   It was
agreed that before undertaking any single investment exceeding US$1 million
equivalent, or investments totalling more than US$5 million equivalent in
any fiscal year, ONATRA would carry out satisfactory feasibility studies,
prepare a feasible financing plan and review the proposed investment(s)
with the Association.
2.22       ONATRA's economic and planning unit, which is still new, is being
strengthened with the help of the Association. This unit should be able to
provide economic analysis to help ONATRA establish clear priorities. In
addition, through better coordination with GEEP there should be a better
link between ONATRA's planning efforts and the country's general transport
strategies, especially in relation to the needs of the productive sectors.
F. Matadi and Kinshasa Ports
Background
2.23         Matadi is Zaire's main seaport and accounts for over 90% of
Zaire's port traffic.   The only other seaport of some importance is Boma



- 14 -
(downstream from Matadi), which handles about 80,000 tons annually.  Petro-
leum products are handled at Banana (the location of Zaire's refinery) and
also at Ango Ango, Matadi.   Kinshasa lies about 350 km upstream of Matadi
but navigation between the two ports is blocked by rapids.
Matadi
Facilities
2.24         Matadi port  is located on the south bank of the Zaire River
estuary about 140 km from the Atlantic Ocean.  The river is navigable for
vessels requiring 8.5 m of water or less and able to travel at 12 knots on-
ly as far as Matadi.  The draft restriction is due to the need for conti-
nuous daily dredging in the 20-km long central section of the river located
30 km upstream from the mouth. The operation of the port is totally depen-
dant on this dredging and, due to the complexity and the need for equip-
ment, night navigation in the dredged section is not permitted.   This re-
striction gives rise to considerable ship delays.
2.25         The level of the river varies  considerably during the year.
There are two low periods, March and August, the latter being the lowest;
and two high periods, May and December, the latter being the highest. The
difference in level between the lowest low and the highest high level is
normally about seven metres, but nine metres was recorded in 1962.  This
large difference in level all but eliminates the year-round use of Ro-Ro
vessels and causes problems in fendering vessels off the quays.
2.26        Matadi's port facilities, designed for traditional methods of
handling cargo from ship to railway, have become totally obsolete.  Modern
handling methods are difficult to employ due to the profusion of railway
tracks and the lack of planned open storage areas and access.   The port
commenced operations as a lighterage port and, as traffic grew, general
cargo berths able to receive vessels alongside were built downstream from
the lighterage quays.   The first berths, the Matadi quays (626 m), were
built in 1925; the second set of berths, the Fuka-Fuka quays in 1940
(524 m); and the third and last set, the Kala-Kala quays (460 m), were
built relatively recently (1956).  Only the Kala-Kala quays are constructed
of concrete blocks; the other quays consist of a steel and concrete deck
supported by braced piles. As very little maintenance has been carried out
over the years, the condition of the piled quays is very poor, fendering is
almost non-existent,  and the quays are collapsing  in places.   Handling
operations on these quays are limited to direct movements between ships and
wagons; no heavy handling equipment can be  used on these berths.   There
are eight transit sheds on the quaysides, whose condition varies from quite
good on the Kala-Kala quays to poor on the Matadi quays.   Recently,  two
other transit sheds were   dismantled as part of overall plans to convert
the Fuka-Fuka quays to a container facility.
2.27        Upstream of the berths and lighterage quays are landing places
for the ferries crossing the river towards Kinshasa and Boma; downstream (7
km) is the Ango-Ango quay (120 m), which is used for vessels that cannot
negotiate the strong river currents just below Matadi port and those carry-
ing explosives or inflammable products. Although old, these facilities are
adequate in the short to medium term.



- 15 -
2.28        One of the port's problems is the lack of flat land since there
is only a narrow strip of land between the berths and the steep hills form-
ing the river valley.   This strip of land is only 150 to 200 m wide, much
of which is taken up with railway marshalling yards and roadways.   ONATRA
have commenced carrying out by themselves the first phase of the master
plan for the rehabilitation and development of the ports of Matadi and Kin-
shasa prepared by consultants BCEOM.  ONATRA have been converting the land
behind the berths to accommodate the rapidly increasing percentage of con-
tainerized cargo, and they have managed to keep pace with the changes with-
out creating congestion or seriously interrupting  port  operations.   The
works have consisted of a rationalization of the railway network, involving
the relaying of some track and the elimination of many sidings, and the
concrete paving of considerable areas for the storage and handling of con-
tainers and copper exports. The civil works have been undertaken by ONATRA
as an "in-house" exercise, and with the shortage of experienced staff, it
has been difficult to maintain standards at an acceptable level.
2.29          The  port's  services  -- electricity,  fresh water  and  fire-
fighting -- have received little maintenance over the years and are in poor
condition.  Cable faults, old transformers and old feeder lines leading to
the port from the national power network cause frequent power failures.
These, in turn, seriously disrupt port operations since the quayside cranes
are electrically powered.   The water distribution system has major leaks;
valve problems and the lack of adequate fire hydrants constitute a major
hazard.  Additional fire fighting equipment is also needed.
2.30        Grain imports (about 160,000 tons per year) are handled on the
Kala-Kala quays using a permanently installed suction system which is
being improved by the addition of 61 m of rails to enable vessels to be
handled over a longer length of quay.   Conveyor belts  transfer the grain
to steel silos located behind the port.   The rate of discharge is about
1,750 tons per day, which is satisfactory.  For the forecast grain traffic
to 1990, additional grain-handling equipment is not needed.
Equipment
2.31       The port is equipped with 37 cranes of three-to-six-ton capacity,
6 of three-ton, 2 of ten-ton and I of fifty-ton capacity on the quayside
with 9 more in the stacking areas.  Fourteen cranes on the Kala-Kala quay
were  recently  overhauled.    The  port  has  acquired  75 four-ton  forklift
trucks which, with its existing 38 forklifts of capacities up to ten tons,
will give it adequate capacity to handle general cargo to 1985.   Special-
ized equipment to handle logs and heavier products is, however, needed. To
cope with container traffic, three mobile cranes and one rail-mounted gan-
try were purchased; one of the cranes and the gantry are now in service and
the others are to be delivered.   In addition,  two rubber-tired container
gantries are on order for use in stacking containers.
2.32         Maintenance of cargo-handling equipment and infrastructure has
been seriously neglected; only recently has a determined effort been made
to improve equipment availability.   Most of the equipment in the mainte-
nance workshops is over 25 years old and some 50 years old but still
usable.   Because of the backlog of work and the shortages of spare parts
and skilled personnel, there is no routine maintenance program; most main-



- 16 -
tenance consists of emergency repairs to keep the port operational.   The
port's technical service is unable to plan and implement the preventative
maintenance program and operate the parts control system that are needed.
These will require additional technical staff.
Organization
2.33       The port functions are carried out by two Authorities:   (i) the
Office of the Port of Matadi, which is under the ONATRA Ports Department
and operates and manages the Ports' installations, services and staff; and
(ii) the Office des Voies Maritimes (RVM).
2.34        Matadi Port is headed by a competent Zairian Port Director, who
reports to the director of ONATRA's Ports Department.  Decision making re-
garding budget approvals and controls is centralized in ONATRA's headquar-
ters, but this is needed to coordinate the agency's overall operations.
The port director is, however, directly responsible for port operations,
essentially: (i) supplies and services for ships, cargo and passengers;
(ii) the management of staff and infrastructure of the port; and (iii)
external relations with port users. The Health, Police, Customs Services,
etc. are under the appropriate ministries, but the port director coordi-
nates these activities.  Generally, the port organization is adequate.
2.35        The port employs about 3,000 people including about 550 steve-
dores.   The port director is assisted by five principal subordinates who
are expatriates.  One of these, the assistant director, is responsible for
all general cargo operations (a separate director is in charge of the con-
tainer terminal) and for port planning. A major problem facing the port is
the recruitment of trained and qualified personnel; its greatest weakness
is the maintenance of port equipment for which it urgently needs additional
qualified  engineers.    In  addition,  the  shortage  of  skilled  operators
exacerbates normal maintenance problems: poor operating skills result in
greater wear and more frequent breakdown.
RVM
2.36         RVM is in charge of maintaining navigation on the Zaire River
between the ocean and Matadi.  It provides and maintains all the  aids to
navigation (buoys, lights, beacons, etc.); provides pilotage service inclu-
ding the pilot boats; prepares, updates and issues navigation charts; and
carries out the daily dredging to maintain the navigation channel through
the central  section of the river.   RVM's  headquarters,  workshops,  dry-
docking facility and dredging control unit are in Boma.
2.37       Its over-riding task is to maintain the channel.  Because of the
very large volumes of water and silt and the meandering nature of the river
through the wide, shallow central section, the channel changes its course
continuously, and RVM must make hydrographic surveys on a non-stop basis to
determine the location of the navigation channel and to direct dredging
operations.   Since 1978, the annual volume of material  dredged has been
about 5 million m3.  The aim of the RVM is to enable vessels drawing 8.5 m
to navigate during daylight hours.  The operation of the dredging fleet of
six dredgers, although improving, is still inefficient and its overall
utilization is only 31% (1980). No reliable information on the cost of the
dredging is available but it is estimated at US$12 million per year.



- 17 -
2.38        The inability to navigate at night through this section results
in substantial ship-waiting time.  It is important that night navigation be
resumed as soon as possible, but RVM claims it is not possible with the
equipment and means now available to it.   RVM receives assistance on the
management of its dredging program from the Hydraulic Research Laboratory
of Borgerhout, Antwerp, Belgium under Belgian aid.   Hydraulic models are
maintained and periodic visits made by the staff to the dredging sites.
Traffic and Operations
2.39       Traffic through Matadi Port has averaged 1.1 million tons during
the past few years.  Port traffic exceeded 1.4 million tons in the 1950s,
fell drastically to about 850,000 tons in the 1960s, then increased to
about 1,350,000 tons in 1974 before falling to its present level.
2.40      Matadi port handles about 60% of the country's imports in volume
and 50-55% of its exports; the remainder uses the southern routes from the
Shaba region.   The volume  of imports  at Matadi  has  fluctuated  between
800,000 tons and 600,000 tons in the past 10 years.  Exports through Matadi
on the contrary have consistently declined from about 600,000 tons in 1968
to about 400,000 tons at present.   A salient feature is that the composi-
tion of imports has been relatively stable,  food products accounting for
about 35-40% of the total volume but with a growing share of wheat.   The
composition of exports, on the contrary, has changed noticeably, due to the
decline  in agriculture  goods.   A striking  fact  has  been the growth of
container traffic.  Figures show a 50% annual increase from 1976 (5000 TEU
and 50,000 tons) to 1980 (20,000 TEU and 240,000 tons).  In 1980 about 20%
of non-wheat imports and 35% of total exports were containerized. This is
a  consequence   of  the  clear  advantages  of  containerization  in  the
multi-modal transport sector of Zaire.  Log traffic has increased somewhat
during the last decade to about 50,000 tons; this level has, however,
stabilized during the last five years.
2.41      About 400-450 ships are handled annually, the majority being con-
ventional general cargo or polyvalent ships; however, fully cellular con-
tainer ships of 500/900 TEU are now calling regularly.   One or two of the
West African conference lines are introducing cellular vessels particularly
designed for shallower draft ports.  Logs and timber products are exported
in conventional vessels.   More recently, copper is being exported in con-
tainers which eases handling problems significantly.
2.42        In 1981, the port handled an average of 505 tons per ship per
day, which compares  favorably with most sub-Saharan ports.   A large in-
crease in productivity occurred during the last few years due to a major
reorganization of the port and procurement of new handling equipment,
financed by KFW; this completely eliminated the congestion which existed in
the mid-1970s.
2.43        Three shifts a day are worked with optional work on Sunday and
holidays.  Because there is no night navigation on the central section of
the river, considerable night shifts are used so vessels can reduce waiting
time to a minimum.   Unless a departing vessel can sail by  1:30 in the
afternoon, it must stay alongside until 5:30 the next morning.



- 18 -
2.44        The overall berth occupancy rate in 1981 was 61%.  This figure,
however, is misleading due to the very poor condition of some berths; the
need to wait for daylight navigation, refrigerated trucks or export cargo;
and the inclusion of fishing vessels lying alongside for repair and vict-
ualling.   The occupancy rate of individual berths varied from 12% (Ango
Ango) to 90% (Kala Kala quays).
Kinshasa
Facilities
2.45       The port is located on the south bank of the river not far above
the last rapids upstream from Matadi at the point where the river widens
into the vast Malebo pool. It is relatively protected from fast river cur-
rents, and siltation is not a major proble-m.  Water levels vary seasonally
as at Matadi; the maximum difference is about 6.5 m.   From Kinshasa up-
stream the river is navigable as far as Kisangani on the Zaire river and
Ilebo on the Kasai river.   Because  of its  location,  all  river  traffic
either converges on Kinshasa from the interior of Zaire or departs from it.
2.46       Kinshasa was built as a railway port.  The port borders directly
on the city and much of the narrow space available between the berths and
the city, sometimes less than 200 m, is taken up by railway tracks, sheds
and warehouses.   The port is flanked on the downstream side by the passen-
ger terminal and upstream by ONATRA's ship-repair facility, private petro-
leum  berths  and  privately  owned  quays  known  as  "beaches".    Ngobila
Beach, a private ferry terminal for passengers travelling between Kinshasa
and Brazzaville,  is located nearly in the middle of the port effectively
splitting it into two sections and seriously hampering port operations.
2.47     The port has 1,076 m of quays: Ex Citas quay (290 m) and the con-
crete block quay (272 m) are used for export traffic; "Aux Avancees" quay
(390 m) and Kisangani quay (124 m) for import traffic and river passenger
terminals.   The overall condition of the infrastructure is poor as most of
the facilities are old and little maintenance has been carried out over the
years.  Productivity is seriously hampered by broken up pavement surfaces,
distorted railway tracks, partially collapsed quay edges and a general lack
of  fendering on the quay faces.   Like Matadi,  the electrical and fresh
water distribution systems are in very poor condition and failures and
leakages are commonplace.   The port is also split by about 250 m of unde-
veloped bank between the "Ex Citas" quay and the rest of the port. At pre-
sent, this space is used as a crude mooring for ONATRA's pushers. The area
behind this provides the only undeveloped space in the port. The poor con-
dition of the infrastructure and the lack of open space for storage has
particularly impeded the handling of copper, containers and logs.
2.48        The "Ex Citas" quays are the oldest and in the poorest condi-
tion, though their exact condition is unknown. They were constructed using
steel sheet piling.  Due to the lack of maintenance, the capping beam for-
ming the edge of the quay at the top of the sheet piling has collapsed,
some of the piles show severe corrosion and collision damage in the tidal
zone and the shape of the front face of the wall indicates possible failure
of some of the tie rods in the structural system.   ONATRA have commenced
the reconstruction of the capping beam themselves, but there would seem to
be little point in carrying out this work if the main structure is in



- 19 -
doubt.   Thus, a testing program in the project will examine the stability
of the quay which could lead to a satisfactory solution for the rehabilita-
tion (para. 3.26).   Although part of this quay is used to handle logs and
copper on an emergency basis, such heavy cargo on the quays presents a ma-
jor risk and is avoided as much as possible.
2.49       The major problem facing the port is the inability to handle con-
tainer and log traffic.   Traffic growth in this sector cannot be accomo-
dated because: (i) there is a severe shortage of open storage areas adja-
cent to the berths; (ii) the berths cannot support modern cranes capable of
handling logs or containers without major engineering modification; and
(iii) the railway marshalling system is not able to deliver or retrieve
containers to a suitable stacking area in the port rapidly enough.  Thus,
the construction of a modern container facility with its own railway mar-
shalling yard, open stacking areas and specialized berth is essential if
the port is to be able to handle the projected traffic in logs and contain-
ers.
2.50       The master plan for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of Kin-
shasa port includes a modern facility for logs and containers together with
changes in the port layout, relocation of the ferry terminal and a phased
program for the rehabilitation of the electrical and water distribution
networks. In this plan the 'ex Citas' quays will be used for passenger and
light cargo traffic only.
Equipment
2.51       Since barges do not have their own cranes, the quayside cranes at
Kinshasa are extremely important.  There are 30 of which 11 are of 1.5-ton
capacity (thus of limited value) and the rest of 2.5- to 6-ton capacity.
Seven cranes (4- to 60-ton capacity) are used in stacking areas. Logs are
handled with quay cranes of 3- to 6-ton capacity or with larger mobile
cranes; the work is cumbersome and can be dangerous, and productivity is
low.  The condition of the cranes is generally poor with low availability
(64% in 1980).   Containers are difficult to handle at Kinshasa.   An old
fixed hammer-head crane of 40/60-ton capacity is used but it is very slow.
No container stacking equipment exists.  A container stacking crane is to
be transferred from Matadi to Kinshasa together with some tractors and
trailers which will bring about some improvement, but the very poor paving
and shortages of space will still present major problems until proper
stacking areas are developed.
2.52        The port recently acquired 25 forklifts; these together with 30
existing trucks (capacities up to 10 tons) are enough to handle general
cargo to 1990.   Many of the older trucks, however,  are 20 years old and
will soon have to be replaced.
Organization
2.53      A major problem at Kinshasa port is that operations are dependent
upon railway and barge movements under the direction of ONATRA's Railway
and River Transport Departments and are influenced by overall decisions by
ONATRA's headquarters based on, for example, the degree of congestion up-
river at Ilebo or downstream at Matadi.   Therefore,  although the port is



- 20 -
responsible for coordinating operations, it is difficult to do it because
the port lacks control over certain basic functions.  This lack of coordi-
nation adds to the port's other problems and is one of the reasons for its
low productivity.
2.54      The port is headed by a Zairian director, who is assisted by four
expatriates,  including the assistant director.   The administration lacks
technicians and engineers, especially for the Equipment Maintenance and
Port Operations departments.  Slightly more than 1,000 people are employed
plus additional day laborers.
Traffic and Operations
2.55      Traffic at Kinshasa port was about 650,000 tons in 1980 of which
about 45% was downstream and 55% upstream.  The traffic grew to a peak of
790,000 tons in 1975 but fell sharply thereafter to its present level which
is about the same as in 1968.  With the exception of coffee, which is pri-
marily handled by private operators, the composition of traffic has been
relatively constant.  In 1980, about 60% of the inward and 30% of the out-
ward cargo was for Shaba.   Container traffic has risen very rapidly and
averaged a 60% annual growth rate between 1978 and 1980 (from 2100 TEU and
30,000 tons 1978, to 4,400 TEU and 75,000 tons in 1980).   Despite this,
container traffic was in 1980 still only about 12% of the total cargo move-
ments.
2.56       Productivity in the port averages about 10 tons per hour, which
is very low when considering the nature of the products handled.  This is
due to numerous factors, the most important being the following:   (i) poor
condition of the paving, railtracks and access routes; (ii) congestion at
the berths due to idle rail wagons and stacked cargo caused by the poor
condition and layout of the port; (iii) poor availabilty and low capacity
of the quay cranes; (iv) poor packing of certain goods, particulary copper;
(v) poor coordination of barges and wagons; and (vi) lack of qualified, ex-
perienced personnel.
2.57       The port operates with two shifts of eight hours each except on
Sundays and holidays, when only one shift is used. Although the port capa-
city could theoretically be increased by introducing a third shift, this
would require additional supervisory staff, already scarce, and would only
increase the problems of congestion and coordination with railway and barge
operations.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01        The proposed project partly results from the VN study carried
out by consultants BCEOM (financed under Credit 255-ZR) and completed in
November  1972.   One of the recommendations  was  that a master plan and
feasibility study for the redevelopment of the ports of Matadi and Kinshasa
be undertaken.   After completion of these studies, consultants BCEOM were
selected early in 1979 to undertake detailed engineering studies and to up-
date the economic analysis of the proposed investments, but work did not
commence until early 1980.  An advance under a PPF of US$1 millionl/ was
made available for this work.   The final report, completed in 1981, was
generally satisfactory.
3.02      This master plan includes:  (i) rehabilitation of all facilities;
(ii) revision of the ports' layouts to suit modern cargo handling methods
and to simplify operations; and (iii) new facilities for container and log
traffic.   As the proposed investments amounted to over US$125 million at
1980 prices, Bank staff, consultants BCEOM, ONATRA and the Government,
agreed to implement the plan in phases.   Priorities for the first phase
were set and these compose the proposed project.
3.03       Considering the urgency of some of the work in the first phase
and the time delay prior to effectiveness, ONATRA began to carry out some
of the work with its own staff, provided the foreign costs were small and
the work not too complex.   Following the appraisal mission,  consultants
BCEOM were further retained to prepare tender documents, invite tenders,
evaluate bids and to make recommendations concerning the award of con-
tracts.
B. Objectives
3.04      An overall aim of the Government is to ensure that transport de-
ficiencies do not hamper economic recovery.   The Bank Group supports this
aim provided that any new investment in the sector focus on increasing
capacity by optimizing the use of existing resources and building or pro-
curing new infrastructure or equipment only when absolutely necessary. The
proposed project is given priority by the Government and is included in the
PIP.   It is consistent with the Government's objective of rehabilitating
existing transport facilities and of increasing utilization of the VN for
import/export  traffic.   In this context,  it complements  past Government
efforts supported by the Bank Group of upgrading railway operations in
Shaba (SNCZ Railway Project) and improving river services and railway
operations between Kinshasa and Matadi (ONATRA Modernization Project).
3.05        The project is essentially one of rehabilitation to bring quays
and infrastructure that have not been maintained for many years up to
acceptable standard and to accommodate the rapidly increasing amount of
container traffic.   Equipment will be procured  for the handling of log
traffic and containers Which will augment that recently acquired by ONATRA
1/   Being reimbursed under the ongoing Credit 1180-ZR.



- 22 -
and should be sufficient to cope with the traffic needs to 1990.  The pro-
ject will also address some of ONATRA's most pressing technical assistance
and training needs and provide for studies of RVM and RVF's operations and
of the private transport sector to provide the basis for a possible future
project with these institutions.
C. Description
3.06       The proposed project will consist of the following components:
(a) Civil works including:
(i)  Matadi: Reconstruction of the Fuka-Fuka quays and underwater
protection for Kala-Kala quays; rehabilitation of electrical
and water distribution systems; and resurfacing and track
relaying works;
(ii)  Kinshasa: Repair of Kisangani quay and concrete-block quays;
relocation of ferry terminal; construction of tug berths and
200 m of container and log quays; track laying and relaying;
installation of storm-water drainage system; and rehabilita-
tion of electrical and water distribution systems;
(b) Procurement of equipment and spare parts, including:
(i) Matadi: forklifts, log-loaders and two fire-fighting trucks;
(ii)  Kinshasa: container, log and stacking cranes,  tractors and
container trailers, and one fire-fighting truck;
(iii) replacement of ONATRA's main computer;
(c) Consulting services for ONATRA:
(i) supervision of civil works;
(ii) technical assistance;
(iii) studies and tests of Ex Citas quays at Kinshasa;
(d) Consulting services for studies of RVF, RVM and the private
transport sector.
Civil Works
Matadi
3.07         The Fuka-Fuka Quays (Berths nos. 5 to 7), designated as the
port's principal container berths in the port master plan, consist of a re-
inforced concrete deck supported on braced piles. Through neglect and lack
of maintenance, the front edge of the deck is collapsing, the fender system
has all but disappeared and the services are in very bad condition.The re-
building of the berths was originally to be carried out by a contractor
under the project, but since the work is urgent, ONATRA has elected to do
the work as an "in-house" project.  The Association has agreed to ONATRA's



- 23 -
decision on the understanding that the work will not begin until they have
recruited two suitably qualified civil engineers to work full time on the
project and that consultants BCEOM simplify the design of the deck
structure  to ease construction and supervise the construction.   Imported
essential materials and equipment for construction will be financed by
AfDB.
3.08      With these improvements, ONATRA will have about six quays in pro-
per working order for general cargo and container traffic.  Rehabilitation
of the remaining four quays will be done at a later stage as traffic war-
rants.   In the meantime,  some urgent resurfacing and maintenance will be
undertaken on these quays in order to accomodate overflow traffic at peak
periods.
3.09      Rehabilitation of the Water Supply and Fire Hydrants:  To improve
efficiency and safety conditions, the entire water supply system will be
renewed. The work will be carried out by contractors.
3.10       Rehabilitation of the Electrical Distribution System:  The exist-
ing system is in very poor and dangerous condition.   The consultants have
split the complete renovation into three phases, and the first phase will
be carried out by contractors under the project.  The port's flood-lighting
will also be renewed in this phase.  One particular problem has been the
frequent power failures of the port partly caused by overloading of the
feeder line to the port area, since the same feeder line supplies both the
city and the port.   Agreement was reached with SNEL,  the power company,
that a new separate line would be provided for the port; the foreign ex-
change costs are included in the project.
3.11       Under Water Protection Works on Kala-Kala Quays:   The Kala Kala
berths are the newest in the port and are constructed of large concrete
blocks.  Scouring of the river bed has taken place beneath the lowest level
of blocks threatening the stability of the quays.  Repairs to correct ear-
lier scouring were carried out in 1979, but a recent survey shows the situ-
ation to have further deteriorated.  The Consultants BCEOM have proposed a
solution for permanent repairs, which will be carried out by a specialist
contractor.
3.12       Paving of Stacking Areas and Track Relaying:  Although ONATRA has
completed 73,000 m2 of paving under the first phase of the master plan, a
further 9,000 m2 are needed behind the Kala-Kala berths mainly for con-
tainer traffic. The work will be undertaken by ONATRA using its own staff
and equipment; the proposed project will finance necessary imported materi-
als.
3.13       Under the port master plan, most of the rail tracks will be lo-
cated behind the port area.   Although ONATRA has already undertaken some
work on the rationalization of the railway network, much remains to be
done.  They will continue with the work using their own resources but with
imported materials  financed under  the proposed project.   ONATRA has the
capacity to implement these works using their own staff and equipment.



- 24 -
Kinshasa
3.14        Repairs to the Kisangani Quays and Concrete Block Quays:   The
work consists of the rehabilitation of the front of the quays.   The work
will be carried out by contractors.
3.15      Relocation of the Ngobila Beach Ferry Terminal:  This busy termi-
nal effectively cuts the port into two sections, seriously hampering effi-
ciency. The master plan calls for the terminal to be relocated on a vacant
section of the river bank immediately upstream of the last berths in the
port.  As the relocation consists of building a simple terminal, the work
will be tendered to local contractors.  Agreement has already been reached
with all interested parties on relocating this terminal to another site;
however, since this relocation must take place as soon as possible to free
the present site for redevelopment, it was agreed during negotiations with
ONATRA and the Government that all preparatory work, including all design
works and vacating of the present installations, would be completed before
December 31, 1984.
3.16       Construction of a Dolphin Berth for Tugs and Pushers:   At pre-
sent, tugs, pushers and other vessels which are out of service for any rea-
son often lie against the operational quays taking up valuable berth space
and against the undeveloped banks where the new container facilities are to
be built.  The master plan proposes that five dolphin berths be built up-
stream from the concrete block quays to berth these vessels.   The works
will be undertaken by a contractor.
3.17       Construction of 200 m of New Container/Log Berths:   The master
plan shows a need for new berths specifically designed to handle containers
and logs.  The system of construction proposed is a suspended deck on steel
piles.  The berths will be equipped with a quayside rail mounted container
gantry crane and a 35-ton crane which will be used for the log traffic but
could handle containers in the event that the container crane is out of ac-
tion.  Since there is some uncertainty concerning the length of new berths
that can be justified in economic terms, tenders have been invited for 200,
250 and 300 meters and a final decision on the length to be built will be
made after the bids are received.
3.18        Relaying of New Railway Track:   With the rehabilitation of the
port and the need to accommodate the container traffic, the entire railway
network needs to be rationalized. Particularly needed is a new marshalling
yard behind the proposed container berths in the area recovered from the
old ferry terminal.   This work will be undertaken by ONATRA as an "in-
house" project, but imported materials will be procured under the project.
3.19      Civil Works for Storm Water Drainage:   The need to renew much of
the storm water drainage system in the port, as described in the port mas-
ter plan, will be undertaken by a contractor.
3.20       Rehabilitation of the Water Distribution and Fire Hydrants Sys-
tem: The existing system needs to be totally renewed.



- 25 -
3.21       Rehabilitation of the Electrical Distribution System:  The port's
electrical system is in very poor condition, dangerous and subject to fre-
quent failure. The task of renewing the entire system is enormous and very
costly.   Therefore the work has been divided into three phases, of which
the first and most urgent phase will be included in the project.  The work
which will be undertaken by a contractor, includes flood-lighting, cabling,
sub-stations and rewiring existing buildings.
Equipment
3.22       The project will also include additional equipment needed at both
ports.   In Mlatadi, additional equipment is needed  for stuffing/stripping
containers, handling logs, and for fire fighting.  Therefore,  the project
will include three forklift trucks (2.5 tons) for containers, three front-
end loaders for logs, and three fire-fighting trucks, two for Matadi and
one for Kinshasa.  The needs were based on traffic forecasts.  The project
also includes some equipment ONATRA needs to reconstruct the Fuka-Fuka
quays.
3.23        The following equipment will be procured under the project for
use at the new container/log facilities at Kinshasa:   a quayside container
gantry crane of 45-ton capacity; a rail-mounted quayside crane of 35-ton
capacity to handle logs (and containers in an emergency); a rubber-tired
mobile crane (BELOTTI) for stacking containers in the yards (ONATRA has two
of these in Matadi and one is on order for Kinshasa; a second mobile crane
in Kinshasa is needed in view of traffic forecasts and for breakdown); five
agricultural tractors and eight trailers for 20-ft. and two for 40-ft. con-
tainers. Provision has also been made for the financing of critical spare
parts.
3.24        ONATRA's computer main frame is old and outmoded; this severely
limits the flow of information available for normal management and causes
serious disruptions especially in procurement and financial management.
The present installation is nearly saturated and has minimal capacity to
expand. ONATRA is paying over $30,000 per month in maintenance fees, which
alone justifies the purchase of a new computer.
3.25        Because of the size of the problem and the limited technical
capacity of ONATRA's personnel, ONATRA must undertake this program ln
phases. Phase I will comprise the replacement of the computer main frame.
Once the staff is familiar with the new facility, a second phase will
begin, comprising mainly an expansion of the main computer and acquisition
of additional terminals; a third phase would comprise installation of
microcomputers in ONATRA's main stores and remote management centers.  The
project will cover the first phase and include about 12 man-months of tech-
nical assistance over a two-year period to help train ONATRA's staff in the
use of the new equipment and to help improve the general organization of
the computing department.
Consulting Services to ONATRA
3.26       The project will provide consulting services for:   (i) supervi-
sion of civil works; (ii) technical assistance; and (iii) studies and tests
of the "Ex Citas" quays at Kinshasa.

(i)  Supervision of civil works:   In view of the complexity of the
works, ONATRA will recruit independent consultants to supervise
implementation of the works.  On the basis of their past involve-
ment, ONATRA intends to retain BCEOM for this purpose.  The cost
of  this work was calculated at about 3% of the cost of civil
works.
(ii)  Technical assistance:    Technical  assistance  is  being  financed
under Cr. 1180-ZR to fill key postions and help implement
ONATRA's five-year training program. A review of ONATRA's over-
all staffing program in relation to its training program indi-
cates there are areas where selective additional technical assis-
tance will be needed, at least temporarily.  Therefore, the pro-
posed project includes eleven additional positions for the next
two years, at an average cost of US$10,000 per man month, as
follows:
(a)  General  Administration:        two  engineers   to  strengthen
ONATRA's works division and coordinate the works to be
undertaken under the project (financed by CCCE) and one com-
mercial director to help set up adequate commercial proce-
dures.   It is also proposed  to extend for one additional
year the six positions financed under Cr. 1180-ZR.
(b) Ports department: four mechanical engineers to review work-
shop maintenance procedures at Kinshasa and Matadi ports;
(c)  Other operational departments:   while ONATRA's railway de-
partment is satisfactorily organized, ONATRA's river and
shipyard operations need strengthening.   The proposed pro-
ject includes two deputies to the river and shipyard direc-
tors to review river operations and possible reorganization
of ONATRA's shipyards, as well as a marine engineer and a
shipyard general inspector to investigate the causes of dam-
age to ONATRA's river fleet, review ONATRA's rehabilitation
needs, and set up a condemnation board to dispose of unused
assets.
(d)  Procurement system:   the project also provides for a review
of ONATRA's procurement system by external consultants and
for training of ONATRA's personnel in a simplified system.
This review is expected to cost about US$250,000 over a
two-year period.
Agreement on this technical assistance was reached during nego-
tiations, at which time ONATRA and the Government also agreed to
consult with the Association before making any substantive
changes in ONATRA's staffing program.
(iii)  Study of Ex Citas quay:  A testing program will examine the sta-
bility of the quay, which could lead to a satisfactory solution
for rehabilitation.   Proposals will  be  invited  from qualified
local firms.

Studies
3.27       The project will also provide consulting services to the Govern-
ment to carry out studies on RVM and RVF operations and on the private
transport  sector.    GEEP  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  these
studies.
(i)  Studies on dredging, pilotage and finances of RVM:  The mainte-
nance of adequate depths in the Zaire River up to Matadi and the
introduction of night navigation are of key importance.  The pro-
ject includes a study to review RVM's dredging operations and a
study of navigation and pilotage.   Since the studies could pro-
vide the basis for a future project with RVM, a financial expert
would also be retained to audit RMV'S finances.   These studies
would involve about six man-months of independent consultants, at
an average cost of about US$12,000 per man month (inclusive of
fees, travel and subsistence).
(ii)  Studies on RVF operations:   The Government is in the process of
reorganizing RVF's management.  To assist the Government in this
undertaking, the project provides for a study a RVF's operations,
finances and investment needs to be carried out by independent
consultant, over a four-month period.
(iii) Study on the private transport sector: A detailed study is need-
ed of the growth of the private transport sector in order to de-
fine an adequate policy framework to enhance its development.
The project provides the services of an economist for 12 man-
months phased over a two-year period to help GEEP carry out this
work.
D. Cost Estimates
3.28        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$90.0 million
equivalent, net of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of
US$52.0 million, or 58%.  Cost estimates are based on consultants BCEOM
1980 estimates of cost updated to January 1983 prices. Physical contingen-
cies covering civil works and their supervision, are about 10%. Price con-
tingencies, based on Bank Group inflation estimates, at annual rates of 8%
for 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and 7% for 1985 and thereafter have been applied.
The same percentage rate has been used for both local and foreign costs un-
der the assumption that the progressive devaluation of the Zaire would com-
pensate for increases in local costs.  Project costs are net of taxes and
duties since Government has expressed its willingness to exempt the project
from these costs; the Government's views were confirmed during negotia-
tions.
E. Financing Plan
3.29      The US$52 million foreign cost of the project will be financed by
external sources and the US$38 million local costs by internal sources. It
is proposed that IDA provide a credit of US$25 million and that the remain-
ing US$27 million of foreign costs be financed from other sources on a
parallel basis.  The other cofinancing agencies in the project are AfDB,
CCCE and FAC (French Cooperation Agency). AfDB has agreed to finance UC 20

million (US$ 21 million) of the foreign costs to be undertaken by force ac-
count (reconstruction of Fuka Fuda quays, relaying of railway trackwork,
repaving of stacking areas) and of the rehabilitation of the electrical
systems at both Matadi and Kinshasa.  It will also finance the cost of the
three fire-fighting trucks. CCCE will finance FF 35 million (equivalent to
US$5 million) of the foreign exchange costs of port equipment and of two
engineers  needed  to  strengthen  ONATRA's  civil  works  department.   This
financing is part of a larger project aiming at modernizing ONATRA's equip-
ment under the ONATRA Modernization project.   FAC has also agreed to fin-
ance the foreign cost of the supervision of the works. - Items to be fin-
anced by IDA are all the remaining civil works elements to be performed by
outside contractors, replacement of ONATRA's computer,  provision for log
loaders and a stacking crane, and technical assistance and studies.   The
cofinancing agreements were confirmed at negotiations.   The effectiveness
of the proposed cofinancing agreements with AfDB and FAC and the signing of
the CCCE agreement are a condition of credit effectiveness. The port hand-
ling equipment financed by CCCE would only be needed near the time of the
completion of civil works.
F. Execution and Implementation
3.30       ONATRA will be responsible for the execution of the project and
is competent to do so.   A project unit will also be created in ONATRA's
works department; the necessary technical assistance is provided under the
project. They will be assisted by consultants BCEOM for the supervision of
the civil works element of the project and for procurement of the larger
items of equipment.   Works are expected to begin by mid-1983.   All works
and delivery of equipment are expected to be completed before mid-1986.
The project implementation schedule (Annex 3) was adopted during negotia-
tions.  GEEP will be responsible for coordinating the studies on RVM, RVF
and the private sector.
G. Procurement and Disbursements
3.31       Civil works:  The civil works are divided into three categories:
those which ONATRA will undertake itself; those which will be tendered to
local contractors; and those which will be subject to international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.   The project was
divided in specific lots which have been allocated to the various cofinanc-
ing agencies.  All civil works will be financed by IDA and AfDB.  The fol-
lowing civil works elements will be procured by ICB under the IDA credit:
Matadi--rehabilitation of the fresh water system and underwater protection
works on the Kala-Kala quays; Kinshasa--repairs to the Kisangani and con-
crete block quays, construction of a dolphin berth for tugs and pushers,
construction of new log and container berths, renewal of storm-water drain-
age system, and rehabilitation of the water distribution system.   During
negotiations, the Zairian delegation requested deletion of the Civil Works
Preference for this Project, given the difficulty of determining the bene-
ficial ownership of local contractors within the meaning of the Associa-
tion's regulations.  The tests for the Ex Citas quay and the relocation of
the N'Gobila beach will be procured through local competitive procedures
since they are not likely to interest foreign bidders.  The balance of the
works will be financed by AfDB under its own procurement procedures
(limited ICB).   All bidding documents are subject to IDA's prior review
of procurement documentation.



- 30 -
3.32       Equipment:  All port equipment financed by CCCE will be procured
through local  (French)  competitive  procedures.   Equipment  and  material
financed by IDA will be obtained through international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines except for critical spare parts
which are available only from the original equipment manfacturers, for a
total amount not to exceed US$500,000.
3.33      Consulting Services:  Consulting firms or individuals will be re-
tained to provide technical assistance to ONATRA and to carry out studies
on pilotage, dredging and financial capabilities of RVM, on RVF's opera-
tions and on the private transport sector. The terms of reference and con-
ditions of employment for consultants will be satisfactory to the Associa-
tion and in accordance with 1981 Bank Group Guidelines on the Use of Con-
sultants.
3.34       Disbursements:  The proceeds of the credit will be disbursed as
follows on contracts financed by the Association:
(a)  100% of the foreign cost (CIF) of directly imported equipment,
materials, spare parts and computer hardware;
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of civil works financed by IDA (from
bids);
(c) 100% of the foreign cost of consulting services.
The bids will differentiate between local and foreign costs. All disburse-
ments will be fully documented.  The estimated disbursement schedule is as
follows:

Closing date: September 30, 1987
This project is the first port project in Zaire; therefore, no experience
exists on an adequate disbursement profile.   The scale of the project and
the extensive use of foreign contractors  for the major  civil works  and
supply  of equipment  should ensure  prompt  implementation.   In addition,
ONATRA's performance in carrying out major civil works in Matadi shows them
to be capable of good proj.ect management. The experience gained from pre-
vious rail/river projects in Zaire (Cr. 255 ZR and 571 ZR, which took about
seven to eight years to complete) is not relevant because ONATRA's manage-
ment was recently strengthened, thus alleviating the major cause of delay
in these projects.
H. Operational Targets
3.35        Because of their particularities, it is difficult to apply any
normal productivity indicators for port projects to either Kinshasa or
Matadi.   For example,  in Matadi, statistics on ship waiting time are ir-
relevant due to the fact that there is no night navigation.   Similarly,
statistics on berth occupancy are meaningless since there is a surplus of
berths at present.   Since night work is essential in Matadi to reduce the
time that vessels spend alongside because of the night navigation restric-
tions, the tonnes/vessel/day for different categories is the only useful
figure as a guide to productivity.   Allowing for improvements which have
already taken place and actions now under consideration, ONATRA should be
able to achieve the following productivity rates in the future:

3.36       For the port of Kinshasa the only realistic statistic that seems
to be applicable is the tonnage handled per berth in a normal two-shift day

set:

3.38          Through implementation of the project,  productivity in both
Matadi and Kinshasa ports will be increased by: (a) reducing the down time
of quayside cranes due to electrical power failure; (b) improving the mar-
shalling of railways wagons through improved track layout;(c)   providing
more handling equipment for logs and containers; (d) rebuilding or repair-
ing old quays and constructing new ones (in Kinshasa), with adequate back-
up areas; (e) improving the port layout and operations; and (f) increasing
technical assistance.   In addition, the training program under the ONATRA
Modernization Project will result in better operation and maintenance of
equipment.   These targets were discussed and agreed upon during negotia-
tions of the proposed credit.
3.39        ONATRA will prepare quarterly reports which will include data
showing progress in achieving operational targets; the reports should be
submitted to the Association not later than one month after the end of each
quarter.   ONATRA will also prepare a project completion report in a form
acceptable to the Asso>ciation not later than six months after the closing
date of the project.

I. Environmental Impact
3.40        The proposed project will make no material changes in the envi-
ronment of the ports of Matadi and Kinshasa.  Both ports should be consid-
erably safer to work in, following implementation and the completion of re-
paving and railway realignment works.   The introduction  of more modern
equipment for container and log handling will also reduce the risk of acci-
dents.   The relocation of the Ngobila  beach  ferry  terminal  should  not
change the pattern for passengers and the overall effect may well be to im-
prove the conditions through a newer facility and a location away from the
operating port.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
4.01       Although the traffic flow in each port depends to an extent on
the efficiency of the other, the economic analysis for each has been
carried out separately.
A. Traffic Forecasts
Factors Affecting Traffic
4.02      The future traffic through Kinshasa and Matadi ports will depend
on five factors: (1) the economic performance of Zaire and its external
trade, (2) the availability and use of the southern routes, (3) the devel-
opment of containerized traffic, (4) the development of the private sector
in river transport, and (5) the carrying out of other major Government pro-
jects, mainly a new deep water port at Banana.
4.03        Economic performance and external trade.  The economic recovery
which appeared to have begun in 1980 did not continue into 1981.  Medium-
term prospects for the prices of Zaire's main export commodities are poor
and the country will continue to face a severe shortage of foreign exchange
as well as a low level of investments (specially from private sources). It
has therefore been assumed that Zaire's economy will at best remain stable
until 1985 and experience slow growth thereafter.  Import volumes are par-
ticularly dependant on Zaire's economic performance, except wheat imports
which are fueled by urban growth. Agriculture exports are likely to grow
slowly from their present low level; mineral exports, after some decline,
are expected to reach their 1981 level in 1985 and match estimated produc-
tion capacity (copper, 570 000 tons) by 1990. Timber reserves are vast but
a substantial increase in production and exports, which could significantly
boost traffic in both ports, is unlikely before 1990 because of the costs
of production and transport, the general investment climate, the depressed
international market and the problems of marketing Zaire's varieties. As a
whole, the volume of imports and exports will increase on average at about
2.5% annually until 1985 and about 3.5% thereafter.
4.04         Availability and use of alternative international  transport
links.  The allocation of Zaire's external trade, particularly to and from
the mining region of Shaba, will greatly affect the traffic in the ports
(para. 1.05).  It is expected that the improvements on the capacity of the
VN, as reflected by a 40% increase in mineral exports on the VN between
1979 and 1981, will continue in the future, and that mineral exports on the
VN will increase from 265,000 tons at present to 350,000 and 400,000 tons
in 1985 and 1990, respectively.   These improvements are in line with the
expected results from the major rehabilitation efforts undertaken in ONATRA
and SNCZ, and supported by current Bank assisted projects.  The same rate
of increase was assumed for import traffic, in view of the development of
containerization.   While the reopening of the Lobito route could somewhat
affect this development, its impact on the VN traffic is likely to be
limited.   Actual  reopening  of this  route  is highly  dependent upon  an
improved political situation in the region and would in any case require
heavy  investments  for  rehabilitation.    In  addition,  only  part  of  its
transport capacity would be available to Zairian traffic; this would be
completely utilized in transporting Zairian manganese exports and traffic
diverted from the more costly southern route.



- 35 -
4.05        Development of container traffic.   The increasing containeriza-
tion of cargo is likely to continue. In addition to the reasons already
mentioned (para 2.11) to explain this trend, two other factors come into
play. First, two of the three main shipping lines serving Matadi are going
to begin operating fully cellular containerships especially designed for
the ports of West Africa, resulting in a greater use of containers in
Zaire's external trade.   Secondly, organizational and procedural problems
which are limiting the return flows (for example, lack of equipment to fill
containers and copper marketing constraints) can be solved relatively
easily in the near future. As a result container traffic through Matadi is
expected to grow an average of about 11% annually between 1980 and 1990.
Although container traffic through Kinshasa Port is expected to grow at the
same pace during this period, the share of containerized traffic would be
less than in Matadi.  The reasons are that the advantages of containeriza-
tion for local traffic are likely to develop more slowly than for interna-
tional traffic given the primitive equipment at most inland locations
(except on the VN), the low cost of manpower, and the security and reliabi-
lity that private transporters offer on high-value shipments.
4.06        The development of the private sector in river transport.   If
this trend continues, it could influence traffic at Kinshasa because pri-
vate river transporters use private quays instead of the public port.  The
impact of this development is, however, likely to be limited.   ONATRA is
doing and can do much to improve its competitive position; the first and
foremost is restructuring tariffs (see para. 2.14).   ONATRA carries much
higher volumes than private carriers and is therefore in a position to use
more  efficient  equipment.   Private  operators' investment  capabilities,
especially in terms of foreign exchange,  are also limited.   Furthermore,
private transporters may have underestimated the maintenance cost of their
equipment and their operating costs are likely to increase as the equipment
ages.   Finally,  there is evidence  that space  is getting limited on the
private quays and, with today's slow handling methods, may not permit large
traffic increases.
4.07       Other government projects.  It has been assumed that a commercial
port at Banana would not be in operation before 1996. The main reasons de-
velopment of such a port should be delayed are (i) Matadi has enough berths
to handle the likely traffic into the mid-1990s; (ii) it is much cheaper to
rehabilitate Matadi port than to build a new one at Banana as well as a
rail link between Banana and Matadi; and (iii) the 8.5 m draft limit is not
a serious constraint because RVM can maintain that depth, which is in fact
similar to that of other West African and some European ports.   It also
appears that the very large funds needed for this undertaking are not
available at the present time.
Traffic Projections
4.08        Matadi port.   Traffic is expected to increase yearly by about
5.2% in the 1980s and 6% thereafter.   This is somewhat high for an economy
which is experiencing difficulties such as Zaire's.   It is mainly due to
the increase in the exports of forestry products and the increased use of
the VN for exports of minerals and imports to Shaba.   Container  traffic
would steadily increase from about one-fourth of total traffic in 1980 to
almost one-half as early as 1990.   Forecasts  for Matadi  port  are shown
below:

4D09       Kinshasa port.  Traffic is expected to increase yearly by about
4% in the 1980s and 3.5% thereafter.   The increase in mineral exports in
the VN is likely to create rapid growth in the mid-1980s  that would slow
down afterward since cement exports to the Congo and CAR will probably de-
crease and forestry products are expected to be shipped in part through the
private ports in Kinshasa.  Container traffic would grow from about 14% of
total traffic in 1980 to about 26% in 1990 and 34% in 1995.  Forecasts for
Kinshasa port are shown below:

B. Economic Returns
Matadi Port
4.10       The implementation of the project will result in significant im-
provements in operational efficiency.   Handling rates per berth are ex-
pected to increase from 1982 averages of about 400 tons/day for general
cargo and logs and 170 units/day for containers to about 500 tons/day and
300 units/day in 1990, respectively. Given the growth of containerization,
service time is expected to decrease by about 25% in 1990; waiting time
should be negligible in 1990 and increase to less than half a day per ship
in 1995.
4.11      If the project were not carried out, the deteriorating condition
of the Fuka-Fuka and Matadi quays and the port's electrical system would
create severe problems.  To keep the port operating, ONATRA would continu-
ally have to carry out emergency repairs from 1984 through 1995 at a cost
of about 40% of the total renewal cost.   Cargo-handling rates would de-
crease by about 5% per year from their 1982 level and one quay would always
be out of use for repair.   By 1995 the quays and the electrical system
would be beyond any repair.   The Port of Matadi would reach an occupation
factor close to 90% as early as 1990.  Average general cargo ship waiting
time would then be about 3 days.  Since only very limited volumes could be
moved by lighterage, traffic would have to be diverted downstream to Boma
and carried by truck to Matadi at an average cost of about 55 Z/ton. Since
capacity is limited at Boma, some export traffic (mainly logs) would have
to be diverted to Brazzaville or, if this alternative is then not possible,
this production would simply have to be foregone.
4.12      The average value of ship-waiting time has been taken at US$8,000
per day, reflecting the mix of general cargo ships calling at Matadi.  It
has been assumed that 50% of the benefits from time savings would be recov-
ered by Zaire in the case of foreign ships and 100% in the case of CMZ ves-
sels which account for about 35% of the general cargo traffic.  To compen-
sate for the overvaluation of the Zairian currency, a standard conversion
factor of .25 has been applied on local inputs.  To allow for the possible
construction of a new deepwater port at Banana, the benefit stream does not
go beyond 1995. The cost and benefit streams would be as follows:

The resulting economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at about 50%,
which shows that the rehabilitation is in fact overdue.  First year return
would be 33%.
Kinshasa Port
4.13          Following  implementation  of  the  project,  the  port  layout and
operations will be reorganized.  Traffic flows will be separated by commo-
dity.  Consequently handling rates per berth are expected  to increase  from
1982 averages of about 95 tons/day for general cargo, 270 tons/day for min-
erals and 180 tons/day for logs to about 165 tons/day, 470 tons/day and 350
tons/day in 1990, respectively. Service time will decrease by about 35% in
1990 and the waiting time per barge will be negligible until 1995.
4.14         As with Matadi, without the  project, ONATRA would  continually
have to carry out emergency repairs on the electrical system at a cost
of about 40% of the total renewal cost spread over 12 years; average pro-
ductivity would decline  by about 5% each year.   Since the present hammer-
head crane and wagon system cannot satisfy the projected demand for con-
tainers, without the project, ONATRA would have to install in 1989 a modern
35 ton crane on the concrete block quay and construct about 3 ha of
stacking areas.  The handling  rate would then be 125 TEU/day on two shift
basis versus rates of 240 TEU/day and 320 TEU/day that can be achieved in
1985 and 1990 respectively with the new container facility provided under
the project.   The congestion  that would  develop  in  the  port would  force
ONATRA to introduce a third (night) shift by 1986. Given the lack of flood
lighting and the problems of management and control, the productivity of
the night shift, on the basis of previous experience, would be only about



- 39 -
25% of  that of the day shifts.   In this case,  average waiting  time per
barge would be over 10 days in 1986 (up from about 5 days in 1982).    By
1990, all cement traffic as well as about 100,000 tons of general cargo
would have to be diverted to the private quays. The congestion would immo-
bilize about 10,000 tons of minerals waiting in barges at a high financing
cost to the Zairan economy.   As the capacity of the port decreases with
falling handling rates, mineral exports would finally start being diverted
to the southern route.   By 1995 all minerals  not  containerized would be
diverted to the southern route at a cost to Zairan economy conservatively
estimated at 100 Z per ton.
4.15        The average value of waiting time for a barge has been taken at
about $165 per day reflecting the opportunity cost of immobilized capital.
The cost of financing the inventory of minerals tied up has been estimated
at 12% in real terms, the stock being valued according to the Bank's pro-
jections for commodity prices. As in the case of Matadi, local inputs have
been multiplied by a 0.25 standard conversion factor.   It has been assumed
that for security reasons the Ex Citas quay would be condemned by 1985.
4.16       Cost and benefit flows are expected to be as follows:

The resulting base ERR for the entire Kinshasa project component is esti-
mated to be about 25%.  First year return is about 20% indicating that the
project is timely.  Since the project is a coherent set of improvements, an
estimation of an ERR specific to the new log and container quays has not
been attempted.

C. Sensitivity Analysis
4q17        The risks associated with this project are not expected to be
greater  than  those  found  in similar  projects.    Even  under  restricted
assumptions concerning costs, implementation schedule, productivity in-
creases, and traffic projections, the project achieves relatively high
rates of return as summarized below:
ERR Matadi   ERR Kinshasa
Base case                             50%           25%
If costs are 15% higher               45%           22%
If project completion is delayed
two years                          49%           23%
Minimum productivity scenario         44%           24%
Minimum traffic scenario              30%           16%
4.18       The two main risks to the estimated rates of return are (i) that
productivity targets would not be achieved, and (ii) that traffic forecasts
would not materialize as anticipated.   Productivity targets are, however,
conservative and have already been achieved for short periods of time.
Their achievement should not be a problem if ONATRA maintains its good
organization and control of operations, which is expected, especially with
additional technical assistance provided under the project and implementa-
tion of the training program under the Modernization Project.  Based on a
minimum productivity scenario, with productivity increases about one third
lower than expected, the ERRs amount to 44% for Matadi and 24%, for Kinsha-
sa, which is satisfactory.
4.19      Traffic forecasts may not materialize as anticipated for a number
of reasons including a further deterioration of economic conditions in the
country and stagnation of traffic on the VN. A conjunction of the two fac-
tors has, however, a relatively low probability since Zaire's economy has
stabilized in the past two years despite extremely low commodity prices,
and the VN enjoys much support from the Government and foreign donors. The
project ERRs associated with more conservative traffic volumes (mineral ex-
ports on the VN limited to 250,000 tons, other traffic virtually stagnant
except for a small growth of forestry products) amount to 30% for Matadi
and 16% for Kinshasa.   The main reason for these satisfactory returns is
that the proposed project is mainly a rehabilitation project whose aim is
to prevent a rapid deterioration of the port facilities and operations, and
which would be necessary even if traffic growth were limited.
4.20      On the basis of the restricted traffic projections, the construc-
tion of new berths to handle container and log traffic in Kinshasa would be
questionable at this time -- particularly since the new berths would be far
from fully utilized even by 1990. However, without the new quays, it would
be very difficult, and increasingly so, for the port to effectively handle
increasing volumes of containers and logs, an important part of traffic and
source of revenue.   In addition, movements of general cargo and minerals
would still be mixed with movement of containers and logs; handling rates
would then remain poor.  Thus, construction of these quays is essential to
the reorganization and new layout of the port.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. History
5.01        ONATRA's operating statements and balance sheets over the last
three years are given in Annex 4; a detailed analysis of ONATRA's financial
situation prior to 1979 was presented in the staff appraisal report
No.3313ZR on the ONATRA Modernization Project (Cr. 1180-ZR).   Starting in
1977, when the Government implemented a complete recovery program and
appointed a new management team, ONATRA has been able to produce positive
operating results before depreciation in each year; it achieved a 70%
working ratio during the last two years and was able to produce positive
results before interest charges in 1981.  This is a remarkable achievement
considering the deteriorating national economy during the period under
review.
5.02            The net operating losses incurred by ONATRA in 1979 and 1980
are a direct result of a change in ONATRA's depreciation policy; in 1979,
ONATRA revalued its fixed assets based on replacement values; this resulted
in an increase in its depreciation allowances.   Although tariff increases
were often granted after long delays, they were in general sufficient to
offset the cost increases due to inflation and devaluations and to progres-
sively cover the increase in depreciation allowances due to reevaluation of
ONATRA's assets. ONATRA's change in depreciation policy and the correspon-
ding tariff increases reestablished a strong cash position; this served as
a financial buffer against subsequent delays in tariff adjustments and
allowed ONATRA to start a large and much needed rehabilitation program of
its facilities and equipment in 1980.
5.03       ONATRA's financial recovery needs to be measured against a back-
ground of high inflation rates and large devaluation of the Zaire's curren-
cy (see table below). Until 1980, efforts were aimed at reducing operating
expenses; excess personnel was laid off, salaries kept at a minimum, and
controls tightened on procurement of materials and consumption of fuel.

There are, however, signs that some of these measures may now have reached
their maximum potential, and that new approaches are needed.   During the
last two years, operating costs per ton increased more rapidly than the
general cost of living in the country, in part because of readjustments in



- 42 -
the price of fuel and because salaries were increased substantially in 1981
and 1982 after a long period of declining in real terms.   Tariffs, which
have quadrupled since 1979, have reached a level where transport costs ham-
per export activities, especially at a time of declining world demand and
decreasing world prices. Since transport tariffs in ONATRA reflect overall
transport costs, the transport sector has become one of the few profitable
sectors in Zaire and therefore one of the few where private investment has
been taking place.   As a result,  competition from private operators has
been increasing, progressively eroding ONATRA's share of the transport mar-
ket, particularly on the lucrative Kinshasa-Matadi corridor and on river
transport (paras. 2.12-2.14). To meet the competition, ONATRA's management
must soon shift its focus from recovery and control towards a more agres-
sive marketing approach, better services, more detailed analysis of the
cost structure of specific services and productivity increases.
5.04        ONATRA's current liquidity situation and debt/equity ratio are
adequate. Although it has not seriously affected ONATRA's financial situa-
tion, a continuing problem has been the long delays in payments by the
Government and its agencies for ONATRA's services.   ONATRA reached a com-
pensation agreement with the Government on all past arrears in October
1979.   Since  then,  however,  Government  arrears  have again accumulated,
amounting to about Z30 million as of December 31, 1981.   During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached with the Government and ONATRA that current
bills will be settled within 90 days of billing in the future.  Payment by
the Government of its past arrears is included in its FY83 budget; past
arrears will be repaid in equal monthly installments over a 12-month
period.
Tariffs
5.05        ONATRA's tariff structure is complex and obsolete; in addition,
the recent increases granted have not been uniform and have further dis-
torted the relation between the cost of the services and tariffs.  There is
a large amount of cross-subsidization among ONATRA's operating departments
and among the goods transported. Consultants are being recruited to set up
a cost accounting system at ONATRA and to revise its tariff structure; this
should be completed by December 1983.  In the meantime, ONATRA has carried
out a cost analysis of copper and mineral movements since tariffs for cop-
per increased at only half the rate of other goods.  The study shows that
tariffs for copper cover less than 25% of the total transport costs, which
results in a significant subsidy of Gecamines by ONATRA's other clients.
Copper accounts for about 30% of ONATRA's traffic but contributes only
about 10% of revenues.   This may explain in part the increase in competi-
tion for general cargo. Based on preliminary studies, the tariff increase
needed should amount to at least 50%. A condition for credit effectiveness
will be that transport tariffs for minerals be increased to cover at least
their variable costs.
5.06        ONATRA should have some flexibility in the setting of tariffs,
once the costing system is implemented, between the minimum tariffs needed
to at least cover the variable costs of services and the overall revenues
needed to cover operating expenses. In addition, the costing system should
provide the necessary information to enable ONATRA to substantially reduce
the costs of some services.   An increase in copper tariffs will, for in-
stance, permit a reduction of tariffs on other goods.



- 43 -
5.07       Final decision on tariff adjustment rests with a subcommittee of
the Minister's council (Comite de Conjoncture) in charge of supervising the
general anti-inflation program in the country.   The Government  recently
decided to reactivate a Transport Commission composed of representatives of
all ministries involved in the tariff review process.  It is, however, too
soon to assess its impact since so far, this Commission has met only irreg-
ularly; although tariffs have generally increased in step with inflation,
not much progress was noticed in the procedure for approving tariffs, which
is still time consuming.   During negotiations of the ONATRA Modernization
Project, the Government agreed that tariff adjustments requested by ONATRA
will be made within a three-month period from reception of a tariff adjust-
ment request, after which the request will be deemed approved if no action
by the Government has been taken. While this framework should be adequate
to ensure sufficient revenues to the transport organizations, the Transport
Commission will need to progressively set up adequate tariff procedures to
(i) ensure consistency of tariffs among the major transport organizations;
(ii) link more closely tariff increases to inflation to avoid large tariff
increases; and (iii) provide some flexibility to set up specific tariffs to
the transport organizations.
B. Financial Projections
Assumptions
5.08      Meaningful forecasts are difficult to prepare in Zaire because of
the uncertainty surrounding the rate of inflation, the extent and timing of
future devaluations, and other policy changes the Government might make to
correct macroeconomic problems.  Uncertainty also exists within ONATRA on
the effects of the ongoing reorganization of its accounting procedures and
of the recommended policy changes on its assets and tariff structure.   In
this context, the main purpose of the projections is to provide a basis for
sufficiently flexible financial measures to safeguard ONATRA's financial
position in the future.
5.09        The financial projections prepared in the ONATRA Modernization
Project focused on a sensitivity analysis of (i) the effects of price in-
creases and devaluations of some magnitude on ONATRA's finances, and (ii)
the financial capacity of ONATRA to implement a large investment program.
While the actual financial results in 1981 and 1982 are expected to vary
somewhat from the projections, the main conclusions of the projections were
achieved.    ONATRA's  financial  structure  continued  to improve;  its cash
position has strengthened, enabling it to start a much needed rehabilita-
tion program; and although a large (65%) devaluation occurred in 1981, this
was compensated overall by a tariff increase of 80% for general cargo and
40% for copper.   ONATRA's cash reserves served as a buffer to offset the
three-month delay between the devaluation and the tariff increase.   Thus,
in general, the framework of financial measures agreed upon during negotia-
tions of that project proved satisfactory (para. 5.16-5.19).
5.10        The projections presented in this chapter are complementary to
the previous projections.   In addition to some changes in assumptions to
reflect new events, ONATRA's investment program has been reduced in rela-
tion to its implementation capacity, mainly constrained by its limited ac-
cess to foreign exchange.  In the projections, it was assumed that the IDA



- 44 -
credit would be onlent by the Government to ONATRA at 15% interest, payable
in 10 years after 4 years grace period, and that ONATRA would take the for-
eign exchange  risk.   The proposed  interest  rate of  15% is  that which
SOFIDE, Zaire's development bank, would be charging its borrowers.   Al-
though inflation in Zaire averaged 50% in 1980 and 1981, the proposed
interest rate is positive in real terms because ONATRA would take the for-
eign exchange risk.  A relatively short repayment period is proposed be-
cause of ONATRA's strong cash position and low debt service ratio (paras.
5.12 and 5.13).   The signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and ONATRA satisfactory to IDA is a condition of credit effec-
tiveness.
5.11      The major assumptions underlying the financial projections are as
follows:
(a) The projections are based on the traffic forecasts detailed
in Chapter IV and are in current terms.   The same rate of
inflation of 8% was considered for both local and foreign
costs since it is expected that any significant divergence
between foreign and local costs will be compensated by de-
valuations of the Zaire currency.   A devaluation of 50% of
the Zaire currency was applied as of January 1, 1983.
(b) Expenditures are generally expected to increase in step with
traffic,  inflation, and devaluation.   Salaries do not in-
crease in step with traffic on the grounds that ONATRA's
personnel has reached a reasonable level and that producti-
vity increases are expected in the future.  They are, how-
ever, expected to increase in step with inflation, because
ONATRA's salary structure must stay competitive with the
private market; salaries are also already very low in real
terms.   Fuel-related expenses have been increased by 50%
over the 1982/83 period in view of a possible increase in
diesel prices2/, in addition to the increase needed to off-
set the devaliuation and inflation.
(c) It was assumed that tariff increases will be granted to com-
pensate for inflation and devaluation.  In the projections,
the additional revenues required are just sufficient to cov-
er working expenses, depreciation and interest as required
by the agreements under the ONATRA Modernization Project.
(d) Fixed assets and depreciation allowances are based on cur-
rent values.  The projections take into account the remain-
ing life of the existing assets and new additions in rela-
tion to ONATRA's investment program.
2/   Although, overall, the Government is not subsidizing fuel products, it
has followed a policy of cross-subsidization of diesel fuel by
gasoline.   The Government is reviewing its fuel policy as required
under the Fifth Highway Project.



- 45 -
(e) Only part of ONATRA's investment program was taken into ac-
count, considering its past achievements and existing finan-
cing possibilities.  The investments include the Moderniza-
tion Project (Cr. 1180-ZR), the proposed project, some pro-
curement of equipment with foreign exchange, and some civil
works in local currency.
(f) Additional long-term borrowings to finance the foreign ex-
change portion of the investment program were included in
the projections. The projections also include the cofinanc-
ing arrangements for the proposed project (AfDB: US$21 mil-
lion, 11.5% interest, 4 years grace period, repayment over
15 years; CCCE:   US$5 million, 10% interest, 5 years grace
period, repayment over 15 years; and IDA:  see para. 5.10).
In the last year of implementation (1986), most investments
requiring foreign exchange were assumed to be met directly
from ONATRA's internally generated funds on the grounds that
ONATRA would have access to foreign exchange by that time.
Results and Comments
5.12       The projections are summarized in Annex 5.  They indicate that
the present tariffs should be sufficient to produce a positive net income
in 1982.  Tariff increases will, however, be needed thereafter to compen-
sate for devaluation and inflation; revenues would have to be increased by
about 40% in 1983 to compensate for the projected devaluation in that
year. ONATRA would generate a cash surplus in each year as long as tariffs
are adjusted to cover at least all working expenses and depreciation allow-
ances.  Under this assumption, all other financial ratios are also satis-
factory.   The high debt equity ratio indicates  that ONATRA's borrowing
capacity is strong.  The low debt service ratio is partly due to the rela-
tively soft terms associated with existing loans; also, most of ONATRA's
debt is associated with its recent investment efforts and is relatively
new; the debt service is expected to increase somewhat when the grace peri-
od on repayment expires in about four to five years' time. The low rate of
return on revalued fixed assets comes in part from the assumption that
revenues would just be sufficient to cover expenditures; in addition,
ONATRA's assets include a large amount of social and housing infrastruc-
ture.   The value of ONATRA's assets is also expected to decrease in the
future in relation to the proposed introduction of a Condemnation Board and
appropriate condemnation policies (para. 2.17).
5.13        ONATRA owes its strong cash position to the fact that deprecia-
tion allowances alone are sufficient to cover all local and part of the
foreign exchange costs of ONATRA's investment program, service the debt and
provide for working capital additions.   Its borrowing needs result mainly
from the limitations on its ability to convert local currency into foreign
exchange due to government regulations on foreign exchange allocation.
This is illustrated by the positive cash flow statement in 1986 when it was
assumed that almost all investment needs, including foreign exchange expen-
ditures, would be met by internally generated funds.    In view of these
facts, the Government and ONATRA indicated that they would consider includ-
ing a prepayment clause on the reimbursement of the proposed IDA credit in
the subsidiary loan agreement.



- 46 -
Risks
5.14        The main financial risks affecting these projections relate to
devaluation and inflation and to delays between a devaluation and Govern-
ment approval of tariff adjustments to offset the devaluations's effects.
Although a devaluation would seriously affect ONATRA's finances by in-
creasing its outflow of funds both for operating expenditures and debt ser-
vice, it would also require a revaluation of its depreciation allowances
thus increasing its inflow of funds if a sufficient tariff increase were
granted to compensate for devaluation and/or inflation.
5.15      In the projections, ONATRA's cash surplus rapidly increases to a
level sufficient to cover more than three months operating expenses.  This
level is, however, very sensitive to (i) any delay in tariff adjustments;
(ii) ONATRA's actual capacity to implement its investment program, and the
possibility of financing a greater portion of local costs by substituting
locally produced goods for those produced abroad; and (iii) any relaxation
of the present policies restricting foreign exchange operations.  In addi-
tion, the cash build-up will also be influenced by the proposed policy
changes on ONATRA's tariff structure and on ONATRA's depreciation policy.
Financial Covenants
5.16       The projections indicate that all the financial covenants agreed
to during negotiations of Cr 1180-ZR constitute a valid financial framework
in Zaire. These are summarized below and were confirmed during negotiation
of the proposed credit.
5.17        The Project Agreement on Credit 1180-ZR provides that ONATRA's
revenues be sufficient to (i) meet its total operating expenses, including
depreciation provisions based on replacement values and interest; (ii)
generate sufficient funds to meet debt amortization requirements, maintain
adequate working capital and to make a reasonable contribution towards its
investment needs; and (iii) with respect of each service to meet at least
the variable cost of each service from the revenues of the service.   It
also provides that decisions regarding tariff adjustments requested by
ONATRA will be made within three months, after which the request will be
deemed approved if no action has been taken.
5.18       In view of ONATRA's need for foreign exchange to purchase spare
parts and materials, the Government will provide ONATRA with sufficient
foreign exchange to cover its spare parts and other operational require-
ments. To prevent possible delays due to temporary shortfalls at the Bank
of Zaire, it was agreed that ONATRA will be allowed to retain at a minimum
its revenues in foreign exchange from port operations ("stevedoring
revenues") and other revenues in foreign exchange in order to meet its
operating requirements.
5.19       ONATRA should also maintain a reasonable relationship between its
operating surplus and debt service requirements.   Unless otherwise agreed
with the Bank, ONATRA will not incur any additional debt if its operating
surplus for the year or the twelve consecutive months immediately before
the date of occurrence, whichever is greater, is less than 1.5 times the
maximum debt service requirements of any succeeding fiscal year.



- 47 -
Long-term Financial Objectives
5.20       The strengthening of ONATRA's financial structure is a long pro-
cess which needs to be approached progressively.  The ONATRA Modernization
Project aimed at strengthening ONATRA's financial management and accounting
procedures and at setting up a flexible financial framework.  The proposed
project focuses mainly on improving ONATRA's commercial procedures and tar-
iff structure and on setting up appropriate policies to dispose of overaged
and unnecessary assets.   The long-term objective of these measures is to
progressively foster complete management autonomy based on appropriate com-
mercial procedures, tariff flexibility and eventual payment of dividend
based on a positive return on fixed assets.
5.21       While the present economic conditions in Zaire (more particular-
ly, the price distortions among the various economic sectors and ONATRA's
satisfactory cash position in the absence of a positive income) would make
it difficult to justify payment of a dividend to the Government in the
short to medium term, the distribution of such a dividend should neverthe-
less consititute a long-term financial objective of ONATRA. This objective
will become clearer when appropriate commercial and condemnation policies
and tariff revision procedures, all provided for in the project, are intro-
duced.  In the meantime, increased revenues from transport operations will
be made  available  to the Government  through the difference  between the
financing terms of the Credit and those of the onlending agreements on the
proceeds of the credit (para. 5.10).
5.22       In addition, ONATRA and the Government should study an appropri-
ate rental fee for the use of the public ports of Matadi and Kinshasa,
since all the infrastructure (mainly the land and the quays) belongs to the
Government and are not incorporated in ONATRA's assets (para. 2.05).  Al-
though the project provides for the construction of a new quay at Kinshasa,
it was agreed during negotiations that pending an agreement on an overall
rental fee, the onlending agreement between the Government and ONATRA will
cover all the proceeds of the credit with only the exception of the studies
carried out for the Government.
C. Financial Rates of Return
5.23          Separate financial rates of return were calculated for both
Matadi and Kinshasa ports, on the same basis as the economic analysis.
5.24       In Matadi, the major benefits to ONATRA arise from four factors:
(i) the difference in operating costs per ton expected to result
from the productivity improvements brought about by the pro-
ject; only half of such benefits were taken into account
since it is expected that they will take time to materialize
in substantial cost reductions;
(ii) the avoided loss of revenues which would arise from a reduc-
tion or a diversion of exports if the project were not im-
plemented; while at first the limited capacity at Matadi
would divert traffic to Boma (which would not constitute a
loss of revenues to ONATRA), the port capacity of Boma is



- 48 -
limited and traffic would have to be diverted to either the
Congo or the southern route;
(iii)  the avoided emergency investments to the electrical network
and quays which would in any case be needed to maintain the
port capacity were the project not implemented; and
(iv)  the avoided investments in railway wagons due  to. the im-
provement in turnaround times that the modification of the
track network and the change in handling methods will allow.
On the basis of these benefits, the financial return on the project amounts
to at least 22%, which is satisfactory.   The major difference  from the
economic rate of return comes from the fact that no benefits were consi-
dered to arise to ONATRA from the reduction in ship-waiting and service
times; such benefits could, however, be partly recuperated by ONATRA
through appropriate tariff increases.
5.25       The project would provide the same kinds of benefits in Kinshasa
as in Matadi.  The benefits from cost reductions and avoided loss of reve-
nues are relatively higher than in Matadi due to the fact the Kinshasa port
is already congested, a third shift would have to be organized by 1985 to
avoid a major diversion of traffic, and any traffic diversion would immedi-
ately result in a loss of revenues to ONATRA.  The resulting financial re-
turn of 20% is also satisfactory.  This return is very close to the econo-
mic rate of return since in Kinshasa any reduction in the service and
waiting time of the barges would directly result in an avoided cost to
ONATRA, since all the barges berthing at the port belong to ONATRA.

Bank Group Projects in the Transport Sector
1.   First Highway Project (Credit 152-CK, US$6 million, 1969) assisted the
Government in preparing a program to improve the highway administration and
in executing emergency maintenance and rehabilitation. The Project cost of
US$9.6 million was financed by IDA, UNDP (US$1.6 million) and the
Government  (US$2 million).    The  credit  financed  technical  assistance,
procurement of equipment, spare parts and tools, and some maintenance and
rehabilitation work. The project was instrumental in the creation of OR as
an autonomous agency.  The project was completed in 1976, four years after
the planned closing date.
2.    River Transportation Project I (Credit 255-ZR,  US$7 million,  1971)
included the rehabilitation of navigational aids, dredging facilities and
equipment for the Zaire River estuary; improvement of navigating conditions
on the Kinshasa-Ilebo river connection; rehabilitation of ONATRA's river
fleet; a study of alternative investments to increase the capacity of the
VN;  and  technical  experts  for  the  river  agencies.    The  project  was
completed in 1982.
3.   Second Highway Project (Credit 292-CK, US$19 million, 1972) had as its
goal to help the Government to set up and strengthen OR, train local staff
and to rehabilitate about 1,900 km of roads.  The project cost, originally
estimated at US$46.4 million and later increased to US$53.7 million, was
co-financed by UNDP (US$2.2 million), USAID (US$4 million), CIDA (US$4
million), FAC (US$1 million) and the Government (US$17.7 million). The IDA
credit financed technical assistance to OR and rehabilitation.  Only about
1,000 k   of roads were rehabilitated to planned standards, 600 km were
rehabilitated to lower standards and the remaining 300 km were deleted from
the project. Completion was in 1979, five years after the original closing
date.
4.   Third Highway Project (Credit 536-ZR, US$26 million, 1975) continued
the   strengthening   of   OR,   developing   local   expertise   in  highway
administration and rehabilitating paved roads (600 km).  It also included
implementation of two pilot maintenance schemes in the regions of Bas Zaire
and Bandundu.   The project cost, originally estimated at US$40.3 million,
was  later  increased  to US$42.2 million.   The  IDA credit  financed  (i)
procurement of equipment, tools and spare parts, (ii) road rehabilitation
including supervision, (iii) construction of workshops, (iv) technical
assistance and (v) feasibility studies for future road construction.
Because  of  Zaire's  financial   crisis,   the  road  rehabilitation  and
feasibility studies components were reduced in order to buy essential
materials such as fuel for road maintenance and to introduce a ferry
maintenance program.  The project was completed in 1980, two years behind
schedule.
5.,     River  and  Railway  Transportation  Project  (Credit  571-ZR,  US$26
million, 1975) comprised (i) technical assistance to ONATRA including a

Page 2 of 2
comprehensive training program; (ii) financing of a major part of ONATRA's
1975-77 investment requirements for river transport equipment, railway
improvements and track renewal, (iii) additional river markings on the
Kinshasa-Ilebo waterway, (iv) port studies, and (v) preliminary engineering
study for the Ilebo-Kinshasa rail link. The closing date of the project is
scheduled for December 31, 1982.
6.    SNCZ Railway Project  (Credit 902-ZR, US$20 million,  1979) supports
SNCZ's 1979-82 investment program and includes track rehabilitation,
equipment  and  operational  investments  to  increase  SNCZ's  effective
capacity.   The project finances:  (i) renewal and upgrading of 210 km of
track and ballasting another 285 km, (ii) 100 ore wagons, 9 shunting
locomotives and 12 passenger coaches, (iii) spare parts for locomotives and
wagons, (iv) expansion of Ilebo port facilities, (vi) social infrastructure
and (vii) middle/senior level technical and management staff training and
consultant services.  This project is undergoing numerous difficulties as
explained in Chapter I.
7.    Fourth Highway Project (Credit 916-ZR, US$26 million, 1979) finances
two and a half years of OR's three year (1980-82) road maintenance and
rehabilitation  program.       It  consists  of  (i)  routine  and  periodic
maintenance of 40,900 km of national and priority regional roads, including
construction and equipping warehouses, procurement of equipment, spare
parts and fuel; (ii) rehabilitation and strengthening of about 400 km of
paved roads; (iii) repair and maintenance of ferries; (iv) strengthening or
replacement of about 25 bridges; (v) equipment for the National Public
Works Laboratory; and (vi) technical assistance to OR.  Project completion
is expected by December 1982.
8.    ONATRA Modernization Project (Credit 1180-ZR, US$26 million,  1982)
comprises elements from ONATRA's five-year investment program.   The main
components are railway: renewal of 65 km of track, 100 wagons and brake
conversion kits for railway wagons; river transport: 12 pusher tugs, 28
barges, shipyard equipment and a shipyard study; and technical assistance
and training.
9.   Fifth Highway Project (US$43.5 million, not yet effective) covers OR's
1983-85 work program, taking over where the previous project leaves off.
Project components comprise (i) continuation of the country-wide road
maintenance/rehabilitation program, including procurement of equipment,
spare parts, fuel and lubricants, materials and radio equipment, and
technical assistance; (ii) resurfacing and strengthening about 165 km of
paved raods; (iii) replacement of ferries and construction of ferry
approaches;   (iv)  reconstruction  and  reinforcement   of  bridges;   (v)
procurement of equipment for National Public Works Laboratory; and (vi)
studies.
