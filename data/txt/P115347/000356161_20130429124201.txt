Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The long-term development objective (PDO) of this Adaptable Program Lending is to
improve the quality of education as measured by coverage, social participation, and
educational outcomes. Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II
(the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social participation
in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on
the Indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the School Grants to improve
public schools’ internal efficiency and learning outcomes.

A.       SUMMARY

1.       The proposed changes and rationale are as follows:

        Components. Dropping Component 3 Policy Development and Evaluation of the
         Project since most activities are not critical to the achievement of the Project
         Development Objective and have been financed outside of the Project using
         CNPEC’s own resources. Retaining only the planned impact evaluation and
         qualitative evaluation originally under subcomponent 3.1 and moving them to
         Component 2. Component 2 is also being revised to explicitly include: the
         provision of technical assistance to the States to improve their prioritization of
         Indigenous schools and schools in marginalized areas and monitor their adherence
         to the PEC operating rules; the dissemination of the simplified school planning
         instrument; and the carrying out of a monitoring and evaluation survey to collect
         data from community members on the strategic school-based management model
         in PEC schools.

        Results/indicators. Adjustment in the Results Matrix to revise a number of PDO
         indicators in order to ensure the full measurement of the achievement of the PDO,
         as well as to revise a number of intermediate outcome indicators so as to more
         precisely measure Project results for Component 1 “School Grants? and
         Component 2 “Monitoring and Oversight.?

        Reallocation of the Loan Proceeds. Reallocation of part of the Project funds
         from Categories 2 (Operation Costs) and 3 (Consultant Services) to Category 1
         (Goods, Works and Consultants’ Services financed under School Grants) in order
         to increase the number of beneficiary schools.

        Closing Date/implementation schedule. Extension of the Closing Date by one
         year, to June 30, 2014, largely to make up for the delay in signing the Loan
         Agreement and declaring effectiveness, as well as to extend the period of
         disbursement of school grants to the 2013-14 school year, and to allow for a
         second round of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) survey and the carrying
         out of the impact evaluation, which is expected to be completed in June 2014.

     B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The School-Based Management Project, Phase II (the second phase of an
expected three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL)), was approved by the Board on
June 17, 2010 and declared effective on December 20, 2010. It finances the Government
of Mexico's largest school autonomy program, Programa Escuelas de Calidad (PEC),
which was established in 2001 to introduce school autonomy and improve local
participation in education. It has three components: (1) School grants to eligible schools
to support the implementation of school improvement plans, (2) Monitoring and
oversight, including update of PEC information systems and Project oversight; and (3)
Policy development and evaluation, including an impact evaluation.

3.      PEC remains the Bank's main conduit into the large basic education system in
Mexico, and overall, the Project is advancing satisfactorily and either achieving or
surpassing its objectives in terms of both coverage and equity. Currently, 22 percent of
public schools are in PEC, meeting the 2012 target, and up from 18 percent in 2009. PEC
has increasingly focused on schools in marginalized areas, which now account for 64
percent of all PEC schools, compared with targets of 50 and 55 percent for 2012 and
2013, respectively. Eighteen percent of PEC schools serve the Indigenous population, just
short of the 18.3 percent target for 2012.With regards to the social participation objective,
the percentage of community members that participate in the design of the PETE was
74.2 percent according to the 2009 survey. Progress against this indicator is being
assessed based on the December 2012 M&E survey. In terms of the reorientation of
School Grants objective, the proportion of School Grants spent on education quality
inputs accounted for 70.7 percent of expenditures in 2011, up from 59.7 percent in 2009.
Alongside this, and although an objective only of the planned Phase III of the APL,
learning outcomes themselves have improved, with average test scores in Math and
Spanish rising consistently in both primary and secondary PEC schools between 2009
and 2011 (with the exception of Spanish test scores among PEC secondary schools,
which fell between 2009 and 2010 - possibly due to the incorporation of marginalized
and Indigenous schools in which this outcome tends to be lower - but rose again by
2011). Similarly, internal efficiency, another objective of the planned Phase III of the
APL has improved slightly, with the average pass rate in PEC schools increasing from
97.48 percent in 2009 to 98.04 percent in 2011 in primary schools, and from 82.65
percent in 2009 to 82.84 percent in 2011 in secondary schools.

4.      Project status by Component is as follows:

     a. Component 1: School Grants. While Project implementation at the school level
        is proceeding largely as planned, the main bottleneck has been to the
        disbursement of transfers to schools to finance the implementation of school
        improvement plans. Because schools accumulate expenditure receipts throughout
        the school year, schools are generally not able to submit expense reports proving
        the total of these expenditures until the end of the school year (August - July).
        Since the Project had anticipated that schools would submit receipts throughout
        the year, disbursement has been slower than expected. The PEC National
        Coordination (Coordinación Nacional del Programa Escuelas de Calidad –
                                             2
        CNPEC) has made great efforts to reduce the time taken for schools to present
        proof of their expenditures, modifying the Operating Rules of Phase XII1 of the
        Program to speed up the time of approval. PEC Operating Rules were also
        changed during Project preparation in 2009 to include a reorientation of School
        Grants towards education quality inputs, as well as to prioritize schools in
        localities with an Indigenous population and in highly and very highly
        marginalized areas, respectively. Nine criteria were established within the
        Operating Rules which guide the focus on such schools. These were shared with
        the PEC General State Coordinations (Coordinaciones Generales Estatales del
        PEC – CGEPECs) by the CNPEC along with technical assistance on how to
        operationalize this focus, as well as a ‘priorities map’ which highlights localities
        with Indigenous population.

    b. Component 2: Monitoring and Oversight. PEC has worked to create a strong
       financial management and information monitoring system. The CNPEC has been
       developing an information system for online collaboration which brings together
       the main modules of PEC’s new National Management Information System2.Its
       launch has been delayed until a server with sufficient capacity to ensure the
       technical operation of the system is acquired. The Program’s information
       campaign has been growing over the past 2 years and in 2012 included: 1)
       EDUCARE magazine; 2) 6 PEC volumes which are being delivered to all schools
       in PEC;3 3) bulletins and informative notes; 4) Webinar platform; and 5) “Barra
       de Verano? television series. Due to the change in administration of the CNPEC
       in December 2012, the dissemination campaign for the remainder of the 2012-13
       school year has been altered to focus on the design and delivery of SBM
       brochures and the renovation of the PEC website. In addition, the CNPEC
       continues to organize annual or semi-annual national and regional meetings first

1
  PEC operates in Phases according to academic years, but includes several months on either side of the
academic year for official preparatory and closure activities. PEC Phase I began in 2001. Phase XII is the
current Phase of the Program, which officially started in December 2011 (when PEC’s 2012 Operating
Rules were published) and will end in December 2013. The delivery of school grants corresponding to PEC
Phase XII will be for school year 2012 -2013 (from August 2012 until July 2013).
2
  There are 3 different channels through which schools can report information through an MIS to their PEC
General State Coordination (Coordinación General Estatal del PEC - CGEPEC): 1) PEC’s own
Information System (Sistema de Información del Programa Escuelas de Calidad - SIPEC), 2) an -pre-
certified MIS (any state management information system for which its methodologies and systems have
been verified), and 3) direct report (Pdf, Word, or Excel file) given to PEC Regional Coordinators
(officially called “Origen y Aplicación? by the CNPEC). The CGEPECs are then responsible for delive ring
all information collected through these 3 channels to the CNPEC, which then uploads all the information
received to its National Management Information System (NMIS). However, the current NMIS is being
revised by the new administration and is expected to be subsumed by a new NMIS designed to gather
information on all education programs, the construction of which is planned under the new Government’s
education reform of Article 3.
3
   The 6 PEC volumes are: Volume I: Strategic School-Based Management Model; Volume II: Simplified
PETE – Recommendations for the elaboration of the School Transformation Strategic Plan (PETE – Plan
Estratégico de Transformación Escolar); Volume III: Management Standards for Basic Education; Volume
IV: Orientation/Guidance to Activate Social Participation in Basic Education Schools; Volume V:
Management Model for School Supervision; Volume VI: Guide to facilitate the inclusion of impaired
students in schools participating in PEC.

                                                    3
         started in 2008-2009 to disseminate information on PEC and attended by PEC’s
         federal and state authorities.

    c. Component 3: Policy Development and Evaluation. PEC is committed to
       developing and supporting policy research and evaluation. To this end, external
       evaluations of PEC are carried out annually by the Consejo Nacional de
       Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social (CONEVAL). Similarly, analyses
       of student learning achievement assessments using national education standards in
       the form of the ENLACE test are conducted every academic year for Secretariat
       of Public Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública - SEP) internal purposes.
       In addition, the CNPEC has carried out studies on improving the coordination of
       PEC with other SEP programs as well as on improving the equity and efficiency
       of PEC. While these activities have furthered the objective of policy development
       and evaluation, they have been financed outside of the Project and are not critical
       to the Project itself, leading to the decision to drop Component 3. The impact
       evaluation is pending, with a baseline having been established in 2008 through a
       study financed by the School-Based Management Project Phase I (P088728, Loan
       7347-MX).


    C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Component 2: Monitoring and Oversight

5.      The Component is being revised to clarify in subcomponent 2.2 that the technical
assistance provided by CNPEC to the States aims to improve their prioritization of
Indigenous schools4 and schools in marginalized areas5, consistent with the Project’s
Objective; and to monitor their adherence to PEC’s Operating Rules. The activities
carried out under the umbrella of CNPEC’s technical assistance include supervision
visits, national and regional meetings, training and workshops, intended to support
CGEPECs’ understanding of the operating, financial and academic implementation of the
Program, including the fulfillment of PEC’s Operating Rules, PEC’s academic model,
and accountability processes. The Component will further be revised to include in
subcomponent 2.3 the dissemination of the simplified school planning instrument (known
as PETE until school year 2012-13), which is critical to its use in marginalized and
Indigenous areas and to encourage greater social participation. The simplified school
planning instrument is a manual containing a series of recommendations intended to
make the school planning process clearer, easier and more efficient for schools; its
dissemination is carried out through its publication as one of the collection of six PEC

   Indigenous schools are defined as Indigenous modality schools and are those categorized by
bilingualism/biculturalism: schools in which at least one Indigenous language is taught and elements of
Indigenous culture are immersed in the school’s activities. The schools are not necessarily attended in
majority by students with an Indigenous background (OECD Review of Evaluation and Assessment in
Education: Mexico 2012).
5
  Schools in marginalized areas are those located in highly and very highly marginalized localities or Basic
Geo-Statistical Areas (AGEBs – ?reas Geo-Estadísticas Básicas) according to an index provided in 2005
by the National Population Council (CONAPO – Consejo Nacional de Población).

volumes. The M&E survey to collect data on social participation for the Results Matrix is
also being explicitly included in Component 2 with the 2013 survey to be financed under
the Project. In addition, the impact evaluation and qualitative evaluation of PEC, which
are the only activities under Component 3 Policy Development and Evaluation that are
critical to the Project, are being moved to this Component.

Component 3: Policy Development and Evaluation

6.      After moving the impact evaluation and the qualitative evaluation under
subcomponent 3.1 to Component 2, Component 3 is being dropped from the Project as
part of Restructuring since it is not critical to the achievement of the PDO and all the
remaining activities are not critical to the achievement of the PDO and/or have been
financed outside of the Project using CNPEC’s own resources.

Results/indicators

7.      The Results Matrix is being adjusted to revise a number of PDO indicators in
order to ensure the full measurement of the achievement of the PDO, as well as to revise
a number of intermediate outcome indicators so as to more precisely measure Project
results for Component 1 “School Grants? and Component 2 “Monitoring and Oversight?
(see Annex 1 for the revised Results Matrix).

8.      Three of the five original Project Development Outcome indicators for this
second Phase of the APL are being revised, one dropped due to repetition, and one
additional PDO indicator created. The total number of PDO indicators continues to be
five. In addition to revisions to the baseline values for PDO Indicators One and Three in
light of final data, targets for 2013 have been created for all PDO Indicators, to reflect the
longer implementation period. See Table 1 for details on the changes and their rationale.

 CONAPO’s marginalization index is constructed as a composite indicator of the following eight
socioeconomic indicators:1) percentage of population aged 15 or more that is illiterate; 2) percentage of
population aged 15 years or more without complete primary education; 3) percentage of private homes
without drainage or toilet; 4) percentage of private homes without power; 5) percentage of private homes
without running water inside the house; 6) percentage of private homes with some level of overcrowding;
7) percentage of private homes with dirt floors; 8) percentage of private homes without a refrigerator.
When ranked in order of the marginalization index, those localities in the highest two – of five –
subintervals are defined by CONAPO as having ‘very high’ and ‘high’ grades of marginalization, with the
localities in the remaining subintervals representing ‘medium’, ‘low’, and ‘very low’, grades of
marginalization, in decreasing order of marginalization index.

9.      The Results Matrix has also been changed in order to preview an additional future
PDO indicator, “pass rate?, which will measure internal efficiency during Phase III of the
Program. It is defined as the number of students that pass a given school year as a
percentage of the total number of students enrolled at the beginning of the same school
year. It captures the school’s capacity to ensure enrolled students do not dropout, and
pass that school year. The indicator is constructed using data from Mexico’s education
census (Estadística 911), collected by the SEP on a twice yearly basis: at the beginning
and end of each school year. As indicated in the PAD, the Government committed to
begin tracking both the internal efficiency and learning outcomes of the Program during
Phase II of the APL in anticipation of improving results in these areas by Phase III. In
light of this, the measurement of these two indicators to date is presented in Table 2
below.

10.    Two of the original seven Intermediate Results Indicators have been revised, one
dropped due to repetition with a PDO indicator, and three added in order to ensure that all
key activities critical to the achievement of the PDO are measured. The total number of
Intermediate Results Indicators with the restructuring is nine. See Table 3 for details on
the changes and rationale. In addition to the specific revisions to certain Indicator targets
described in the ‘Comments’ section for each indicator below, targets for 2013 have been
created for all Intermediate Results Indicators to reflect the longer implementation period.

Financing

11.     Reallocation. The categories of items financed by the Project have been revised.
Part of the Project funds under Categories 2 (Operation Costs) and 3 (Consultant
Services) will be reallocated to Category 1 (Goods, Works and Consultants’ Services
financed under School Grants) in order to increase the number of beneficiary schools, as
well as because Component 3 (Policy Development and Evaluation) which Category 3
currently finances, is being dropped from the Project. The Government is using
counterpart funds instead of loan funds to finance some operating costs, which enable a
reduction in Category 2. Specifically, US$2,299,769 is being transferred from Category 2
to Category 1, and US$3,930,000 is being transferred from Category 3 to Category 1. The
revised allocation of proceeds is shown in Table 4 below.

Closing date

12.     The implementation period would be increased by one year, to June 30, 2014
(from June 30, 2013) to enable the completion of activities (including support to school
improvement plans and an impact evaluation, as well as allowing a second round of data
collection to take place in September 2013) and achievement of targets which are already
underway. It would also allow the full disbursement of Bank financing, by providing the
CGEPECs with enough time to present proof of the deposit of funds to the schools to the
CNPEC. This is a condition for the disbursement of funds, which has hitherto been the
Project’s main bottleneck.

Implementation schedule

13.    The implementation schedule will change as follows as a result of the closing date
extension:

    a. Financing of school improvement plans through School Grants – Project
       Restructuring will enable financing of School Grants under the Project during the
       school year 2013-14 rather than only through the school year 2012-13 as
       originally planned.


                                            11
b. Annual Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Surveys – The annual M&E
   surveys to collect data for the Results Matrix are to continue but according to a
   new schedule. The planned annual M&E survey to collect data for the
   measurement of Project indicators was not carried out in 2011 since it could not
   be included in that year’s budget. The extension of the Project closing date will
   allow for two rounds of data collection. The first survey was carried out in
   December 2012, with results to be available in early 2013, and the second survey
   will be carried out in September 2013, with results available in December 2013.

c. Impact Evaluation – This is divided into two parts: 1) an evaluation of
   educational achievement which is expected to be delivered in April 2013; and 2)
   an evaluation of PEC’s school-based management model which is expected to be
   delivered in June 2014.

d. Dissemination activities – With the closing date extension some dissemination
   activities will take place during school year 2013-2014. The specific schedule of
   dissemination activities for each school year is only determined on a yearly basis
   in February before the start of each school year.

Project Development Objective (PDO): The long-term development objective (PDO) of this Adaptable Program Lending is to improve the quality of
education as measured by coverage, social participation, and educational outcomes. Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II
(the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public
marginalized schools and on the Indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the School Grants to improve public scho ols’ internal efficiency
and learning outcomes.
