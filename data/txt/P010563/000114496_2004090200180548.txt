SCHEDULE 5
Single Currency LIBOR Determination
1.
Single Currency LIBOR for any Interest Period shall be the offered rate for 
deposits in dollars for a period of six months which appears on the display designated 
as page "3750" on the Telerate monitor (or such other page or service as may replace 
it for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks for 
dollar deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second day on which banks and 
foreign exchange markets are open for business in London prior to the relevant January 
15 or July 15 (the Interest Determination Date).
2.
If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on such service as may 
replace it, the Bank shall request the London offices of four major banks to provide 
the Bank with the rate at which deposits in dollar are offered by such banks on the 
Interest Determination Date to leading banks in the London interbank market for a 
period of six months ending on the last day of such Interest Period. Single Currency 
LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if 
necessary to the fifth decimal place) of such offered quotations as determined by the 
Bank.
3.
If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such quotations under 
paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall be arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if 
necessary to the fifth decimal place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at 
least two major banks in New York selected by the Bank on the Interest Determination 
Date for loans in dollar to leading European banks for a period of six months ending 
on the last day of such Interest Period. If fewer than two of the banks so selected 
are quoting such rates, Single Currency LIBOR shall be the single currency in effect 
for the last preceding Interest Period.
