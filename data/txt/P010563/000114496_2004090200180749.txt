adequacy norms established by RBI, including by provision of
Subordinated Loans by the Borrower to PBs for the financing of

Enterprises,  and the public issue of shares by PBs.
Part B:    Modernization and Institutional Development of
           Participating Banks
      Implementation of a modernization program for PBs to build
their financial strength and long-term competitiveness in a

targets; and development of market research and product
development plans;

to staff;
      (iii) Human Resource Development: Designing and
developing human resource development (HRD) plans for PBs,
including reviewing changes required in current human resource
development capabilities; designing improved internal training
programs in areas in which expertise is not available in-house
for each PB; and identifying extramural training needs in new
functional and business areas such as automation,
computerization, merchant banking, credit analysis and
management, marketing, product pricing, lending in new sectors,
treasury management, asset-liability management, foreign
exchange, management information systems, strategic planning
and auditing of computerized processes;

business priorities and their strategic plans, to rationalize
zone-region-branch configurations as well as head office
functions to eliminate excess costs, improve customer services;
rationalize chronic, loss-making branches; and open new
branches for specialized functions such as export credit and leasing;
      (v)   Asset-Liability and Treasury Management:
Strengthening asset-liability and treasury management to
control overall balance sheet risk and liquidity volatility,
inter alia, by establishing automated management information
systems (MIS) for asset-liability management with capacity to
gather all relevant data on loans, deposits, liquidity
positions, margins, maturity gaps, and interest rate gaps; and
evaluating use of certificates of deposits (CDs), inter-bank
funds and similar instruments to manage liability positions and
improve foreign exchange management capabilities; and
      (vi)  Credit Management: Strengthening evaluation of credit
risk, in particular to enhance incorporation of environmental
impact assessment in the loan appraisal processes; pricing
credit in relation to risk; streamlining loan documentation and
approval procedures; improving identification of risk
concentrations and opportunities at the sectoral level;
preparation of credit aspects of strategic plans; formulation
of credit policies; and development of financial products.
