                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER

This restructuring paper is in response to a request by the Department of Finance of the
Republic of the Philippines. In letters received from the Department of Finance (June 17
and July 13, 2011) and LGUGC (June 10, 2011), the following changes were requested:

       (a) Reallocation of proceeds of the GEF Grant TF 053361-PH; and

       (b)                           Extension of closing date for GEF Grants TF 053360-PH
             and TF 053361-PH


The reallocation of proceeds does not result in a change either to the project development
objective or to project activities as described in the GEF Grant Agreements. This is the
first request for an extension of closing date for these grants. This is the second re-
allocation of proceeds of GEF Grant TF 053361-PH, the last re-allocation dating from
March 2, 2010.

Details of the proposed restructuring are discussed in Annex 1 (Re-allocation) and Annex
2 (Extension of closing date).

1. This memorandum seeks your approval for a proposed Reallocation Letter for the above-
   mentioned Grant, concerning the reallocation of the grant proceeds set out in category (1)-(4)
   under the Grant Agreement – Schedule 1. The LGU Guarantee Corporation requested a
   reallocation of the GEF grant proceeds in a letter to the Bank dated July 28, 2011 (see
   Attachment 1). The re-allocation is being requested as a direct outcome of the very positive
   developments in project implementation. With a greatly increased deal flow, incremental
   operating cost projections have increased greatly, as the LGUGC program management unit
   responds to market demand for inclusion in the Electric Cooperative Partial Credit Guarantee
   (EC-PCG) program.

2. Proceeds of the GEF Grant for the Philippines Electric Cooperative System Loss Reduction
   Project [GEF 053361 – P066352] are proposed to be reallocated as follows:

3. Background: the objective of the Project is to achieve significant and sustained energy
   efficiency improvements in electric cooperatives (ECs) in order to provide current and
   prospective viable EC customers with reliable and least-cost power supply over the long
   term. The global objective of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) support is to reduce
   GHG emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency investments in the rural
   power distribution sub-sector.

4. Towards this end, the Project has attempted to (i) develop and test financial and contractual
   mechanisms to support private sector investment, management and operation, and risk
                                                  5
    sharing to support system loss reduction measures in selected ECs; and (ii) support
    commercial lending to qualified ECs for efficiency improvements. For (i), it was found that
    there were significant barriers, both in attracting qualified private sector entities, and in
    fostering the right conditions for those private players that actually looked at the proposed
    deals. Accordingly, the decision was made to concentrate the project on (ii), access to
    affordable term loans, facilitated by the EC-PCG Program.

5. The key change in the allocation of the grant proceeds is to significantly increase the budget
   for incremental operating expenses. This category pays certain project management
   overheads and expenses to actually run the EC-PCG program. With a view to, in parallel,
   obtaining a two-year extension to the project, LGUGC is proposing to re-configure the
   allocations such that the incremental operating expense category is sufficient to perform
   program management and monitoring in 2012 and 2013. They have reduced allocations for
   training and consultants. The allocation for consultants will be focused on the specialist
   consulting inputs that support due diligence on deals in the pipeline, so even though the
   overall category has been reduced, the nature of the consulting work will shift from studies to
   operational work.

6. Project financing is composed of two Global Environment Facility Trust Fund Grants totaling
   $12-million – one in the amount of US$11.23 million to the Republic of the Philippines and
   one in the amount of US$0.877 million to LGU Guarantee Corporation (LGUGC). LGUGC
   is requesting a change in the expense categories of its grant.

7. Project Status – The project is rated “Marginally Satisfactory;? this is an upgrade, in the latest
   ISR, from Unsatisfactory, because until the second half of 2010, no guarantee transactions
   had been done. But in 2010, due to increased focus and coordination among Government
   agencies, the project has started to take off. Seven deals have now been done and another
   seven could be done in the balance of 2011. Another dozen deals at least are forming in the
   pipeline. Each deal represents a loan from a commercial bank to a specific EC; 80% of the
   principal amount, and three months interest, can be guaranteed through the EC-PCG program,
   which protects the participating banks from the threat of default.

8. Disbursement of GEF Grants as of September 20, 2011– Of the total $12-million granted to
   the Philippines in the two GEF grants, most has been disbursed. $10-million has now been
   disbursed to the Guarantee Reserve Account, so this is now funded at its full design level.
   Because of accrued interest, resources available to back guarantees amount to over $12-
   million, and at a 1:5 leveraging ratio about $60-million in obligations can be covered. The
   Department of Energy has utilized about 30% of its $1.12-million grant and is initiating work
   on a significant activity to update the credit risk rating system for electric cooperatives. This
   major effort will revive what has been a moribund component of the project. Of LGUGC’s
   $877,000 grant, 58% has been disbursed. LGUGC believes that the remaining $367,000 that
   is undisbursed will be sufficient to cover eligible expenses through the end of 2013 (see
   Annex 2).

9. Financial management and reporting – coincident with the GOP request for re-allocation and
   restructuring, the Bank supervision team has worked closely with each implementing agency
   on the timeliness of financial management and audit reporting, and on the follow-up to
   auditor observations. Timeliness and quality of reports has improved, and the Bank team will
   continue with intensive supervision of these aspects through the close of the project.

10. The Reallocation Letter has been cleared by LEGES and LOA.

                                           ANNEX 2
                       Extension of Closing Date (TFs 053360 and 053361)


    1. LGUGC and the Department of Energy, through the Department of Finance, have
       requested an extension in the closing dates of the two grants. If the proposed extension is
       approved by the Bank, the two grants will close December 31, 2013.

    2. Implication of extension: Because the GEF grant for the Guarantee Reserve Account has
       been made in perpetuity, the point of the extension is not to enable the EC-PCG program
       to continue per se. Given that the money is in an escrow account, the program can
       continue past December 31, 2011 (the current closing date of the grants), provided that
       there is a program manager and that there is market demand for the program. Indeed, the
       intention of the GEF grant is that the program does continue as long as the project
       objectives remain relevant. Rather, the rationale behind the request for extension is
       three-fold: first, continuity at a critical time in program development; second, provision
       of more time to allow results of investments to develop; and third, a desire on the part of
       the counterpart agencies to have the Bank more closely involved in the medium term than
       would be the case if the closing date is not extended. LGUGC and DOE have requested a
       two-year extension, which they believe will be long enough for the program to mature,
       and is consistent with the funds remaining available under the grants for project
       management, program monitoring, and policy support.

    3. Continuity: This is the key rationale behind the extension request. Due to a variety of
       institutional factors beyond the control of LGUGC, no deals were done during the first
       five years of the project (out of the original seven year grant implementation period).
       During this period, however, due diligence on 15 deals was done, involving considerable
       consultant and operating expenses. But there were important lessons learned, including
       the identification of the need to forge a closer link between the EC-PCG program and
       NEA. This relationship was formalized in late 2009 with agreement on a co-financing
       partnership between LGUGC and NEA. Since then, the program has taken off. From
       zero deals as of June 2010, there have now been seven loan closings, and another three
       are imminent. LGUGC expects to have at least four more guarantees booked by end-
       2011, and the pipeline now has over a dozen EC’s in it (it should be noted that, for
       pipeline entry, an approval from the Board of the specific electric cooperative is
       necessary). Closure of the grants has the implication that program management and due
       diligence costs, much of which are now paid for by the grant proceeds, would need to be
       paid fully by the participants in the program. While eventually this is how the program
       will have to be financed if it is to be sustainable, the reality is that the program remains in
       a formative stage, and LGUGC and its partners across the Government apparatus
       (especially the National Electrification Agency and the Energy Regulatory Commission,
       NEA and ERC respectively) are still developing the routines and processes that will
       provide a stable operating context for electric cooperative financings.1 Now is not an
       opportune time to introduce major pricing changes into the EC-PCG program.

    4. Given the availability of the remaining grant funds, a better approach will be to provide
       an extension of the closing date. About $367,000 remains undisbursed, and LGUGC has

 NEA is responsible for helping individual EC’s prepare investment plans. The process has evolved into a
system under which a rolling, 5-yr investment plan is maintained. NEA also helps to coordinate financing
possibilities as needed, and assists in shepherding qualified (creditworthy) EC’s into the EC-PCG program.
The resulting investment plans need to be approved by ERC; LGUGC and NEA help participating EC’s
guide their investment plans through the ERC process.
                                                    7
    provided a detailed budget breakdown to the Bank showing how these funds would be
    sufficient for two additional years of program management, based on the portfolio and
    pipeline of deals now in place. With more deals to shepherd through the process, and
    with upcoming expenses related to monitoring of deals in implementation, the
    incremental operating cost budget has been raised significantly. While some of this
    increase comes from a reduced budget for consultants, within that budget, all of the
    remaining effort will be focused on ensuring that a high standard of due diligence is
    maintained.

5. Monitoring results: implementation time for investments that are supported by the EC-
   PCG program is about one year (up to about 18 months). Assets financed under the very
   first loan that was supported, dating back to July 2010, are therefore only now coming
   into service. From an evaluation point of view, one can measure the financial volume of
   investments that will have been supported by December 31, 2011, but almost none of the
   financed assets will have come into service, so the loss reduction impact of the
   investments will not be measurable. DOE and LGUGC are keen to work with the Bank
   during the extension period to monitor and evaluate actual results. Additionally, work on
   updating loss reduction planning methodologies (financed by the Japanese Government)
   has just started at NEA; this work is important because of the role that NEA, as the apex
   agency of the electric cooperatives, plays in providing technical assistance to the electric
   cooperatives as they prepare their investment plans.

6. Bank participation: LGUGC and DOE would like the World Bank to remain more
   closely involved in the program than would be the case if the closing dates are not
   extended. The Bank team has been closely involved in helping to foster the co-financing
   agreement between NEA and LGUGC which got NEA more heavily involved in the
   project; prior to this co-financing agreement, there were no booked guarantees.
   Additionally, the Bank team has helped identify technical changes in the EC-PCG
   operating guidelines that have allowed more efficient processing of deals, and have
   increased the capacity of the Guarantee Reserve Account to back new commercial
   lending. This means that much more commercial lending is now supported – previously
   the program could operate at a leverage ratio of 1:1 (one dollar in the reserve account
   backed one dollar in lending); this has been increased first to 1:3 and now to 1:5,
   enabling the guarantee reserve account to back $50-million in commercial bank lending.
   Additionally, LGUGC is now counting and additional $2-million in accrued interest
   income as part of the Guarantee Reserve Account, adding another $10-million in
   coverage. And because participating banks can only have 80% of their total loan so
   secured, the GEF grant of $10-million for the Guarantee Reserve Account can leverage
   $75-million in private commercial lending to the sector. It should be pointed out that the
   higher leveraging ratio does not entail the assumption of much greater risk; rather, it is
   consistent with good practice in the Philippines and elsewhere and is at the lower end of
   the range that is typical in such programs, where leverage ratios of up to 1:10 can be
   found. The larger volume of lending and greater number of deals is another reason why
   program management expenses have increased.

7. The Bank team has also started to participate in Project Monitoring Board (PMB)
   meetings. PMB’s are formed each time a loan is agreed, and include representatives from
   the borrowing EC, NEA, the lender, LGUGC, and DOE. For LGUGC, PMB
   participation is funded out of incremental operating expenses. The purpose of the PMB
   is to monitor the implementation of the investment plan, including in its procurement,
   environmental, and social aspects. PMB meetings are intended to be held at least once
   annually, so at this point only the first handful of deals have had PMB meetings. The

                                            8
   meetings will also typically be hosted by the borrower, so site visits to specific
   investment locations will be facilitated. LGUGC and DOE believe that extension of the
   grant closing dates will help in ensuring that PMB meetings become an institutionalized
   feature of the EC-PCG program.

8. Recommendation: The EC-PCG program has started to work. At very low incremental
   cost to the World Bank, an extension to the grant closing dates will help the program to
   continue to develop, leading to full utilization of the capacity of the guarantee fund.
   Authorization of an extension of the closing date is therefore requested.

9. The Closing Date extension letter has been cleared by EASIN’s GEF Coordinator,
   LEGES and LOA.
