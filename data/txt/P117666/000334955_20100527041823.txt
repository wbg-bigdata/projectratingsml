    Program Development     This is the third and final lending operation supporting a policy program aimed
    Objective(s) and        at accelerating Poland's convergence with EU living standards. PL3 continues
    Contribution to CPS     to support Government measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis on
                            households, workers and businesses. With the recovery gaining speed, it also
                            supports Government efforts to unwind the extraordinary anti-crisis policies and
                            step up reforms to reinforce Poland's growth prospects.

                            The three main Program Development Objectives are to (i) mitigate the social
                            cost of the economic slowdown; (ii) strengthen public finance; and (iii) pursue
                            structural reforms.




+
                            The PL series is central to the Bank's 2009-13 Country Partnership Strategy
                            (CPS). The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Poland's convergence
                            towards EU living standards, and is based on four pillars: (i) Growth and
                            Competitiveness; (ii) Public Sector Reform; (iii) Social and Spatial Inclusion;
                            and (iv) Regional and Global Public Goods. Reforms of public financial
                            management, private sector development, labor markets and social sectors are
                            key elements of the first three pillars of the CPS.
    Risks                   There are three main risks as the Government takes the next step in its reform
                            program with the Bank. First, Europe's recovery from the global financial
                      crisis, which triggered a sharp and synchronized contraction, could be sluggish
                      or followed by a ?double-dip?. This could undermine growth in Poland, would
                      jeopardize fiscal outcomes and might give rise to pro-cyclical expenditure cuts.
                      Mitigating factors include low inventory levels, some pent-up demand, low
                      interest rates and stepped-up utilization of EU funds. In addition, the
                      authorities? solid track record over the last years has assured good access to
                      financial markets, which should provide adequate access to credit to borrow
                      through any further slowdown or downturn, as long as credible commitment to
                      medium-term fiscal and structural reform is documented.

                      Second, in spite of the recent improvements in global financial markets,
                      heightened financial strains could return, especially if policy support is
                      withdrawn prematurely or policy coordination deteriorates. Similarly, renewed
                      deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could lead to a further increase in
                      non-performing loans and additional credit tightening by banks. Mitigating
                      factors include the strong initial condition of Poland?s financial system, and the
                      strong credibility in the conduct of monetary policy by the country?s central
                      bank and the regular. stress-tests undertaken by the financial supervisor KNF.

                      Third, a prolonged deterioration of economic prospects could undermine public
                      support for the Government reform program. Without such reforms, the
                      remaining rigidities in the labor and product markets and the large public sector
                      in Poland could become a drag for future growth. Mitigating factors include the
                      Government?s strong commitment to the fiscal development and consolidation
                      strategy and Vision 2030, and the broadly recognized need for a reduction in the
                      fiscal deficit in view of the constitutional public debt limit of 60 percent of GDP
                      and Poland?s commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.

                                 I. INTRODUCTION
1.      Poland has shown remarkable resilience to the global financial crisis. In the
decade leading up to the crisis, Poland's increasing integration with Europe had brought
about strong economic expansion and rapid convergence to European Union (EU)
income levels. As the crisis broke out, this integration made Poland vulnerable to the
collapse in regional capital, trade, and labor flows. Poland's companies, workers, and
households have so far weathered well the impact of the global financial crisis. The good
performance reflects, among other factors, a diversified and flexible economy, fairly
strong macroeconomic balances going into the crisis, and a timely policy response of the
Polish authorities during the crisis.
2.      While Poland has withstood the global financial crisis better than other
countries in the region, it faces stark social and economic challenges in politically
sensitive times. The short-term recovery remains fragile, with significant risks for
businesses and families, and the medium-term growth and convergence prospects
uncertain. Like other countries in Europe, Poland faces the challenge of advancing
economic reforms needed to stay competitive in a world of reduced capital flows and
discriminating financial markets. It needs to bring about medium-term fiscal
consolidation while safeguarding crucial social and infrastructure programs.
3.      This is the third policy loan (PL3) in a program of three lending operations
supporting Poland's goal of convergence with EU living standards. PL3 continues to
support the Government's successful policy response to the economic slowdown. Key
reform initiatives included the anti-crisis stability and development plan; the reduction in
the tax wedge; the phasing out of early retirement pensions; and the amendments of the
law on freedom of business operations, the public finance act and the 2009 state budget.
Following the second policy loan, PL3 will continue to support Government measures to
mitigate the impact of the global crisis on households, workers and businesses. With the
recovery gaining speed, it also supports Government efforts to unwind the extraordinary
anti-crisis policies and step up reforms to reinforce Poland's growth prospects.

                                    1
2.1. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN POLAND
4.      The global economic crisis has ended Poland?s fast economic expansion over
the recent years, but in contrast to its neighbors Poland has avoided a decline in
economic activity.? Since late 2008, Poland has been hit by two shocks: the recession in
high-income countries, which hurt external demahd for exports; and the global financial
crisis, which reduced capital inflows and thereby lowered domestic demand.
Nevertheless, growth remained positive throughout the last four quarters. In fact, Poland
is the only one of 27 EU member states whose economy has continued to expand
throughout the crisis. Poland grew by 1.7 percent in 2009, while the EU declined by 4.1
percent and the EUlO region by 4.2 percent according to preliminary EC estimates.2
5.      Economic activity has rebounded since early 2009. Year-on-year growth
increased from 0.8 percent in the first quarter to around 3 percent in the fourth quarter.
Based on year-on-year comparisons, industrial production improved from a 15 percent
decline in January 2009 to a 8.5 percent increase in January 2010; the economic
sentiment index from 87.8 percent in January 2009 to 93.7 in December 2009; and
private investment improved year-on-year from a 5 percent decline in the first half of
2009 to a 2 percent decline in the second half of 2009. Inflation has remained near the
upper limit of NBP?s tolerance ban of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent since September 2009.
6.     The narrowing in the trade balance provided the principal spur for growth.
In 2009, the GDP contribution was 2.5 percent from net exports, 1.6 percent from
consumption, and -2.4 percent of GDP from investment and the statistical discrepancy.
As imports contracted more than exports, the current account deficit narrowed to 1.6
percent of GDP in 2009 compared to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008. Trade flows stabilized
over the second half of 2009. Measured in Euro and on year-on-year basis, exports
improved from a 30 percent decline in April 2009 to a 12 percent increase in December
2009; and imports from a 37 percent decline in April 2009 to a 3 percent decline in
December 2009.
7.      Poland?s economic slowdown is muted for a number of reasons. First,
Poland?s relatively large domestic economy has limited its exposure to the decline in
world trade. Exports accounts for only around 40 percent of GDP in Poland, compared to
around 80 percent of GDP in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and the Slovak Republic.
Second, the flexible exchange rate regime has facilitated the economy?s adjustment to the
external shock. While the zloty has been regaining value on the back of strengthening
investor confidence since March 2009, the depreciation of the real exchange rate remains
larger than in Poland?s neighbors. Third, Poland?s banking system has withstood the
global financial crisis well. In part, this is because Poland?s credit expansion was less
dramatic than elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe with credit to GDP amounting to
less than 50 percent in 2008. Because Poland entered the crisis, with relatively strong

fundamentals, the Government has been able to implement policies that are now
cushioning the impact of the slowdown.
8.      Although capital inflows have declined, the financial sector remains
relatively sound. Immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September
2008, the Polish interbank market froze. In the subsequent six months, the stock markets
declined by close to one half and the zloty depreciated by about one third. In response to
the stabilization of global financial markets in the spring and the precautionary one-year
USD20.5 billion facility under the IMF's Flexible Credit Line (FCL) from early May
2009, the zloty appreciated more than 10 percent and the stock market recovered most of
its losses since late March 2009. This has mitigated the strains on foreign-currency
indebted corporations and households and helped to stabilize banks' profits in the third
quarter of 2009. Subsidiaries of foreign banks have largely maintained their exposure,
with private debt roll-over rates close to 100 percent relative to end-2008 levels, and
credit default swap spreads of parent banks have come down significantly. Most banks
retained 2008 profits to strengthen their balance sheets, and the capital adequacy ratio
improved from 11.1 percent in March to 13.0 percent in September, safely above the
minimum level of 8 percent. Non-performing loans of households have increased only
moderately. While non-performing loans of corporates have increased noticeably, they
remain modest as a percentage of GDP. Furthermore, foreign direct investment improved
year-on-year from a 50 percent decline in the first half of 2009 to a 20 increase in the
second half of 2009. In addition, overall corporate profitability and corporate bank
deposits remain high. The NBP has also reduced the policy rate from 6 percent in
November 2008 to 3.5 percent in August 2009 in support of the recovery. Nevertheless,
bank lending standards have tightened and the interbank market is active only for short-
term maturities, as banks prefer to hold on to liquidity in view of economic uncertainties.
9.      Fiscal policy shored up growth through automatic stabilizers and
discretionary measures, and at the same time contained the rise in public debt
through consolidation measures. The general government deficit doubled to 7.2
percent of GDP in 2009 from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2008. About two-thirds of the
increase was due to lower revenues. Poland adopted fiscal recovery measures of about 2
percent of GDP in 2009, which was the largest stimulus among the EUlO countries. This
included the reductions in personal income tax legislated in 2007 and entering into force
in early 2009, and increases in social and infrastructure expenditures adopted as part of
the July 2009 supplementary budget and supported through accelerated utilization of EU
funds. The supplementary budget also incorporated fiscal savings of about 1.4 percent of
GDP through reductions in administrative spending and increases in dividends from
state-owned companies.
10.     Poland's large fiscal deficit is related mainly to three factors. First, as in other
EU countries, the use of automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus to counteract the global
economic crisis has increased budget deficits. Second, the large fiscal deficit reflects the
shift to a funded public pension pillar in the late 1990s. This reform imposes
considerable upfront fiscal cost, amounting according to Government estimates annually
to around 3.2 percent of GDP for pension reform. Third, high fiscal deficits also reflect
lack of progress in advancing public expenditure reforms, generous spending in recent
years, and weak public expenditure controls. From 1995 to 2008, the overall fiscal


                                             3
deficit averaged 4.2 percent of GDP, and the structural fiscal deficit 4.4 percent of GDP.
Government expenditures exceeded revenues throughout this period, even at the peak of
the economic cycle.
11.     The remarkably robust economic performance in 2009 suggests that the
Government managed to strike the right balance between supporting the recovery
and limiting the deterioration of public finances. Financial markets have responded
well to the Government's rising financing needs. Yields on government bonds have
declined over the last half a year, although they remain somewhat above pre-crisis levels.
The Government secured all external financing for 2009 without difficulties. The IMF
staff assessment of the FCL review from November 2, 2009 concluded that Poland
continues to meet the qualification criteria for access to FCL resources and remains
committed to responding appropriately to actual or potential balance of payment
pressures.


2.2. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
12.    Growth is expected to accelerate steadily over the medium-term in line with
an improving external environment. It is projected to increase from 1.7 percent in
2009 to 3 percent in 2010 and gain more strength in 201 1 (Table 1). The recovery is
expected to be driven by improving global conditions, higher investments supported
through increased EU funds, moderate consumption growth, and strengthening financial
markets. As output is set to remain below potential output and the exchange rate
appreciated over the last quarters, inflation is projected to be moderate in 2010 and
remain subdued over the medium-term.
13.      The fiscal deficit is targeted to decline gradually and drop below 3 percent of
GDP by 2012. While Poland's fiscal position has held up fairly well in comparison to
the EU (Box l), medium-term fiscal consolidation is crucial for the Government's goal of
early Euro adoption, to stay clear of the 55 percent of GDP national public debt limit
(Box 2), and to protect priority spending for jobs and growth. In January 2010, the
Government reiterated its commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP
in the fiscal development and consolidation strategy and the convergence program update
(Table 2). This target is consistent with the European Council recommendations issued
                                                                            The
in July 2009 as part of the initiation of the excessive deficit pr~cedure.~ scale of the
fiscal consolidation is set to increase over time, as selected expenditure savings are offset
initially by higher capital investments, part of which are financed from EU structural
funds. The rebalancing from public to private investment in 2012, together with faster
growth of nominal GDP relative to index-based social expenditures, will support a large
contraction of public expenditures as a share of GDP in 2012. In an alternative
macroeconomic scenario which assumes a slower recovery in growth due to a weaker
external environment, the Government still projects bringing down the fiscal deficit to 3
percent of GDP by 20 13.

  Under the provision of the EU Stability and Growth Pact, if a member states exceeds the deficit-to-GDP
ratio of 3 percent, the excessive deficit procedures is triggered at EU level. This entails several steps -
including the possibility of sanctions -to encourage the member state concerned to take measures to rectify
the situation.


                                                    4
14.     The Government is in the process of elaborating the details of the fiscal
consolidation strategy. This strategy lists a number of laws and resolutions which the
Government intends to adopt by end 2010. According to the strategy, the main
instruments identified to date for bringing about the reduction in the fiscal deficit are
maintaining the public sector wage bill constant in real terms;4 limiting the growth in
other discretionary budgetary spending to 1 percent in real terms against the backdrop of
a robust economic recovery; rationalizing non-discretionary spending; and broadening
the tax base and strengthening tax administration (Box 3). The Ministry of Finance has
already prepared draft assumptions for four initiatives (law on the stability of public
finance; integration of uniformed services into main pension system; alignment of
disability benefits with pension benefits; and removal of floor on public defense
spending). Preliminary estimations suggest that the Government might have to plan for
additional consolidation measures to reach the fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by
2012, especially if growth in economic activity and hence revenue collection turns out to
be lower than expected.

15.    Beyond 2012, the Government aims to achieve a structural fiscal deficit of 1
percent of GDP, in line with the medium-term objective of the EU Stability and
Growth Pact. Such fiscal discipline is to be achieved with the help of a fiscal rule
adopted as part of a new fiscal responsibility law that limits public expenditure increases
during an economic upturn. Introducing multi-year binding expenditure ceilings and
implementing a permanent fiscal rule would also contribute to keeping public
expenditures below 40 percent of GDP over the long-term.




 Over one-fifth of public expenditures, or about 10 percent of GDP,goes towards paying wages of public
employees in Poland. The tightening of the labor markets in the run-up to the crisis fuelled public sector
wage growth. Now, the outlook of the labor market has changed, and the need for fiscal consolidation
make the public sector wage bill a important source of fiscal savings in coming years, as indeed many
countries of the region have discovered. For example, expenditure on the wage bill of the state budgetary
entities increased in nominal terms by 5 percent in 2006, 8 percent in 2007, 19 percent in 2008, and 9
percent in 2009.

16.     External financing of the 2010 fiscal deficit is already effectively secured. On
January 11, 2010, the Government issued a 15-year euro-denominated bond of EUR3bn
priced favorably at 148 basis points over the mid-swap rate. This was the Government's
longest-dated offering of eurobonds since 2007. Including the scheduled loans from the
World Bank and the EIB, Poland has already covered its planned external financing of
the 2010 fiscal deficit. More than three-quarters of the financing of the fiscal deficit is
expected to come from the domestic capital market (Table 2), part of which the
Government had begun pre-financing in 2009.

17.     In spite of the increase in fiscal deficits during 2009 and 2010, public debt is
projected to remain at sustainable levels. The gradual economic recovery, a steady
appreciation in the exchange rate, the fiscal consolidation, better public sector cash
management and stepped-up privatization are projected to be sufficient to maintain public
debt below key national and EU thresholds under the baseline scenario (Table 2). Stress
tests suggest that public debt is set to remain below such limits even under an adverse
scenario (Table 3). However, delays in the implementation of the announced fiscal
consolidation measures could undermine the planned reduction in public debt.

18.     The Government's plan to reinforce the privatization agenda, which will
enhance product markets and the business climate, is also a key measure to limit the
rise in public debt. The Government foresees an acceleration of privatization in 20 10
and 201 1 in line with improving market conditions in sectors such as finance, power, oil
refinery, chemical sector, coal mining, copper, and defense. Receipts from privatization
are expected to increase from PLN2.4 billion in 2008 to PLN37 billion in 2009 and 2010,
out of which PLN7.0 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) were collected in 2009. The
projections are subject to a number of risks, including the strength of the recovery, the
stability of capital markets, and exchange rate developments. In July 2009, the
Government introduced an electronic auction as a privatization method and some
transactions were already made in such a way. In 2010, the Ministry of Treasury plans to
introduce a new law on corporate governance to further facilitate the privatization
process.

19.     The external position is improving. While the current account is set to increase
in 2010 as imports pick up on the back of stronger GDP growth, the recovery in exports
and the adjustment in the zloty-according to IMF estimates the real exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals-are expected to keep the current account at moderate
levels. In addition, solid private sector flows and the continued favorable access to
international capital markets all suggest that the balance of payments will remain robust
                                                   )
even under adverse economic scenarios (Table 4 . The financing of the current account
deficit through foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows is expected to improve
further with the recovery of the economy and the return in confidence in global financial
markets.

20.    Despite an uncertain economic environment, the macroeconomic policy
framework is considered adequate for the proposed Policy Loan.                     The
macroeconomic policies implemented prior to and during the global crisis have helped to
ensure continuous growth in 2009. Most of the latest high frequency indicators,
including industrial production, retail sales, unemployment rates and economic
confidence, suggest a modest recovery of economic activity in recent months. The
announced policies are supportive of a gradual recovery of economic activity, keeping
external imbalances in check and narrowing fiscal deficits over the medium-term. Low
inventory levels, some pent-up demand, low interest rates and stepped-up utilization of
EU funds could support a stronger-than-expected rebound of the economy. However,
downside risks are significant. They include a weak recovery in the EU, depressed
investment levels in view of lack of financing, and slow progress on growth enhancing

structural reforms. Policy makers need to remain vigilant and undertake timely and
adequate measures in case the recovery is weaker than expected.

21.     Despite recent consolidation efforts, Poland faces major fiscal challenges. The
budget deficit needs to be reduced to stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio and to meet
the criteria for euro adoption. The 2010 deficit target strikes an appropriate balance
between accommodating the still feeble economic situation and medium-term
consolidation objectives. However, the fiscal development and consolidation strategy
entails politically difficult decisions and will require strong and steadfast implementation.
The authorities are prepared to take additional measures, if necessary, to ensure
attainment of the fiscal objectives, and are strongly committed to strengthen the fiscal
framework.



2.3. SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE SLOWDOWN
22.    The social impact of the economic crisis has been muted. The steady growth in
the economy, Government schemes to strengthen the labor market, and adequate funding
of social and unemployment benefits have together contained the rise in unemployment
and poverty. This, along with financial market stability, has limited household
vulnerability to credit market shocks. According to estimates from the European
Commission, overall social protection spending increased from 24.2 percent of GDP in
2007 to 25.3 percent of GDP in 2009. Means tested social assistance in Poland is
comprehensive and relatively well targeted compared to programs in other countries in
Central Europe, although leakage and coverage of benefits remain a challenge.
23.     While labor market outcomes have worsened over the last year, the
deterioration was modest compared to other countries in the region. Unemployment
rates increased according to the Labor Force Survey from 7.3 percent in March 2008 to
8.9 percent in December 2009, or by about 300,000 people. This was the fourth lowest
increase among the EU countries, where overall unemployment rose from 6.7 percent to
9.6 percent over this period (Box 5). As the rise in unemployment was compensated by
an increase in labor force participation, the employment rate remained unchanged at close
to 60 percent in 2009. Moderation in real wages growth, which declined from 7 percent
in the second quarter of 2008 year-on-year to close to 1 percent in the third quarter of
2009, has helped to stabilize employment. The economic slowdown is affecting foremost
workers with only basic education level and limited work experience, most of whom are
young. As in the EU overall, unemployment rates for workers aged 15 to 24 increased in
Poland more than twice compared to the overall increase. The regional distribution of
unemployment in Poland has remained broadly unchanged during the recent slowdown.
Unemployment is highest in areas where state farms used to dominate (the North, West,
and along the Eastern border), as well as in the old industrial regions. Unemployment is
low in metropolitan centers and regions in the center-west with a diversified economic
structure-this includes the city of Warsaw, localities around Warsaw, Upper Silesia and
Krakow. Peripheral rural areas have not seen increases in unemployment, as they have
few links to sectors hit by the global crisis, such as trade and construction industries.

24.     The Labor Fund is well placed to alleviate the impact of the economic crisis
on the labor market. The rise in unemployment creates strong pressure on labor market
expenditures. Workers who lose their jobs claim unemployment benefit and expect
government's assistance in finding a new job. There is also a pressure to protect the
existing jobs, for example by means of government wage subsidies. These expenditures
act as an automatic stabilizer and dampen the fall in income and demand. However, all
this creates fiscal strain. Fortunately, the Labor Fund holds sufficient resources to cope
with the rise in such expenditures thanks to the substantial surplus accumulated during the
period of falling unemployment. Simulation results suggest that there will be enough
resources to finance unemployment benefits and active programs under the falling
employment and high unemployment scenario until at least 2011 (Box 6). This is
important given that the unemployment benefit goes mainly to poorer households and is
thus an effective poverty mitigation instrument. At the same time the unemployment
benefit system is not overly generous and thus does not create significant labor supply
disincentives.

25.     Poverty has only increased modestly during the economic slowdown. Poverty
continued in 2008 its steady decline of the last few years on the back of a growing
economy, rising household incomes and falling unemployment (Box 8). The current
economic slowdown is likely to result in some losses in both labor income and
employment compared to what would have occurred without the global financial crisis.
However, the continuous expansion of the economy, stable employment rates and wage
levels together with public transfer schemes and automatic stabilizers (Le. unemployment
insurance) have ensured that there are no significant increases in poverty (Box 8).

                              Box 7: Changes in Poverty and Inequality in 2008
Poverty declined continued its downward trend in 2008. Real per capita income and expenditures
increased in 2008 by, respectively, 8.0 percent and 7.1 percent. The rise in household resources translated
into a lower poverty based on the commonly used poverty lines in Poland. Taking the social assistance
threshold as poverty line, poverty declined from 14.6 percent in 2007 to 10.6 percent in 2008. Adjusting
the social assistance threshold for inflation would still imply a reduction to 12.0 percent. Only the relative
poverty measure, based on 50 percent of average expenditures, registered a statistically insignificant
increase. The Gini coefficient suggests that inequality remained unchanged in 2008. The poverty profile
remained broadly unchanged. The incidence of poverty is high among the unemployment, particularly
when combined with low education of the head of household, many children in the family and residence in
small towns or rural areas.

            Box 8: Employment, Poverty and Distributional Impacts of the Crisis in Poland
                      Brief overview of results from microsimulation exercises

Macroeconomic Impacts
Overall GDP growth in Poland is expected to be 1.5 percentage points lower in both 2010 and 2011 as
a result of the crisis, compared to what it would have been without the crisis. However, GDP growth in
Poland remained positive in 2009 and expected to gain strength in 2010 and 201 1. The loss in GDP growth
relative to the non-crisis scenario is attributable to a projected fall in industry, construction and service
sectors.

To estimate how these macroeconomic impacts would translate into changes in household income, we use
a microsimulation approach that superimposes macroeconomic projections on behavioral models
built on pre-crisis household data. The macroeconomic shocks are transmitted to households through
changes in employment, labor earnings, and non-labor income (including remittances from migrants).' To
measure the impact of the crisis, comparisons are made between scenarios with and without crisis for 2010
and2011.
Impacts on Employment and Income
Labor market shocks can be decomposed into shocks to employment and earnings. Employment rates are

  The model is loosely based on the approaches described in Bourginon, Bussolo, and Pereira da Silva
(2008) and Ferreira et al. (2008), but simplified in the sense that it is not linked to a general equilibrium
model. Instead, the simplified model takes the macroeconomic projections for a specific country and year
as given, and extrapolates the microeconomic snapshot of future impacts from these projections.


                                                           16
    expected to fall by about 3 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011 due to the crisis. The shock is spread
    out fairly evenly across male and female workers, as well as across the industry, construction, and services
    sectors. Agricultural employment is unaffected in 2010 and in fact rises in 201 1 as a result of the crisis,
    consistent with the sectoral GDP projections.

    Earnings per worker are predicted to be 1.3 and 3.3 lower in 2010 due to the crisis, with the largest
    declines occurring in manufacturing and construction. The losses are especially high in the industry and
    construction sectors, and the impact is expected to be worse for both sectors in 201 1 than in 2010. Also,
    male workers appear to suffer greater income losses in percentage terms than do female workers, although
    both genders suffer similar employment shocks. Since males have higher incomes to start with, the crisis
    appears to reduce the gender gap in incomes to some extent. The combination of lower employment levels
    and individual earnings translates into household labor income being 3.3 and 4.7 percent lower in 2010
    and 2011 respectively as a result of the crisis (Figure 1).

    By contrast, non-labor income is higher under the crisis scenario, mainly due to a generous
    unemployment insurance system and, to a lesser extent, an increase in family allowance transfers to
    recipient households. Two scenarios are computed with respect to non-labor income. Both scenarios
    include a projected increase in unemployment insurance paymentsa6In addition, the first scenario reflects
    no increase in social transfers while the second includes the 20 percent increase in family allowance
    transfers approved implemented as part of the crisis response package. In both scenarios, non-labor income
    is around 3 and 2 percent higher in 2010 and 201 1 respectively. This is largely due to unemployment
    insurance payments being higher as a result of the crisis, as the number of unemployed workers increases.
    Since non-labor income accounts for about 30 percent of the average household's income, the increase in
    non-labor income offsets some of the losses in labor income and cushions the shock for households.

    Poverty and Distributional Impacts
    The impact of the crisis on overall poverty rate and depth is projected to be small and further
    mitigated by unemployment insurance benefits and, especially, the increase in social transfers. As a
    result of the crisis, the poverty headcount rate in 201 1 is projected to be higher by 0.5 percentage points

     This assumes that every worker who becomes unemployed receives an amount equal to the average
    annual payment of unemployment insurance per worker.


                                                                     17
with the increase in social transfers and 0.7 percentage points without the increase; the impact is even
smaller in 2010 (Table). In other words, the increase in family allowance transfers in response to.the crisis
is expected to reduce the poverty impact by about 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points in 2010 and 201 1
respectively. The poverty gap, which measures the depth of poverty, follows a similar pattern to the poverty
headcount.

Most income losses are felt in the middle of the income distribution. Although changes in aggregate
inequality measures appear to be negligible, this masks important changes in income distribution. Eight to
ten percent of households in the middle of the income distribution (3*-8* deciles) suffer a negative income
shock large enough to push them to a lower income decile. These shocks are mainly associated with losses
in labor income in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Some upward movements also occur,
especially at the bottom of the income distribution, due to increases in non-labor income (Le. social
transfers).

Impacts are larger in urban than in rural areas and, within urban areas, they are largest among
those at the bottom of the distribution. Large impacts among poor and vulnerable households in urban
areas are likely the result of weaker attachments to the labor markets and employment in informallless
productive jobs. In contrast, in rural areas it is those at the top of the distribution and with access to non-
farm employment, who are most affected.

26.     The moderate impact of the economic slowdown on household budgets has
enabled households to continue servicing their loans. The rise in household access to
credit has exposed Polish households to potential credit market shocks, although the
vulnerabilities are weaker than in some other EUlO countries (World Bank 2009a). At the
end of 2008, household debt reached 25 percent of GDP, the fourth lowest ratio among the
EUlO countries. About half of this debt was housing loans. Payment obligations may
increase as a result of the crisis for three reasons. First, about 40 percent of bank loans
were foreign currency denominated, exposing households to exchange rate depreciation.
Second, most households have loans that have variable interest rates, which means that
their interest payment obligations may rise as average interest rates rise. Third, those who
              Y
have recent1 lost their jobs will have an even more difficult time meeting their payment
obligations. Fortunately, the stable employment rate and positive real wage growth have

' A stress test in Poland suggests that unemployment shocks (compared to interest rate or exchange rate
shocks) have the highest impact on probability of default. Modest increases in unemployment can increase
the share of loans in default by over 5 percentage points (Zochowski and Zajqczkowski 2007 and 2008).


                                                       18
protected household incomes. Household debt is also well distributed, with total
household debt repayment exceeding one fifth of household budgets in only 16 percent of
Polish households, the lowest share among seven EUlO countries with available data. In
addition, the appreciation of the zloty since March 2009 has limited balance sheet effects
for households with foreign exchange mortgages. Moreover, stabilization of the financial
markets and the low interest rate environment have helped maintain household access to
affordable borrowing. Finally, as discussed below in Section 111, the Government has
initiated programs to support vulnerable households with mortgages. As a result, non-
performing loans of households have increased only moderately from 3.5 percent in 2008
to 4.9 percent in September 2009, and non-performing loans for mortgages have increased
from 1.O percent in 2008 to only 1.4 percent in September 2009.

            111. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM
27.     Government policies continue to balance support for a broad-based,
sustainable economic recovery with medium-term fiscal stabilization. More than one
year after the outbreak of the global financial crisis, Poland has managed successfully to
shore up economic growth, strengthen financial markets and sustain social outcomes.
Signs of recovery are also appearing across the EU, with the halt of the sharp decline in
economic activity and the improvement in market confidence. However, the strength of
the recovery remains uncertain. A key policy issue is when to phase out the
extraordinary support to the economy and the financial sector, which was adopted as part
of Poland's Stability and Development Plan in line with the European Economic
Recovery Program from November 2008. The strategy for exiting from the broad-based
anti-crisis policies has to strike an appropriate balance between stabilization and
sustainability concerns. The Government shares the EU Council's assessment from
October 22, 2009 that it is still too early to withdraw the support, as the recovery is not
yet secured. As soon as the recovery is firmly under way, the stimulus measures will be
gradually withdrawn and a conservative fiscal stance restored to make room for a private
sector led recovery. A sustainable medium-term reduction in the fiscal deficit is required
in view of Poland's commitments as part of the EU stability and growth pact, the
Government's goal of early euro adoption, and in keeping with its own national public
debt ceilings. Increasing the quality of public finances and intensifying structural reform
are desirable even in the short term and will foster potential output growth and debt
reduction.
28.     Reform of public sector spending is also required to bring about structural
changes envisioned as part of the Government's strategy for 2030. This vision,
presented in autumn 2009, entails a fundamental transformation from a "welfare society
to a workfare society". The need for this transformation arises from the challenges of
globalization, energy deficiency, climate change, and population aging. The aim is to
build a competitive, innovative and energy efficient economy supported by a performing
state for a socially and regionally cohesive society. Taking the current economic crisis as
a stepping stone for Poland's modernization, Vision 2030 provides a framework for long
term development anchored in specific targets to inform the process of designing,
developing and implementing public interventions (Table 4).

29.     In response to the challenges arising from the current economic environment
and the need for structural reform in line with Vision 2030, the Government has
continued to make significant advances in the reform agenda. Crucial policy
measures adopted since summer 2009 include additional steps to safeguard financial
stability, the anti-crisis package to preserve employment and promote job creation, the
reform of unemployment benefits to increase incentives for job search, the liberalization
of the regulation for temporary work agencies, the reform of family benefits to increase
effectiveness in alleviating poverty, the reduction in management and contribution fees
charged by the private pension funds, the reform of health financing to enhance the
stability of the health system, the roll-out of syllabus reform in schools, and the adoption
of the law on delivery of services. Overall, Government policies pursue four main
objectives:
        To safeguard the stability of the financial sector
    0   To mitigate the social cost of the economic crisis
        To strengthen public finance
    0   To pursue structural reforms.

3.1. SAFEGUARDING THE STABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
30.     Expanding on the anti-crisis package adopted in November 2008, the Polish
authorities have taken further measures to safeguard financial stability since
summer 2009. In June 2009, NBP has extended the maturity of its rep0 transactions to 6
months. In September 2009, NBP announced as contingency measures to improve
liquidity its readiness to extend its rep0 transactions to 12 months, purchase banks' bonds
directly in the secondary market, and use corporate promissory notes as security for
central bank funding. NBP has also undertaken top-down stress tests showing that the
banking system is robust to adverse scenarios. KNF, the financial supervisor, has been
successful in encouraging banks to retain their 2008 record profits, which helped to
increase capital adequacy from 11 percent in March 2009 to 13 percent in September
2009. KNF has also approved a new capital adequacy regulation temporarily allowing
banks to strengthen their capital by issuing subordinated debt. In addition, KNF has
stepped up work on systematic bottom-up stress tests in the banking sector. KNF also
supported new legislation, currently under review by the Supreme Court, which
subordinates credit unions to the supervisory powers of the KNF, reducing systemic risks.


                                                   20
To ease the credit crunch and help banks reduce credit risks, the government has
introduced a credit guarantee program for SMEs offered by the state-owned bank BGK.
On February 5 , 2010, the Government approved the assumptions of the proposed
legislation on consumer loans, which will harmonize Polish law with the new EU
directive on consumer loans. In late February 2010, KNF approved a new
recommendation to tighten criteria for local and foreign currency consumer lending.
Aiming to broaden the supervision of consumer loans, it advises banks to introduce new
lending procedures for both domestic and foreign currency loans.

                              Encouraged banks to retain earnings to boost own capital. With all profits from
    capital buffers           2008 retained, capital-adequacy ratio increased from 11 percent in March 2009 to
                               13 percent in September 2009.
                              Introduced new capital adequacy regulation temporarily allowing banks to
                              strengthen their capital, subject to the approval of the KNF, by issuing subordinated
                              debt.

                              NBP has started providing euro, dollar, and Swiss franc swaps to domestic banks.
                              NBP has secured participation in the weekly euro-Swiss franc exchange swap
                              operations of the Swiss National Bank and the Eurosystem.
                              The NBP rep0 line with the ECB of up to EURlO billion has been arranged.

                              Stepped up individual measures towards certain banks. For example, early
    corrective measures       warnings were issued to some banks to stop mortgage lending in foreign currency

    3.2. MITIGATING THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE SLOWDOWN
    3 1,    Strong policy intervention focused on recovery and social protection systems
~   played a major role in mitigating the social consequences of the crisis. The measures
    aimed at households amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP, the fourth largest stimulus among
    the EU member states, and the largest stimulus among the EUlO countries. The growth
    in the economy and the stability of the employment rate meant that the number of
    beneficiaries of social assistance and minimum income even declined slightly in the first
    nine months of 2009 compared to the same period last year (EC 2009). Stable
    employment, together with the continued rise in wages, has also played a crucial role in
    sustaining household incomes and domestic demand, as Poland's tax and benefit system
    provides less cushion of disposable income to unemployment shocks than in other EU
    countries.'
    Labor Markets
    32.     Poland has a relatively well developed system of labor market programs to
    support the unemployed. Expenditures on labor market programs accounted in 2007
    for about 1 percent of GDP, which is in the middle of the OECD range. Expenditures on
    active labor market programs (ALMPs), such as training, wage subsidies and public
    works, account for about 50 percent of total expenditures, while the remaining part is
    spent on unemployment benefits. Participants in ALMPs represent about 2.7 percent of
    the labor force against the OECD average of 4.3 percent. Certain challenges limit the
    efficiency and effectiveness of labor market programs (Box 9).
    33.     Building on the reductions of the tax wedge from 2007 to 2009 through
    lowering disability contributions and personal income taxes, Poland has taken
    further measures to preserve employment and promote job creation. The
    Government agreed with the social partners on a temporary anti-crisis package which
    came into force in August 2009 and will be phased out in December 201 1 (Table 6). The
    act's main components include short-time working subsidy, greater flexibility in the
    adjustment of working hours, and the relaxation of rules governing the use of fixed-term
    contracts. The new regulation on working hours allows employers by collective
    agreement or agreement with employees' representatives to fix a reference period of
    working time up to 12 months (PL3 prior action). This is meant to encourage the
    adjustment of working hours rather than employment and thus to discourage layoffs. The
    short-time working subsidy is provided to enterprises which experienced a large fall in
    revenues (over 25 percent) in the wake of the crisis and reduced working hours or put
    workers on mandatory leave. The maximum subsidy per worker is equal to the amount
    of unemployment benefit (40 percent of the average wage). As regards fixed-term
    contracts, employers can now renew them more than three times in a row, with the
    maximum duration of one contract kept at 24 months.




      Income taxes and social benefits absorb only 30 percent of a 5 percentage point increase in the
    unemployment rate in Poland, compared to 34 percent in the US and 50 percent in the EU overall (Dolls et
    a1 2009).


                                                      23
34.      Preliminary evidence indicates that few employers have used these measures
to date. According to the Guaranteed Employee Benefits Fund, by the end of January
2010 only 111 firms applied for a short-term working subsidy covering 9,577 employees
compared to its original estimates of as many as 60,000 firms. Greater working time
flexibility has proved to be a more popular instrument: by mid January 2010, 534
agreements on extending the calculation period for working time were approved.
Overall, the public expenditures to support the temporary labor market measures are
likely to remain below the planned PLNl.5 billion provided by the Labor Fund.
35.    The authorities have taken measures to discourage long-term unemployment.
As of January 1,2010, the level of unemployment benefits will decline after three months
in order to encourage the unemployed to seek a job immediately after their registration
(PL2 prior action).' In addition, in order to improve employment prospects of the youth
- a group particularly vulnerable during the period of weak labor demand - the
Government also plans to introduce a new program referred to as Better Start. This
program will enable local labor offices to design individually tailored action plans for
young job seekers, combining training initiatives and job search assistance.
9
  In 2009, the unemployment benefit was set as a flat rate at PLN 55 1.8 during the first six months and PLN
575 during the second six months. From January 2010 onwards, the amount will rise to PLN 717 during
the first 3 months of unemployment, and to PLN 580 thereafter. The maximum duration of benefits is 6
months in powiats (districts) where the rate of unemployment is less than 125% of the national average, 12
months in powiats where unemployment is less than 200% of the national average, and 18 months where
unemployment is greater than 200% of the national average.


                                                    24
36.    To enhance labor market performance, the regulation of Temporary Work
Agencies (TWA) was liberalized. The aim is to improve employment prospects of
disadvantaged workers who often are employed on temporary contracts (e.g. youth,
workers with limited labor market experience, low-skilled workers). Specifically, the
revised law no longer prohibits employers who in the last 6 months issued layoffs to use
services of TWA. This allows employers who were hit by the crisis to hire temporary
workers. Moreover, the revised law extends the maximum duration of temporary
employment with one employer from 12 to 18 months. These changes make the services
of TWA more attractive to employers, and thus improve the job prospects of temporary
workers.


Social Assistance
37.     Relative to other branches of the social protection system, Poland's spending
on social assistance is low. Out of the 15.7 percent of GDP that Poland spent on social
protection in 2007, only 1.4 percentage points was allocated for family and child
allowances and minimum income assistance. The Czech Republic and Slovenia, which
like Poland target family and child benefits based on income, spend 2.5 and 2.3 percent
of GDP, respectively. Furthermore, there are concerns about coverage and leakage.
Analysis of the 2007 household budget survey suggests that about 31 percent of the
population who met the eligibility criteria for some form of targeted social assistance in
2007 did not receive any social assistance, while 47 percent of the population receiving
social assistance benefits would be ineligible when eligibility is assessed by consumption.
In addition, there is no clear improvement in performance from giving local governments
a greater role in administering social assistance since 2003.




                                           25
38.     Following on the provision of a reserve in the 2009 budget to protect the
vulnerable affected by the economic downturn, the Government has continued to
strengthen the social assistance system.
     ~




    First, means-tested core child benefits were increased by over 40 percent in
    November 2009 (PL3 prior action), and no changes were made to eligibility criteria.
    The expected outcome of this measure is a more progressive distribution of spending
    on social assistance transfers (Section IV. 1).
    Second, a new law is in preparation to create favorable conditions for development of
    diverse forms of care of young children (e.g. nurseries, children's clubs, child-
    minders, and other arrangements) as well as improvements of standards in child care
    centers for children aged 0 to 3. The intention is to provide legal cover for child care
    arrangements without the stringent requirements imposed by the health code. This
    law is expected to improve the incentives for parents, particularly women, to
    participate in the labor force, as currently only 2 percent of children below 3 years of
    age are in child care. The legislation is expected to be adopted by the Council of
    Minister in the autumn of 20 10.
    Third, the Government is finalizing draft legislation to move the system of foster care
    from institutional to household-based care. The law will also improve standards in
    existing foster care centers and support initiatives to strengthen the prevention
    through the appointment of municipal family assistants. The shift is expected to incur
    moderate fiscal up-front cost of PLN30 million but is expected to translate into
    considerable medium term financial savings, as well as better quality care for
    abandoned and orphaned children.
    Finally, the new act on state aid for repayment of certain mortgage loans to persons
    who lost their jobs came into force in August 2009. It provides governmental loans to
    persons who are unemployed since 2008 and have problems with mortgage loans.
    The Labor Fund has allocated PLN0.5 billion to finance this program. By end of


                                            26
     January 20 10, fewer than 1,000 unemployed used this support, compared to original
     estimates of 45,000.

                      the assistance.
 To support           The amendment to the act on employment promotion and labor market institutions
j o b creation        introduced a one-off grant for the unemployed person for undertaking business activity
                      (up to 600% of the average remuneration). Moreover, the maximum amount for
                      fbnding and joining a social cooperative has been increased (to 400% and to 300% of
                      the average wage, respectively).

3.3. STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCE
Public Fin ancia1 Man agement
39.     The recent strengthening of the national budgetary framework underpins the
credibility of the Government's fiscal development and consolidation strategy
(Section 11.2.2) and supports fiscal sustainability. The new Public Finance Law passed
in August 2009 and adopted in September 2009, as supported by PL2, has enhanced the
transparency, efficiency, and the quality of budgetary process (Box 11). New regulations
strengthen the medium-term performance-based orientation of the budget. The 20 10
budget was prepared in a performance-based budgeting format, including budgets of
selected units outside the state budget. The PBB budget should be fully operational from
2013 onwards, and will be prepared together with the traditional budget.


                                                      27
Pensions
40.     The 1999 pension reform will help Poland to avoid major fiscal stress of the
pension system related to the rapidly aging society, but a number of reform areas
are still to be completed. The traditional pay-as-you-go system inherited from the
socialist times was replaced with a multi-pillar pension system that included a notional
defined contribution scheme (the first pillar) and a mandatory fully funded defined
contribution scheme (the second pillar). In recent years, the Government has been
completing outstanding issues from the 1999 reform. In 2008, the Government revisited
the occupational categories eligible for early retirement and tightened early retirement
provisions to ease the fiscal burden of early retirement on the pension system, as
supported by PL2. It is expected that these reforms reduce the number of people eligible
for early retirement pensions from about 1.2 million to around 300,000. Important
medium and long-term challenges include the low retirement age, especially for women;
brining disability benefits in line with pension benefits; and a fiscal surplus over the next


                                             28
two to three decades due to a large reduction in pension benefits relative to wages;
defining the payout provisions from the second pillar; and integrating special schemes
into the main pension system (Box 12).
41.     Given the increased importance of the second pillar in financing future
pensions, the funded pillar of the pension system will need to become more efficient.
The global financial crisis has reemphasized the need to strengthen the second pillar (Box
13). The Government approved the law on limiting the management and contribution fees
charged by the General Pension Society (PL3 prior action). As the crisis has shown,
payout options need to be designed so that they are flexible enough to withstand market
fluctuations while protecting workers. However, progress on adopting multiple portfolio
legislation was put on hold as a result of a government debate about lowering transfers to
the Open Pension Funds. The pension component of the Government's fiscal
development and consolidation strategy focuses on strengthening the effectiveness of the
second pillar.




                                           29
Health
42.     A major accomplishment of the Polish system has been the almost universal
coverage of the population by health insurance. There has been a steady and
substantial reduction since 2000 in the percentage of respondents citing financial
problems as a reason for not seeking needed services. Poland is successfully providing
protection from catastrophic medical costs for inpatient care, use of which is almost even
across consumption quintiles with very low out-of-pocket expenses. It has also
succeeded in delivering a fairly high level of satisfaction with general practitioner
services and has been whittling away at out-of-pocket costs as public funding has
increased. Following years of incremental improvements since 2000, the health system
has been transformed. Problems remain in access to specialist and dental services, out-
of-pocket expenses for drugs, queues in hospitals for "planned" (as opposed to "urgent")
care, and hospital debt.
43.      The Government's health policy is centered on implementing recent reforms
to improve the incentives for better economic and medical performance of health
providers. The agenda includes the definition of a basic care package to be financed by
NHF, encouraging private insurance coverage to finance services not covered by the
NHF package; the transformation of hospitals organized as independent public
institutions into companies regulated under the Commercial Companies' Code; the
creation of a single Patient's Ombudsman (already completed); a new legal framework
for accreditation; a new legal framework for health professionals; and a shift to hospital
reimbursement via diagnosis related groups (already completed) (Box 14). In September
2009, the Parliament approved revisions to the algorithm for the distribution of NHF
financial resources across voivodships. The allocation of funds is now related only to
demographics, epidemiologic factors, and the provision of highly specialized medical
services. The modifications in the formula increased the share of resources accruing to
poorer voivodships.
44.     A key step in the process has been the adoption of the new law on financing
health services in July 2009. It defines the basic health package that is provided to the
insured citizens. In terms of coverage, the law is almost a direct adaptation of the decrees
of the President of NHF. Initially over 4,000 activities are covered, encompassing
virtually all that NHF has financed historically. It increases the stability in the health
system, and opens up the possibility of prioritizing the scope of health services financed


                                            30
by the NHF in the future. One use envisaged by the Ministry of Health is, rather than
limiting services financed for beneficiaries, to help define the minimum providers must
deliver under NHF, freeing them to provide additional services for other payers and thus
use available resources more extensively to provide a larger total volume of services.




Education
45.     The Government has advanced the reform of the education system.
Education decentralization started in 1990 and over time the tasks of maintaining and
managing preschools, primary schools and finally secondary schools were gradually
transferred to local self-governments in gminas and poviats. In 1999, the Government of
Poland stepped up reforms of secondary education. They improved the integration of

                                          31
general secondary and vocational education and delayed the vocational training track in
order to expand students' exposure to general secondary curricula. These reforms helped
to provide young people with flexible skills and improved their ability to absorb and
generate new knowledge and technology. Overall, Poland's education system is
remarkably efficient and equitable. While the achievements are impressive, there remain
important challenges in the area of kindergarten and pre-school education, adjusting the
education system to demographic change, and reforming tertiary education (Box 15).
46.    Over the last year, the Ministry of Education has taken steps to bolster pre-
school education. It has introduced mandatory pre-school education of 5 year-old
children from 2011112 onwards, and mandatory school education of 6 year-old children
from 2012/13 onwards (PL3 prior action). In addition, the Government has started to roll
out the new syllabus. In the school year 2009/2010, the reform covered kindergartens
and the first grades of primary and middle schools. The syllabus reform will be
completed in secondary and vocational schools by 2015, in secondary technical schools
and artistic secondary schools by 2016, and in complementary secondary schools by
2017.
47.     The Ministry of Science and Higher Education is preparing a new law on
higher education. Within the framework of tertiary education reform, the financial
support for graduate and post-graduate students from poor households is set to increase.
The Council of Ministers adopted the assumptions of a new law to shift a larger share of
public stipends for tertiary education onto a needs basis on October 28,2009. At present,
higher education facilities have to allocate no less than 50 percent of the financial subsidy
to support low-income students. Under new rules, this threshold is set to go up to 75
percent." The law is expected to become effective by October 2010. In addition, the
Government has endorsed the higher education reform plan that includes higher funds for
elite universities starting on 201 1; limits tuition-free studies to one degree (only the top
10 percent of students will have the right to pursue a second tuition-free degree); and
defines a common list of free services on public and non-public universities including
examinations, final examination, submitting and reviewing of the thesis.




lo Income thresholds for social stipend will also be raised. Currently, all students with income below
PLN351 are entitled to get material support from the university. This lower threshold will be increased to
PLN438.75, and the upper threshold from PLN602 to PLN752.5. In addition, students with income
exceeding PLN351 but less than PLN602 may also receive support pending decisions of the Head of
University and Students' Association. This upper threshold will be increased to PLN752.5.


                                                   32
3.4. PURSUING STRUCTURAL REFORMS
48.     As stagnation gives way to recovery, Poland can shift attention to
strengthening the foundations of inclusive growth with productive jobs. With the
crisis still unfolding, much of the policy makers' attention is understandably on
addressing immediate needs. Yet, the crisis has been a reminder of the need to build the
foundations for sustainable growth. Advancing structural reforms to safeguard the
achievements of transition and put the economy back on track for convergence remains
vital.
Private Sector Development
49.     Poland has continued to make gradual progress in improving the business
environment. The 2010 Doing Business Report recognizes four recent reforms, making
Poland the most active reformer among the EUlO countries (Box 16). In the 2008 Doing
Business Report, Poland ranked 74 out of 178 countries; in 2009, 72 out of 181 countries,
and in 2010, 72 out of 183 countries. Overall, Poland improved from the 42ndpercentile
to the 3gthpercentile.
50.     The Government recognizes the need to accelerate reforms of the business
environment. Staying internationally competitive in a world of reduced capital flows
and discriminating financial markets reinforces the importance of an enabling business
environment. First, following on the two previous business liberalization acts, so called
"Economic Freedom" acts, adopted in September 2008 and March 2009, the Government
is in consultation with stakeholders regarding a new business liberalization law to further
decrease barriers to firm registration, cut red tape, including through limiting the need for
administrative affidavits, and improve access to e-government. The new law, which


                                             33
would change more than 100 existing laws, ranging from business inspections to business
registration, is scheduled to come into force in January 201 1. Third, the Government is
cooperating closely with the Bank on Doing Business reforms. The Bank will provide
technical assistance focused on five major reform areas identified in the 2010 Doing
Business report (starting a business, closing a business, providing construction licenses,
paying taxes, and registering a property). Fourth, on December 8, 2009, the Council of
Minister submitted to Parliament an act on delivery of services in Poland, aimed at
enhancing this sector, which accounts for 56 percent of GDP, in line with the EU Service
Directive (PL3 prior action). Finally, the Ministry of the Economy is developing a Public
Private Partnership (PPP) Policy and Implementation Framework based on international
best practices. The objective is to increase the number of PPP projects following the new
PPP act which entered into force in February 2009.

     IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
4.1. LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
51.     The PL program is central to the Bank's engagement in Poland, as
emphasized in the 2009-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved by the
Board on June 30, 2009, together with the PL2 operation. The overarching goal of
the CPS is to support Poland's convergence towards EU living standards. The CPS aims
to situate the Bank's engagement in Poland firmly in the context of the activities of other
external partners and focuses on niche areas of engagement where the Bank can add
value.
52.     The policy lending series provides an anchor for the strategic dialogue
between the Bank and the Polish authorities. The Bank's strategic partnership with
Poland is based on four pillars: (i) Growth and Competitiveness; (ii) Public Sector
Reform; (iii) Social and Spatial Inclusion; and (iv) Regional and Global Public Goods.
Public financial management reform, private sector reform, labor market efficiency and
social sector reform, supported by the PL series, are key elements of the first three pillars..
Beyond the current series, the Bank will continue focusing on supporting high,
sustainable growth through the improved competitiveness of firms and regions, increased
employment, and strengthened social cohesion. The Bank is also engaged in energy
sector reforms and climate change challenges, and is reaching out to subnational
governments to sustain broad-based, sustainable and inclusive growth. The Bank will
support Poland in implementing the fiscal development and consolidation strategy and in
advancing structural reforms of the Government's Vision 2030 and of the EU's Europe
2020 strategy.


4.2. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
53.    The Bank has collaborated closely with the IMF and the European
Commission on this program. The staffs of the Bank and the Fund are working closely
together on Poland, with frequent exchanges on macroeconomic, fiscal and structural
reforms. The measures under the proposed PL program have been discussed with both
the IMF and the EC to ensure that they reinforce and complement their support to Poland.


4.3. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
54.     The PL series constitutes the bulk of new lending in the early years of the
CPS. In addition, two non-sovereign operations are under preparation, each of which
could amount to about EUR300-400 million, although the operations are at risk due to
issues related to sovereign guarantees and negative pledge clauses. The first is a line of
credit to support SMEs. The second is an investment loan to the City of Warsaw to
support municipal infrastructure development. The reforms supported in the program
will also benefit from prior Bank financed assistance at the local level. The Post
Accession Rural Support Project (PARSP), approved by the Bank in 2005, provides
assistance to rural gminas to enhance the capacity of local governments to identify, plan,
and execute social protection strategies through a Social Inclusion Program. The project


                                             35
is implemented in 500 rural gminas, where it has helped to increase the capacity of local
governments as well as to engage communities - by emphasizing participation and
building on social capital - in monitoring the use of resources and social transfers. As
the reforms supported by the program of policy lending help to put more decisions into
the hands of local authorities, the capacity created with support of the PARSP will
become critical. The Bank has also provided support to the agricultural insurance fund
(KRUS) reform to improve the efficiency of the KRUS Agency by strengthening its
administrative and analytic capacities, its management, and its decision-making
processes.


4.4. LESSONS LEARNED
55.     The Bank has played an important role in Poland since 1990, the beginning
of the transition period. The Bank has supported the economic transformation efforts of
successive governments through policy dialogue, technical assistance related to project
preparation, capacity building and institutional strengthening, and financing. In the first
half of this decade, the EU accession provided an important anchor for structural reforms.
Following EU accession, a range of other financing sources were available to the Polish
authorities, including grants from the EU and loans from regional institutions and
development banks. Several changes of government made it difficult to engage in a
continuous dialogue on core policy issues.
56.     The PL series incorporates a number of lessons from the Bank's previous
engagements, and from Bank work with other middle-income countries. First, the
program focuses on areas of strategic relevance where the Bank has an established track
record of strong technical capacity and ample cross-country experience. Rather than
seeking to cover an extensive list of measures, this program has sought to concentrate on
core aspects of public financial management, labor market efficiency, private sector
development and social sector expenditures. Second, these engagements are grounded in
a strong analytical basis. Analytical work is crucial for selecting the reform areas to be
supported with policy lending and informing the design of particular policy reforms.
Third, in order to implement a lending program that best addresses Poland's needs as a
creditworthy middle income country, the program's focus should be adjusted flexibly to
respond quickly to changing circumstances. This is especially important in the context of
the global financial crisis. An anti-crisis program cannot solve all problems a country
faces, but should be tailored to address urgent issues, while leaving some structural
reforms for the post-crisis phase. Fourth, Government ownership is crucial for the
success of reforms. The concentration on critically important reform steps facilitates the
political ownership of the program, and thereby made the process easier for the
authorities to initiate and to pursue. The proposed operation effectively responds to the
Government's own priorities and commitments as reflected in the fiscal consolidation
and development strategy, the convergence program and Vision 2030.

4.4. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
57.    The Bank has undertaken extensive analytical work in the areas covered by
the proposed operation, with a number of recent or ongoing activities. The Bank
team prepared in 2009 the first Public Expenditure Review since Poland's accession to
the EU in 2004 (Table 7). This was a key element in the analytical assistance agreed in
the negotiation of the first lending operation. It provides a comprehensive assessment of
Poland's policies in the areas of social sector, public wages, and performance-based and
medium-term budgeting, The report lays out options for reforms in support of Vision
2030, and simulates the medium-term fiscal impact of these reforms.
58.      In addition, several pieces of technical assistance have been completed or
initiated to inform the policy dialogue in PL-related areas. To analyze the impact of
the global financial crisis, the Bank team is collaborating with DEC and PREM on
country case studies of the growth and distributional dimensions as part of the Bank's
knowledge agenda. In the area of public financial management, the Bank finalized end
2009 a EUl 0 study on recent reforms in performance-based and medium-term budgeting
fiameworks, will complete by April 2010 a subnational PER on the Mazowieckie
voivodship, and has launched work on tax expenditures. In the area of private sector
development, the Bank is collaborating with the Ministry of the Economy in fee-for-
service technical assistance to improve the business regulatory environment, enhance the
quality and effectiveness of state control institutions providing oversight over the private
sector, and developing a PPP policy and implementation framework. In the area of labor
markets, the Bank has engaged with the Government on the reform of unemployment
insurance and active labor market programs. In the area of pensions, the Bank conducted
in February 2010 a workshop on the Bank's pension simulation toolkit for Government
staff, and discussed Poland's experience as part of an ECA study on the implications of
the global financial crisis on mandatory pension systems. In the area of health, the Bank
conducted workshops on the fiscal implications of demographic change on long-term
care in Poland and public-private partnerships in health with the Mazowieckie
voivodship, and continues a close dialogue with the Ministry of Health on the health
policy agenda. In the area of education, the Bank collaborated with the Government on
higher education reform through participation in two regional conferences, expert advice
on linkages between science curricular practices and the development of human capital
for research, science and technology. Policy notes on enhancing teacher performance and
assessing the quality of educational services at higher education institutions are in
preparation. In the area of social assistance, the Bank is updating the incidence of social
assistance spending using the 2008 household survey data, undertaking qualitative field
research to compare gminas where social assistance performance has improved with
those where it has deteriorated over recent years. The Bank is also supporting the
preparation of the Government's plans to encourage and regulate child care facilities for
children under the age of 3. This collaboration entails a case study of existing child care
facilities in Poland and a review of international experience with policies to increase
labor force participation of women through an expansion of child care facilities.

                     V. THE PROPOSED POLICY LOAN
5.1. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

59.     This is the third lending operation supporting a policy program aimed at
accelerating Poland's convergence with EU living standards (Figure 1). The first
policy loan (PLl), prepared in summer 2008, focused on structural reforms central to the
convergence agenda. This included strengthening the quality and efficiency of public
finances, increasing the supply of relevant and skilled labor, and strengthening the
business environment. The second policy loan (PL2), prepared in early 2009, continued
to support reforms in public financial management, labor markets, pensions, and private
sector development. However, from autumn 2008 to spring 2009, the external economic
environment changed dramatically, leading to a sharp slowdown in Poland's growth rate.
The Government responded to the weakening of revenue collection by strengthening
fiscal balances through a supplementary budget in July 2009. At the same time, the
Government stepped up its efforts to mitigate the social cost of the economic slowdown
and to protect priority programs and up-front fiscal costs of structural reforms in the
sectors of education, health and social assistance. Consequently, PL2 expanded its focus
to these additional social sectors. PL3 maintains the focus of PL2. It will continue to
support the Government's reform agenda in the seven sectors of public financial
management, labor markets, pensions, private sector development, education, health, and
social assistance. The measures supported by PL3 are critical for achieving the three
main objectives of the PL series:
0   mitigating the social cost of the economic slowdown;
0   strengthening public finance; and
0   pursuing structural reforms.

60.     The PL series has supported a number of policy reforms crucial to
maintaining Poland's convergence process on track. According to recent Eurostat
data on GDP per capita in purchasing power standards, Poland is projected to continue
the convergence to EU levels between 2008 and 201 1 from prior to the crisis, while the
other nine EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe are expected to see a
moderate reversal in the convergence process over this period. Policy reforms supported
by the PL series have contributed the Government's successful policy response over the
last year and a half. In particular, they have:
    strengthened the resilience of: the private sector (improvements in the business
    environment through the reduction in minimum capital requirements for business
    start-ups (PLl); the amendments of the law on freedom of business operations (PL2);
    and the enactment of the law on delivery of services (PL3));
    protected vital social and labor market reforms (reduction in the tax wedge (PL1);
    phasing out of bridging pensions (PL2); hospital corporatization (PL2 and PL3);
    universal primary education at 6-years of age (PL2 and PL3); and
    contributed to the robust social outcomes in the face of the economic slowdown
    (provision of budget reserve for the vulnerable (PL2); better targeted family benefits
    and greater flexibility in working hour adjustments (PL3)).

61.   The remainder of this section will present the policy areas and prior actions
supported by the proposed operation. Table 8 explains the revisions to PL3 triggers as
indicated in the PL2 program document and summarizes the status of the PL3 prior
actions. Some of the prior actions supported by PL3 were adjusted in order to ensure that
PL3 addresses adequately Poland's needs in the context of the global financial crisis.
While the Government has continued to advance structural reforms, it has tailored its
efforts to address the crucial issues of mitigation and recovery, which has led to some
delays in structural reforms for the time when the recovery is more firmly under way.
The proposed operation effectively responds to the Government's own priorities and
commitments as reflected in the fiscal consolidation and development strategy and
convergence program.

     9. Adopt Government strategy for the                 9. The Borrower has enacted the Law of March 4, 2010 on            While the Government remains committed at the highest level to

5.2. POLICY AREA I: MITIGATING THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE
SLOWDOWN
Labor Markets
Prior Action 1:       The Borrower has enacted the Law of July 1, 2009 on Alleviation
o Implications of the Financial Crisis for Employees and Entrepreneurs (Journal of
 f
Laws o the Republic of Poland No. 125 of 2009, item 1035)) thereby introducing a
       f
temporary measure to allow entrepreneurs to redistribute working hours over twelve (12)
months instead of between one (1) and four (4) months during the period between August
22, 2009 and December 31, 201 1.
62.     The new law on "Mitigating the effects of the economic crisis for employees
and entrepreneurs" came into force in July 2009 as temporary, crisis-related
legislation until end 2011. This measure is expected to help stabilizing the employment
rate, including of elderly workers. This law gives employers the possibility to reduce
working hours during periods of low demand and increase them during periods of high
demand, provided that the total number of working hours within 12 months is unchanged
and the work week does not exceed 48 hours. Moreover, employers are not required to
pay an overtime premium as long as the total yearly amount of work hours is not
exceeded. The law provides businesses with a cost-effective tool to manage the
slowdown in the economic cycle through adjustments in working hours rather than
layoffs. Workers would face a lower risk of job loss and unemployment during the
period of downturn.
Social Assistance
Prior Action 2:        The Borrower has passed the Regulation of the Council of
Ministers of August 11, 2009 on the Amounts of Family Income and Student Income Used
as the Basis for the Provision of Family Allowance and on the Amounts of Family
Benefits (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland No. 129 of 2009, item 1058), thereby
increasing the means-tested child benefits by on average forty (40) percent.
63.     The changes to family benefits became effective as of November 2009. This
measure is expected to improve the effectiveness of social assistance in alleviating
poverty. In spite of the tight fiscal envelope, the Government approved a nominal
increase of about 42 percent of the monthly child benefits, or by about 38 percent in real
terms, in order to improve livings standards of vulnerable households with children. This
constituted the first increase in child benefits since 2004. It also improved targeting by
leaving the income threshold unchanged. The amount of family support was increased for
a child less than 5 years of age by 42 percent (from PLN48 to PLN68); for a child aged 5
to 18 by 42 percent (from PLN64 to PLN91); and for a child aged 18 to 24 by 44 percent
(from PLN68 to PLN98). To limit the fiscal impact of the revision, supplementary family
benefits, including the PLN80 top-up for every third and fourth child, remained constant
in nominal terms. Since supplementary family benefits account for about 50 percent of
spending on family benefits, overall family benefits increased by close to 20 percent in
real terms. The increase in child benefits was required to meet the provision from the
2004 family benefit law that the amount of core family benefits has to be no lower than
40 percent of food expenditures of a child.

5.3. POLICY AREA 11: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCE
Prior Action 3:       The Borrower has enacted the Budget Law for 201 0 of January 22,
201 0 (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland No. 19 of 201 0, item 102) in line in form
and substance with the provisions of the Law on Public Finance (Journal of Laws of the
Republic of Poland No. 157 of 2009, item 1240).

64.      The 2010 state budget, approved by Parliament on December 18,2009, and
effective from January 1,2010, mitigates the impact of the global financial crisis by
supporting economic growth and bolstering social expenditures. As stated in the
justification to the 2010 budget act, the 2010 budget act was based on the new law on
public finance. In particular, it includes for the first time a separate budget for the EU
funds and is subject to the enhanced debt safety procedures if public debt exceeds 55
percent of GDP (Box 2). As discussed in Section 111.2.2, the general government fiscal
deficit is projected to decline moderately from 7.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.9 percent
of GDP in 2010. The large fiscal deficit reflects pension and labor tax wedge reforms,
the decline in revenues due to the economic slowdown, and the Government's
commitment to bolster social and infrastructure expenditures to support the recovery.
 State budget expenditures on pensions, education, health and social assistance are
projected to increase by 0.3 percent of GDP, mainly due to the rise in the state budget
 subsidy to fund first pillar pension benefits (Table 9).11 Social benefits of the general
government are set to reach 17.0 percent of GDP 2010, compared to 17.2 percent of GDP
in 2009. Capital expenditures are planned to increase from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to
7.1 percent of GDP.

Prior Action 4:            The Borrower has adopted a fiscal strategy to initiate medium-

   The decline in the budget of the Ministry of Health is due a decentralization of paramedical services to
local government. In 2009, FUS,the general social insurance fund, projects receipts of PLN30 billion as
state subsidy, PLN22.2 billion as compensation for transfers to the second pillar OPFs, and PLN4 billion as
loans. In 2010, FUS projects receipts of PLN38 billion as state subsidy, PLN22.5 billion as compensation
for transfers to the second pillar OPFs, PLN4 billion as loans, and PLN7.5 billion from the demographic
reserve fund. Overall, non-contributory sources, including for OPF transfers, increase from PLN56 billion
to PLN72billion. Out of the increase of PLN16 billion, about PLNlO billion are needed due to lower
revenues in light of the economic slowdown, and PLN6 billion due to higher expenditures.

term Jscal consolidation as part of Convergence Program Update approved by its
Council of Ministers on February 8, 201 0.
65.     The Government adopted the fiscal development and consolidation plan for
2010 and 2011. Laying out the Government plan for the second two-years of its term of
office, this plan embeds fiscal consolidation in structural and institutional reforms. As
discussed in Section 111.2.2, the objectives are to consolidate public finances in the next
few years and lay the foundations for a competitive economy. The Government aims to
adopt the legal changes for the implementation of the proposed reform by the end of
2010. The main targets are to:
0   reduce the fiscal deficit from 7.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3 percent of GDP in 2012
    (or 2013 if economic performance is more modest)
0   limit the rise in public debt according to national methodology below 55 percent of
    GDP in 2010 and beyond
0   maintain the structural public deficit at no higher than 1 percent of GDP, Poland's
    medium-term objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, from 2012 onwards, and
0   maintain general government spending below 40 percent of GDP over the long-term.
Pensions
Prior Action 5:     The Borrower has enacted the Law of June 26, 2009 on Amending
the Law on the Organization and Operation of Pension Funds and on Amending the Law
Amending the Law on Pension Funds and Other Laws (Journal of Laws of the Republic
of Poland No. 127 of 2009, item 1048), thereby reducing the cap in contribution fees
earned byfund managers by haw
66.     The law reducing fund management fees was adopted by Parliament and
went into force on January 1, 2010. This measure is expected to increase the
accumulated savings balances workers can rely on at retirement. Together with the scale
economies of centralized revenue collection arrangements, the measure will ensure that
Polish pension funds continue to operate with low costs by comparison with other
reforming countries at a time when the cost-effectiveness of the funded pillar is under
close public scrutiny. The legislation advanced from 2014 to 2010 the reduction in the
cap on contribution fees from 7 percent to 3.5 of the second pillar. All but one fund
manager charged in 2009 the maximum contribution fee in spite of a fairly conservative
asset structure dominated by government bond holdings. In addition, a cap on the
management fee was imposed at PLN15.5 million per month once a fund reaches PLN45
billion in assets. Currently, the assets of all OPFs with the exception of one OPF are
below this limit. In line with the requirements, all OPFs submitted a revision of their
status to the Financial Supervision Commission and introduced caps on their fees.
Health
Prior Action 6:         The Borrower has allocated adequate resources for financing the
hospital corporatization program through the enactment of the Budget Law for 201 0 o January
                                                                                    f

67.   The 2010 state budget provides adequate financing for the voluntary
program of hospital corporatization. Hospital corporatization (shifting from SPZOZ


                                            45
status - state corporation - to NZOZ status - commercial code corporation - under Polish
law) can help to ensure that hospitals have incentives to control costs and to check the
accumulation of debt, which national and local government budgets have in the past paid
off periodically at high cost. Hospital corporatization was initiated in 2009. The
program was authorized by the Council of Ministers on April 27, 2009, but a tripartite
agreement among the Ministry of Health (MoH), the National Health Fund (NHF), and
Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK) to implement the program was not signed until
July 7,2009. Under implementation, the program has taken several routes:
0   Leveling the Playing Field for Local Governments. Prior to 2009, about 10 percent or
    70 hospitals had been shifted to NZOZ status unilaterally by local governments.
    They assumed all the debt of the SPZOZ upon its liquidation, with no help from the
    MoH. Obviously these first movers have had an incentive to seek assistance under
    the current program from the MOH to resolve some of this debt on terms similar to
    what is available today. Seventeen of these local governments (mainly counties) so
    far have applied for a subsidy from the state budget for an amount of PLN 65.6
    million. As of January 26, 2010, one hospital has completed the process. The MoH
    expects a high proportion of these municipalities to seek relief from the program.
    Liquidation. One hospital in Byt6w has been liquidated completely and a new
    hospital in the form of a limited liability enterprise was established in its place.
0   Full Process. The full process of corporatization begins with an application by the
    local government to BGK using templates available on its website. BGK uses
    templates available on its website. BGK prepares an assessment of its 5-year business
    plan using a set of estimated ratios (current assets/liabilities, debt/EBITDA, gross
    profit margin, and net profitability ratio). If positively evaluated, the assessment is
    sent to NHF for acknowledgement of the revenue projections for healthcare
    provision. After approval, the local government provides the voivodship with its
    application, which sends it to the MoH with recommendation to include it into the
    transformation program. Twenty-five additional applications were received by the
    end of 2009, and BGK expects that it will receive approximately 30 more in the first
    half of 2010.
68.     For all three routes, the MoH estimates a total of 80 hospitals will be
processed in 2010. The total estimated cost to the State Budget in 2010 is expected to be
PLN350 million. Compensation by the State includes unpaid social insurance
contributions and a PLN 1-for-1 matching of any reductions in arrears to suppliers that
the local government is able to negotiate. The target of the program is to have 30
percent, or about 210, hospitals corporatized by the end of 201 1, when the program is
projected to end.
Education
Prior Action 7:        The Borrower has allocated adequate resources for the Jinancing
of educational programs for Jive (5)- and six (6)-year olds through the enactment of the
Budget Law for 201 0 of January 22, 201 0 (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland No.
19 o 201 0, item 102).

69.     The 2010 state budget provides adequate financing for ensuring mandatory
pre-school education for 5-year olds in 2011112, and mandatory school education for
6-year olds in 2012/13. This measure is expected to increase school participation rates
among young children. The Ministry of Education has confirmed that this program is
adequately financed in the 2010 budget through a number of initiatives. First, local
govemments are receiving larger education subventions to cover the cost of schooling for
6-year olds. l Second, on September 1, 2009, a new ordinance on the types of other forms
of pre-school education came into force in order to ensure equal educational opportunities
for children aged 3-5 from various backgrounds. Since 2008, 1,159 other public and non-
public forms of pre-school education have been established. In addition, 484 new public
and non-public kindergartens and 1383 pre-school branches in elementary schools have
been set up. These activities are supported through funding of PLN 243 million
including contributions from the European Social Fund, with currently 480 ongoing
projects. Third, complementary activities supporting this reform include: promoting pre-
school education with an extensive media coverage on Polish public TV and commercial
stations, the distribution of a brochure with 1.8 million circulation, and the setting up of a
dedicated pre-school website; improving the professional abilities of pre-school teachers,
including through a new regular occupation training course for future pre-school and
elementary education teachers; defining rules and regulations on the voluntary diagnosis
of school readiness of five-year-old children and related training; and developing new
core curriculum for pre-school and general education. Finally, on 7 July 2009, the
Govemment adopted the "happy school" program over PLN2.4 billion to upgrade school
playgrounds and equip schools with teaching aids for school playtime areas. The
program is expected to support 14,000 public and non-public elementary schools and 1st
degree music schools with children in grades 1-3.
Prior Action 8:      The Borrower has adopted the Resolution of the Ministry of
Science and Higher Education of May 18, 2010 (Journal of Laws of the Republic of
Poland No. 87 of 2010, item 560) to introduce a means-based sliding scale in subsidized
student loan programs.
70.     The Government approved in May 2010 a new resolution on the principles,
modes and criteria for granting, repaying and amortizing student credits and loans.
This measure is expected to make the student loan system more equitable. The targeting
of student loans will be improved so that students from poor households will receive a
higher proportion of subsidies by way of, among others, introducing a more transparent
method to calculate per capita income in students' families with regard to applying for
loans, introducing the option to suspend payments in the event of lack of means or a new
regulation of the option to lower the monthly repayments for students of limited means to
20 percent of their income.



I In the school year 2009/2010, some 15,000 6-year olds started education at schools (about 5 percent of the
age cohort). According to preliminary data, local governments received in 2009 funds over PLN24 million
through the education subvention to cover the related school expenses for the period of September 2009 to
December 2009. Another PLN77 million of additional education subvention will be provided to cover
expenses in the period from January 2010 to December 2010. This amount will be further adjusted within
the budget year to include 6 year-oIds, who will start school education in September 2010.

5.4. POLICY AREA 111: PURSUING STRUCTURAL REFORMS
Private Sector Development
Prior Action 9:          The Borrower has enacted the Law of March 4, 2010 on Delivery of
Services in the Republic of Poland (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland No. 47 of 2010,
item 278) on Delivery of Services in the Republic of Poland, thereby enhancing international
competition in services in line with the EU Services Directive.
71.     Parliament adopted the new act on March 4, 2010; the Law will become
effective on April 9, 2010. Its objectives are to (i) align Poland's legislation with the EU
Services Directive, (ii) reduce barriers to delivery of services by both domestic and EU-
based firms and (iii) increase product market competition through opening Poland's
service sector to EU competition. This measure is expected to increase Intra-EU trade in
services increased and improve the quality of the business environment. By removing
legal and administrative barriers to trade in the services sector, this act streamlines
procedures and increases transparency for SMEs and consumers when they want to
provide or use services in the single markets. By enhancing the growth potential of the
service sector, which contributes 56 percent of GDP in 2008, this act enhances Poland's
mediwn-term growth prospects. The act simplifies procedures and formalities that
service providers need to comply with, including by facilitating establishment of
businesses and cross-border provision of services. It also sets up points of single contact
through which service providers can obtain relevant information and deal with
administrative formalities without the need to contact several authorities. The points of
single contact have to be accessible at a distance and by electronic means.


                          VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
6.1. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT13

72.     The two prior actions in the policy area of mitigating the social impact are
likely to support poverty reduction significantly.
0   In labor markets, the flexible working hours arrangements contribute to limit the
    increase in unemployment, which is an important correlate of poverty. As of mid-
    January 20 10, over 500 agreements on extending the calculation period for working
    time mostly in large companies were in place. By in effect paying firms to hoard
    workers, Poland has slowed the rise in joblessness and helped to support consumer
    confidence and demand. At the same time, this measure will be phased out by end-
    2011 and hence does not constraint adjustments in job structure away from sectors
    with excess capacity to more promising ones over the medium-term.
0   In social assistance, the increase in family benefits improves the household income of
    vulnerable households, as large families are prone to poverty. Simulations suggest
    that the rise in family benefits reduces poverty by about 0.5 percentage points in 2010
    compared to 2009. Maintaining the income threshold constant ensured that the
    increases in child benefits accrued mostly to poor families and families vulnerable to

                                                       48
   poverty. The income threshold remains 20 percent above the relative poverty line
   defined according to EU standards. For example, for a 4-member family (2 parents, 2
   children), the relative poverty threshold according to the EU in 2008 was PLN1,676
   per month, which equals 60 percent of the national equalized median income. By
   comparison, the monthly family benefit income threshold was PLN2,016                         '



   (4*PLN504).
73.     The prior actions in the policy area of public finance are likely to support
poverty reduction and social inclusion. In 2010, the Government is pursuing
countercyclical policies to boost economic growth, sustain employment, and limit the rise
in non-performing loans. According to estimates of the European Commission based on
ESA95 methodology, social expenditures are projected to increase slightly from 24.6
percent of GDP in 2008 to 25.3 percent of GDP in 2009 and 25.5 percent of GDP in
20 10. Beyond 20 10, the proposed operation supports medium-term fiscal consolidation,
which will be critical for a sustainable recovery of growth. This in turn will facilitate
employment creation and poverty reduction over time.
0   In pensions, the reduction of contribution and management fees for the second pillar
    is expected to increase the accumulated savings at retirement for contributors.
    According to Government estimates, this measure will reduce fees by PLN700
    million in 20 10 alone.
0   In pre-school education, introducing mandatory enrolment for 5-year olds is a cost-
    effective way to improve equitable opportunities in education. It contributes to
    increasing the knowledge of literacy, mathematics and other basic subjects and ensure
    access to a range of better paying vocations and professions.
0   In higher education, the uptake of the student loan program among poor students is
    small, in part because commercial banks require physical collateral to approve the
    loans. Limited access to loans is one of the reasons for low enrollment rates in higher
    education among individuals aged 19-26 from low-income families. Household
    Survey data show that only 9 percent of private-day-school students come from
    households within the first quintile of per capita consumption, while 40 percent come
    from households from the last quintile. International experience suggests that making
    the loan scheme more affordable will expand its reach with little risk to repayment
    given that the students' human capital and associated future income are perhaps the
    strongest guarantee of repayment.
    In health, hospital corporatization is expected to reduce cost overruns in the hospitals,
    and thereby improve the allocation of resources to programs that would be more
    effective in improving the health of the population. Access of poor households to
    health services will be maintained, as Poland has developed a robust and adequately
    financed health insurance program that protects citizens from the adverse
    consequences of health costs, particularly for hospital care and for access to a general
    practitioner. In some cases hospital corporatization may involve the reduction in
    hospital staff and lay-offs. Hospital workers who lose their jobs are likely to
    experience temporary unemployment and associated income reduction. However, the
    poverty impact of hospital corporatization is expected to be minor. First, the number
    of involuntary lay-offs is expected to be limited, as normal attrition provides
    flexibility in adjusting the number of hospital staff. Second, most hospital workers
    have skills that are sought after by employers. Specifically, the private health care


                                            49
   sector is large and growing. In addition, the labor market was rather mildly affected
   by the downturn and job opportunities remain relatively good. The majority of the
   affected workers can be expected to find new jobs relatively quickly, without
   experiencing long unemployment spells. Finally, Poland has in place a developed
   income protection mechanism. Laid-off workers receive severance payments and are
   eligible for unemployment benefits for up to one year. Those who become long-term
   unemployed are eligible to participate in active labor market programs (e.g.
   retraining, hiring subsidies), and those whose income falls below the income
   threshold are eligible for social assistance.
74.    The prior action in the policy area of structural reforms is also likely to
benefit poverty reduction. In private sector development, the act on service delivery is
expected to generate employment growth, especially for SMEs. According to EU
estimates, the EU service sector directive is estimated to increase EU growth by at least
0.8 percent, increase EU net employment by 0.3 percent, and increase the real average
wage by 0.4 percent.


6.2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
75.     The specific policies supported by the third policy loan in the program are
not likely to have significant effects on Poland's environment, forests, and other
natural resources. Unanticipated and unintended risks of adverse effects to the
environment and natural resources are minor, although acknowledged. However, Poland
has adequate environmental controls in place. Poland's environmental legislation and
regulation is reinforced by EU environmental directives, including the EU's guidelines on
adoption of environmental assessments at the planning and programming level (June
2001) and the EU's Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for damage to
properties and natural resources (April 2007). Pre-privatization environmental audits are
required to determine the existence and scope of any liabilities of companies in state
hands, manifested as contamination on real property or other conduits. The quantification
of such liabilities is then used as part of the overall valuation of the state enterprise for
purposes of negotiating a fair purchase price with the private party. Private sector bidders
of enterprises will be subject to the environmental provisions embodied in Polish and EU
law once they acquire previous state assets in the process of ownership transfer.
6.3. CONSULTATIONS
76.     All legislative measures - particularly social sector reforms - in Poland are
subjected to a demanding consultation process with social partners and groups
likely to be impacted by particular proposed reforms. The consultation process is an
important institutional feature of Poland's process of government. The reforms supported
by this operation have been subject to extensive stakeholder consultations. Regular
parliamentary procedures ensure careful scrutiny during consideration by Parliament, and
hearings and debate in Parliament receive large coverage by the news media.
77.    Specific examples of social sectors consultations concerning the program
supported by the policy loan include:



                                             50
     The Government carried out an extensive information campaign on mandatory pre-
     school education of 5 year-olds and mandatory school education for 6 year-olds. Up
     to June 2009, the education reform agenda was discussed by government
     representatives in 16 regional debates with more than 7,000 participants. The
     Ministry of National Education received more than 200 reviews of the proposed
     reform program. During the legislative process, the amendment to the law on the
     education system was consulted with 25 social partners.
     The multi-year program ?Support for regional and local self-government units with
     regard to activities that stabilize health care system? has been widely consulted with
     relevant stakeholders. The assumptions of the program were presented to the public in
     February 2009. The Ministry of Health organized three workshops with
     representatives of local governments, representatives of trade unions and management
     of hospitals to discuss the proposed changes. In addition, the Ministry of Health
     launched a dedicated website (www.ratujemyszpita1e.pl) for this program.
     The resolution on increasing family benefits was consulted with a tri-party committee
     of trade unions, employers, and government in May 2009.
     The law on ?Mitigating the effects of the economic crisis for employees and
     entrepreneurs? from July 2009 was agreed jointly by trade unions, employers?
     associations and government representatives. It was endorsed at the meeting of a tri-
     party committee on May 25,2009.

6.3. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
78.     The Bank continues to work closely with the MOF, PMO and sector
Ministries to monitor and assess reform progress and impacts during the course of
the program. Monitoring and evaluation will be supported by the various Ministries as
well as budgetary, legislative and economic data provided by the authorities and verified
in official disclosures, directives and regulations. Baseline and updated data are provided
by the respective specialized agencies for the pertinent functions and tracked according to
the indicators and outcome measures as shown in the Monitoring and Results
Framework.
6.4. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS AND PROCUREMENT
79.    The fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland?s public financial
management system and use of budget resources is low. As part of its accession
process to the EU, Poland has achieved significant progress in reforming its public
financial management system (PFM). l 4 It has upgraded its legislative framework, in line
with the EU acquis, introduced an internal audit function, and prepared for the EU
accreditation process of fund-managing agencies. Poland has also made significant

14
   The status of the PFM was derived from the World Bank?s ongoing monitoring of PFM reform and
diagnostic works conducted by the Bank and external organizations including: The World Bank 2009
report - ?Poland Public Expenditure Review: From Welfare State to Workforce Society?, The World Bank
2009 publication ?Current Issues in Fiscal Reform in Central Europe & the Baltic States 2008 -
Performance-Based Budgeting and Medium-Term Expenditures Frameworks in Emerging Europe?, IMF
report dated October 16, 2009 - ?Republic of Poland - The Staff Report for the Review Under the Flexible
Credit Line Arrangement?, IMF report dated July 17, 2009 - ?Republic of Poland - Staff Report for the
2009 Article IV Consultation?.


                                                  51
improvements related to the public availability and coverage of fiscal information,
particularly the adequacy of accounting and reporting standards and regularity of
reconciliations of bank accounts.
80.      The PFM reform agenda supported by this program will enhance budget
transparency, predictability and performance-orientation over the medium term.
The new law on public finance adopted in September 2009 enhances budget
transparency, predictability and performance-orientation (Box 1 1). A key challenge is
the implementation of the reform at the operational level, as emphasized in a recent EUl 0
fiscal study on PFM reforms (World Bank 2009). The introduction of performance-based
budgeting (PBB) involves a number of technical challenges like changes in the financial
control framework; updated and compatible budget classification, accounting and
reporting systems; and an integrated financial management information system. The
authorities are aware of the required changes. They have followed a well-defined
implementation roadmap, and, with EU support, put strong emphasis on building the
required skills and capacity at MOF and other agencies. The development of monitoring
and evaluation systems, with well-specified key performance indicators, the
harmonization of accounting and reporting practices, and the designing of the IT system
are ongoing. In mid-2010, the medium-term financial plan will be prepared in PBB
format. The state budget in PBB format is expected to be operational from 2013, in
parallel with the traditional line-item budget.
8 1.    Other areas of ongoing reform include cash management. This includes the
introduction of a single treasury account (TSA) system, computerization of all cash
transactions and central monitoring of commitments and liabilities. The State Budget
TREZOR computerized system includes all tier State budget holders. In 2005, the
TREZOR system gained an ability to communicate with the National Bank of Poland's
accounting system, allowing direct coordination of pending payment orders and State
Budget cash availability, improving internal controls. The next phase of system
upgrading commencing in 20 10 includes rolling out paperless procedures for applications
of budget funding.
82.     In the area of external audit, Poland is advanced in relation to availability of the
audit reports to the public, independence of the Supreme Audit Institution (NIK) from the
executive, and control of the NIK budget, providing a well functioning public financial
accountability and assurance mechanism for the legislature and the public. The amended
Law on Public Finance introduced a requirement for the independent external audits of
the annual financial statements prepared by large local governments.
83.     The National Bank of Poland is part of the European System of Central
Banks, and it has upgraded its accounting and reporting policies in accordance with
the guidelines of the European Central Bank Its financial management and operations
are transparently disclosed and presented on its website. The NBP's annual financial
statements are regularly audited. The most recently available audit reports (for 2004-
2008) have unqualified audit opinions and were approved by the Council of Ministers.
The IMF safeguard assessment of central banks is not available for Poland. Overall, the
fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland's public financial management system
and use of budget resources and its foreign exchange environment as controlled by the
Central Bank is low.


                                            52
84.     Finally, Poland has made significant progress in reforming its public
procurement system. Adoption of a new law in January 2004 made Poland a pioneer in
Central and Eastern Europe in setting up a sound public procurement system that met the
requirements of the EU. In April 2006 and April 2007 the Public Procurement Law was
further amended to implement the provisions of the EU directives 2004/18/EC and
2004/17/EC, on the (i) coordination of procurement procedures for the award of public
works, supply, and service contracts and (ii) coordination of procedures of entities
operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors. The latest
amendments to the Public Procurement Law entered into force in October 2008 in order
to further adjust the Law to the EC directives but also to enhance and streamline the
implementation of procurement procedures. Improvements and further simplifications of
the public procurement system were also a result of the development and upgrading of e-
government procurement tools. In 2009 two major amendments were approved: one in
response to the current economic slowdown with the overall objective to limit the
financial burden posed on contractors participating in public tenders, and the second one
incorporating the provisions of the new Directive 2007/66/EC of the European
Parliament and the Council regarding increasing of effectiveness in appeal procedures in
public procurement. Other areas of ongoing reform in public procurement relate to: (i)
increasing the effectiveness of public expenditures; (ii) strengthening competition in
public procurement; (iii) facilitating access of SMEs as bidders; (iv) improving the
quality of procured goods, works, and services; and (v) promoting innovative and
ecological solutions in public procurement.
6.5. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
85.     As with the first and the second loan in the program, loan proceeds will be
disbursed in one single tranche to the foreign currency national budget account at
the National Bank of Poland (Central Bank). This account forms part of the foreign
currency reserves of the country. Disbursement will be made upon declaration of loan
effectiveness and submission of a withdrawal application to IBRD. At the request of the
MOF, IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into the foreign currency national
budget account indicated by the Government that forms part of the budget management
system of the country. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy lending. Disbursements will not be linked to specific
purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The Government shall
maintain accounts and records with respect to the deposit of loan proceeds in the NBP. If
the loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD
will require the borrower to refund the amount directly to IBRD.
86.    No additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The Bank will not
require an audit of the Deposit account but will require the Government to provide
confirmation to the Bank in the form of an official letter from the Ministry of Finance on
the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account within 30 days of receiving the
funds.

                    VII. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
87.    In view of Poland's deep market integration in the region, a recovery in
Europe is needed ,to support exports, spur credit growth, and strengthen job
prospects in Poland. However, Europe's recovery from the global financial crisis,
which triggered a sharp and synchronized contraction, could be sluggish or followed by a
`double-dip'. This could undermine growth in Poland, would jeopardize fiscal outcomes
and might give rise to pro-cyclical expenditure cuts. Mitigating factors include low
inventory levels, some pent-up demand, low interest rates and stepped-up utilization of
EU funds. In addition, the authorities' solid track record over the last years has assured
good access to financial markets, which should provide adequate access to credit to
borrow through any further slowdown or downturn, as long as credible commitment to
medium-term fiscal and structural reform is documented.

88.     In spite of the recent improvements in global financial markets, heightened
financial strains could return, especially if policy support is withdrawn prematurely
or policy coordination deteriorates. Banking stresses still persist. A renewed
deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could lead to a further increase in non-
performing loans and additional credit tightening by banks. The authorities may need to
respond with additional confidence-restoring and liquidity-enhancing measures.
Mitigating factors include the strong initial condition of Poland's financial system, and
the strong credibility in the conduct of monetary policy by the country's central bank and
the regular stress-tests undertaken by the financial supervisor KNF.

89.     A prolonged deterioration of economic prospects could undermine public
support for the Government reforms. This could reduce the Government's ability to
implement the needed structural reforms. Improvements in productivity depend on
successful structural reforms in areas such labor markets, education, and business
climate. Without such reforms, the remaining rigidities in the labor and product markets
and the large public. sector in Poland could become a drag for future growth. Mitigating
factors include the Government's strong commitment to the fiscal development and
consolidation strategy and Vision 2030, and the broadly recognized need for a reduction
in the fiscal deficit in view of the constitutional public debt limit of 60 percent of GDP
and Poland's commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.

 Mr, Robert B. Zoellick
 President
 The World Bank

 1818 H Street, NW
 Washington, D.C. 20433
 United States of America


Dear Mr. President,
Let me express my appreciation of the continued efforts of the staff of the International Bank.for
Reconstruction and Development towards the successful performance of our joint projects and mutually
beneficial cooperation. The prime example of this is the Development Policy Loan (DPL), aimed at
supporting Poland's economic and social reforms. Currently, representatives of the Polish public
administration are working in close cooperation with the Bank's Warsaw Office on the preparation of the
third and final loan within the designed EUR 3 billion DPL envelope.

In light of the above, I would like to request that the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development deliver .the third loan under the Development Policy Loan envelope, including the
associated technical cooperation program, in the amount of EUR 1 billion.

The Employment, Entrepreneurship and Human Capital Development Policy Program encompasses a set
of actions towards the objective of accelerating Poland's convergence with the living standards of the
European Union, continuing the activities included in the scope of the second loan of the series. The loan
proceeds are to be utilized to strengthen the measures implemented with the aim of mitigating the effects
of the economic crisis and boosting the somewhat languishing recovery through carefully targeted
expenditure. In addition, a number of key structural reforms are supported under the program in the fields
of public financial management, labour markets, social assistance, pensions, healthcare, education, and
private sector development.

Public financial management
Among the key activities supported are crucial improvements to the efficiency of public finance
management, outlined in the latest Convergence Program, geared towards the broader goal of achieving
                                         u
financial stability and sustainability. O r Plan for the Development and Consolidation of Public Finances
2010-201 1 contains steps to attain the structural deficit consistent with the medium-term budgetary
objective.

Labour markets
With relation to a difficult situation on the labour market, in August 2009, thc Anti-crisis Package was
implemented, elaborated in cooperation with trade unions and employers, in order to help companies
affected by the crisis. The Package mitigates the effects of crisis for entrepreneurs and employees, by
creating additional labour market instruments limiting unemployment, supporting human resources
development and creating a mechanism of financial support for mortgage payers who lose their jobs.

Social assistance
As part of our efforts to strengthen the social assistance system, we have increased child benefits in 2009
while leaving eligibility criteria unchanged. This measure will contribute to project vulnerable families
during the economic slowdown.

Pensions
The Plan for the Development and Consolidation of Public Finances proposes a reform of the social
security system for uniformed services for officers and soldiers starting their service from 2012. The Plan
also assumes that a debate on the gradual increase and equalization of the retirement age of women and
men, which would allow the retirement age to be adapted to ongoing demographic changes and increase
the value of retirement benefits. Higher retirement benefits would also mean the lowering of required
extra payments to minimum retirement benefits, which would lower state budget expenditure. The debate
will concern the methods of including farmers in the labour market while conducting an evolutionary
reform of the pension and retirement system of this professional group.

Healthcare
In line with the organizational changes in the health services, adopted in April 2009, we continue our
efforts to create economically stable entities providing health services as part of the health protection
system. This program, which includes financial support for founding authorities of facilities under
transformation, will be executed until end 20 11.

Education
In education, activities aimed at lowering the school starting age to 6 years, modernization of vocational
and life-long education are being carried out. Moreover, we are taking steps to increase the effectiveness
of the education financing model, implement a new model of higher education financing and ensure the
universality of pre-school education.

Private sector development
Our activities are aimed at facilitating the operation of companies, by removing red tape and abolishing
some requirements for businesses, including in the services sector. As part of the liberalization of the
economy, activities aimed at eliminating unnecessary administrative procedures, developing e-
administration and improving the relations of citizens and business with administration will be carried
out.

It is my firm conviction based on the outcome of OUT cooperation thus far that the support by the World
Bank, comprising providing financing as well as expertise, may prove pivotal to the attainment of the
objectives set forth in the Polish government's reform agenda. The successful conclusion of the program
shall serve to reinforce the Bank's position as a leading provider of comprehensive support for the
emerging countries and further highlight its vital role to the Central and Eastern Europe region,
particularly in the current period of economic unrest.

                          CHALLENGES: Low pre-primary education enrollment in Poland of 52% for 3-5 year old (pre-school aged children). Merit-based public
                          subsidies of tertiary education tend to support better off students.
                          LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE: To improve the quality of education and begin instruction at an earlier age, increase the relevance of education to
                          the labor market, and develop general knowledge and skills needed for a flexible workforce able to renew its skills and knowledge over a
                          lifetime.

ANNEX 3: PUBLIC INFORMATION NOTICE OF THE ARTICLE IV MISSION
OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND FROM MAY 10,2010
On May 7,201 0, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.??

Background
Poland is the only EU economy to have escaped a recession in 2009. Similar to its regional peers,
it experienced spill-overs from the crisis through real and financial channels, as an abrupt
slowdown in capital inflows caused a credit crunch and a sharp decline in investment. However,
consumption held up relatively well, and the trade balance began to contribute positively to
growth from the onset of the crisis. This reflected Poland?s large domestic market and attendant
modest reliance on exports; a flexible exchange rate policy; and, not least, significant fiscal
stimulus and monetary easing, as policymakers took advantage of the room for maneuver
afforded by Poland?s contained external and internal imbalances on the eve of the crisis.

The rapid contraction in the trade balance resulted in a decline in the current account deficit from
5 to about 1% percent of GDP in 2009. Foreign direct investment has declined notably, although
higher retained earnings have cushioned the fall. Portfolio inflows have performed particularly
well, especially since the middle of last year, driven by renewed external appetite for zloty-
denominated assets, especially government debt. As a result, after its initial sharp fall, the zloty
has been recovering steadily.

Fiscal policy has provided significant counter-cyclical stimulus, with discretionary relaxation
estimated at 1% percent of GDP in 2008 and 2% percent of GDP in 2009, mainly due to tax cuts
enacted in 2007 but coming into effect with a delay. While the government initially intended to
offset revenue shortfalls to the extent needed to maintain the state budget deficit below the limit
of zloty 18 billion in 2009-through what would have been highly pro-cyclical expenditure
cuts-it appropriately altered such plans at mid-year. As a result, the general government deficit
increased from under 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to over 7 percent of GDP in 2009.

The Monetary Policy Council continued to cut rates through the first half of 2009, to 3.5 percent.
It maintained a loosening stance until October 2009, when it changed its informal bias to neutral,
reflecting an improved outlook and renewed concern about inflation. Nevertheless, helped by
subdued wage growth and commodity prices, and renewed appreciation of the zloty, inflation has
recently fallen from around 4 percent in mid-2009 to well within the National Bank of Poland?s
tolerance range of 1%- 3% percent. Core inflation followed a similar path, declining to around 2
percent in recent months.

The banking system has withstood the crisis relatively well, while facilities for exceptional
liquidity support have been phased out. Capital adequacy ratios have risen to over 13 percent at
end-2009, from 11 percent a year ago. Moreover, profits remained robust in 2009, reaching about

   Under Article IV of the IMF?s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country?s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country?s authorities.

two thirds of the record-high level of the preceding year. While nonperforming loans rose from
around 4 percent in 2008 to about 7% percent in 2009 as economic activity declined, their growth
appears to be slowing. Banks' balance-sheet restructuring is coming to an end. They have
recently started to ease lending policies for housing loans and short-term corporate credits and
resumed foreign-currency lending, especially for Euro-denominated mortgages.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors expressed their deepest sympathy to the people and authorities of the
Republic of Poland for the death of their President, his wife and many senior country
officials in the recent airplane crash.

Directors commended the authorities for their swift and timely response to the global
crisis. Anchored in a strong macroeconomic framework and financial system, and
buttressed by access to the Flexible Credit Line, this response enabled Poland to escape a
recession in 2009.

Directors noted that economic growth is set to increase gradually as the global
environment improves, banks' risk appetite reemerges, and the inflow of EU funds
accelerates. Given the still fragile recovery and surrounding uncertainties, the timing and
manner of the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimuli will have to be carefully
managed.

Directors considered that policy interest rates should not be raised at this stage, in view of
the contained outlook for inflation and the excess capacity in the economy. If increased
capital inflows put persistent upward pressure on the zloty and inflation remains subdued,
interest rates could be further cut, possibly complemented by transparent foreign-
exchange interventions. Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to euro
adoption, while not setting a target date at this juncture. This will allow them to continue
to take all the steps, including on the structural front, for successful euro adoption at an
appropriate time, while preserving exchange rate flexibility in the face of external shocks.

Directors stressed the need to gradually start withdrawing the fiscal stimulus while
carefully balancing short-term cyclical priorities and longer-term objectives. They
welcomed the steps already taken by the authorities to reduce the deficit and called for
further measures, including reform of entitlement programs and revenue enhancements,
to meet the deficit target of 3 percent of GDP. A number of Directors endorsed the
authorities' intention to achieve this target by 20 12, noting that although ambitious, this
would be achievable. Anumber of other Directors, however, were of the view that a
somewhat more gradual consolidation would be preferable so as not to stifle the incipient
recovery. In order to help anchor confidence in fiscal policy, Directors recommended
introducing a permanent fiscal rule with a deficit or debt anchor consistent with the
authorities' medium-term targets.

Directors considered that, although the financial sector has been well buffered, continued
vigilance is necessary. They welcomed the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's
recent recommendations aimed at strengthening lending standards for household loans.

                                              65
Directors noted that the renewed appetite for foreign-exchange lending could pose risks.
They encouraged the authorities to ensure that such lending is funded and hedged on a
longer-term basis as well as to raise capital requirements on foreign-exchange-
denominated mortgages to reflect higher credit and valuation risks. Directors also
underscored the importance of cross-border cooperation in this area.

Directors stressed that despite Poland's strong fundamentals, raising its exceptionally low
labor participation rate remains critical to boosting long-term growth. They encouraged
labor supply-enhancing reforms with complementary measures such as equalizing and
gradually increasing the retirement age and merging special pension schemes with the
general scheme. This, together with vigorous pursuit of the ambitious privatization
agenda, would help to enhance the economy's flexibility and bolster its long-run
potential.
