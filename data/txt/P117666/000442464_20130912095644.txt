F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The original Program Development Objective was to accelerate Poland’s convergence with EU
living standards. The PL series supported the government’s reform program under three original
core pillars:

   (i) Strengthening the Quality and Efficiency of Public Finances
           to ensure a continued gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit and improve the quality
            of public finances through lowering the tax burden, and increased emphasis on
            productive spending and institutional reforms in public financial management to
            make the budget more transparent, predictable over the medium-term, and
            performance-oriented.

    (ii) Increasing the Supply of Relevant and Skilled Labor
             to improve the utilization of labor resources and reduce the incidence of long-term
             unemployment to foster income growth and combat social exclusion, as well as to
             reform some of the incomplete components of the pension design, specifically
             oriented toward lowering pension expenditures, reducing or eliminating disincentives
             for early withdrawal from the labor force, and generating additional revenue by
             making the pension system more attractive to workers and employers.

    (iii) Strengthening the Business Environment
             to remove regulatory barriers to enterprise start-up and operations, increase private
             investment in the productive enterprise sector, and offer for sale various remaining
             state-owned enterprises for transfer to private owners, while increasing corporate
             competitiveness and efficiency through private sector-led growth

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)


In the course of the PL series, the program development objectives did not change. However, as
the DPL series evolved, the reform focus shifted and the reform agenda became broader. As a
consequence, both the pillars and indicators were adjusted.

The final pillars were as follows:

    (i) Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown
        to protect the vulnerable affected by the economic downturn and to protect jobs by
        introducing temporary measures aimed at increasing flexibility of working hours.

    (ii) Strengthening Public Finance
         to ensure a gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit and a sustainable level of public debt,
         while maintaining reform momentum in the area of social services, including in
         education, health, pensions, and the labor market.

    (iii) Pursuing Structural Reforms
         to simplify procedures and formalities that constrain SMEs activity, to enable them to
         make better use of the European single-market, and to advance the privatization agenda.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Poland Policy Loan (PL) series was a part of World Bank’s strategic re-engagement with the Polish
government. Following the elections in late 2007, the Civic Platform and the Polish Peasant’s Party
formed a coalition government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Since then, the Government has
been functioning with no major political tensions and with strong social support. In early 2008, several
line ministries expressed interest in technical cooperation and knowledge-sharing with the World Bank
in key policy areas. These included strengthening the business environment, infrastructure development,
regional development, public finance and administrative reform, and climate change. The PL series was
initiated against this backdrop as a part of a longer-term engagement on Poland’s development policy
agenda.

When the first operation (PL1) was appraised in October 2008, Poland’s macroeconomic performance
looked exemplary, with strong output growth and a rapid decline in unemployment combined with low
inflation and low external imbalances. Poland had successfully managed its integration into the
European Union (EU) since accession in 2004. However, the reform momentum slowed down in 2006-
07 and constraints to rapid EU convergence began to appear. The new government confronted a
challenging reform agenda related to infrastructure development, labor market bottlenecks—exacerbated
by outward migration--excessive regulations, and high costs of business activities. In this context, the
first operation focused on structural reforms central to Government’s EU convergence agenda. This
included strengthening the quality and efficiency of public finances, increasing the supply of relevant
and skilled labor, and strengthening the business environment.

By the time the second operation (PL2) was appraised in May 2009, the worsening external economic
environment had led to a sharp downturn in Poland’s growth rate. In late 2008, Poland experienced two
shocks: the recession in high-income countries, which lowered external demand for exports; and the
global financial crisis, which reduced capital inflows and concomitantly domestic demand. The
Government responded to weakened revenue collection by shoring up fiscal balances through a
supplementary budget in July 2009. At the same time, the Government stepped up efforts to mitigate the
social costs of the economic slowdown and to protect priority programs and related up-front fiscal costs
of structural reforms in education, health, and social assistance. Consequently, PL2, in addition to further
supporting public financial management, labor markets, pensions, and private sector development,
expanded the focus of the PL series to encompass social sectors.

When the third operation (PL3) was appraised in May 2010, Poland had clearly withstood the global
financial crisis better than other countries in the region, but it still confronted stark social and economic
realities. The short-term recovery proved fragile, with significant risks for businesses and families, and
the medium-term growth and convergence prospects appeared uncertain. Like other countries in Europe,
Poland faced the challenge of continuing to advance its program of economic reforms to remain
competitive but in a world of reduced capital flows and discriminating financial markets. Medium-term
fiscal consolidation was required while safeguarding crucial social and infrastructure programs. Thus,
PL3 continued support for government measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis on
households, workers, and businesses. With the recovery gaining speed, support was also given to
Government efforts to unwind the extraordinary anti-crisis policies and step up reforms to reinforce
Poland’s growth prospects.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original Program Development Objective (PDO) was to accelerate Poland’s convergence with EU
living standards. The PL series supported the government’s reform program under three original pillars:

    (iv) Strengthening the Quality and Efficiency of Public Finances
             to ensure a continued gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit and improve the quality of
             public finances through lowering the tax burden and increased emphasis on productive
             spending and institutional reforms in public financial management to make the budget more
             transparent, predictable over the medium-term, and performance-oriented.

    (v) Increasing the Supply of Relevant and Skilled Labor
            to improve the utilization of labor resources and reduce the incidence of long-term
            unemployment to foster income growth and combat social exclusion, as well as to reform
            some of the incomplete components of the pension design, specifically oriented toward
            lowering pension expenditures, reducing or eliminating disincentives for early withdrawal
            from the labor force, and generating additional revenue by making the pension system more
            attractive to workers and employers.

    (vi) Strengthening the Business Environment
            to remove regulatory barriers to enterprise start-up and operations, increase private
            investment in the productive enterprise sector, and offer for sale various remaining state
            owned enterprises for transfer to private owners, while increasing corporate
            competitiveness and efficiency through private sector-led growth.

The original Key Outcome Indicators focused on:

Strengthening the Quality and Efficiency of Public Finances

    1. General government deficit lowered to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2010 from 2 percent in 2007;
    2. PIT rates reduced and simplified from 19 percent, 30 percent, and 40 percent in 2007 to 18
       percent and 32 percent in 2010;
    3. Law on Public Finance amended;
    4. Advances in implementing performance-based budgeting (PBB).

Increasing the Supply of Relevant and Skilled Labor

    5. Employment rate increased from 57 percent in 2007 to 60 percent in 2010;
    6. Labor force participation rate of population aged 55-64 increased from 29.7 percent in 2007 to
        33 percent in 2010;
    7. Ratio of out-of-school and out-of-work youth population to total population aged 15-24 reduced
        from 14.1 percent in 2007 to 12.5 percent in 2010;
    8. Ratio of long-term unemployed (12 months +) to total registered unemployed (registered)
        reduced from 47 percent in 2007 to 42 percent in 2010;
    9. Ratio of unemployed who receive job search assistance and vocational counseling to total
        registered unemployed increased from 18 percent in 2007 to 30 percent in 2010;
    10. Positive and significant net impact of main active labor market programs by main groups of
        beneficiaries;
    11. Disability contribution rate reduced from 13 percent in 2007 to 6 percent in 2010;



                                                    2
    12. Percentage of new pensioners receiving early pension reduced from 82 percent in 2007 to below
        70 percent in 2010;
    13. Number of disability pensioners reduced from 1.5 million in 2007 to less than 1.3 million in
        2010;
    14. Legislation enacted for payout phase of funded pension system;
    15. Increase in the number of portfolio choices available to funded system recipients from one in
        2007 to at least two in 2010.

Strengthening the Business Environment

    16. Minimum capital requirement for limited liability company reduced from PLN 50,000 in 2007 to
        below PLN 10,000 in 2010;
    17. Elimination of overlapping regulatory inspection visits and procedures imposed on businesses
    18. From 740 state-owned enterprises or state shares in enterprises announced for sale in 2008 at
        least 200 have received private investor offers by end of 2010.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

In the course of the PL series, the program development objectives did not change. The overarching
PDO from PL1 to PL3 was accelerating Poland’s convergence with EU living standards. Under this
PDO, the pillars were adjusted as follows from PL1 to PL3:

Pillar I, Strengthening the Quality and Efficiency of Public Finances and Pillar II, Increasing the Supply
of Relevant and Skilled Labor, of PL1 were consolidated into one Pillar Strengthening Public Finance.
Pillar III, Strengthening the Business Environment, was reworded to Pursuing Structural Reforms, with
no impact on its content. Finally, a new pillar, Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown,
was added. The final pillars were the following:

    (iv) Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown;
         to protect the vulnerable affected by the economic downturn and to protect jobs by introducing
         temporary measures aimed at increasing flexibility of working hours.

    (v) Strengthening Public Finance;
        to ensure gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit and a sustainable level of public debt, while
        maintaining reform momentum in the area of social services, including in education, health,
        pensions, and the labor market.

    (vi) Pursuing Structural Reforms
        to simply procedures and formalities that constrain SMEs activity, to enable them to make better
        use of the European single-market and to advance the privatization agenda.

The DPL team revised the Pillars to reflect the broadening policy areas covered by PL2 and PL3:
   • PL1 supported reforms in the following policy areas: public financial management, labor
      markets, pensions, and private sector development.
   • In PL2 and PL3, these policy areas were maintained. In addition, education, health, and social
      assistance were added for two reasons. First, at the time of PL2 appraisal, the external economic
      environment changed dramatically, leading to a sharp decline in Poland’s growth rate and a
      reprioritization of government’s reform efforts. Second, in education and health, which were
      closely related to the intent and objective of the programmatic series, the preparation of reforms



                                                     3
         had advanced substantially since the preparation of PL1. The PL1 program document (para. 71)
         indicated that these policy areas might be included as part of the DPL series once reform
         preparation was sufficiently advanced.
    •    In PL3, the PL2 policy areas were maintained.

To reflect changes in the structure of the PL series, the team changed the original Key Outcome
Indicators correspondingly. The final Key Outcome Indicators of the PL series were the following:

Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown

    1. Employment rate increased from 57 percent in 2007 to 58 percent in 2010, despite the economic
       downturn;
    2. Percentage of social assistance benefit going to the poorest quintile increased from 31 percent in
       2007 to 38 percent in 2010.

Strengthening Public Finance

    3. General government deficit reduced to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2010 from 2 percent of GDP in
        2007;
    4. PIT rates reduced and simplified from 19 percent, 30 percent, and 40 percent in 2007 to 18

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The original policy areas supported by the PL series were:

    (i) Public Financial Management:
        Public finance reforms were intended to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances in
        Poland. Further fiscal consolidation was needed to improve macroeconomic stability and
        provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy, while a lower tax burden and simpler tax system
        aimed to encourage formal private sector activity. A re-orientation and restructuring of spending
        was to provide fiscal space for increased productive spending, notably on infrastructure, and
        improved outcomes of key public services (including health and education). The PL series
        supported these objectives by supporting measures to improve the national budgetary framework
        and to enhance the transparency, efficiency, and quality of budgetary process. The New Public
        Finance Act, supported by the operation aimed to strengthen the medium-term performance-
        based orientation of the budget, enhance debt safety procedures and help consolidate
        government units.

    (ii) Labor Market and Pensions:
         Labor supply mobilization was intended to raise low employment rates, including among older
         cohorts, and improve the workforce skills. This required the reform of the social protection
         system and labor taxation to enhance incentives to work, along with development of more
         flexible forms of employment, improved active labor market programs targeted at disadvantaged
         worker groups, and promotion of life-long learning. Limiting the number of professions entitled
         to early retirement was in line with the principles of the pension reform introduced in 1999,
         which was geared to support increases in labor force participation. In addition, the global
         financial crisis shifted the focus to strengthening the effectiveness of the second pillar. The PL
         series supported these objectives through supporting government reforms aimed at revisiting the
         occupational categories eligible for early retirement and tightening early retirement provisions.
         In addition, it supported the government program to increase labor force participation of older
         workers, known as “50+?. After the economic slowdown, the Bank supported government
         measures to preserve employment and promote job creation.

    (iii) Private Sector Development:
          Structural reforms in the area of private sector development were pursued to improve the general
          investment climate. Poland ranked low in Doing Business Ranking and further deregulation of
          business environment was needed. Simplification of Poland’s onerous legal, tax and
          administrative environment for entrepreneurship and business development was a major issue.
          The PL series supported these objectives through supporting government’s de-regulation and
          privatization agenda.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

As discussed above, the following policy areas were added to the subsequent DPLs:
    (iv) Education
    (v) Health
    (vi) Social Assistance.




                                                    5
1.6 Other significant changes

There were no other significant changes in the design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements,
schedule, or funding allocations.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

The PL series was provided in a timely manner to respond to the crisis and delivered annually with no
major delays. As the PL series advanced, the scope broadened and the number of prior actions increased
from six in PL1 to 10 in PL2, and nine in PL3.

Overall there was some variation between the triggers proposed initially and the actual prior for
subsequent PLs. The triggers were adjusted to ensure that the series addressed adequately Poland’s needs
in light of the global financial crisis. The Government continued to advance structural reforms, tailoring
its efforts to address the crucial issues of mitigation and recovery.

In case of PL2, five out of six triggers became prior actions. One trigger, on implementation of the
budget, was re-worded to reflect the country’s changed macroeconomic environment. Moreover, four
additional prior actions were identified to reflect the broader scope of the operation: one prior action
under the new pillar Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown, and three prior actions under
the pillar Strengthening Public Finance, two of which were in the health sector reform and the other in
education.

In the case of PL3, six out of nine triggers became prior actions with some rewording. Two triggers were
fully replaced, and one trigger was consolidated:
   i.    The first replaced trigger referred to the introduction of the legislation to enable multiple
         portfolios within the second pillar. The trigger was replaced due to Government’s internal
         discussions on the pension reform, which resulted in a delay in the preparation of this legislation.
         This legislation could no longer be prepared within the PL3 timeframe and the Government
         advised to replace it. To compensate, the PL team included a new prior action on the adoption of
         a fiscal strategy to initiate medium-term fiscal consolidation under the pillar Strengthening
         Public Finance.
  ii.    The second replaced trigger referred to the Government’s adoption of the strategy for the
         rationalization of inspection processes. It was dropped due to Government’s reshuffle and
         broadening the scope of the private sector development reforms to administrative changes within
         state control institutions and the doing business agenda. While the preparations of inspection
         regime reforms were proceeding, they were beyond the PL3 timeframe. To compensate, a new
         prior action under the pillar Pursuing Structural Reform was included regarding the Law on
         Delivery of Services.
 iii.    The trigger on shifting government subsidies in the student loan program to a sliding scale and
         the introduction of legislation to reorient Government higher-education subsidies for poorer
         students was split, as the original trigger covered two separate policies linked to separate legal
         instruments. The first part of the trigger related to the student loan program and was reworded.
         Regarding the second part of the trigger, the Government clarified that it would take until
         autumn 2010 to finalize the preparation of legislation to reform student subsidies. Hence, the

        Government advised that meeting the second part of the trigger was not feasible within the PL3
        timeline.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The overall performance of the program supported by the PL series was satisfactory. Despite the global
financial crisis, and the economic slowdown, which led to some delays in structural reforms, progress on
identified outcome indicators was largely met. Program content based on solid analytical underpinnings,
as well as stable political environment and strong government partnership were the major factors
affecting implementation of the PL program. They were positive and conducive to the continued success
of the program. Unstable macroeconomic environment affected the design of PL2 and PL3 operations,
but PL series main pillars were kept unchanged.

Program content. The program focused on areas of strategic relevance where the Bank had an
established track record of strong technical capacity and ample cross-country experience. Rather than
seeking to cover an extensive list of measures, the PL program sought to concentrate on core aspects of
public financial management, labor market efficiency, private sector development, and social sector
expenditures.

Unstable macroeconomic environment. The global economic crisis ended Poland’s fast economic
expansion. However, in contrast to neighboring countries, Poland avoided a decline in economic activity.
Since late 2008, Poland has been hit by two shocks: the recession in high-income countries, which hurt
external demand for exports; and the global financial crisis, which reduced capital inflows and thereby
lowered domestic demand. Nevertheless, growth remained positive throughout 2009. Poland is the only
one of 27 EU member states whose economy continued to expand throughout the crisis. Poland grew by
1.7 percent in 2009, while the EU declined by 4.2 percent and the EU10 region by 3.5. As mentioned
earlier, the unstable macroeconomic environment impacted the design of the PL program. Additional
elements were brought to the program to assist Poland in addressing challenges resulting from the global
economic crisis. The crisis also led to some delays in structural reforms (as foreseen in the early phases
of the program), which were postponed until the recovery gained strength.

Stable political environment and strong government partnership. During the PL period, there was
political stability with the same government in place. Government ownership was crucial for the success
of reforms. The concentration on critically important reform steps facilitated the political ownership of
the program, and thereby made the process easier for the authorities to initiate and to pursue them. The
PL series effectively responded to the Government’s own priorities and commitments as reflected in the
fiscal consolidation and development strategy, the convergence program updates, and Vision 2030.



                                                    9
Analytical underpinnings of the program. PL series was grounded in a strong analytical base. The
Bank carried out extensive analytical work in the areas covered by the PL series. The Bank team
prepared the first Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2009, following Poland’s accession to the EU in
2004. This was a key element in the analytical assistance agreed during the negotiations of the first
lending operation. The PER provided a comprehensive assessment of Poland’s policies in social sectors,
public wages, and performance-based and medium-term budgeting. This work was crucial for selecting
the reform areas to be supported by the PL series and informing the design of specific policy reforms. In
addition, several technical assistance efforts were initiated or completed to inform the policy dialogue in
PL-related areas.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Monitoring of the PL program was based on continuous dialogue with government counterparts to assess
progress and address potential bottlenecks. With team members in the field, monitoring was done on an
on-going basis and supported by complementary TA and AAA activities.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

At the time of writing this ICR, the Government has expressed interest in continuing cooperation in the
area of public finance reform through another development policy loan series. It is anticipated that the
new series will span two operations, covering the period of the CPS FY12-13.

The FY12 and FY13 PLs are expected to support Poland’s fiscal consolidation agenda, including
through strengthening fiscal rules at both central and subnational government levels, improving the
efficiency of public administration, and rationalizing social spending while maintaining strong social
service delivery.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The main objective of the loan series and the pillars remain highly relevant to Poland’s current
development agenda and the Bank’s Partnership Strategy (CPS). Rapid convergence to EU living
standards remains the overarching policy objective of the Polish Government. This has been confirmed
in the recently approved National Reform Program and the Convergence Program Update submitted to
the European Commission (EC) in April 2011, as well as Poland’s commitments under the Euro Plus
Pact. There is broad consensus (including among the EC, the IMF and the OECD) that policy
interventions, focused on strengthening public finance and pursuing structural reforms are crucial for
Poland’s growth prospects. In addition, in view of the global financial crisis and economic slowdown in
early 2009, policies aimed at mitigating the social cost of economic slowdown remain key government
priorities.

The PL series was built around 2005 CPS pillars (Fiscal Consolidation, Convergence and
Competitiveness, and Employment and Poverty). The focus of the CPS was in turn based on the Polish
National Development Plan. Although the PL series itself was not explicitly foreseen in the CPS, it was
fully consistent with Bank interventions along the envisaged strategic pillars of engagement.



                                                    10
The PL program remained central to Bank’s engagement in Poland, as emphasized in the 2009 Country
Partnership Strategy, which was presented to the Board along with the PL2 operation in June 2009.
Given the global financial crisis and the changed macroeconomic circumstances, which resulted in the
biggest economic adjustment after the economic transition in the early 1990s, the PL program was
adjusted to address the challenges related to the economic slowdown. The strategic pillars of the
engagement (public financial management, labor markets, pensions, and private sector development)
remained relevant, and the program additionally expanded to the policy areas of education, health and
social assistance. The macro-oriented and flexible partnership proved well-suited to help Poland mitigate
the impact of the crisis while promoting reforms to support longer-term growth.

The 2011 Update of the CPS acknowledged the progress in most strategic pillars of engagement
delivered by the PL series, and underscored the importance of further support to the government reform
efforts in the areas covered by the program (described in section 2.4).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Achievement of Objectives:
Rating: Satisfactory
PL1: Satisfactory           P2: Satisfactory                          PL3: Satisfactory

The PL series supported a number of policy reforms crucial to maintaining Poland’s convergence
process on track. Poland was the only EU country to avoid any decline in output during the crisis.
Poland’s GDP per capita in purchasing power standards improved by close to 6 percentage points from
2008 to 2010 to reach 62 percent of the EU27 average. This was the best performance among the EU
member states. The EC projects are expected to further convergence in the coming years (Figure 2).

Poland’s robust economic performance suggests that the Government managed to strike the right balance
between ensuring sustainability of public finances, supporting the recovery of the private sector, and
mitigating the social impact of the crisis. Replacing private through public demand during the crisis
shored up growth, strengthened labor markets, and stabilized financial markets. As incomes of
enterprises and households held up, domestic demand performed better than elsewhere in the region,
which in turn supported the balance sheets of the banking sector and translated into continued economic
growth. With growth returning close to its potential towards the end of 2010, the Government was able



                                                       11
to begin tightening fiscal and monetary policy without undermining labor or financial markets, laying the
groundwork for a sustainable economic expansion in the years to come.

Policy reforms supported by the PL series have contributed to the Government’s success over the last
three years. In particular, they have:

     •    strengthened the resilience of the private sector to the economic slowdown (improvements in the
          business environment through the reduction in minimum capital requirements for business start-
          ups (PL1); the amendments of the law on freedom of business operations (PL2); and the

Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown
Rating: Satisfactory

In Mitigating the Social Cost of the Economic Slowdown, the PL series performed satisfactory in
achieving its outcomes and objectives of protecting the vulnerable affected by the economic downturn
and protecting jobs by introducing temporary measures aimed at increasing flexibility of working hours.
The PL series performance in the area of labor market is highly satisfactory and social assistance is
moderately satisfactory.

     •    Labor Market

The PL series supported measures aimed at preserving employment and promoting job creation during
times of economic slowdown. The temporary anti-crisis package supported by the program included a
short-term work subsidy, greater flexibility to adjust working hours, and relaxation of rules governing
the use of fixed-term contracts.

These temporary measures increased labor market flexibility and helped stabilize the employment rate,
including for elderly workers, despite the adverse macroeconomic circumstances. In the June 2011
Article IV Staff Report, the IMF advocated extending those temporary flexible employment provisions
beyond 2011. The employment rate in Poland increased from 57 percent in 2007 to 59.3 percent in
2010, the best performance among countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

    •   Social Assistance

Combating poverty and social exclusion, and in particular assisting families with children, are among the
key priorities of the Polish Government, as delineated in the National Reform Program of April 2011.
The reduction in the number of people in or at risk of poverty or exclusion is also one of the main
Europe 2020 targets.

The PL series supported government activities aimed at protecting vulnerable groups from the impact of
the global crisis. Linked to the provision of a reserve in the 2009 budget to protect the vulnerable
affected by the economic downturn, the Government continued to strengthen the social assistance system
by reforming family benefits. The system was seriously challenged by “leakage? of benefits to non-poor
groups.

In spite of the tight fiscal envelope, the Government approved an increase of monthly child benefits by
about 31 percent in real terms to improve the living standards of vulnerable households with children. It
also sought to improve targeting of social assistance expenditure by leaving the income threshold for
eligibility unchanged. The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis performed in 2010 suggests that the
increase in family benefits in response to the crisis was expected to reduce the increase in the poverty
headcount from a 0.7 percentage point to 0.4 in 2010.

The increase in family benefits helped to increase the efficiency of public spending on social assistance
for the poorest households and make them more effective in alleviating poverty. The household budget
survey data show that the share of social assistance going to the poorest quintile increased steadily from
31.3 percent in 2007 to 36.9 percent in 2010. This was somewhat below the target of 38 percent.

Strengthening Public Finance;
Rating: Satisfactory

In Strengthening Public Finance, the PL series helped to maintain the reform momentum in the areas of
social services, including in education, health, pensions, and the labor market despite unfavorable
macroeconomic environment. Key national thresholds for public debt level were adhered to, even though
the targets of key outcome indicators for both fiscal deficit and public debt were not met. While the PL
series supported institutional public finance reforms, these fiscal variables are high order outcome
indicators mainly impacted in by the overall macroeconomic environment the short run.


                                                        13
The overall PL performance in Strengthening Public Finance was satisfactory, with some areas
performing strongly being counterbalanced by those that lagged. Within this pillar, the PL series focused
on the area of Public Financial Management (moderately satisfactory), Pensions (moderately
satisfactory), Health (moderately satisfactory), Education (satisfactory), and Labor Market (highly
satisfactory).

  This outcome indicator was added in PL3 operation when it was clear that the public debt in Poland would increase as a result
of economic slowdown. Nevertheless, it was supposed to ensure that public debt would stay at sustainable level below the key
national and Maastricht thresholds.


                                                                  14

    •    Public Financial Management

The PL series supported government activities aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit and tax burden in a
sustainable manner, improving transparency and predictability of fiscal policy, and increasing
effectiveness and efficiency of public spending. At the time of economic slowdown, it was crucial to
keep the public debt below the national public debt thresholds.

The ambitious fiscal consolidation agenda in Poland was interrupted by the global financial crisis and
economic slowdown in early 2009. Real output growth dropped to 1.6 percent in 2009 from 5.1 percent
in 2008. The resilience of the Polish economy during the crisis reflected the interplay of several factors,
including the absence of large macroeconomic imbalance, relatively low trade openness, favorable
export structure, and a timely monetary and fiscal policy response. The latter included the PIT reform
and a reduction of disability contribution (both reforms supported by PL1), which provided an additional
boost for domestic consumption.

The outcome indicator targets for the fiscal deficit and general government public debt were missed.
Nevertheless, there is broad consensus that the government’s fiscal policy during the crisis was
moderately satisfactory for four reasons:
   (i) the government’s countercyclical fiscal policy was crucial for preventing an economic recession
             as private sector investment and exports collapsed during the crisis;
   (ii) the overrun in fiscal deficit targets (the general government deficit rose steadily from 3.7 percent
             of GDP in 2008 to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2009 and 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010, despite
             some consolidation measures enacted in 2010) was mainly due to under-runs in revenues
             rather than over-runs in expenditures. The underperformance of revenues was caused by
             weaker-than-expected tax collection, linked mainly to low corporate income tax collection,
             as enterprises used loss carry-over provisions to lower tax returns;
   (iii) the Government is still on track in terms of meeting the obligations under the Excessive Deficit
             Procedure of the EU. The Convergence Program Update from April 2011 assumes that
             Poland is set to reduce excessive general government deficit by 2012 in line with the
             Council recommendation for eliminating the excessive deficit situation from July 2009. To
             support fiscal adjustment, the Government has already amended the law on public finance to
             limit the growth of discretionary state budget expenditures, which include the wage bill of
             the budgetary sphere and new legally mandated expenditure, to one percent in excess of
             inflation. The Government is working on reforming the pension system of the uniformed
             services. In addition, the investments in the area of public roads, financed from the National
             Road Fund, are also set to be reduced by about 2.2 percent of 2010 GDP over the next three
             years. In spite of this, the share of public investments in GDP will remain significantly
             above the EU average and will reach about 4.6% in 2014. Finally, the Government has
             commenced work on a permanent fiscal rule imposing relevant limitations on the growth of
             public expenditure, ensuring in particular that the share of expenditure in GDP will not rise
             permanently, and tightened further fiscal rules for local governments.
   (iv) institutional reforms of public finances remained on track. In late 2009, the Parliament enacted
             the new Public Finance Act, which significantly strengthened transparency, efficiency, and
             quality of the budgetary process in Poland. Among others, the new legislation introduced a
             medium-term fiscal framework (a four-year financial plan of the state) and performance-
             based-budgeting, enhanced debt safety procedures, strengthened control and internal budget
             audit, and increased budget transparency through consolidation of some budgetary units, and
             establishing a separate budget for the EU funds.



                                                    15
In the course of the economic slowdown 2008-10, Poland’s public debt to GDP ratio increased by 7.9
percent to reach 54.9 percent of GDP in 2010. The general government debt is projected to fall gradually
in the next few years to reach around 50 percent of GDP in 2014. The strong economic recovery, a
steady appreciation in the exchange rate, fiscal consolidation, better public sector cash management,
stepped-up privatization, and strengthened public debt thresholds at the local level are projected to be
sufficient to maintain public debt below key national and EU thresholds. The Public Finance Act
reinforces prudent fiscal policy, as it prompts corrective action when the public debt reaches 55 percent
of GDP, in addition to the Constitutional ceiling for public debt at 60 percent of GDP. A breach of the
national 55 percent public debt threshold will trigger an automatic increase in the VAT rate by 1
percentage point, in addition to other measures such as a nominal freeze in budgetary wages and a
change in pension indexation rules. A breach of the Constitutional limit implies a freeze on any new
government guarantees, a zero budget deficit target for the next year, and an enactment of a
rehabilitation program that brings down the public debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent.
In support of public debt and deficit reduction, the Government reduced the contribution rate to private
Open Pension Funds from 7.3 percent to 2.3 percent of gross wages, and shifted the 5 percent of gross
wages into notional individual accounts of the state pension system starting May 2011. While this
measure improves current fiscal balances, it leads to higher implicit pension liabilities in the long run,
leaving the overall fiscal position broadly unchanged.

    •   Pensions

The PL series supported the government efforts to reduce the number of pensioners below the statutory
retirement age as well as reforms aimed to increase efficiency of the second pillar.

PL2 supported the “bridge pensions? reform, which curtailed occupational privileges for early
retirement. This resulted in a decrease in the number of people eligible for early retirement by 75 percent
(to around 250,000). The option to retire earlier was limited to employees working in difficult working
conditions and early pensions for those workers were supposed to be partially financed from additional
employers’ contributions. The law also closed the window that allowed retiring five years before the
statutory ages (at 55 for woman and 60 for men). As a result, the labor force participation rates have
increased, especially among older women, and the percentage of new pensioners receiving early
pensions dropped from 82 percent in 2007 to 55.6 percent in 2010. The phasing out of the early pension
provision has had significant effect on the planned fiscal consolidation. The cumulative impact of this
reform is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit by close to 1 percent of GDP in 2011-12.

Given the increased importance of the second pillar in financing future pensions, the PL program (PL3)
supported reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of the funded pillar. The Government approved the
law on limiting the management and contribution fees charged by the General Pension Society. As a
result, an average contribution fee charged by Pension Fund Association (PTE) to Open Pension Funds
(OPF) members decreased from 6 percent in 2008 to less than 3.5 percent in 2010. In addition, a cap on
the management fee was imposed at PLN15.5 million per month once a fund reaches PLN45 billion in
assets. This measure ensured that Polish pension funds continue to operate with low costs in contrast to
other reforming countries at a time when the cost-effectiveness of the funded pillar is under close public
scrutiny.

As the crisis has shown, payout options for the funded pillar need to be designed so that they are flexible
enough to withstand market fluctuations while protecting workers. The PL series (PL3) was supposed to
support changes in legislation to enable multiple portfolios within the second pillar, but the government




                                                    16
discussion on pension reform delayed the preparation of this legislation5. The Government remains
committed to this reform, as outlined in the National Reform Program.

    •    Health

The PL series supported two important reforms aimed at managing pressures for cost and expenditure
escalation in the health sector. The first policy action (supported by PL2 and PL3) was intended to
contain the increase in public hospital indebtedness by providing financial incentives to local
governments that decided to convert their public hospitals into corporate entities operating under the
Commercial Code. The second program (supported by PL2) was aimed at reducing costs within the
health care system by introducing treatment guidelines for diagnostically related groups (DRGs).

The Council of Ministers program (CoM program) of hospital corporatization was initiated in 2009. It
was the Cabinet’s response to the presidential veto on the law on hospitals’ corporatization. In contrast to
this law, which assumed that the change in the legal status would be obligatory for all hospitals, the CoM
program was voluntary. The program includes compensation by the state for unpaid social insurance
contributions and a PLN one-for-one matching of any reductions in arrears to suppliers that the local
government was able to negotiate. Nevertheless, the program has been advancing slower than expected.
By the end of 2010, 24 hospitals were corporatized under this program, against the target of 60.

Local governments viewed hospital corporatization as a politically sensitive topic, especially prior to
local elections in late 2010. However, despite the slow pace the program remains broadly on track.
     (i) The program will expire by end 2011. The Ministry of Health has seen an increase in the
             program uptake of local governments. MoH has received expressions of interest from 73
             health care entities to participate in the CoM program this year.
     (ii) From July 2011 onwards, local government units will have a stronger incentive to corporatize
             their health care entities. The new Law on Therapeutic Activity, signed by the President in
             May 2011, stipulates that local governments will have to cover potential losses of their
             health care entities from their budgets, unless they are transformed into commercial code
             companies.
The PL series also supported the introduction of DRG-based payments for Polish hospitals. DRGs
classify treatments according to their costs, by employing a complete and consistent coding system of
patient-level information obtained from medical records to establish and cost bundles of appropriate
inputs for one or more diagnosis-based treatments. The DRG system provides a valuable tool not only
for reimbursing hospitals but also for overall planning and resource management. Starting in 2010, NHF
was able to start analyzing DRG data to understand efficiency characteristics of hospitals and to
formulate future reimbursement policies to encourage attentiveness to costs by hospitals. By the end of
the year, 1,279 hospitals out of 1,386 had the DRG system in place. This means that 91 percent of
hospitals were covered by the DRG system. Many of them are currently fully covered by the system, but
in some cases the DRG roll-out is still ongoing.

    •    Education

Building on the substantive reforms of the late 1990s, Poland continued its extensive efforts to
modernize all levels of its education system. The 2009 OECD PISA results confirm Poland’s
remarkable performance.



5
 The Government reduced the contribution rate to private Open Pension Funds from 7.3 percent to 2.3 percent of gross wages,
and shifted the 5 percent of gross wages into notional individual accounts of the state pension system starting May 2011.


                                                            17
    The PL series supported the government efforts to reform pre-primary, primary, and higher education. In
    pre-primary education, the PL program (PL2 and PL3) supported increasing enrollment rates of 3-5 year
    olds and lowering the age of mandatory primary education age to 6. In the area of higher education, PL3
    supported policy action related to increasing the equity within the system of student loans.

    Poland has one of the lowest enrollment rates for pre-primary education in the EU. The law supported by
    the PL program introduced mandatory pre-school education of 5 year-old children from 2011-12
    onward, and mandatory primary school education of 6 year-old children from 2012-13 onwards. The
    enrollment rates for 3-5 year olds have already increased from 45 percent in 2007 to 60 percent in 2010.
    Better access to childcare for 3-5 year olds will also have positive implications on labor market prospects
    for young and elderly women in particular. Although the primary school education of 6 year-old children
    will be mandatory from 2012-13 onwards, the enrollment rate of 6 year-olds have already increased. In
    the school year 2010-11, 12.6 percent of 6 year olds who previously attended kindergartens have used
    the opportunity to go to school earlier.

    PL3 also supported a government resolution on the principles, modes, and criteria for granting, repaying,
    and amortizing student loans and credits. This measure was intended to foster equity within the student
    loan system. In fact, the percentage of students who submitted a loan application, met the criteria, but
    failed to obtain the loan because of lack of collateral decreased from 10.2 percent in 2007 to 9.4 percent
    in 2010. The target was not met but the value of the indicator has improved significantly as compared to
    2009 value of 12.2 percent. At the same time, the percent of student credits with collateral in the total
    number of student credits increased from 14 in 2007 to 35 percent in 2010. Moreover, the number of
    loans guaranteed by the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego increased more than twofold compared to
    academic year 2009-10, increasing from 2,616 to 5,753. In academic year 2010-11, over 30 percent of all
    loans were covered by either 100 percent or 70 percent guarantees.

           •        Labor Market

    The PL series supported labor market policies aimed at reducing the tax wedge and implementation of
    government program to increase labor force participation of older workers. PL1 supported the reduction
    in disability contribution from 13 percent to 6 percent of wages in 2007-08. This was followed by the
    PIT rate cut in 2009. Both measures lowered the tax wedge in Poland; however, it still remains relatively
    high compared with other countries in the region. The “50+? program supported by PL2 had a positive
    impact on increasing the employment rate of the population aged 55-64 from 29.7 percent in 2007 to 34
    percent in 2010.

    Pursuing Structural Reforms
    Rating: Satisfactory

    In Pursuing Structural Reforms, the PL series proved satisfactory in achieving its outcomes and
    objectives geared to simplify procedures and formalities that restrained SMEs activity, enabling them to
    make better use of the European single market and advancing the privatization agenda. The progress in
    supporting private sector development was satisfactory.

         •    Private Sector Development

    Over the course of the PL series, the Government made advances in improving the regulatory
    environment for business activity. Apart from lowering the minimum capital requirement for business
    start-ups from PLN 50,000 to PLN 5,000, the Government introduced one-stop-shop regulations to
    further accelerate business start-ups (PL1 and PL2). While those steps improved the business
    environment, the Government plans to continue its deregulation agenda to facilitate business activity and
    lower its costs by, inter alia, limiting documentation and licensing requirements. The PL series also
    supported a privatization agenda under the ambitious four-year government privatization plan,
    envisaging the privatization of about 800 state companies from several business sectors. The plan was
    adopted in mid-2008. The global financial crisis in late 2008 slowed the implementation of this plan, but
    it gained momentum in 2010, when market conditions improved. In 2010, privatization receipts totaled
    PLN 22bn (1.6 percent of GDP), comprising almost 90 percent of the PLN 25bn target. By the end of
    2010, 412 state-owned companies were successfully privatized (partly or completely). The PL3
    operation continued to support private sector development through supporting the Law on Delivery of
    Services in the Republic of Poland. The law aimed at reducing barriers to delivery of services by both
    domestic and EU-based firms and increasing product market competition by opening Poland’s service
    sector to EU competition. It has contributed to increasing Poland’s share in total intra-EU trade in
    services from 2.2 percent in 2008 to 2.6 percent in 2010.

    3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

    Rating: Satisfactory



                                                                    19
PL1: Satisfactory               P2: Satisfactory                  PL3: Satisfactory

The overall PL series has delivered highly relevant progress in the areas targeted. The objectives of the
loan set at the time of its approval still remain highly relevant.

Despite the unfavorable macroeconomic environment, the reform agenda of the Government was not
compromised and the scope of reforms supported by the PL series was broadened. The program was
largely implemented as planned and the foreseen program outcomes were achieved.

In summary, the PL series has satisfactorily supported public financial management, social sectors, and
private sector development reforms. At the end of the series, while the outstanding reform agenda is still
significant, the institutional and policy foundations for future reforms appear stronger in each of the
pillars.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In recent years, Poland has significantly reduced the number of people facing poverty and social
exclusion. The rise in household incomes in recent years translated into a lower poverty rates based on
commonly used poverty thresholds in Poland. Using the social assistance threshold as the poverty line,
poverty declined from 14.6 percent in 2007 to 10.6 percent in 2008, and despite the crisis declined even
more to 8.3 percent in 2009. Despite the progress, poverty is still a problem, especially among the
unemployed, elderly, and families with more than three children.

The PL series has attempted to address poverty outcomes by supporting:
   (i) measures aimed at providing access to work for disadvantaged population groups through
             promoting labor market and pension reforms (decrease in tax wedge, introducing labor
             market flexibility measures, bridge pensions reform, and 50+ program);
   (ii) measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the economic slowdown on businesses, families, and
             workers by ensuring resources in the state budget to protect the vulnerable affected by the
             economic downturn; and has increasing family benefits.
   (iii) the Government’s countercyclical policies during the crisis which boosted economic growth,
             sustained employment, and limited the rise in household indebtedness. Beyond 2010, the PL
             series supported medium-term fiscal consolidation, which is critical for a sustainable
             recovery of growth. This in turn will facilitate employment creation and poverty reduction
             over time.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The Bank’s assistance to Poland under the PL series supported numerous reforms aimed at institutional
strengthening across the PL pillars. Technical Assistance activities under the umbrella of PL series have
had a more direct impact on institutional development than the loans.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Over the course of the PL series, there was a gradual positive change in Bank–Government relations. PL
loans opened a new chapter in the Bank’s collaboration with Poland. The PL1 program was the first
policy lending operation in Poland which was a type of instrument that worked well in Poland’s current
economic circumstances As such it led to a strategic re-engagement of the Bank in core policy areas of
Government’s reform program. This single operation increased Bank’s lending exposure to Poland by
nearly 50 percent. In addition, the disbursement of the first loan coincided with the escalation of the
global crisis in fall 2008, when the financial and advisory support from the Bank was most wanted. It
helped to avoid additional costs of external financing, as risk aversion to emerging markets increased
substantially, and in the first phase of the crisis, financial markets did not sufficiently differentiate the
country risks.

The PL series also laid groundwork for the Energy Efficiency Development Policy Loan, approved by
the Board in June 2011, and the future series of PL loans in the area of public finance (see section 2.4).

Ratings: Moderate
PL1: Moderate                    P2: Moderate                      PL3: Moderate

Throughout the PL series, three main risks to achievement of Development Outcome were identified:
-Economic risks                 PL1: Significant        P2: Significant       PL3: Significant
-Political risks                PL1: Moderate           P2: Moderate          PL3: Moderate
-Institutional capacity risks   PL1: Moderate           P2: Low               PL3: Low

Economic risks. The impact of the global financial crisis and the economic slowdown on Poland’s
macroeconomic situation was a significant risk throughout the PL series. Although the nature of this risk
changed from PL1 (complete uncertainty about the impact of the crisis on Polish economy) to PL3 (risks
related to the speed of recovery in Europe and stabilization of financial markets), the medium-term
outlook was subject to significant downside risks. Both the structure of the Polish economy and the
government’s policy responses to the deteriorating macroeconomic situation proved to be important
mitigation factors. In fact, Poland was the only EU country to avoid any decline in output during the
crisis.

In the context of the global crisis, the economic risks were to a large extent beyond the government’s
control. A worsening in the external environment could slow down growth in Poland, and possibly delay
the ambitious fiscal consolidation agenda, which is central to Poland’s further development.

Political risks. At the time of PL series political risks were moderate. The coalition government lacked
qualified majority in Parliament and there was a big risk that the President could veto the government’s
new legislation. However, the inherent flexibility of the proposed PL series allowed the program content
to evolve in step with government priorities.

Institutional capacity risks. The risk of insufficient institutional capacity that would impede the reform
process in Poland was low. Although the policy formulation tended to be fragmented and sometimes
technical and administrative capacity in some ministries was weaker than desirable, the progress in
reforms was sustained.          The PL series helped to strengthen policy coordination and
technical/administrative capacity through analytic and advisory services (see also section 3.4.b).

    •   The loan was underpinned by strong analytical work and other forms of policy dialogue and
        technical support;
    •   The work was well-coordinated within the Bank’s multi-sectoral team;
    •   The Bank managed to flexibly adjust the program to changes in economic and social
        developments.
    •   PL series was delivered in a timely manner at the onset of the crisis.

Rating: Satisfactory
PL1: Satisfactory               P2: Satisfactory                 PL3: Satisfactory

As all prior actions were completed before the loan went to the Board, and the supervision was
considered embedded in the preparation of each DPL in the series. Thus, preparation for subsequent
DPLs entailed continuous dialogue with the Government and follow-up on triggers, which served as the
de facto focus of supervision. With team members in the field, monitoring of progress towards outcome
indicators was done on a relatively continuous basis. The process was supported by various ministries.
Budgetary, legislative and economic data was provided by authorities and verified in official disclosures,
directives and regulations. In addition, the dialogue with the government was supported by an ongoing
technical assistance activities directly or indirectly supported by the DPL program.

Rating: Satisfactory
PL1: Satisfactory               P2: Satisfactory                 PL3: Satisfactory

Bank performance both at entry and during supervision benefitted from the close linkage with the
Government’s own strategic reform pillars and the Bank’s DPL Program. This led to a strong interlinked
series of reforms and limited the potential for moving away from addressing the carefully defined
program of reforms aimed at dealing with the both internal and exogenous threats to the economic,
financial and social areas of the Program over its three-year duration.

The Implementing Agency Ministry of Finance played a consistent and effective role in maintaining
progress on the triggers. It also used the PL series to strengthen inter-ministerial coordination.
Nevertheless, the performance of implementing line agencies was mixed. This ICR does not go into
detail about the various line ministries, as each pillar involved working with several different
implementing agencies over three years. While some agencies were responsive, others sometimes
resented the imposition of DPL triggers--particularly when their unit would not directly benefit from the
DPL tranches.
Overall the performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
PL1: Satisfactory                P2: Satisfactory            PL3: Satisfactory

Over the life-cycle of the DPL series the Bank and Borrower worked closely together. The Ministry of
Finance, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, and the sector ministries were attentive to the agreed
triggers for each loan. This sustained commitment reflected the Government’s own commitment to the
reform pillars, which was well embedded into the Government’s overall reform agenda. Hence, the
Program was able to achieve its stated development objectives and, based on this experience, prepare for
a subsequent series of reform.

6. Lessons Learned

    1. Ideally DPLs should be based on previous technical assistance successes and salient cross-
       country experience. The Poland PL series focused on areas of strategic relevance where the
       Bank had first established a record of strong technical capacity and ample cross-country
       experience. Instead of covering an extensive array of measures, the program concentrated of
       core aspects of public financial management, labor market efficiency, private sector
       development, and social sector expenditures.
    2. DPLs should be grounded in prior strong analytical groundwork, which, in turn, can provide the
       necessary rationale for selection of policy and program reform areas, as was the case in Poland.
    3. Creditworthy middle income-countries benefit most from programs that permit adequate
       flexibility to account for rapid responses to changing circumstances, especially during times of
       crisis. This was the case in Poland, when social sector related actions needed to be fine-tuned
       and indicators adjusted accordingly.
    4. A Bank-Borrower partnership rooted in a country-specific reform agenda must be in place
       before a DPL series is undertaken. The concentration of critically important reform steps
       facilitate political ownership of the program, and make the process easier for the authorities to
       initiate and implement. The Poland program responded to Government’s own priorities and
       commitments, which were articulated in the fiscal consolidation and development strategy, the
       convergence program, and Vision 2030.
    5. Development Policy Lending proved to be an instrument that served well Poland in the times of
       the global financial crisis and economic slowdown. It effectively supported the government’s
       reform agenda. The counterparts appreciated DPL instrument due to its flexibility and lower
       transaction costs as compared with the traditional investment lending.
