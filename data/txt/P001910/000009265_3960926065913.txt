MRAMOWJDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANK OF MAURITIUS
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL FINANCE PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Bank of Mauritius
(BOM) for the equivalent of US$10 million is submitted for approval.  It
would help finance, through a line of credit, investment projects in
manufacturing, transport, tourism and industrial building construction.
The proposed lean would be repayable over 17 years, including 4 years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and charges. It would
have a flexible amortization schedule that would substantially conform with
the aggregate of the amortization schedules of subloans made by PFIs. BON
would on-lend the proceeds of the line of credit in foreign exchange to two
participating financial institutions (PFIs): the Development Bank of
Mauritius (DBM) and the State Commercial Bank (SCB), at the Bank's variable
rate plus a modest administration fee to cover the costs of coordinating
the project. The PFIs would be free to set interest rates to final
beneficiaries and are expected to pass on the foreign exchange risk. The
rates are expec:.-d to provide a spread of 2.5-3Z to the PFIs.
2.        Background.  The Mauritian economy is in its fourth year of rapid
expansion. After a period of stagnation during 1979-1983, GDP expanded by
4.6% in 1984, a further 6.5% in 1985, and an estimated 7.9% in 1986. The
engine behind this remarkable performance is the ongoing boom in
manufactured exports, which now account for over 50% of Mauritius'
exports. This makes Mauritius one of the true success stories of
export-led manufacturing growth. Since 1970, when the Export Processing
Zone (EPZ) Act was enacted, Mauritius' manufactured exports have grown at
remarkably high rates. Exports grew at over 10% p.a. during the 1970s and,
after a period of relatively low growth in the early 1980's, they have
grown at over 30% p.a. in real terms during the last four years, as a
result of the sound policy framework adopted by the Government which
increased the competitiveness of Mauritian exports. lhe Government
provides a comprehensive package of incentives for exporters, including low
corporate taxes, duty free import of inputs and capital goods, and access
to credit and serviced industrial sites. The tourism sector has also
contributed to the upswing of the economy, with growth of about 12% in
1986. As a result of the ongoing investment boom, the demand for foreign
exchange to finance new investments in productive sectors and to develop
industrial sites has increased significantly.
3.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the project would be
to: (i) support the Government's strategy of export-led growth by
providing funds for manufacturing, transport and tourism subprojects and
construction of industrial buildings; (ii) encourage competition among
financial institutions in providing term finance by giving access to long
term foreign currency resources to DBM, and for the first time to SCB; and
(iii) strengthen DBM institutionally so that it is better able to respond
to the economy's growing need for term finance.

4.        Project Description.  Under the proposed project, BNM would be
the borrower and wo         on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan to two
participating financial institutions (PFIs): the Development Bank of
Mauritius (DBM) and the State Commercial Bank (SCB), which are both
Government-owned. The PFIs would relend the proceeds of the loan to
eligible subborrowers for financing medium and large-scale manufacturing,
transport and tourism subprojecto and construction of industrial
buildings. There would be a notional preallocation of US$6 million
equivalent to DBM and US$4 million equivalent to SCB. However, since the
line of credit would be available to the PFIs on a 'first come-first
served' basis, these amounts could be later adjusted according to the PFI's
requirements. A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) in the BOM would have
overall responsibilities for coordinating and administering the loan and
for the accreditation of the PFIs. The estimated project costs and
financing plan are given in Schedule A. Anounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, as well as a disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group Operations in Mauritius are given in Schedule C and D respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report, N6708-MAS dated March 14, 1988 is attached.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank supported the
Government's adoption of an export-led industrialization strategy through
two SALs and further supported greater trade liberalization through the
recently approved (April 1987) Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan (ISAL).
The financial sector has responded well to the financing requirements of
the industrial sector. However, the capacity of the financial sector to
provide adequate term financing in support of continued export-led growth
is being constrained by: (i) DBM's staffing and organizational
limitations; (ii) commercial banks' limited project appraisal capability;
and (iii) lack of adequate longer term resources, particularly in the form
of deposits, in the commercial banks. The Bank would help address these
constraints by setting up a mechanism whereby two banks, DBM and SCB, would
have access to long term foreign currency resources to lend for long term
investments. Through this project, the Bank would also be in a position to
help strengthen DBM's organization and management and develop SCB's project
evaluation capacity. The mechanism could be later expanded to include
other financial institutions. By developing capabilities and increasing
competition in the supply of term financing, the Bank would help improve
the efficiency of financial intenmediation in Mauritius. This project
would also lead to a close working relationship between the Government and
the Bank in fientifying ways to improve the ability of the financial sector
to respond to the neede of Mauritius' expanding economy. This would
include broadening the financial intermediation process and developing the
capital market.
6.        Actions Agreed.  Agreement has been reached with BOM that it
would: (a) permit foreign exchange earning enterprises benefitting from
the project to maintain foreign currency denominated accounts with at least
one installment of principal and interest due under their subloan; (b)
supervise the carrying out by PFIs of their obligations under their
respective Subsidiary Financing Agreements; and (c) submit progress reports
and audited financial statements relating to the project. As a condition
of loan effectiveness, the BOM would: (a) confirm appointment of the PCC



-3-
staff and their terms of reference; and (b) enter into Subsidiary Financing
Agreements with the PFIs. Agreement has beenu reached with the Government
that it would: (a) consult with the Bank regarding the appointment of the
Managing Director of DBM; and (b) provide DBM with the needed equity in
order to maintain its debt equity ratio below 4:1. DBM has recently
revised its Policy Statement to include Bank suggestions regarding interest
rates, rental policies and accounting practices. In order to improve its
portfol. o performance, DBM has already started implementing a debt recovery
action plan in agreement with the Bank and has created a special division
to monitor clients in arrears.  Agreement has been reached with Government
that it would cause DBM to furnish its debt recovery action program for
each financial year to the Bank for its review and comments, until debt and
rental arrears have been reduced to a level satisfactory to the Bank, and
following adoption of a satisfactory program, cause DBM to implement it.
7.        Justification.  The proposed project would:  (a) contribute
towards Mauritius' foreign exchange earnings, job creation and the growth
of production and Income; (b) increase competition in the supply of medium
and long term credit by providing, for the first time, access to long term
foreign currency resources to a commercial bank (SCB) in addition to DBM,
thus paving the way for further participation by the commercial banks in
long-term project financing; and (c) strengthen DBM, which has hitherto
been the major institutional source of long term finance, and thereby
enabling it to better serve the needs of the economy.
8.        Risks.  The main risk of the project is initial procedural delays
due to the-uiUfamiliarity of SCB with Bank requirements for sub-project
appraisal and processing. In addition, the project may be delayed if DBI's
management is unable to Improve its debt recovery and loan processing
capabilities as envisaged in the project*  These risks have been minimized
by the provision of approprt6te material to SCB to acquaint its
professional staff with Bank requirements, prior to loan effectiveness.
Also, DBM has taken initial steps to strengthen its organization and middle
management and is implementing a debt recovery action plan agreed with the
Bank. Furthermore, the expected incorporation of DBM under the Companies
Act would facilitate further strengthening of DIM's management and staff.
9.        Recommendations.  I an satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of 4greement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

through the Bank of Mauritius to two Mauritian banks
for them to finance eligible sub-projects. mhe
conventional project cost table is therefore not
applicable.
Financing Plan:         The line of credit is expected to finance up to
about 60% of investment costs of subprojects
(including permanent working capital), Which
corresponds to the estimated foreign exchange
component of industrial investments in Mauritius.
Investors are expected to contribute a minimum of
252 to the total cost of the investment in the form
of equity, and the rest would be contributed by
local financial institutions.
