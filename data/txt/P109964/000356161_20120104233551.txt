1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Burundi is one of the poorest countries in Africa and over the last two decades has
suffered from considerable political and economic turbulence, negative economic growth,
and stagnation, resulting in remarkably low socio economic and health indicators. With a
gross income per capita of $380, Burundi has a total expenditure on health per capita of
$49 but much of this is out of pocket and public expenditure remains low.

2.      The project appraisal was conducted just three months after a new Government
was formed. This transition saw the abolition of the Ministry of State at the President
Office in charge of HIV/AIDS and the creation of a Ministry of Health and HIV/AIDS
with a Vice-Minister in charge of HIV/AIDS control activities.

3.      Data from the 2007 National Sero-Prevalence and Socio Behavioral Surveillance
(NSPSBS) show a slight decrease in HIV prevalence in the general population to 3.0%
from an estimated 3.2% in 2002 (2002 BSS). The prevalence rate among commercial sex
workers (CSWs) was found to be 38%. Results of this study only became available after
the project appraisal. The survey suggested a significant variation in prevalence rates
within the country and an apparent rapid increase in prevalence in rural areas. The main
factors driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic appear to be commercial sex work, widespread
presence of multiple concurrent partnerships, and low rates of male circumcision.

4.      This Project is a successor to a Project financed through a US$36 million IDA
Credit in the context of the second round of the Bank’s Multi-country HIV/AIDS
Program (MAP). Despite a constrained environment, the first project has been
implemented successfully. Activities financed under this first IDA Credit were carried
out with minimal delays and the Project achieved its development objectives with
satisfactory ratings.

5.      As encouraging as those results were, they remained insufficient to stop the
transmission of HIV/AIDS or to reduce its impact on affected families. This is not
surprising as only 30 percent of the activities under the Burundi’s 2002-2006 National
HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) were financed, mainly through the IDA Credit. In addition,
there were many institutional, technical, financial, and capacity-related issues that
constrained the implementation of the NHAS. Lessons learned from the implementation
of the first strategy were used to develop the second 2007-2011 NHAS. In order to
leverage the country’s limited financial and human resources, the 2007- 2011 NHAS
introduced changes in the focus and scope of operations for HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment.




                                            1
6.      The rationale for the Bank’s involvement in HIV/AIDS in Burundi has been
reflected in the Bank’s sector strategies. Strategic guidance and lesson learned reflected
in the 2006 “AIDS Program of Action?, and the Health, Nutrition and Population
Strategy published under the name of “Healthy Development?, (2007), were central to
the Project’s design. Specifically, the Bank provided technical assistance to strengthen
the 2007-2011 NHAS, and to ensure the synergy between health system strengthening
and HIV/AIDS interventions. The Project’s focus on results and accountability stemmed
directly from the strategies referred to above. Consolidating and scaling-up effective
interventions under the first project were essential to progress towards achieving the
country’s MDGs.

7.       In national and international fora, the Government, communities and partner
agencies have indicated that they consider IDA’s continuing involvement in Burundi’s
National Program as critical, particularly regarding multisectoral capacity and in the areas
of prevention and support to civil society through subprojects and capacity building
activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The Project's development objective (PDO) as presented in the PAD was “to
increase the utilization of a selected set of preventive services, among groups highly
vulnerable to, or affected by HIV/AIDS? and was to be tracked through a set of three
PDO indicators and ten intermediate output indicators. However, the Financial
Agreement adds the treatment dimension to the PDO. Indeed, component 2 specifically
provides funding for performance-based curative services. Also, component 3 provides
grants to vulnerable families to increase treatment compliance. Two of the seven PDO
indicators monitor treatment services. The PDO, as stated in the signed Financing
Agreement reads as follows: “The objective of the Project is to increase the coverage of a
selected set of preventive and treatment services among groups highly vulnerable to, or
affected by, HIV/ AIDS.? The Government and the Bank project team were aware of the
omission from the PAD of what was an important component of the PDO. Unfortunately,
this discrepancy was not well handled during an earlier HNP sector wide exercise
(undertaken in 2008) to harmonize PADs and respective FAs.

9.      The key performance indicators included in the results framework were selected
from indicators of the NHAS to measure the achievement of the project development
objective. They include: (i) percentage of female sex workers who report using a condom
with their most recent client, (ii) percentage of women and men aged 15-49 who report
having sex with more than one partner in the last 12 months which report having used a
condom in the last sexual act, (iii) number and value of subprojects targeting vulnerable
populations and high risk groups (iv) percentage and number of adults and children with
advanced HIV infection receiving antiretroviral combination therapy, (v) number of
HIV+ pregnant women who received antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of mother-
to-child transmission (MTCT) versus the expected number of HIH+ pregnant women,
(vi) number of persons living with HIV/AIDS reached through small grant activities, and



                                             2
(vii) number of public sector organizations that have HIV control-related activities in the
annual plans or sector strategies.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
    and reasons/justification:

10.    NA

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.      The primary beneficiaries of the Project were: (i) people belonging to vulnerable
groups such as commercial sex workers, demobilized ex-combatant, internally displace
persons (IDPs), youth, Batwa (an ethnic minority), transport bus touts, handicapped
persons, domestic workers, uniformed personnel, fishermen, seasonal workers, drug users,
prisoners, (ii) people living with HIV/AIDS and affected individuals and families, and
(iii) pregnant women and their babies.

1.5 Original Components

12.    Component 1: Preventive Services Targeted to High Risk Groups (IDA financing:
US$7 million) financed (i) IEC and behavior change activities to be implemented by
CSOs, NGOs, community groups, professional associations and line ministries (other
than Ministry of Health (MoH), and( ii) direct transfers to the MoH to finance
performance based contracts for public and private service providers to support PMTCT
and male circumcision.

13.    Component 2: Performance-Based Curative Services (IDA financing: US$2
million) supported the expansion of ARVs country wide, using performance based
contracting arrangements to be managed by the MoH (where the SEP/CNLS had
managed this in MAP I).

14.     Component 3: Decentralized Financing of Small Grants to Families Living with
HIV/AIDS and High Risk Groups (IDA financing: US$ 3 million) used mechanisms
applied in the first project to finance subprojects managed by NGOS, community groups
to provide small grants to vulnerable families.

15.   Component 4: Capacity Building for Local Authorities and Key Ministries to
Implement HIV/AIDS Activities, and National Program Management (IDA financing:
US$ 3 million) supported HIV/AIDS activities in key ministries and local governments,
improving the operations and management of SEP/CNLS.

1.6 Revised Components

16.   The components were not revised. The MTR proposed changes to the PDO and
components with a revised results framework but the project was not restructured.

                                             3
Management rejected a request for additional financing as well as an extension of the
project closing date.


1.7 Other significant changes

17.     The results based financing (RBF) which started during the first MAP Project on
a very limited scale was extended to the entire country during the second MAP.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

a.       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparation

18.    The Project preparation built on lessons learned and good practices from its
predecessor which was rated satisfactory.

19.    The preparation process was highly participatory and included members from the
Ministry of Health and HIV/AIDS, other public institutions involved in HIV/AIDS
prevention activities, UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, etc.

20.    During the transition between the first MAP project and the second MAP there
were many vacancies at the SEP/CNLS which took a long time to fill. This had a
negative impact on the implementation of the project in the beginning.

Design

21.     The project design, as laid out in the PAD, sought to focus more on the provision
of preventive and treatment services to high risk groups, encouraging decentralization of
decision making, and intensifying efforts to improve national monitoring and evaluation
of the epidemic and response.

22.    At the same time, the project was structured to finance a transverse slice of the
underfinanced 2007-2011 NHAS, meaning that the components of the project were
aligned to the four axes of the that strategy. The project components were designed to
align with NHAS ’axes’ to ease the reporting burden on the CNLS.

23.    Therefore, the project design, though earnestly seeking to focus attention on
MARPs, suffered from excessive breadth and complexity that comes from trying to align
with the whole of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

24.    The task team was on the cutting edge of HIV/AIDS prevention methods by
including male circumcision as one important activity to be supported by the project. At
the time of the project appraisal results from the randomized trials had only recently been
published.

                                             4
25.    At the institutional level, the role of the SEP/CNLS, the HIV/AIDS Coordinating
body, was clearly re-defined and more autonomy given to implementing entities,
especially the Ministry of Health which is in charge of HIV activities in the health sector.

Quality at entry

26.   The team that conducted the appraisal mission had members from the Bank’s
AIDS Strategy and Action Plan (ASAP) who supported the country in its efforts to
improve the quality of the 2007-2011 National Strategic Plan, especially on how to focus
on most-at-risk populations.

2.2 Implementation

27.      At the beginning of the Project, the focus was on too many vulnerable groups and
there was insufficient targeting of the groups that were driving the HIV epidemic, i.e.
CSWs. Just before the MTR, a QER Panel suggested identifying a highly specific set of
activities that could be usefully delivered to specific target groups, and proceeding to
contract for these groups in specific areas where they were numerous, rather than
attempting to engage all line ministries and all provincial governments in the effort. The
MTR recommendations went in the same direction. It was one and a half years into
implementation before the implementing agency really started focusing on the most-at-
risk population driving the epidemic, namely the commercial sex workers (CSW).

28.      The Project suffered major implementation lags in the beginning. Major factors
for the lags included (i) significant turnover in leadership (the country had four Ministers
of Health in three years) which hampered needed implementation of institutional changes
at the implementing agency level, (ii) a long transition period at the managerial position
at the SEP/CNLS after the departure of the former Manager, (iii) misunderstanding of
certain procedures between the Bank and Borrower as to the need for pre-financing
activities by the Borrower while awaiting funds to transfer from the Bank, (iv) delays in
project selections at the provincial level due largely to ignorance of the existence of
funding opportunities from the Project, (v) delays in approval of the 2009 annual work
plan and in selecting keys staff positions at the SEP/CNLS, (vi) delays in understanding
how to identify and target most-at-risk populations at the provincial level so that sub
grants only started in September 2009, and (vii) the work to develop the mechanisms
necessary to use performance contracting for curative services, a central element of
component 2, was only completed and reviewed in October 2009. This created delays in
contracting with CSOs.

29.     For all the above reasons, following a June 2009 mission, the PDO and
implementation performance ratings were downgraded from MS/MS to MU/MU. During
that mission, specific benchmarks were agreed upon between the Bank and the Borrower.
These benchmarks had to be achieved satisfactorily for the disbursement to continue.
Starting February 2010, implementation performance had improved as evidenced by the



                                             5
progress on intermediate indicators and disbursement rates. The PDO/IP ratings were
upgraded to MS/S.

30.      The transition toward scaling up the Results-Based Financing (RBF) strategy took
place fairly late in the implementation stage, starting in April 2010. This reflected the fact
that it was part of a larger, nation-wide roll-out of RBF. Seven HIV-related indicators
were included in the service package covered by the RBF scheme, namely, (i) the number
of persons benefiting from VCT services; (ii) the number of new ARV-treated cases; (iii)
the number of pregnant women under PMCT protocol; (iv) the number of ARV-treated
persons monitored during a six-month period; (v) the number of STI cases treated; (vi)
the number of newborns from seropositive mothers under PMCT protocols; and (vii) the
number of 15 to 49 year-old males who benefited from male circumcision.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

31.     In an effort to support the Government and development partners’ desire to
harmonize monitoring and evaluation arrangements, the PDO and results framework for
the project were designed to align with those for the NHAS. This is in line with the
World Bank desire to support the strengthening of the entire health system for
sustainability purposes and Government ownership. However, it undermines the ability to
collect necessary data in a timely manner in order to inform the ISRs of the progress
made toward the achievement of the project’s objectives.

32.      The 13 performance indicators in the PAD, which were selected from the larger
list of indicators in the NHAS, were relevant to the project. However, some of the
indicators could not be tracked with reasonable frequency. For some other indicators
there were no baseline data.

33.    There were additional design flaws in the PAD. The behavioral surveillance
survey (BSS) as designed would have to generate data for monitoring the PDO once
every two years, but this has de facto become once every three years in the ISRs with one
BSS study at the beginning of the Project and another one towards the project closing
date.

34.     Determination of the number of HIV positive pregnant women in need of PMTCT
services, an important denominator to some of the project outcome indicators was done
using the Spectrum software. Use of this modeling program was problematic because it
yielded different figures when new parameters (more accurate ones) used towards the end
of the project were plugged into the program.

M&E Implementation

35.   The capacity and number of M&E experts at the implementing agency
(SEP/CNLS), the provincial and CSO level were reinforced by training sessions. This had

                                              6
a positive impact on the timeliness and accuracy of information reported to the central
level. However, data available at the Ministry of Health for health-related HIV activities
were not always in synch with data available at SEP/CNLS in a database (SidaInfo).

36.     The M&E system improved over time. The SidaInfo database was updated and
completely decentralized. The functionality of this database with regard to data
management for the ARV coverage module has been good. The assurance of data quality
improved with increased supervision. In addition, collection of more elaborate data made
it possible to organize more systematic supervision missions and audit the data. In turn,
this led to a better information system regarding results framework indicators.

M&E Utilization

37.    Project funds enabled a clear improvement of the knowledge of the epidemic in
Burundi thanks to the availability of an analysis and epidemiologic synthesis report
regarding HIV/AIDS in Burundi. In addition, the implementation of a bio-behavioral
survey targeting most-at-risk populations which allowed the country to identify the
populations that were really most-at-risk. However, that survey was brought to
completion toward the end of the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

38.     There are no legal covenants but one financial undertaking consisted in the
provision of Government budget allocation to support the implementation of the national
HIV/AIDS strategic plan in the amount of US $3.0 million through the national annual
budget. This commitment has been partially fulfilled with an average allocation of US
$2.0 million per year. There are no unresolved fiduciary, social or environment problems.
There are no audit issues. The project procurement and financial management ratings are
satisfactory.

39.     The project as a whole had a single Category of Expenditure. The allocation
amounts by component shown in the PAD were indicative of the relative importance of
each component with regard to the implementation of the project. This may explain the
difference between the effective expenditures and the level of IDA funding by component
as shown in table 1 below. The 30% overrun of Component 4 expenditures was mainly
due to the increased burden of operating costs incurred by the governing body
(SEP/CNLS), particularly the salaries. The 10% increase of Component 1 expenditures
was naturally due to a de facto reallocation between components in an attempt to follow
the MTR recommendation to focus on CSWs targeted interventions.

40.     With regard to the environmental safeguards, Burundi acquired instruments to
monitor medical waste management through a ministerial decree pertaining to classifying
and managing biomedical wastes produced by care facilities in Burundi. This decree was
signed jointly by the Public Health Minister and the Environment Minister on February 4,
2008. Based on this decree and with the financial support from the Project, the Health
Minister led activities to strengthen the biomedical waste management, namely: (i) an
analysis study of the biomedical waste management situation; (ii) the development of a
biomedical waste management plan; (iii) the development of training modules for care
providers; (iv) the availability of appropriate material in care facilities; and (v) the
organization of a training series for health service providers regarding biomedical waste
management. Physicians who are also health province directors, physicians who are also
heading health districts, health promoting coordinators at the provincial level,
paramedical school officers, heads of labs in provincial hospitals, and hygiene officers at
provincial hospitals in 16 provinces were trained as trainers.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     At the Project mid-term review, it was planned that the RBF related HIV
indicators would later be financed by other funds. Indeed the Government has been
paying for these HIV related indicators since the closing of the Project, namely by those
from the Health Sector Development Support Project (HSDSP), PRIDE, European Union,
and the Belgian Cooperation.

42.    The restructuring of the SEP/CNLS has been approved by the Minister of Health
and focuses on re-organization and staffing. Only after the closing of the Project the
Government began to take some serious steps to resolve this issue. These steps should
have been taken at the beginning of the Project or just after the MTR in order to ensure a
smooth transition after the Project closing date.

43.     The announcement of the Project closing on June 30, 2011 has caused fear and
distress, even frustration and discouragement, among the Burundian population through
all kinds of media reports. However, this mixture of fear and discouragement was mostly
due to the scarcity of reliable information. It quickly disappeared following a joint press
conference organized jointly by the Borrower and Bank project teams. During this
information session, both parties asked the press to explain to the general population that
the project’s end was not a financial freeze by the World Bank, as many people had come
to believe, but rather a normal project closing occurring at the end of its term as foreseen
in the Project Financing Agreement. Moreover, this agreement was signed by the
Burundian government and the World Bank prior to implementation. The organizers of
the press conference explained that, as for any other project, a specific timeframe had
been given to this project from the onset. As a result, it was not surprising that this
project would close on a date known to project staff and the Burundian government. No
other expression of misunderstanding came about, and the situation returned to normal.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

44.     The project objective to provide HIV preventive and treatment services to
MARPs is relevant according to current international recognized best practices. These
best practices recommend concentrating efforts on the populations which are the drivers
of the epidemic in a country. The PDO is fully aligned with the current Country Strategic
Plan and the Burundi PRSP in which HIV control is a strategic priority. In the current
international financial crisis, it is imperative for poor countries like Burundi to focus on
recognized effective and efficient interventions.

45.    The relevance of the project objective is therefore rated substantial.

Relevance of design

46.     The MAP II project was structured to finance a transversal slice of the
underfinanced 2007-2011 NHAS, meaning that the components of the project were
aligned to the four axes of the that strategy. This transversal slice financing of the NHAS
may have created confusion at the level of the implementing partner and may be one of
the reasons why targeting activities towards most-at-risk populations took time to
materialize.

47.    The components of the project were well designed to achieve the project
development objective because they were directed towards ensuring preventive and
treatment services to MARPs with a community component. Focusing on MARPs rather
than on traditional BCC messages directed to the general population made the project
design relevant even at current scientific evidence which suggest adapting the HIV
response to the actual epidemiological situation of a country. The focus on male
circumcision also made compelling sense in the context of Burundi. The task team
deserves a lot of credit for braving animosity and ridicule for promoting circumcision.
The Bank was the only development partner to bring the issue up consistently.

48.     The transfer of all health related activities under the responsibility of the Ministry
of Health ensured both ownership by the Ministry and proper implementation. Since
some treatment activities were conducted by the private sector, it reinforced public-
private partnerships in the country thereby maximizing the project reach and ensuring
sustainability of interventions.

49.    The selected three performance indicators are judged to be relevant. Baseline data
for two of them were not available at the time of the project appraisal. However the task

                                              9
team was waiting for data collected for the 2007 BSS study to be made available by
Government Officials to be used as baseline for these two indicators. The data became
available in late 2008. Unfortunately, when the baseline data became available,
necessary target re-setting for some of the indicators was not done accordingly

50.    The relevance of the project design is therefore rated substantial.

Relevance of implementation

51.     There have been unnecessary delays from the implementing agency, to focus the
project efforts on fewer, most-at risk populations (e.g CSW) which are the drivers of the
HIV epidemic in the country. In addition, the project was designed to scale up male
circumcision services in order to mitigate the transmission of HIV in the general
population. Although, the activity has now achieved very encouraging results, the
implementation of MC took a long time to veritably take off.

52.     The implementation of RBF was delayed (not due to any fault of the SEP/CNLS
or the project), reflecting the challenge of scaling up such an innovative approach to an
entire country (proper preparation of implementation and monitoring tools was necessary
to ensure future success). Once implemented, the RBF scheme helped the project to catch
up on several outputs indicators as shown below (Graph 1).

53.   According the information presented above, the relevance of the project
implementation is rated modest.

54.    For all the facts described above, the relevance of the project objective, design
and implementation is rated substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

55.     The Project achieved two out of three outcome indicators as shown in table 2
below. For the first one, the project did not achieve the target set because it was
impossible to achieve (above 100%). In fact, the target setting for the first outcome
indicator on condom use among female commercial sex workers illustrates the problems
of setting target without baseline data. With an 82% condom use at baseline (data became
available after the project effectiveness date), a target of a 30% increase at the end of
project meant achieving condom use levels at 106.6%, which is impossible. Nonetheless,
condom use rate among female commercial sex workers increased from 82% from
baseline to 91.2% at the end of the project which is quite satisfactory.

56.    The project was the only major project engaging in behavior change
communication (BCC) activities for sex workers in a concentrated way, so this result can
be almost solely attributable to the project.

*Data available up to end of June 2011

57.     Over the life of the project there was a large decline in HIV prevalence rates in
the general population. (See table 3 below) which was out of keeping with the secular
trend (in 2002 the HIV prevalence rate was 3.2%). With more than a doubling of the
number of the number of people on ARV treatment, people infected with HIV are living
longer with the disease. Thus the decline in prevalence combined with a longer duration
of the disease indicates a significant decline in incidence. The significant (47%) decline
in HIV prevalence among CSWs is also remarkable.

58.     The project was the one that put male circumcision “on the roadmap? in Burundi.
Without the project, the strong takeoff in male circumcisions would never have happened,
and in this way the project has permanently changed the landscape of HIV prevention in
Burundi.

significant achievements, as shown in the graph 1 below.

60.     Attribution: The project made the largest (and likely highest quality) investment
in CSW programs, one of the reasons why the Government wanted continued Bank
involvement after the closing of the project. The RBF scheme, with its impressive results
in HIV indicators as shown above, was financed mostly by the Bank through this project.
In addition, the project team courageously advocated for male circumcision with shows
already very encouraging positive results.

61.    With regard to intermediate indicators, the project achieved, and in many cases far
exceeded, the targets for 8 out of 10 of them.

62.    In terms of achievement of project development objectives the project is therefore
rated modest.


                                           12
3.3 Efficiency

63.     As was the case for other MAP operations, no formal economic or financial
efficiency analysis was conducted at appraisal. However, the Project achieved the
outcome targets to satisfactory levels in a short period of time (less than three years of
implementation, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the results achieved).

64.    Targeting most-at-risk populations is currently recognized by the international
community as a highly effective and efficient means of intervention. In addition,
prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been recognized as a cost-effective
approach. The project contributed to increasing the rate of PMTCT from 15% at the
beginning of the project to 32% at the end of the project. The project also supported
implementation of male circumcision after conducting a feasibility study in the country.
Male circumcision is now recognized as a very important and efficient intervention in
curbing the rate of new HIV infections among men.

65.    The BSS survey of MARPs, conducted to look closely at the beneficiary groups,
was another effort to sharpen efficiency and gain information on the size and nature of
vulnerable groups.

66.     These results from the economic and financial analysis (see Annex 3) show that
the total economic benefits for two interventions (BCC for CSW and PMTCT) supported
by the project are over $13 million. This almost equals the amount spent from project
($15 million) funds for all the interventions. Note that these interventions are all under
Component 1, for which a total of $7.7 million was spent (for these two interventions as
well as others). Even if all the other interventions under this project – including those
under Components 2, 3 and 4 – impart total benefits of zero, the total benefit from the
three interventions alone of over $13 million.

67.    It should be stressed that these estimates are very much lower-bound estimates,
even for the two interventions considered. This is because a very conservative figure has
been used for the economic cost of each new HIV infection. If one takes into account the
many costs imposed along different dimensions by every new HIV/AIDS infection, as
described by Haaker (1994) chapter (as well as in many other sources), the total
economic benefits for the two interventions due to the project would be much higher.

68.    The efficiency of the project is rated substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

69.     Based on the above presented data on the relevance of the project’s objectives,
design, and implementation (substantial), achievement of PDOs (modest) and efficiency
(substantial), the overall outcome rating of the project is moderately satisfactory.




                                             13
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     The Project made a very positive impact on the lives of women having multiple
partners, most of which are widows living in rural areas. Many of these women confessed
that they learned their HIV status as a result of this Project and have benefited from the
income generating activities (IGA) financed by the Project. However, they lamented that
the project came to a close too fast and could not reach the majority of women.
Furthermore, the funding level of these IGA was insufficient to allow these women to
live a descent life without depending on income from their multiple sexual partners.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.     The Project strengthened the CNLS body in charge of the overall coordination
mandate for HIV/AIDS activities in Burundi. The CNLS (after necessary restructuring)
will be able to carry out this role in the future for all Government and partner (GF,
PEPFAR, etc…) funded HIV/AIDS activities in the country.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

72.    A beneficiary survey was not conducted.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

73.    HIV indicators are now part of the national RBF program and will continue to be
financed under the RBF scheme along with other indicators as long as the national
program remains. RBF indicators, including the HIV indicators, are now being financed
not only by the IDA supported HSDSP project, but also by the Government and partners
such as the European Union and the Belgian Cooperation.

74.     The tariffs for HIV indicators may have to be reduced from their current levels in
the future if partners, particularly the Global Fund project PRIDE, do not start to provide
payments for RBF indicators. At the moment, the tariffs for RBF indicators that have
been set do not take into account the additional parallel financing that the PRIDE project
is providing on an “input? rather than “output? basis for bills for HIV health services.
This creates a situation where there is double payment to health facilities for HIV
indicators – one payment on the RBF basis as part of the national RBF scheme and one

75.   One important area which is not being funded under the remaining mechanisms is
BCC activities for most-at-risk populations like the CSW, which was not part of the
RBF- paid activities under the project.

76.    For the above reasons, the risk to the development outcome is rated moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

77.    Drawing on experience gained from the MAP 1 Project, the Bank built on lessons
learned to design a project that maximizes the PDO achievement. However, the lack of
baseline data makes it difficult to fully appraise any contribution of the Project to the
achievement of the PDO indicators as agreed upon in the PAD.

78.    The participation of a highly qualified team from the ASAP program also
increased the quality of the project design at onset.

79.     Therefore the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry rating is moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

80.     The Bank’s pro-activity in providing expert advice to the country during
supervision visits, helping the project to remain focused on its main objective (providing
prevention and treatment services to most-at-risk populations), was lauded by the QAG in
their evaluation just before the mid-term review.

81.     The presence of the Project TTL in the country throughout its implementation
assured continuity of the Bank’s support to the Borrower. In total seven official
supervision visits, with accompanying Aide Memoires, were produced over the three-
year lifespan of the Project. The supervision teams always were composed of qualified
persons in their respective area of expertise.

82.     The Bank’s quality of supervision rating is therefore rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

83.     Given the two ratings above with regard to the Bank’s performance in ensuring
quality at entry (moderately satisfactory) and the quality of supervision (satisfactory),
the overall Bank performance rating is moderately satisfactory because the overall
outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.




                                            15
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

84.    The Government commitment to provide a budget allocation to support the
implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategic plan in the amount of US $3.0
million equivalent through the national annual budget did not fully materialize. This
commitment has been partially fulfilled with an average allocation of US $2.0 million
equivalent per year.

85.    The country’s total expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP of 13.1% is
among the highest in Africa and close to the 15% advocated by WHO. This testifies to
the Government’s commitment to improving the overall health status of its population.

86.     Despite being a post-conflict country, there has not been any reported
misappropriation of project funds. Likewise, a Global Fund General Inspector’s
investigative team found no mismanagement of GF money.

87.     Although there was delay in replacing the outgoing Manager of the SEP/CNLS at
the beginning of the project, once replaced, the new Manager remained for the entire
project implementation period. This stability in leadership contributed to high quality
performance of the implementing agency.

88.     There have been too many changes in leadership, however, at the Ministry of
Health level with four Ministers in total during the short period of the project. This
situation hindered the project’s goal of allowing the Ministry of Health to take on more
direct responsibilities in implementing health related activities.

89.    Rating for the Government performance is moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

90.     The SEP/CNLS, the implementing agency of the project, was strengthened in its
capacity and ability to become a true coordinating body. Although, some personnel
restructuring was necessary to make it an efficient and effective HIV/AIDS coordinating
structure.

91.     Unfortunately, the SEP/CNLS took a long time to understand the focus of the
Project on most-at-risk populations and may have contributed to the project not fully
achieving its objectives. In addition, major studies (i.e. BSS among MARPs) were not
conducted as planned in the PAD. Only two BSS studies instead of the planned three
studies (one at the beginning and another one towards the end of the Project) were
conducted.

92.    Rating for the implementing agency is moderately satisfactory



                                           16
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

93.    Given the incomplete disbursement of the Government committed budget
contribution to the Project and the delays from the Implementing Agency in focusing
more on the MARPs, the overall Borrower rating is moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

94.     The RBF scheme is a suitable tool to accelerate and/or maintain the
achievement of results even within weak health systems like the one in a post-conflict
country. The scaling up of the RBF scheme at country level can contribute significantly
to achieving significant results in a relatively short period of time.

95.    Close coordination and collaboration between partners is necessary to ensure
sustainability of achieved results. A lack of harmonization of RBF policies supported by
the Bank and the Client on one side and the financing of “inputs? on the side of the
Global Fund created problems of double payment for the same services, thereby
decreasing the efficiency of the overall HIV program in the country.

96.     Project task team need to correct any discrepancy between the PAD and the
Financing Agreement to harmonize the language between the two important reference
documents. In this particular project, the development objective in the PAD mentions
only preventive services to MARPs while the FA adds treatment to prevention. This
creates confusion at the time of preparing the ICR because it’s not clear which document
should be the basis for the evaluation of PDO achievement.

Component 1: Preventive services targeting most-at-risk populations (MARPs)

99.     This component was to finance: (i) sub-projects for the promotion of behavior
change communication strategies for the MARPS and communications campaigns for
male circumcision (MC), (ii) counseling and testing (VCT) of MARPS; (iii) training of
health personnel and supply of medical equipment for the accreditation of providers of
services to prevent mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and male circumcision, and
(iv) contracts based on performance in the provision of PMTCT services and CM.

100. The Project exceeded the targets for two intermediate outcome indicators (for
HIV/AIDS comprehensive knowledge and the percentage of health facilities that offer
VCT to pregnant women) but fell short of achieving the targets for the remaining two
others (HIV testing among MARPs and number of circumcised men).

                                                 19
101. With regard to output indicators, the Project achieved a lot in terms of clinical
services, behavioral change communication and VCT for MARPs, geographical coverage
of services and training of health professionals in ARV provision, PMTCT, VCT, and
medical waste management.

102. The data above confirm the fact that the Project helped maintain the momentum
gained from its predecessor (MAP 1). Without this Project (MAP 2), it is not clear that
the previous successes would have continued in order to achieve the results observed at
the closure of the Project, even with funding from the Global Fund.

103. It took time and persistent technical support from the Bank for the Implementing
Agency to start activities focused on the vulnerable groups most responsible for driving
the HIV epidemic in Burundi, namely the commercial sex workers. In the beginning,
efforts were directed towards too many defined vulnerable groups (see Table 7 below),
which would not allow the Project to achieve its PDO.

a) Behavioral change communication (BCC) for the MARPs

104. Several activities regarding prevention and/or support to behavioral changes of
vulnerable groups were financed under this Project. Since the MTR recommendations in
February 2010, the coverage of activities regarding prevention and/or support to
behavioral changes of vulnerable groups has largely been extended to the groups facing
the highest risks, particularly sex workers. As a result, 1,061 awareness group sessions
were organized that reached 14,177 sex workers. In addition, awareness tools were
developed for sex workers and their partners, notably: (i) 4,392 reference flyers were
distributed to sex workers, 1,000 flyers (for clients) were distributed to Lake Tanganyika
fishermen and truck drivers; (ii) a film was developed, which raised the awareness of
4,866 sex workers and 188 partners of sex workers by way of a mobile movie theater;
and (iii) 20,621 prevention kits were distributed to sex workers. Among the general
population, sex workers in particular, benefited from the distribution of 4,426,322 male
condoms and 28,573 female condoms to prevent HIV infection. In addition, 5,292 sex
workers tested seropositive and retrieved their test results. See table 9 below.

105. The transition toward scaling up the Results-Based Financing (RBF) strategy took
place starting in April 2010, and six HIV-related indicators were included in the service
package covered by Results-Based Financing. During the 13-month period until the
closure of the Project, these indicators reached quite noticeable levels. 633,459 persons
tested seropositive while 6,294 new cases of infected and gravely ill persons were
monitored over a six-month period. Regarding PMCT, 3,407 seropositive pregnant
women benefited from the prophylactic ARV treatment, and 2,097 newborns from
seropositive mothers were treated. In the context of HIV prevention, 93,856 STI cases
were treated.

106. Prevention activities and/or support for BCC have been funded through 138 sub-
projects which reached the following vulnerable groups (see Table 8 above): From

colleges, 330 Batwa (ethnic minority), 8220 returnees, 1500 touts for transportation buses,
1700 household workers, 880 members of uniformed personnel (military and police),
1,711 fishermen, 1,350 seasonal workers, 4330 drug users, 400 prisoners, 100 MSM, 367
disabled, and 135 unmarried young mothers, from all the 17 provinces countries. The
provincial Sectoral Public Units have conducted BCC activities for 3450 workers, 3000
fishermen working on fishing ports along Lake Tanganyika, and 1700 workers in
construction sites.

107. After the February 2010 supervision mission, the approach of involving civil
society organizations (CSOs) has been improved. It now puts more focus on a smaller
number of MARPs and interventions, and uses a result based financing approach for
selected projects.

b) Promotion of male circumcision

109. With support from the Project, activities for the promotion and provision of male
circumcision services were conducted: (i) Funding for a study on the feasibility and
acceptability of male circumcision among the sexually active population in Burundi, (ii)
the collection of data on male circumcision, (iii) signature of performance based contracts
with hospitals to provide MC services, (iv) integration of an indicator on male
circumcision in the national RBF scheme, (v) national training of health care providers on
MC, (vi) procurement and distribution of medical kits for MC.

110. Retrospective data collected show that only 539 CM were conducted in 2008,
1109 CM in 2009, and 3343 CM in 2010.

c) Voluntary counseling and testing of high-risk groups

111. The number of testing centers (VCT) accredited increased from 266 in 2008 to
524 in June 2011. The number of people screened increased from 236,988 in 2008 to
334,409. In 2010, the expected number was 340,000 and 275,692 during the first half of
2011. By the end of the Project, testing kits for 45 VCT and 40 PMTCT sites were
distributed.




                                              24
d) Training of health professionals and provision of medical equipment for the
   accreditation of providers of PMTCT services and MC

112. In total, 520 caregivers were trained in PMTCT and 46 new PMTCT sites have
been accredited. At the end of the Project on June 30, 2011, there were 130 PMTCT sites,
from the public and private sector organizations (Civil Society Organizations and
religious inspiration).

e) RBF contracts for the provision of PMTCT services and MC

113. The Ministry of Health has signed contracts with 563 health facilities involved in
the PMTCT before April 2010 and a campaign of mobilization for PMTCT among
women of childbearing age was conducted in all the communes of the country. A total of
130 health care facilities are accredited as PMTCT sites and 17 sub-projects aimed at
mobilizing and increasing demand for PMTCT were funded. It should be noted, however,
that experience has shown that many structures accredited spend months or years without
providing the services expected because of lack of material and adequate human
resources. Accreditation does not necessarily guarantee the availability and accessibility
of PMTCT services.

114. Approximately 7,217 women received ARV prophylaxis during the project life
(including 1,530 under RBF in the first half of 2011). As for PMTCT activities, the MOH
is considering scaling up CM services in the entire country, as this is a now well proven
strategy for HIV prevention.

Component 2: Curative services based on performance

115. This component aimed to contribute to (i) the provision of clinical services to
AIDS patients through RBF contracts, (ii) the training of health facilities identified for
the provision of such services, and (iii) funding of sub -projects to promote home based
care in communities identified as priority.

                                              25
116. The achieved level for this indicator exceeded the targets set for both the mid-
term and end of the project (65.6% realized versus the 48% target for mid-term and
90.8% realized versus the 50% target for end of project).

117. The number of sites of antiretroviral therapy (ART) accredited rose from 75 in
December 2009 to 95 June 2011. The MOH Sectoral AIDS Unit (USLS) has conducted
supervisory training in all ART sites while 210 providers were trained on the
comprehensive care of HIV/AIDS including ART provision. The 95 ART sites were able
to secure their own supply of medicines, reagents and consumables without documented
stock out thanks to training received in the management of supply chains and the roll out
of the RBF strategy.

118. The new approach of contracting services for clinical management of AIDS has
proven to be effective in the MOH decentralization efforts and effective integration of
such services in the minimum package of activities at health center level. With the
scaling up of the RBF approach in all health facilities in the country, the number of health
centers under contract jumped from 112 in March 2009 to 563 in 2010. This resulted in
putting 5,074 new patients on ARV in 2010 alone, and the cumulative number of new
people on ART as of June 30, 2011 was 25,117.

Component 3: Poverty reduction and other vulnerabilities

119. The implementation of this component was realized through the funding of
selected income-generating activities (IGA) for people living with HIV (PLWHA) and
orphans and vulnerable children (OVC).

120. The number of PLWHA reached through small grants activities fell short of the
targets set for both mid-term and end of the Project. This may be explained by the
ultimate focus of the project on groups most-at-risk like commercial sex workers towards
the end of the Project. However, the number and value of subprojects targeting MARPs
exceeded the projections.

a) Activities benefiting people living with HIV (PLWHA)

121. In total, 48 sub-projects for PLWHA IGAs have been funded to reach 3,909
people infected with AIDS. In order to improve the socio-economic development of
infected CSW, the following results were achieved: (i) 3,175 CSWs received project
funding to undertake income generating activities (AGR); and (ii) 25 CSW associations
were created. From these associations, 75 representatives were trained in organization
and association management and 45 were trained in business management for the IGAs.

122. In terms of promoting the rights of PLWHA, the following results were achieved
through the funding of three sub-projects:

 1836 people received legal support in the 17 provinces of the country, this activity
  was conducted in partnership with the RBP +;
 160 monitors and observers were trained and retrained on the law protecting people
  with HIV and their dependents, the tool index stigma, and techniques for monitoring
  human rights violations of PLWHA;
 360 cases of violations of rights of PLWHA were reported as part of the
  establishment of an early warning system;
 60 members of the network of parliamentarians committed to the fight against HIV /
  AIDS attended the meetings for exchange and dialogue on the fight against violations
  of rights of PLWHA and implementation of policies and legislation favorable to the
  protection of these groups.

b) Activities benefiting infected and affected OVCs

123. The number of sub-projects towards OVCs that were funded by the project was
50. The Project covered 14 provinces at the beginning of the project and ten provinces
since 2010, the remaining provinces being covered by funding from other donors. The
number of OVC affected cared for in the entire project life is 10,836.

Component 4: Capacity building of local authorities and key ministries for the
implementation of activities against HIV / AIDS and Program Management

124. This component was to finance: (i) operating expenses of the CNLS Permanent
Executive Secretariat (SEP-CNLS) in relation to the overall program management
including the management of the Project; (ii) support activities to the national monitoring
and evaluation in connection with (a) impact assessments and other epidemiological
studies, (b) the effective targeting of interventions based on vulnerability mapping and
triangulation of data periodically to identify high risk factors, and (c) monitoring of
epidemiological and socio-behavioral and analysis and use of strategic information for
decision-making programs; (iii) support activities to local authorities for the
decentralization of collection and information management; and (iv) capacity building
activities, implementation, coordination and supervision of action plans against HIV /
AIDS by government departments and institutions involved in sectors other than health.

a) Monitoring and Evaluation

125. Regarding the system of routine monitoring, the performance reliable data
management (SidaInfo) to generate information in real time has greatly improved.
Supervision missions were conducted in 17 Provinces. The SidaInfo database is up to
date and it is now completely decentralized. The tracking system would benefit greatly if
the database incorporated all other modules that also support components (sub-project
monitoring, prevention strategies, PMTCT, VCT) other than ARVs.

126. Project funds have helped to get a better understanding of the epidemic in
Burundi through the availability of a report on the epidemiological analysis and synthesis
of HIV/AIDS in Burundi and the implementation of a bio-behavioral survey targeting
high-risk groups. The epidemiological report summary analysis has been very useful in
that it paints a clear picture showing a certain level of knowledge of the situation of
HIV/AIDS in the country, the state of data quality, needs and gaps in coverage as well as
future prospects. The availability of the report provided a better understanding of the
determinants of the HIV epidemiological situation in Burundi.

127. Available epidemiological data from 2007 to 2010 show that HIV is a real public
health problem in Burundi. Indeed, the 2007 survey reveals an overall seroprevalence of
2.97% in the general population among the adult population. Furthermore, it was found
that among sex workers, the overall seroprevalence was 38% with higher rates in the
cities of the interior in Bujumbura capital city (46% against 29%). During the past three
years, several activities aimed at strengthening the knowledge and behavior change were
carried out as part of the operationalization of the strategic plan 2007-2011. The results of
the 2010 BSS survey among MARPs, show encouraging results with regard to the impact
of the national response. The prevalence of HIV among sex workers dropped from 37.7%
in 2007 to 19.8% in 2011.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

128. This annex presents estimates of economic analysis done for the project. The
analysis focuses on the economic benefits on two categories of preventative activities
supported by the project: (a) behavior change communication (BCC) for commercial sex
workers and (b) prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). These are
all activities of Component 1 of the project which focuses on preventative activities. The
analysis below provides estimates of the total economic benefits of these three categories
of activities financed by the project.

129. The total expenditure under this component was $7.7 million. The focus on
preventative activities more than treatment is appropriate in the project since key
preventative activities are much more cost-effective than treatment (Canning, 2006).

130. Note that the analysis below focuses on just two categories of preventative
activities, but these are only a subset of the preventative activities of the project. Other
critical preventative activities such as male circumcision, behavior change
communication for high-risk groups other than commercial sex workers and treatment of
sexually transmitted diseases are not included in the analysis. If these – all with proven
high benefits compared to costs in several studies in other countries – were included in
the analysis, the total economic benefits would be even larger.

131. The annex discusses the key assumptions underlying the analysis before
presenting the results of the analysis.

Key Assumptions of the Analysis
Economic Cost of Each New Case of HIV/AIDS

132. This is critical for the analysis since it factors into estimates of the benefits of
each new infection averted due to preventative interventions against HIV/AIDS.
However, there is considerable variation in the methodologies used to estimate the
economic cost of HIV/AIDS, and in results found using different methodologies. A key
problem here is that by all accounts, the impact of HIV on society is multi-faceted and
works along several different dimensions.

133. An excellent and thorough description of the economic costs of HIV/AIDS on
society is provided in Haaker (2004). This is a chapter from an IMF book on the
macroeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS. It describes in detail – and with evidence provided
from various studies – how HIV/AIDS has a serious impact on traditional economic
measures such as economic growth, income per capita, and investment, but it does so by
affecting very diverse areas of public, social, and economic life. Aside from the direct
mortality and morbidity costs imposed, as well as the cost of treatment, HIV/AIDS
imposes economic costs in various other ways, including via: (i) changes in dependency
ratios; (ii) effects on the economic situation of households (e.g. through a sick
breadwinner or time needed to take care of a sick family member, as well as out-of-
                                             29
pocket health expenditures; (iii) adverse effects on productivity and hence on the
economy; (iv) an increase in the number of orphans; (v) adverse effects on social capital;
and (vi) adverse effects on economic growth (including via changes in the composition of
the workforce and on productivity).

134. In the present analysis, only the cost of care for an HIV/AIDS patient (over the
lifetime of the patient, discounted appropriately) is taken into account to determine the
economic cost of each new infection averted (which, in turn, is used to estimate the
economic benefits of preventative interventions that reduce the number of new infections
averted). A detailed study in Burundi found that the cost of care per year was $590, on
average (Basenya and Renaud, 2008). To be conservative, about half of this estimate -
$300 – was used in the present analysis for the estimated cost of care per year, for each
new infection averted.

135. It is important to note that this approach substantially underestimates the benefits
of preventative interventions against HIV, because: (i) only about half of the full cost of
care as estimated in the Burundi context is taken into account; and (ii) the many other
costs to the economy and to society as described briefly above (and in detail in the
chapter by Haaker, 2004) are not taken into account in the calculations.

Other Assumptions

136. Key parameters for the analysis are provided in the table below. They are based
on the results of the BSS surveys (mainly the 2007 BSS survey which took place before
the start of the project), as well as data from UNAIDS and the Center for Diseases
Control as wels as various meta-analyses and studies in other similar countries. A list of
the latter is provided below, at the end of this annex.

137. For BCC for commercial sex workers, the number of sex workers reached is taken
from project data. For PMTCT, figures are available in aggregate and it has been
financed by the MAP 2 project as well as the PRIDE project. Thus, a proportion of the
total (e.g. total number of mothers treated with PMTCT) was “attributed? to the MAP 2
project based on the expenditures made by the MAP 2 project relative to those of the
PRIDE project for each intervention.

Methodology

138. The benefits were calculated for each of the two interventions (BCC for
commercial sex workers and PMTCT) as follows. First, the number of lives saved was
estimated in each year, using the below parameters. For example, in the case of PMTCT,
the risk of an infected mother passing on the infection to the child is reduced from 33% to
5% if PMTCT is provided – a risk reduction of 25%. This means that the number of
children saved from a new infection (the number of infections averted) is 25% x the total
number of mothers provided with PMTCT. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, not
all of these were attributed to the MAP 2 project; the proportion of the total “attributed?
to the MAP 2 project was based on the expenditures made by the MAP 2 project relative
                                            30
to those of the PRIDE project for PMTCT. A similar approach was used for the other two
interventions – the aim in each case being to determine the total number of new
infections averted (and attributed to the MAP 2 project) in each year.

139. Next, a monetary value was ascribed to each new infection averted, equal to the
present discounted value of the cost of care each year ($300 per year, every year until
death, for every person with full HIV/AIDS). As mentioned in the table below, the
discount rate used was 3%.
Table 14: Key Parameters Used in the Analysis
Assumptions for All Two Categories of Interventions
Discount Rate                                                                       3%
Assumptions for BCC for Commercial Sex Workers
HIV prevalence of rural commercial sex workers (based on BSS survey data)           46%
HIV prevalence of urban commercial sex workers (based on BSS survey data)           29%
Number of sexual episodes per year, on average per sex worker (based on BSS         281
survey data)
Risk that an infected sex worker infects a client, per sexual episode, without      1 in 2000
condom use
Reduction in the above risk when using a condom                                     89%
Total number of sex workers reached by project (lower-case estimate – includes      18,000
BCC by peer educators, mobile cinema, others – see Table 8)
Percentage of all sexual episodes where condom is used, due to BCC activities –     12%
without which it would not be used (based on data on condom use from BSS
survey data as well as studies on other countries, e.g. see Weller S.C., 1993)
Probability that a client, once infected, will infect his regular partner as well   18%
Assumptions for PMTCT
Risk of transmission of infected mother to child without PMTCT                      33%
Risk of transmission of infected mother to child with PMTCT                         <5%

Results of the Analysis

140. The total economic benefits for each of the three interventions are provided in the
below table.

Table 15: Total Economic Benefits of Each Intervention Included in the Analysis,
Due to MAP 2 project

BCC for Commercial Sex Workers                                                        $6,756,813
PMTCT                                                                                 $6,955,996
Total of the Above Three Interventions                                               $13,712,809

141. These results show that the total economic benefits for the two interventions
considered, due to the project, are more than $13 million. This is almost equal to the total
amount spent from project funds for all the interventions. Note that these interventions
are all under Component 1, for which a total of $7.7 million was spent (for these two
interventions as well as others). Even if all the other interventions under this project –
including those under Components 2, 3 and 4 – impart total benefits of zero, the total
benefit from the three interventions alone of over $13 million.


                                                    31
142. It should be stressed that these estimates are very much lower-bound estimates,
even for the two interventions considered. This is because, as mentioned above, a very
conservative figure has been used for the economic cost of each new HIV infection. If
one takes into account the many costs imposed along different dimensions by every new
HIV/AIDS infection, as described above and in the Haaker (1994) chapter (as well as in
many other sources), the total economic benefits for the two interventions due to the
project would be much higher than presented in the above table.

       Observations du SEP sur le RAPPORT DE FIN D’EXÉCUTION ET DES
                                   RÉSULTATS

                                     (IDA-H03830)

   1. Faire une revue de la partie « abréviations », car il y a quelques abréviations qui
      sont dans le texte et qui ne sont pas retrouvés dans la liste (exemple : Au
      paragraphe 89, « FC » : on ne trouve pas la signification de cette abréviation
      dans la partie y relative).

   2. Contexte au moment de l’évaluation : Cette qualification « particulièrement
      médiocres » en ce qui concerne les indicateurs sanitaires me semble excessive, si
      l’on se réfère aux progrès en terme d’indicateurs de couverture et même d’accès.
      Ainsi donc, il ne faut pas ignorer l’accès gratuit aux soins maternels et infantiles
      depuis 2006 et qui en moins de 4 ans a fait doubler la proportion des
      accouchements médicalement assistés. C’est aussi en contadiction avec les
      résultats appréciés de la 1ère intervention de IDA dans la lutte contre le VIH
      (2002-2008).

   3. Au chapitre du contexte au moment de l’évaluation : Ministère à la Présidence
      chargé de la Lutte contre le Sida (il n’était nulle part indiqué dans la structure
      gouvernementale qu’il s’agissait d’un ministère d’Etat)

   4. Au chapitre 3.1 : Pertinence des objectifs, de la conception et de l’exécution

Au paragraphe 8 : l’objectif de développement du projet tel qu’indiqué dans le PAD
« Accroître l’utilisation d’un ensemble bien déterminé de services de prévention
chez les groupes hautement vulnérables au VIH/SIDA ou affectés par cette
épidémie »

A la fin du paragraphe 34, il est suggéré d’ajouter : « L’une des explications de cette
discordance était le fait que les structures n’étaient pas toutes intégrées dans SIDA INFO
ou n’enregistraient pas leurs données en temps réel,ce qui générait un décalage. (mise en
œuvre du suivi&évaluation paragraphe 34) »

Après le paragraphe 51, il est suggéré d’insérer un paragraphe pour rester en harmonie
avec le paragraphe 27 de la page 11 sur las causes de retard,dont la responsabilité est
entièrement partagée entre l’EMprunteur et l’IDA. Il faut également signaler que la mise
en œuvre ne s’est jamais écartée du plan d’action approuvé par l’IDA . (Pertinence de
l’exécution).




                                            38
Il faut aussi signaler que le cadre des résultats a régulièrement fait l’objet de
modifications de la part des différentes missions de supervision et que la version
définitive n’a été adopté que longtemps après la revue à mi parcours.


   5. Au chapitre 3.2 : « Réalisations des objectifs du développement de
      développement du projet »

Au paragraphe 59 : le rapport ne devrait pas minimiser la contribution du Fonds
Mondial avec tout ce que ces interventions apportent pour améliorer la qualité de l’offre,
notamment l’achat des intrants et le renforcement du système de santé. Il ne faut pas
perdre de vue que c’est grâce aux apports du Fonds Mondial que le traitement ARV et le
traitement des infections opportunistes sont plus accessibles, ce qui a bien contribué aussi
à l’atteinte des bons résultats indiqués ci-dessus.

Enfin le taux de prévalence indiqué pour l’EDS 2010 de 1,4% est encore provisoire et
n’est pas encore validé définitivement.

   6. Au chapitre 3.3 : Efficience

Au paragraphe 61, il s’agit d’une étude d’acceptabilité et de faisabilité (et pas
seulement une étude de faisabilité)

Au paragraphe 63, le SEP ne maîtrise pas bien l’échelle d’évaluation, mais la
conclusion n’est pas en phase avec le corps contenu du 3.3qu’elle est censée conclure.
(en rapport avec l’efficience du projet)

   7. Au chapitre 4 : Évaluation du risque lié aux résultats en matière de
      développement

Au paragraphe 69 : Il est clair que le paiement FAR a stimulé la demande car elle est
incitative pour le personnel de santé. Cependant, le paiement FAR n’est pas suffisant
pour couvrir les intrants nécessaires pour les prestations VIH. Pensez- vous vraiment
qu’avec l’achat des indicateurs, les établissements de soins pourraient acheter eux même
les équipements nécessaires tels que les appareils de suivi biologique, la charge virale et
autres, les réactifs et les médicaments. Il me semble nécessaire de continuer à financer
l’offre si l’on veut améliorer la qualité des prestations VIH.

Par ailleurs avec le financement du Fonds Mondial les conventions établies avec les
structures de soins permettent à celles-ci d’offrir des soins gratuits aux PVVIH, ce qu’ils
ne feraient pas uniquement avec les paiements des indicateurs par le PBF car ceux-ci ne
couvrent pas toutes les dépenses encourues par les établissements de soins. Est-ce que
vous pouvez prouver que les coûts des indicateurs se sont réferés aux coûts réels des
actes ? Si ce n’est pas le cas, ce qui est fort plausible, quelqu’un doit payer la différence.
Le projet PRIDE appuie en remboursant des frais que l’établissement de soins ferait
payer au malade en l’absence de la convention, et ce n’est donc pas un double paiement.
    8. Au chapitre 6 : Leçons tirées du projet
                                              39
Après le      paragraphe 91, insérer parmi les leçons tirées ce paragraphe :
L’importance de créer un environnement propice pour le démarrage et la mise en
œuvre du projet. Dans le cas du PMLS II, on peut remarquer que les conditions d’un
bon départ n’étaient pas totalement réunies : nécessité de renouveler les contrats de
certains personnels, retard dans la mise en place de l’équipe de direction, préalables
comme la signature de conventions avec le Ministère, la formalisation de la
contractualisation, le processus du ciblage, le recrutement des agences d’exécution, ainsi
que la lenteur dans l’appropriation de l’approche PBF par les acteurs de mise en œuvre
du Projet, etc.

Au paragraphe 92 : Les politiques FAR dans leur conception actuelle ne peuvent pas
couvrir les prestations VIH car ce programme a encore besoin d’investissements
importants pour une offre de service de qualité qui puisse susciter une augmentation de la
demande. Quand il ya des problèmes de décaissements et de disponibilité de fonds pour
signer les conventions avec les structures de soins avec le financement de GF, les PVVIH
souffrent énormément car malgré le FAR, les établissements de soins leur exigent des
paiements qu’ils n’arrivent pas à couvrir. Les coûts des indicateurs ne sont pas basés sur
les coûts réels des actes, quelqu’un doit donc payer la différence. Il faut mieux
harmoniser certes, mais il ne me semble pas approprié de parler de double paiement. Le
FAR n’est pas une assurance-maladie, loin de là.

Objectifs : « Accroître l’utilisation d’un ensemble bien déterminé de services de
prévention chez les groupes hautement vulnérables au VIH/SIDA ou affectés par
cette épidémie » 9.400.000 DTS (15.000.000 USD)
Le projet est subdivisé en quatre composantes :


Composante 1 : Services préventifs ciblant les groupes à haut risque (allocation
initiale : 7 millions USD)
Composante 2 : Financement basé sur les performances de services cliniques et
de services communautaires pour les malades du Sida (allocation initiale : 2 millions
USD)
Composante 3 : Financement décentralisé des petits dons aux familles vivant
avec le VIH et aux autres groupes    à haut risque (allocation initiale : 3 millions USD).
Composante 4 : Renforcement des capacités des autorités locales et des ministères
clé pour la mise en œuvre des activités de lutte contre le VIH/ SIDA et la gestion du
programme national (allocation initiale : 3 millions USD).


CONTEXTE ET DE LA JUSTIFICATION DU PROJET


Au niveau national, le PMLSII a été conçu et négocié dans un contexte national
caractérisé par des enjeux importants, parmi lesquels on peut citer:


a) Une situation de pauvreté généralisée, résultant d’une longue période de guerre et de
ses effets divers,
b) Une situation sociopolitique et macroéconomique fragile, caractérisée par des
insuffisances dans le domaine de la gouvernance et dans l’allocation des ressources
d) Des indicateurs sociaux de base parmi les plus faibles d’Afrique : taux de mortalité
maternelle et infantile, situés à environ 900/100 000 et 179/1000 ,taux de malnutrition
chronique touchant deux enfants burundais de moins de 5 ans sur trois



                                            43
e) L’adoption par le pays d’une stratégie pour la réduction de la pauvreté (DSRP) dont
les axes stratégiques principaux du DSRP à 4 axes dont celui du VIH et sida
f) Une prévalence globale du VIH de 2,97% avec une tendance à la stabilisation globale
de l’épidémie en milieu urbaine et une flambée persistante en milieu rural
La principale innovation du projet par rapport au précédent est le focus de la prévention
au sein des groupes à plus haut ainsi que par le fait de mettre en avant des stratégies
avérées de prévention d’une part ,l’introduction du financement des soins à travers la
nouvelle stratégie du Ministère de la santé Publique de Financement basé sur la
performance et une plus grande responsabilisation de ce secteur dans la gestion des
ressources du projet. .


Démarrage du projet


L’Accord de don pour le PMLSII a été signé le 16 juillet 2008 et le projet est entré en
vigueur de fait le 16 octobre 2008. L’atelier de démarrage du projeta été organisé au
cours du mois de février 2009.


Le démarrage effectif du projet a connu un retard d’environ six (6) mois 1, qui a été dû à
plusieurs facteurs, dont les changements politiques intervenus au cours du démarrage du
projet et ayant affecté le montage institutionnel du projet, une transition au niveau du
management caractérisé par la vacance prolongée des postes de direction et d’une partie
du personnel, une insuffisance de compréhension commune de certaines procédures entre
les parties, le retard dans la soumission et l’approbation du premier PTA et budget
2009 ,le retard dans la signature de la convention entre le MSP et le SEP/CNLS et le
contrat entre le MSP et les prestataires de services ,la lenteur dans l’appropriation de la
nouvelle approche du financement basé sur les performances…


LES REALISATIONS DU PROJET PAR COMPOSANTE
Composante 1 : Services de prévention ciblant les groupes à haut risque.
Le projet a financé 138 sous projets qui ont été exécutés par les OSC et des activités
réalisées par des ministères sectoriels dans l’optique de promouvoir un changement de
comportement. Ces actions ont consisté , notamment, en sensibilisation la prévention du
VIH et du sida, en dépistage volontaire du VIH, en distribution du préservatif (masculin
et féminin), en production d’outils et de modules de formation, en formation des pairs
éducateurs , des prestataires , du personnel de santé, en fourniture de services PTME, et
ceci à travers la signature de conventions de financement.

 L’accord de don a été signé en juillet 2008, mais le projet n’a été lancé qu’en février
2009


                                            44
Les résultats enregistrés dans la composante 1 sont les suivants :
Les activités de prévention ciblées (IEC/CCC) dans les groupes à haut risque ont touché:
    •       12034 travailleuses de sexe,
    •       850 travailleurs saisonniers dont les pêcheurs,
    •       10224 jeunes scolarisés des collèges communaux,
    •       3840 déplacés,
    •       140 membres des corps en uniforme, et
    •       1275 usagers de drogues,
    •       26545 femmes en âge de procréer ont bénéficié des séances de promotion de la PTME,
•       PSI a produit et distribué des guides de causeries éducatives, des dépliants éducatifs à l'endroit des
        travailleuses de sexe, un film et des séances de ciné mobile,
 •       Des journées d'information sur les droits des TS ont été organisées en faveur des TS et des administratifs et
         des corps de sécurité
 •          Les activités de prise en charge des Infections opportunistes et des IST, de mise à disposition du préservatif,
            masculin et féminins, de dépistage du VIH, de planification familiale, de référence pour soins spécifique
            mais aussi de formation en métier ont été développées dans le cadre d'un paquet complet de services aux
            travailleuses de sexe, Une étude de la disponibilité et de l’utilisation des services par les TS ainsi que leur
            niveau de connaissance et comportements a été menée .


En matière de distribution et marketing social du préservatif et d’autres outils de prévention (trousses et kit de
prévention):
 •        5 376 408 préservatifs masculins sur 8 043 906 prévus ont été distribués, avec l’aide des pairs éducateurs
         sous encadrement des animateurs sociaux ; 2 600 préservatifs féminins ont été gratuitement distribués
        •      En partenariat avec PSI, un point de vente de préservatifs a été créé à la gare routière, sur 10 Points de
               vente prévus
        •      31173 préservatifs féminins (sur 97 060 prévus) ont été distribués gratuitement;
        •      368 kits de sensibilisation sur 452 prévus ont été distribués aux paires éducateurs ;
        •      Sur 30687 trousses de prévention prévues, 20 621 ont été distribuées aux TS ;
En matière de dépistage volontaire :
                    •   109 989 personnes sur 11 309 prévues ont été dépistées alors que le nombre de CDV n’a cessé
                        de croître
En matière de PTME chez les femmes enceintes, les femmes en âge de procréer et les hommes:
                    •   332 campagnes (sur 465 prévues) de mobilisation en amont pour les activités PTME impliquant
                        les hommes ont été organisés. Elles on touché 26 545 personnes sur 37 190 personnes prévues
                        (femmes enceintes et en âge de procréer et les hommes) ;
                    •   le nombre de couples mères enfants pris en charge a été progressivement rehaussé.


Les forces et les faiblesses
a) Principales Forces au niveau de la composante 1


                                                            45
   •   La stratégie de confier l’offre d’un paquet complet de services de prévention à
       une organisation d’expertise solide s’attachant elle-même les services spécifiques
       d’ autres acteurs spécialisés a montré ses forces. C’est le cas de l’ABUBEF et
       PSI-Burundi ou de APJB- Service Yezu Mwiza et RAM (une association qui
       travaille avec les usagers de drogue)
   •   Les activités de prévention sont intégrées au sein des structures sanitaires
       (structures offrant CDV, PTME-ARV)
   •   Les documents d’opérationnalisation de la circoncision masculine sont
       disponibles pour mettre à l’échelle la stratégie de circoncision qui est avérée
       préventive
   •   L’indicateur « circoncision masculine » est intégrée dans les indicateurs du
       Manuel des procédures du PBF
   •   La collaboration entre les structures publiques et les structures privées est très
       dynamique et donne de bons résultats.
   •   L’adoption d’un code de financement clair se focalisant sur l’atteinte des résultat
       a été une valeur ajoutée.
b) Faiblesses principales au niveau de la composante 1
   •   L’instabilité du personnel du niveau décentralisé a eu des répercussions sur
       l’analyse des dossiers des associations financées, sur la supervision, sur le suivi
       des sous-projets et par conséquent sur le rythme de transfert des fonds et donc sur
       la performance d’ensemble.


   •   Dans certains CPLS, en l’absence des OSC expérimentées, ce sont des OSC non
       expérimentées qui ont soumis des offres de services. Il leur a été difficile de
       s’adapter au rythme, aux approches et à tout le système de travail de la
       composante. Il a fallu un accompagnement de proximité ayant un impact négatif
       sur l’acquisition des résultats des autres activités


Composante 2 : financement base sur les Services clinques et communautaires pour
les malades du sida.
Le projet a financé des contrats de fourniture des services et des soins sur base d’achat
d’indicateurs.
Le SEP/CNLS a d’abord acheté 12 indicateurs dans 6 provinces. A partir de janvier
2010, les indicateurs ont été réduits de douze à six auxquels s’est ajouté après l’indicateur
sur la circoncision masculine et ils sont les suivants :
1) Dépistage volontaire du VIH
2) Femmes enceintes séropositives mises sous protocole ARV prophylactique
3) Prise en charge du nouveau-né d’une femme VIH+
4) Nombre de nouveaux cas sous ARV
                                             46
5) Nombre de clients ARV suivis pendant 6 mois
6) Cas d’IST traités
7) Circoncision masculine
Les résultats de la Composante 2
Selon la base de données en ligne du PBF du Burundi, les données quantitatives
compilées des formations sanitaires pour les indicateurs ci-dessus sont les suivantes,
pour l’année 2010.
   •   1180 femmes séropositives ont été mises sous protocole ARV prophylactique ;
   •   511 nouveaux- nés de femmes VIH+ ont été pris en charge ;
   •   334 409 personnes ont subi le test de dépistage et ont eu le résultat;
   •   981 nouveaux cas ont été mis sous traitement ARV ;
   •   1 322 clients ARV ont été suivis pendant 6 mois ;
   •   58 223 cas d’Infections Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) ont été traités
Pour la circoncision masculine (CM), il faut noter qu’elle a été intégrée dans le
programme Financement Basé sur les Résultats (FBR) depuis seulement le début de
l’année 2011. Cependant, on dispose actuellement des documents de référence suivants:
   •   Un rapport de l’étude d’acceptabilité et de faisabilité de la circoncision masculine
   •   un protocole pour l’opérationnalisation de la circoncision,
   •   une stratégie de communication.
Notons aussi que les données de base pour les années 2008 à 2011 ont été collectées et
sont disponibles.

           vulnérabilité des OEV et une meilleure planification ;
       -   Il existe un cadre légal pour la promotion et la protection des droits des
           PVVIH (Loi n° 8 du 12 mai 2005)


       b) Faiblesses


       -   Le nombre important d’OEV nécessiteux par rapport aux ressources
           permettant de les appuyer
       -   Le manque de soutien nutritionnel pour les OEV et les PVVIH.


Composante 4 : Renforcement des capacités des collectivités locales et des
ministères clés pour la mise en œuvre des activités de lutte contre le VIH et le sida et
la gestion du programme national.


Le projet a financé le fonctionnement du SEP/CNLS pour lui permettre d’assurer la
gestion et la coordination du projet et du programme national
Le Système de S&E a été renforcé par la réalisation de certaines études :
   -   La Synthèse épidémiologique du VIH/Sida au Burundi;
   -   L’Enquête bio-comportementale (BSS) 2011, dont une synthèse des indicateurs
       clé est donnée en annexe.
Dans le cadre de la consolidation du système d’information, des équipements
informatiques avec l’installation de la base des données SIDA-INFO ont été distribués
aux sites de prise en charge, tandis que les prestataires ont été formés à l’utilisation de cet
outil.


Dans le cadre de la coordination de la réponse et du renforcement des capacités :
   -   Des missions de supervision formatives dans tout le pays.
   -   Le cadre de résultats a été actualisé et régulièrement complété.
   -   Les outils standardisés de collecte des données ont été commandés.
   -   La formation des formateurs sur le SIG a été organisée. La formation sur
       l’utilisation de la Base de données SIDA INFO est organisée en continu.
   -   L’appui à l’amélioration des données sanitaires a été assuré
   -   La capacité de recherche du CNR a été renforcée
   -   Le projet a appuyé une réflexion sur les ministères clés et l’élaboration de 13
       nouveaux plans d’actions sectoriels de lutte contre le VIH et le sida.

                                              49
   -   Un nouveau code de financement des OSC a été élaboré et des sessions de
       coordination des OSC ont été tenues
   -   La rédaction et la diffusion d’une note techniques sur la gestion des données
Les forces et les faiblesses
   a) Forces


   -   Le SEP/CNLS dispose d’une équipe technique compétente et expérimentée
   -   Il existe des outils de gestion, de suivi évaluation et de collecte des données
   -   Il existe un cadre de résultats du PMLS2
   -   La Base SIDA INFO est fonctionnelle


   b) Faiblesses


   -   La faiblesse de prédictibilité des financements des programmes /projets de lutte
       contre le Sida,
   -   La pérennité de la structure du SEP/CNLS qui n’est pas assurée après la clôture
       du PMLS2, et la précarité d’emploi de son personnel.
   -   Les structures décentralisées, notamment le COCOLS ne sont pas encore
       fonctionnels de manière satisfaisante.

Au regard du suivi et du contrôle de la gestion financière du projet, on peut remarquer
que : (i) les rapports trimestriels de suivi financiers (RSF) ont été régulièrement produits,
(ii) le projet a fait l’objet de 2 audits financiers.

Le système de gestion financière est également allé en s’améliorant, puisqu’il était côté
« modérément satisfaisant » depuis le début jusqu’à mi-parcours du projet (juin 2010),
à « satisfaisante » au 31/12/2010 et à « très satisfaisante » au 31 mars 2011


Passation des marchés

Tous les marchés prévus ont été passés et exécutés. Néanmoins, les procédures de
passation de deux marchés et contrats importants ont accusé un retard: l’enquête socio-
comportementale (BSS) et le recrutement de l’agence d’exécution pour la provision d’un
paquet intégré de services VIH/SIDA aux professionnels du sexe. Une des explications
est que le processus a pris beaucoup de temps (adoption des TDR, sélection des
firmes ...); la responsabilité du retard étant partagée entre l’IDA et le SEP/CNLS du fait
notamment des nombreux échanges de documents entre les institutions avec souvent une
lenteur de réaction préjudiciable..

                                                            51
En dépit de ces petites faiblesses, le système de passation des marchés a également, de
façon progressive, amélioré sa performance, passant de la note « modérément
satisfaisant » depuis le début jusqu’à mi-parcours du projet (juin 2010), à « satisfaisante »
au 31/12/2010 et à « très satisfaisante » au 31 mars 201.

Les leçons apprises

Les faiblesses constatées, les problèmes rencontrés les expériences acquises avant, au
cours et à la clôture du projet permettent de tirer un certain nombre de leçons, qui seraient
utiles pour les projets similaires à initier dans le futur. Ces leçons ont trait aux aspects qui
suivent.

1. La nécessité de créer un environnement propice pour le démarrage et la mise en
   œuvre du projet. Dans le cas du PMLS II, on peut remarquer que les conditions d’un
   bon départ n’étaient pas totalement réunies : nécessité de renouveler les contrats de
   certains personnels, retard dans la mise en place de l’équipe de direction, préalables
   comme la signature de conventions avec le Ministère, la formalisation de la
   contractualisation, le processus du ciblage, le recrutement des agences d’exécution,
   ainsi que la lenteur dans l’appropriation de l’approche PBF par les acteurs de mise en
   œuvre du Projet, etc.

8. Importance d’une bonne connaissance de la situation et d’un meilleur ciblage
   des interventions. Pour s’assurer que les objectifs sont réalistes et que leur atteinte
   sera facilement mesurée, il est important d’avoir une bonne connaissance de la
   situation de départ. Dans le cas du présent projet, la mise à jour des données de base
   et l’actualisation des résultats cibles se sont avérées être un préalable, et elles n’ont
   été possible que grâce aux résultats de l’enquête BSS de 2007, qui n’ont été
   disponibles qu’en décembre 2008. De plus, cela a coûté du temps à un projet dont le
   démarrage effectif accusait déjà un retard de 6 à 8 mois.

9. La nécessité et l’intérêt d’expérimenter d’autres approches innovantes dans le
   financement des interventions. La nouvelle approche de contractualisation des
   services de prise en charge clinique des malades du sida , PTME et CM s’est avérée
   efficace pour la décentralisation et l’intégration effectives desdits services dans le
   paquet minimum/complémentaire d’activités des structures de soins. De la même
   façon, la nouvelle approche de financement des OSCs impliquées dans les activités de
   prévention en faveur des GPHR renferme des atouts aussi bien dans le choix des
   interventions que dans l’octroi du financement : (i) le champ d’action de
   l’intervention est bien cadré sous forme de paquet de services ; et (ii) le financement
   est conditionné par la définition claire des résultats à atteindre (pour la première
   tranche) et l’atteinte effective de ceux-ci (pour les tranches ultérieures). Cela étant, le
   temps d’apprentissage de ces nouvelles approches a eu un effet négatif sur la
   performance au début.




                                              52
4. La possibilité de faire beaucoup avec peu de moyens. Les ressources que le projet
   a utilisées (15 millions de dollars) étaient modestes et des résultats appréciables et
   réplicables ont été cependant atteints.

5. L’importance de l’appui à la mise en œuvre. Le présent projet a été exécuté dans
   des conditions assez difficiles. Cependant, toutes les activités ont pu se réaliser,
   malgré un calendrier très serré, et ce grâce à l’appui de la Banque, à travers les
   nombreuses missions d’appui à la mise en œuvre, effectués à un rythme régulier et
   soutenu de 3 missions par an en moyenne.

6. La capacité d’adaptation du SEP/CNLS. Bien que le personnel ait travaillé sous
   pression à cause (i) du retard pris dans le démarrage du projet suite à des facteurs qui
   n’étaient pas souvent sous sa maîtrise et (ii) de nouvelles approches dans la gestion et
   le financement de projet, (notamment l’approche de financement basé sur la
   performance, etc.) le personnel du SEP/CNLS a su s’adapter rapidement, se mobiliser
   et mobiliser ses partenaires de mise en œuvre pour la bonne exécution du projet.

CONCLUSION.
Les stratégies promues par le projet étaient novatrices et sont prometteuses. Elles
méritent d’être promues et passées à échelle.

Les études réalisées, notamment sur les besoins de la gestion des déchets biomédicaux, la
circoncision masculine, la synthèse épidémiologique 2010, la BSS 2011,…ont permis
ont une meilleure connaissance de l’état des lieux et une meilleure compréhension des
facteurs qui favorisent la propagation du VIH.

Ainsi, pour pérenniser les acquis du projet, les ressources doivent être mobilisées pour :
i. Mettre systématiquement et progressivement à l’échelle les approches de travail avec
     les groupes à plus haut risque (GPHR), en particulier les travailleuses du sexe (TS) ;
ii. Promouvoir la circoncision masculine à travers les mécanismes de financement basé
     sur les résultats (FBR), étant entendu que chacune de ces 2 stratégies est susceptible
     d’influer positivement sur l’autre.
iii. Renforcer les systèmes de S&E par l’introduction de système de gestion de
     l’information.
iv. Renforcer l’équipe de coordination du SEP pour assurer la pérennité à sa mission.
