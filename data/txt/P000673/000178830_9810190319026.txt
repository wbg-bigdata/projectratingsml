RE:.',T AYD RECON?MEDATICN OF THE PREIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPiENT CREDIT
TO THE EI4PIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FCR A DAIRY DEVELOPMET PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$4.4 million
to the Empire of Ethiopia to assist in financing a project for the devel-
opment of dairy production in the Addis Ababa area.
PART . - HISTORICAL
2.        This is the third agricultural project in Ethiopia to be submitted
to the Executive Directors for consideration, and the first in the field
of livestock. A $3.5 million credit (169-ET) approved in October 1969 for
agricultural development in the WVolamo area of Southern Ethiopia and a
$3.1 million credit (188-ET) approved in May 1970 to assist agricultural
development in the Humera region of north-western Ethiopia are both pro-
gressing satisfactorily.
3.        This project was initially prepared by a Project Preparation
Commission of the Imperial Ethiopian Government assisted by staff of the
Bank's Permanent Mission in East Africa. An appraisal mission visited
Ethiopia in April/May 1970. Extensive consultations with the Government
followed in arriving at the project in its present design.
4.        Negotiations began in Washington in February 1971.  The Borrower
was represented by H.E. Ato Worku Nekasha, Vice Minister of Agriculture,
Ato Beyene Chicaibelu, Director-General of the Livestock Production Division,
Ministry of Agriculture, and Ato Asfaw Damte, Financial and Economic Attache
at the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington, D.C. Negotiations were completed
in Paris on the occasion of the Consultative Group meeting for Ethiopia in
May, 1971.
5.        Two other lending proposals for Ethiopia may be ready for
presentation to the Executive Directors before the end of calendar 1971;
namely) a loan of approximately US$6.7 million for a coffee processing
project, and a loan of approximately US$9.5 million for a water supply and
sewerage project in the city of Addis Ababa. Other lending under consider-
ation for FY1972 would be for the Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank, for feeder road development, and for a second livestock project.



6.        The proposed credit would be the seventh credit to Ethiopia and
would increase total IDA lending to US$48.9 million. Ethiopia has also
rec ved eleven Bank loans totalling US$97.8 million. Three loans made in
1950 and 1951 are fully repaid. Seven loans are fully disbursed. A summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Ethiopia as at April 30, 1971 is
attached as Annex I.
7.        There are no particular disbursement problems, except for the
1963 credit (35-ET) and the 1968 loan (523-ET) and credit (1l1-ET) for high-
ways. The 1963 credit cannot be fully disbursed until the Government and
contractors have concluded arbitration proceedings arising out of claims
concerning completed road construction. Arrangements for arbitration
appear to be proceeding in an orderly manner. The delay in disbursement of
the 1968 loan and credit resulted from slow progress in the preparation of
acceptable tender documents and contractor prequalification. The small
number of responses to the first tender required a second tender with some
changed conditions. Contracts were finally signed in July and August 1969
and work is now proceeding normally.
8.        The IFC has committed US$3.1 million to the Cotton Company of
Ethiopia, US$1.0 million to the Ethiopian Pulp and Paper Company and
US$9.0 million to the HVA-Metahara sugar-growing and milling project.
After deducting amounts taken up by sub-subscribers, sales from portfolio
and principal repayments, the IFC now holds US$10.3 million for its own
account.
PART II - THE ECCN0Of
9.        A report "Economic Growth and Prospects in Ethiopia" (AE-9)
in five volumes was circulated on September 22, 1970.   A Country Data
sheet is at Annex II.
10.       W%Tith an estimated per capita incone of $63 per annum, EthioDia
is one of the poorest countries of its size.   Agriculture provides 901, of
employment, 60% of the gross national product and almost all exports.
While modern commercial farming is increasing, the majority of the popula-
tion is still engaged in subsistence farming on small holdings. The
contribution of the manufacturing sector to the Ethiopian economy is still
very small and the scope for rapid expansion is limited unless export
markets could be developed. Coffee accounts for about 60% of the total
value of exports. This heavy dependence on coffee renders the economy
vulnerable to short-term price fluctuations on the world coffee market and
presents a serious long-term balance of payments problem due to the fact
that world import demand for coffee grows very slowly, on average only
2-5 - 3So per annum.  The Government is fully aware that these structural
problems will inevitably take a long time to resolve, hut a start is being
made and the Government's long-term development strategy is based on the
development ar.d diversification of agriculture and the development and
promotion of non-coffee exports.



11.       Balance-of-payments projections for the next l1-15 years point
at the need for increased external aid on concessionary terms if a reason-
able rate of growth is to be sustained and the debt service burden kept
within manageable proportions. It is projected that the Ethiopian Govern-
ment will be able to finance about 48% of public investment from recurrent
budget surpluses and domestic borrowing over the next three years and wll
have to look to external assistance for the remainder.  Since many individual
projects will not be able to attract foreign assistance it follows that
if external assistance is to make an adequate overall contribution, signi-.
ficantly more than half the cost of other projects will have to be financed
by foreign capital. This often implies external financing of part of the
local expenditures as in the case of the proposed project.
12.       The principal conclusions of the Bank's most recent Economic
Report on Ethiopia are that after several years of fairly modest growth,
the higher coffee prices that have prevailed since the middle of 1969
should enable the country to achieve an average annual growth rate of 5.4%
over the next five years. A 60% increase in public investment and the
mobilization of additional domestic resources through new taxation are
provided for in the budget proposals for 1971/72 as recently submitted
to Parliament. At the same time the Government is making a serious effort
to improve the collection of existing taxes. The Government's overall
development strategy and investment priorities are in line with the con-
clusions of the Bank's Economic Report. The program for public in-vestment
and the raising of additional revenues during the next four years as
submitted to the members of the Consultative Group in Paris in May is more
ambitious than the one suggested in the 1970 Bank Economic Report but is
not considered unrealistic. The Government has set the stage for a major
increase in its development efforts based on sound principles and priorities.
PART III - THE PROJECT
13.       Ethiopia has the largest total national herd in Africa, and is
one of the few countries where there are more cattle than people. With
about 26 million cattle and about 56% of total land surface suitable
for grazing, Ethiopia's livestock represents a major national resource.
This resource, however, makes a disproportionately small contribution to
national income and export earmings due to unsatisfactory management,
diseases, and seasonal shortages of feed supply. A livestock sector
survey prepared by Bank staff was submitted to the Government in November
1970. This report outlines a development strategy for the livcesto lk sector
and identifies several project possibilities. The proposed project includes
$350,000 for exploratory drilling for water and consultants scrvices to
assist the Government in the preparation of projects identified by this
sector survey.
14.       Milk is produced for home consumption from goats and domestic
cattle throughout Ethiopia.  Commercial dairy farming nas only been
established in the two largest urban centers, Addis Ababa and Asmara.



There is Etrong evidence that the demand for milk in Addis Ababa, a city
of about 700,000, exceeds current supply by a wide margin. Per capita
consumption is only 10% of that in Nairobi and 20% of that in Asmara.
Supply has to be rationed. Hawkers sell non-pasteurized milk outside
the official distribution channels at premium prices. Large quantities
of powdered milk have to be imported to supplement fresh milk supplies.
Current fresh milk supply to Addis Ababa from all sources is estimated
at between 13,000 and 25,000 liters per day depending on the season.
The proposed project is estimated to increase milk supply by 31,000 liters
by 1980. Demand in 1980 is conservatively estimated at 59,000 liters.
15.       A report entitled "Addis Ababa Dairy Development Project,
Ethiopia" (PA-68) is being circulated separately. The proposed project
aims at increasing dairy production in the Addis Ababa area by providing
loans to farmers for the development of 240 small and 110 medium-sized
dairy farms and for the development of six ranches for breeding dairy
cattle, together with expansion of facilities for milk collecting,
processing, and marketing, and the provision of the necessary technical
services. In addition, finance is provided under the project for the
preparation of studies for future livestock development projects. A
Credit and Project Summary is at Annex III.
16.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$6.4 million,
about 70% of which is proposed to be financed by the Association. The
proposed credit covers the foreign exchange component of approximately
US$3.3 million and an additional US$1.1 million for local costs, the
justification for which is discussed in paragraph 11 above.  The Govern-
ment, the Dairy Development Agency (DDA) and the Agricultural and Indus-
trial Development Bank (AIDB) would finance about US$1.5 million of the
total project cost, while the remainder of us$0.5 million would be supplied
by the farmers themselves. In order to avoid delays in the recruitment
of project staff and in the initiation of feasibility studies, the
proposed project includes a provision for $100,000 of retroactive financing
of expenditure for these purposes incurred after January 1, 1971.
17.       The responsibility for the execution of the project is shared
by the Government, DDA and AIDB. DDA is a recently created, autonomous,
Government-owned agency. It is the successor of the Addis Ababa Dairy
Industry Section within the MiTnistry of Agriculture, which was responsible
for the operation of a system of milk collection, processing, and marketing.
The dairy plant which was originally established with the assistance of
the United Nations International Children Fund (UNICEF) has been transferred
to DDA. An Order providing for the establishment of DDA has recently
been promulgated by the Enperor. Additional powers required by DDA for
the execution of the project will be provided by a Proclamation, a draft
of which has already been submitted to Parliament. The enactment of this
Proclamation is a pre-condition to the signing of the agreements. AIDB
is also Government-o-.med and was recently created as a result of the
amalgamation of the former Ethiopian Investment Corporation and the
Development Bank of Ethiopia, following the recommendations of a Finan-
cial Intermediaries Reorganization Commission which received technical



assistance from the WTorld Bank. However, due to the recent establishment
of AIDB and the fact that it is still in the process of evaluation of the
loans acquired from its predecessor agencies, it is proposed that, at least
initially, AIDB would act as an agent of the Government in making loans to
participating farmers, and would keep Dairy Project funds separate from
its own accounts. These arrangements could be modified with the Associa-
tion's approval following a satisfactory appraisal of AIDB's finaricial
prospects, in connection with a proposed Bank Group financing of AIDB.
18.       DDA would be responsible for the technical appraisal of applica-
tions for dairy loans under the project and for assisting farmers in
drawing up viable farm development plans. AIDB would appraise the farmers'
creditworthiness and would grant loans under the project acting as agent
of the Government.  DDA would assist ATDB in supervision of the loans,
provide technical assistance to participating farmers, and would assist
in collecting repayments of principal and interest through deductions
from the proceeds of milk sales. DDA, acting in consultation with AIDB,
would further be responsible for the procurement of cattle under this
project and for the distribution of purchased cattle to participating
farmers. The price to farmers would be calculated to cover DDBMs costs
of purchase, transportation, acclimatization and stock losses.
19.       For the purpose of making sub-loans to farmers the Government
would open a Project Account with the National Bank of Ethiopia to be
operated by AIDB. The aggregate of all sub-loans to be made to farmers
is estimated at $2.4 million. Sub-loans to farmers would carry an interest
rate of 9-1/2% per annum and would be for a period not exceeding 14 years.
Of this 9-l125( interest DDA would retain 2% and AIDB 1o as compensation
for work performed and risk assumed while the remainder of 6-1/2% plus
the principal repayments would be paid by AIDB into the Project Account.
The risk of defaults by farmers would be shared equally by DDA and AIDB.
AIDB would provide participating farmers with their requirements for
short-term credit.
20.       About $1.21 million of the proposed credit wiould be relent by
the Government to DDA at 6-1/2' for a term of' 20 years including a 6-year
period of grace. This would finance increases in the capacity of the
dairy processing plant, e-pansion in the network of milk ccl ection centers
and marketing outlets, the establishment of a crossore½-d;-g -,^nch, and
the development of a special farm for the purposes of condu;; ng feeding
trials and holding newly acquired cattle for observation and acclimatiza-
tion prior to delivery to participating farmers. An additional $630,000
of the proposed credit would be passed on to DDA by the Government as
a grant to finance the foreigi exchange cost of senior administrative
and technical staff to assist in executing the Project until local
counterparts can be trained.
21.       Purchase of dairy cattle from outside Ethiopia for project
purposes would be organized and effected by DDA. International cormipetitive
bidding is not appropriate for the purchase of livestock, which would be
procured on the basis of price quotations from potential suppliers in at



- 6 -
least three different countries, taking into account milk production
standards and suitability for Ethiopian conditions. All cattle imported
wiould also have to satisfy appropriate veterinary requirements. The
purchase and installation of equipment for the Shola Dairy Plant and
purchase of vehicles by DDA would be subject to normal international
competitive bidding. The construction of milk collection, marketing
and processing facilities and investments on farms operated by DDA,
costing in total about $150,000, would be too small to attract inter-
national conpetition, and would be subject to local competitive tender.
Assurances have been obtained that prior to the award of contracts for
the purchase and installation of equipment necessary for the expansion
of the Shola Dairy Plant, DDA will obtain the certification of UNICEF
that the equipment to be ordered and the work to be done are technically
sound. Goods and services required for on-farm development will normally
be obtained by the farmers through existing commercial channels.
22.       Assurances have been obtained that DDA would set the price to
be paid to farmers at a level providing adequate incentives to them to
produce and sell milk to DDA, and would set its retail prices for milk
at levels sufficient to enable it to cover its operating expenses and
earn a reasonable return on its capital. The overall economic rate of
return of the project is estimated at 12-16%. Financial rates of return
on investments made by individual farmers under the project are estimated
at about 17-21%.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMEMTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association, DDA and AIDB, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for under Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the
text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
2h.       The draft Agreements conform generally to the pattern of recent
agreements for agricultural credit projects and in particular to the
pattern of recent agreements for dairy projects. The relending of the
proceeds of the Credit to DDA and to farmers through AIDB will be governed
by the terms of project financing agreements, satisfactory to the Associa-
tion, to be concluded between the Empire of Ethiopia and DDA and AIDB
respectively.
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.



PART V - RECOM'TIENDATION
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
