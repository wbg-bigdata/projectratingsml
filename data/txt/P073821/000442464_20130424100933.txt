F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the national HIV/AIDS program, which the proposed MAP will
support, is to reduce the transmission of HIV, to improve the quality of life of those infected and
affected by AIDS, and to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS in all sectors and at all levels of
Malawian society.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised project development objective was to increase access to prevention, treatment, and
mitigation services, with a focus on behavioral change interventions and addressing the needs of
highly vulnerable populations, including those affected and infected by the epidemic.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     At the time of the project appraisal (2004), Malawi was among the poorest countries in
the world with real Gross Domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 2 percent for 1999-2004.
The population was estimated at around 10 million people. Approximately 52 percent of the
population was living below the poverty line. Malawi was spending 7.2% of GDP as the
percentage of public expenditure on health. Life expectancy was 49 years. The maternal
mortality ratio was 620 deaths per 100,000 live births and the under-five mortality rate was 134
per 1,000 live births.

2.     The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi was among the most severe in the region. UNAIDS
estimated in 2001 that 15% of adults aged 15-49 were infected, which translated to about
1,000,000 adults and children with HIV. At that time, there were widespread misconceptions
among the population about how to prevent the disease. As a result, high risk behavior among
sexually active youth and adults was common practice.

3.     Most transmission in Malawi was believed to be via heterosexual contact (90%), with
mother-to-child transmission a distant second (8%). Women were contracting HIV at younger
ages than men and had higher prevalence rates (four to six times more in the 15-29 age group).

4.      The financial and human resources of the already weak public health sector had been
further strained by increasing demands to provide care, treatment and prevention services for
HIV/AIDS. The health system in Malawi was weak, understaffed and struggling to manage the
global burden of disease, with efforts further compromised by the need to manage the
generalized HIV epidemic.

5.     To respond to this massive challenge, Malawi created an enabling institutional
arrangement: (i) The Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) assumed responsibility for
HIV/AIDS policy and HIV/AIDS program oversight in Malawi, (ii) the National AIDS
Commission (NAC) was established in July 2001 to coordinate and facilitate the national
response, and (ii) District AIDS Coordinating Committees (DACCs) were formed in the mid-
1990s in Malawi’s rural and urban districts to coordinate and monitor local HIV/AIDS initiatives.

6.    The Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS (MAP) project was a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) for
Malawi under the Second Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP II).

7.      The Bank’s support to the Malawi HIV/AIDS program stemmed from its comparative
knowledge of design and implementation issues of HIV/AIDS projects. The Bank’s input into
the design of the financial, procurement, and monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems has also
proven valuable. Lastly, the flexibility of MAP financial support and the Bank’s willingness to
participate in a pool funding mechanisms made the MAP support a desirable complement to
assistance from other development partners.



                                               1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The original PDOs of the project was to reduce the transmission of HIV, to improve the
quality of life of those infected and affected by AIDS, and to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS
in all sectors and at all levels of Malawian society. These PDOs were exactly aligned with the
objectives of the National HIV/AIDS Action Framework (NAF).

9.      Key indicators for the original project were: (i) Percent of people who are HIV-infected
(by gender, age, residence); (ii) Percent of orphans and other vulnerable children to whom
community support is provided (be gender and residence); (iii) Percent of sexually active
respondents who had sex with a non-regular partner within the past 12 months (by gender,
residence), and (iv) Percent of population expressing accepting attitudes towards persons living
with HIV/AIDS. These key indicators were extracted from indicators of the National M&E Plan
of the NAF.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The original PDOs were revised at the time of the Additional Financing (AF) in 2009 and
were replaced by one single PDO. The revised PDO was to increase access to prevention,
treatment, and mitigation services, with a focus on behavioral change interventions and
addressing the needs of highly vulnerable populations, including those affected and infected by
the epidemic.

11.    The PDO was modified to reflect changes in Regional guidance regarding PDO structure
of new HIV/AIDS operations based on knowledge gained through MAP implementation
experience and more scientific evidence on the epidemiology of the epidemic.

12.     New key indicators were identified at the time of the AF. The new key indicators were:
(i) Percent sexually active men and women (15-49 years) having sex with a more than one
partner (non-regular partner) in the last 12 months; (ii) Percent of people reporting the use of a
condom during sexual intercourse at last high-risk sex (sex with a non-cohabiting or non-regular
partner) (by gender and age) (iii) Median age at first sex among 15-24 year olds (by gender); and
(iv) Percent of young people (15-24) who both correctly identify ways of preventing
transmission and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission (by gender).

13.    These indicators for the proposed Additional Financing were aligned with the Africa
Region HIV/AIDS Scorecard and Malawi’s National HIV/AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation
framework which was already aligned with the agreed United National General Assembly
Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.    The primary beneficiaries of the project were identified by the type of benefits that they
were to receive from the project as shown in Table 1 below.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparation

28.    The project team made a bold choice to support HIV/AIDS operations in Malawi through
an HIV/AIDS sector-wide approach (SWAp) by participating in the pool funding mechanisms at
a time when there was much pressure to design the operation as many other MAP projects.

29.    The MAP project was designed around the 2005 – 2009 NAF that was later extended to
2010-2012. In 2003, NAC and national stakeholders initiated the development of a programmatic
framework to guide the implementation of the NAF - the Strategic Management Plan (SMP).
The task team actively participated in the development of the SMP.

30.     Both development of the SMP and the project design were conducted in a very
participative process. In addition to working with the NAC Secretariat, NAC Board of
Commissioners, and pooled funding mechanisms partners, the project team worked closely with
the MOF and the Economic Planning and Development (EP&D) department to ensure that the
proposed national HIV/AIDS program was fully consistent with the Poverty Reduction Support
Paper (PRSP), and to ensure that it was classified as a priority program for inclusion in the
Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) and its funding included in the Mid-term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). As a result, as of the fiscal year 2003, NAC appeared for the first time in
the national budget document with its own budget line.

31.     The project team and pool funding mechanisms partners discussed joint oversight
arrangements and how to manage the supervision relationship. The proposed supervision
arrangement was built around joint six-monthly reviews to examine NAC progress reports, audit
reports, and independent consultant reports.

32.     During the project preparation, financing modalities for operating the pooled funding
account were discussed in depth with NAC and MOF staff. Procurement clinics were held with
civil society stakeholders to disseminate information about procedures contained in the NAC
Procurement Manual to be used by grant recipients.

Project design

33.     After the design of the SMP in 2003, NAC invited its external development partners to
provide their financial assistance in support of the SMP, on the basis of a joint annual work plan,
using joint financial, procurement, and reporting mechanisms, rather than funding multiple
HIV/AIDS projects each requiring parallel systems with tracking and reporting to individual
partner's funds. The Bank responded positively and accepted to be part of the pool funding
mechanisms partners.

34.    The SMP was composed of seven major subprograms: (i) prevention and advocacy; (ii)
treatment, care and support; (iii) impact mitigation; (iv) sectoral mainstreaming; (v) capacity

                                                5
building and partnerships; (vi) monitoring evaluation and research; and (vii) national leadership
and coordination. These seven SMP subcomponents constituted the seven components of the
MAP project in the project appraisal document (PAD).

35.     The pool funding mechanisms partners agreed to support the SMP and subscribed to
agreed common systems for planning, financial management, financial and program reporting,
procurement, auditing, and monitoring and evaluation and program reviews. Through the
HIV/AIDS pool funding mechanisms, the partners agreed to fund the implementation of joint
integrated annual work plans with agreed outputs and timeframes. Partners also agreed that
funded activities would be subject to Bank’s fiduciary framework, including its financial and
management, procurement, and anti-corruption guidelines.

36.     Towards the closing of the original project, the task team sought approval for an AF in
order to (i) scale up activities under the original project given the success achieved in scaling up
HIV prevention and treatment services, and the critical importance of continuing to address the
AIDS epidemic in Malawi; (ii) modify the original PDO, to reflect the new Regional
requirements for HIV/AIDS operations, and (iii) request a three-year extension of the project
closing date from September 30, 2009 to September 30, 2012. No change in project components
was proposed. The only proposed change to the project’s implementation modalities involved the
flow of funds, with respect to holding a designated account at the same reserve Bank of Malawi
as other pool funding mechanisms partners, instead of a standalone account at a commercial
bank.

Quality at entry

37.    The programmatic framework as presented in the draft PAD was reviewed during the
Joint Review with national stakeholders and the NAC Board of Commissioners, and was
endorsed as the framework for joint work programming.

38.     A financial management capacity assessment of the NAC and key implementing partners
was carried out prior to appraisal. It was noted that the program would be implemented in a high
risk environment. The main risk would come from the multiplicity of implementing local NGOs
at the district level, many with limited management capacity. However, adequate mitigation
measures and controls were put in place to manage the bulk of the risks that would arise to
partner and basket funds on-granted by NAC to implementing partners.

39.     NAC gave priority to preparation of operational manuals, clarification of key
responsibilities, formation of coalitions, and assessment of institutional capacity. To facilitate
start-up of program activities immediately after MAP effectiveness, NAC prepared an annual
work plan and procurement plan with stakeholder input, and selected the financial management
agency (FMA) and Umbrella organizations so that the Grants facility would be operational
during the first quarter of the first year.

2.2 Implementation

40.    The implementing agency for the project was NAC, supported by line Ministries and
other public institutions, civil society organizations and PLWHA.
                                                 6
41.      Pool funding mechanisms partners met on a regular basis as planned to discuss progress
and bottlenecks in the implementation of the SMP, and the bank task team participated actively
in all the meetings. Coordination among partners seemed to work properly throughout the project
implementation period. This explains why the pool funding mechanisms partners continued to
work together under the same arrangements during the implementation of the next national
strategic plan (2012 – 2016) and the new Bank funded HIV/nutrition project also used these
arrangements.

42.    With assistance from the pool funding mechanisms partners, the improved capacity of the
health delivery system to provide equitable access to ARVs and drugs for the management of
HIV-related infections resulted in treatment, care and support increasingly dominating the
national response with support from the donors, and in particular the GFATM.

43.     However, while the GFATM earmarked most of its funding to ARVs treatment, the Bank
along with other pool funding mechanisms partners concentrated their efforts on prevention
activities, including the PMTCT program which made significant gains during the project
implementation period.

44.     All pool funding mechanisms partners actively participated in the preparation of all
annual work plans as well as joint annual reviews which were both coordinated by NAC. It is on
the basis of these commonly agreed upon annual plans that every partner disbursed funds for
their implementation. There was harmony between pool funding mechanisms partners and this is
the reason why all of them agreed to continue with the same partnership to support the new NSF.

45.    NAC conducted a mid-term review (MTR) of the 2004-2009 NAF on behalf of all the
pooled funding partners. In general, the MTR found that the interventions implemented as part of
the multi-sectoral response have yielded positive results in the area of ARV treatment, public
awareness campaign, VCT, and home-based care.

46.     However, some shortcomings were also noted, including (i) capacity constraints in
almost all civil society organizations in terms of human resources and skills, (ii) poor integration
of HIV services, (iii) unequal access for coverage of HIV/AIDS services between rural and urban
areas, (iv) some services to OVC were not fully implemented due to insufficient resources, and
(v) there were some problems with procurement and supply chain management.

47.    During the AF these shortcomings were addressed with different level of successes. Poor
capacity of civil society organizations was addressed through the continuous engagement of
implementing partners by building their capacity through training, mentoring, supervision and
provision of equipment.

48.    Poor integration was addressed through integration of HIV and reproductive health
services. In addition, effective integration of PMTCT and ART increased access to treatment
among women, who are disproportionately affected by the epidemic.




                                                 7
49.    Unequal access for coverage of HIV/AIDS services was addressed through increase in
ART sites, including in rural areas. Some additional measures such as the push system and use of
community based distribution agents were implemented to increase the availability of HIV
prevention services at facility and community levels.

50.     With regard to OVC, NAC facilitated improved targeting mechanisms, as well as
sustainable mechanisms for providing this support to the target groups. However, the shortage of
funds from the GFATM for this activity negatively affected the number of OVC that the program
was able to reach.

51.     Finally with regard to procurement and supply chain management problems, reforms are
currently underway at CMS, which has been now established as a Public Trust. Its Trustees have
been appointed and have since commenced their functions. The Trustees will strengthen the
capacity of CMS. Furthermore, a Supply Chain Management Agent was recruited as an interim
measure to assist in this regard.

52.      2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design

53.    The NAC developed a national Monitoring and Evaluation Plan 2006-2010 in line with
the National HIV and AIDS Action Framework (NAF) 2005-2009. The Monitoring and
Evaluation Plan was aligned and harmonized with the NAF and enhanced the principle of the
“Three Ones? (One agreed HIV/AIDS Action Framework that provides the basis for
coordinating the work of all partners; One National AIDS Coordinating Authority, with a broad
based multi-sector mandate; and One agreed country level Monitoring and Evaluation System).

54.     In an effort to support the Government and development partners’ desire to harmonize
monitoring and evaluation arrangements, the PDO and results framework for the original project
were designed to align with those for the NAF. This is in line with the World Bank’s desire to
support the strengthening of the entire health system for sustainability purposes and Government
ownership. The performance indicators in the PAD, which were selected from the larger list of
indicators in the NAF, were relevant to the project.

55.    The results framework for the AF was a subset of the overall framework for the NAF and
was also congruent with Malawi’s Universal Access indicators and targets.

56.     With the AF, outcome indicators for the project were restructured in order to be aligned
with the new Africa Region HIV/AIDS regional scorecard. In addition, the task team dropped
some intermediate indicators and replaced them with new ones chosen from the M&E
framework. The choice of the new indicators was influenced by new knowledge gained from the
implementation of MAPs. In addition, the choice of new intermediate indicators needed to focus
more on measuring access to HIV/AIDS services rather than scaling up services as was the case
during the original project.




                                               8
57.     Some selected indicators, however, were not clearly defined or their definition changed
between the baseline and the closing of the project. There are pitfalls when selected indicators
are not clearly defined since the onset of the project. There were positive achievements on a
number of indicators accomplished under this project. However, the definition of two outcome
indicators changed between baseline and the closing date of the project, making any inference on
the progress made on these indicators very difficult.

58.     Some other indicators where not appropriate given new knowledge in M&E. It is not
clear for example why the indicator on HIV prevalence was kept for the AF. The HIV prevalence
may take time to decrease even in the event of a successful project because this is a chronic
condition. In addition, the scaling up of ARV may have an impact on keeping the HIV
prevalence high through longer survival of HIV infected patients taking the drugs.

Implementation

59.     A comprehensive logical framework of the NAF, the operational plan with
implementation responsibilities, and the first year work plan for M&E were prepared and field
tested, and training on M&E for all stakeholders was conducted in June 2003.

60.     Districts were responsible for completing the Local Authority HIV/AIDS Reporting Form
to capture data on all non-health related HIV activities in the district, and to share this
information with NAC on a quarterly basis using the Local Assembly Quarterly Service
Coverage Report. Health related data was captured through the Health Management Information
System (HMIS). Data was collected from health facilities on a monthly basis and reported to
Local Assemblies (District Health Officers) on a quarterly basis. A comprehensive review of the
HMIS was undertaken. After the review, the HMIS was upgraded to capture more HIV/AIDS
related indicators.

61.     Some minor problems were notice at the beginning on the project with data quality.
Efforts were undertaken to improve the quality of data collection, and management within the
National M&E system. A Monitoring and Evaluation Information System Technical Working
Group has been appointed by the NAC to advise on the M&E system.

Utilization

62.     Project funds enabled a clear improvement of the knowledge of the epidemic in Malawi
thanks to the availability of several study reports that were conducted over the duration of the
project.

63.     The various reports such as the sentinel surveys, the behavioral and biological studies and
the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have all brought out empirical evidence on the state
of the HIV response in Malawi.

64.    NAC, in collaboration with various partners, produced the country's national response
progress reports currently referred to as Global AIDS Response Progress Report (GARPR) but
formally known as the UNGASS Report, which are submitted to the UN. In addition, NAC also

                                                9
submitted Country HIV Epidemic Update reports to the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Secretariat.

65.    In order to make available HIV and AIDS research based information, National Research
Dissemination Conferences were held during the project implementation period. Websites have
also been developed both at NAC and in partner organizations and this has resulted in easy
accessibility of research findings. In addition, an inventory of research information in an HIV
and AIDS data base was developed and linked to the SADC website and is accessible through
the NAC website. This site has all the research documentation in the SADC region. Moreover,
one can access all the literature on research nationally and internationally.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

66.    A procurement assessment of the NAC and key implementing partners was carried out
prior to appraisal. It was noted that the program would be implemented in a high risk
environment, arising from the multiplicity of implementing partners, many with limited
procurement skills.

67.    With respect to the multiplicity of implementing partners, potential grant recipients were
screened for organizational and financial capacity before grants were approved. Separate grant
agreements were signed with each grant recipient defining, among other things, the financial
accounting and reporting rules to be observed by the recipient and sanctions to be applied in case
of breach of the rules. The recruited FMA and umbrella organizations were responsible for
monitoring compliance with these guidelines, and audits by independent auditors were
performed to verify the accuracy of reporting.

68.      During the implementation, procurement consulting services was retained by NAC to
assist the Secretariat and implementing partners with procurement tasks, as required. In addition
to the procurement agent for specialized HIV/AIDS drugs, MOHP and partners worked together
to put in place an institutional development / capacity building program for the CMS with the
aim of upgrading procurement procedures, skills, and commodities management/distribution
over the medium term. Over the long term, there are plans to establish a Trust to replace the
current CMS to enable greater institutional sustainability in the pharmaceuticals sector, which is
particularly critical given the expanding national ARV treatment program.

69.     All financial audit reports had unqualified audit opinions. Agreed Financial Management
Action Plans have generally been implemented and, in instances where the Action Plan has not
been fully implemented, NAC has provided a satisfactory explanation to justify not taking an
indicated action.

70.    The project’s final procurement and financial management was rated satisfactory as there
was adherence to the Bank Guidelines, Malawi Public Procurement Law, and NAC Procurement
Manual. Timely payments were made to bidders, there were no complaints or mis-procurements
under the project, and finally there was excellent recordkeeping.

71.   NAC has consistently provided timely responses to audit queries. Procurement cycle
management (and supply chain management) has improved over the course of the operation. The
                                               10
Procurement Improvement Action Plan has been developed to further strengthen NAC
procurement capacity.

72.     All legal covenants have been met and the implementation of the waste management plan
proceeded in a satisfactory manner. The Health Care Waste Management Plan for the original
project was developed in a participatory manner with Government and key stakeholders. The
implementation of this plan was assessed as satisfactory by the MTR and continued to be
satisfactory until the closing of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

73.     In terms of post-completion operation, the Bank has committed to continued support to
the national HIV/AIDS response through US$80 million over the next five years (2012-2017).
Out of this total amount, US$50 million will address HIV and AIDs prevention interventions.
Whilst this will support the overall implementation of the NSP (2011-2016), there are earmarked
resources to scale up implementation of high impact and cost effective HIV prevention
interventions such as VMMC and PMTCT.

74.     The GFATM has also shown commitment towards concluding negotiations on the Single
Stream Funding (SSF) Grant with the Malawi Government. This is a consolidated grant for the
Round 1 Phase 2 Rolling Continuation Chanel (RCC) and Round 7 Phase 2 HIV Prevention
grants for the country, following the new GFATM's grant architecture on similar disease country
grants. The total amount for the SSF is about US$208 million over a period of two years (April
2012 to June 2014), with the majority of the resources planned for the integrated ART/PMTCT
program.

75.     From a process perspective, the institutional arrangements, procedures, and systems put
in place with MAP and partner assistance are expected to be sustainable and to continue to be in
use beyond the project closing date. The strengthening of skills and knowledge among civil
society groups, private companies, and public sector institutions is expected to result in lasting
capacity in the public and private sectors to undertake such HIV/AIDS programs in future.
However, financial sustainability will continue to depend on external financial partnerships for
the foreseeable future.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

76.    The relevance of objectives is rated High.

77.    The project adheres to the basic objectives of the second Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy 2011-2016 (MGDS-II), and the revised (2010-2012) National HIV and
AIDS Action Framework (NAF). The project and its objectives are reflected in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY2007-FY2011) under Pillar 3: Decrease vulnerability at the
household level from HIV/AIDS and malnutrition.
                                               11
78.     The project objectives are aligned with the overall goal of the new 2011-2016 NSP which
is to prevent the further spread of HIV infection, promote access to treatment for PLHIV and
mitigate the health, social-economic and psychosocial impact of HIV and AIDS on individuals,
families, communities and the nation.

79.     The Joint Financing Agreement between the Government of Malawi and its funding
partners, including the Bank, reflects agreements and commitments made to the UNAIDS
principles of the ‘Three Ones’, the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, The Accra Agenda for Action and the Busan Partnership for
Effective Development Cooperation.

80.    Finally, these project result outcomes are well aligned with the new World Bank Africa
Region Strategy under pillar 2: “Vulnerability and Resilience,? which centers on reducing
vulnerability and building resilience to the idiosyncratic health shocks due to HIV/AIDS, malaria
and other diseases.

Relevance of design

81.    The relevance of design is rated Substantial.

82.     The technical aspects of the NAF have been aligned with international best practice,
particularly given the increasing focus and resource allocation on prevention. While GFATM
mainly supported ARV treatment activities, most of the funds from the MAP project were
directed towards prevention activities both in the original and AF projects.

83.   Different components of the project were well aligned with the subcomponents of the
NAF in the spirit of the SWAp arrangement. The content and selected interventions of the
Malawi NAF which the project supported were appropriate and in line with current
recommended practice.

Relevance of implementation

84.    The relevance of implementation is rated Substantial.

85.    The same institutional arrangements from this project were used to design the next
HIV/AIDS and Nutrition project to be supported by the World Bank and other partners in the
country, thereby demonstrating the relevance of this project’s institutional arrangement for its
implementation.

86.     In terms of implementation performance, all components have been rated moderately
satisfactory or higher throughout the project life. Overall implementation has remained on track
with cumulative disbursements reaching 100% of the additional financing.

87.    Rating: Given the relevance of objectives (high), design (substantial) and implementation
(substantial), the overall rating is Substantial for both the original and AF phases of the project.

                                                12
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

88.    Although the achievements below cannot be attributed to the sole contribution of the
Bank supported project (as part of the pool funding mechanisms), the Bank’s contribution to the
national program results achievements were substantial.

89.    For example the Bank’s contribution to the strengthening of the NAC to become a
functional coordinating body as well as strengthening its leadership and fiduciary capacities. As
noted early in this document, it was under the Bank’s leadership and consistent dialogue with the
Government that NAC appeared for the first time in the national budget document with its own
budget line.

90.    In addition, the Bank contribution was recognized in its convening power to bring the
Government and the majority of pool funding mechanisms partners to concentrate their
contributions to prevention efforts so that available resources are not diverted to ARV treatment
only.

91.     Also, the project team and a pool funding mechanisms partners agreed to support “one?
program framework (the SMP) and subscribed to agreed common systems for planning, financial
management, financial and program reporting, procurement, auditing, and monitoring and
evaluation and program reviews. Clearly these arrangements contributed to high level of
efficiency observed during the implementation of the program.

92.     Finally, in looking at the results below, the reader should consider the fact that, unlike
specific projects, the expected results of programs (like the one supported under this MAP
project) have a longer time frame, with no fixed end-point. However, trends data clearly show
that the national effort is on the right trajectory.

a) Original PDO results achievement (outcome level)

Original PDO #1: Mitigate the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS in all sectors and all
levels of Malawian society

93.       The achievement of original PDO 1 is rated Modest.

94.    The percentage of people who are HIV positive (the prevalence of HIV) has decreased
from a baseline value of 14.2% to 12.0% in 2009.

95.    During the same period, the numbers of new HIV infections have declined over the past
years due to the contributions of multiple prevention and control interventions, including ART.
The number of people with HIV infection who were receiving ARV by September 2009 was
147,497; largely surpassing the original target of 25,000. There have been slight but steady
reductions over time in the number of new cases of HIV.

96.     The figures in table 3 above show that there has not been much progress in terms of the
percent of orphans and other vulnerable children (OVC) to whom community support has been
provided. However, an in-depth analysis of this indicator shows that there has indeed been an
increase in the number of supported OVC over time. The denominator for this indicator changed
over time to include all orphans irrespective of the HIV status of deceased parents.

97.     According to UNICEF, this changed the number of estimated OVCs from about 1.2
million to over 2 million. Therefore, even though more children were receiving care and support;
as there are more vulnerable children, the percentage of OVCs receiving support has decreased
because the increase in the number of supported OVCs didn’t keep up with the sudden increase
in the new denominator.

Original PDO #2: Reduce the transmission of HIV

98.       The achievement of the original PDO2 is rated Modest

99.     The percentage of sexually active respondents who had sex with a non-regular partner
within the past 12 months has decreased between baseline data (2004 DHS) and the end of the
original project in 2009 (2006 MICS). However, the values for both males and females were still
short of the targets set for the end of the original project.



                                                               14
100. There are however problems in trying to compare data from DHS to MICS surveys
because the 2 do not use the same methodologies. Since this indicator was retained for the AF,
there is better explanation of its achievement below under the revised PDO indicator where 2004
DHS data are compared to 2012 DHS data.

Original PDO #3: Improve the quality of life of those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS

101.     Rating: The achievement of the original PDO #3 is rated Modest.

104. HIV prevalence among the adult population continued to decline from 12% in 2009 at the
time of the AF to 10.6% in 2012 at the closing of the project. In parallel, the percent of
respondents with multiple partners in the past 12 months sharply decreased from 22% in males
and 6.5% in females to 9.2% in men and 0.7% in females, respectively.

105. For the indicator on percent of people reporting condom use at last high risk sex, the
percentages fell for both men and women. This is therefore an extremely worrying trend as it
would imply that although there are fewer respondents reporting multiple partners in last 12
months (see previous indicator), those who do are less likely to use a condom. However, this
indicator was framed differently between the baseline and the 2010 DHS making inferences from
the data a little bit complicated. Having “multiple sexual partners? was defined at baseline as
having more than one sexual partner in the last 12 months. It is not the exact definition of “high
risk partner? used in 2010 DHS which is defined as having sex with a non-regular partner or
non-cohabiting partner.

106. Retrofitted analysis applied on the 2004 DHS data using the same definition as for the
2010 DHS shows that the actual baseline was 15.9% for female and 20.0% for males, suggesting
an increase in condom use (by almost 100%) in high risk situations between the 2 periods of time.

107. For the indicator on the median age at first intercourse among 15-24 years, the values
slightly decreased for both males and females. This behavior may be related to other cultural
behavior not necessarily related to HIV/AIDS in a given society. Therefore, in order to change
this behavior, messages should be more general than the ones provided for HIV/AIDS mitigation.

108. The 2010 DHS found that 41.8 % of women and 44.7% of men had “comprehensive?
knowledge of HIV/AIDS, slightly short of the target for males and surpassing the target for
females. However, when you unpack the data, most young (15-24 year-old) women and men
know that HIV can be prevented by having sex with just one uninfected partner (85%),
abstaining from sex (80%), and using condoms (70%). The separate figures for men and women
are very similar.

109. The achievement for the revised PDO is rated modest: among the 5 indicators measuring
the revised PDO, 3 were achieved (if we consider the 2004 DHS retrofitted analysis results for
condom use in high risk sexual encounters) and two partially achieved.

3.3 Efficiency

110.        Rating: The overall efficiency of the project is rated Substantial.

111. Most of the data used for the efficiency analysis are from the Burden of Disease
Estimates for 2011 and the potential effects of the essential health package (EHP) on Malawi’s
health burden (Cam Bowie) and the multi-country analysis of treatment costs for HIV/AIDS
(MATCH) conducted by the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI, October 2012).
Methodologies used for both studies are in Annex 3 (Economic and Financial analysis).

112. Figure 1 shows results from the resource mapping study for a cost effectiveness analysis
of interventions by disease burden averted. The analysis showed that it costs approximately
US$29 to avert a health life year lost through the provision of ARVs. This is less than the
provision of malaria treatment ($42), providing malaria bednets ($95), and spraying insecticides
inside homes ($133), all of which have been shown to have a big impact on decreasing infant
mortality and maternal rates.

113. In terms of allocative efficiency, the same resource mapping study showed that providing
ARVs is highly efficient when compared to other HIV interventions (Figure 2). Available data in
2009-2012 show that more than 700,000 healthy live years which would have been lost due to
HIV were averted because of ARVs. This number represents 83% of DALYs averted for 68% of
allocated funding.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     17
114. Also, another allocative efficiency measure is that pool funding partners’ contributions
were allowed to be used to support institutional and operational support costs of the NAC as long
as these operational support costs do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total annual budget.
Institutional and operational supported costs here refer to all costs associated with the NAC
Board of Commissioners and Secretariat (salaries, building costs, materials, equipment, external
audits etc.). These costs have been as high as 40% to 60% in some of MAP supported projects in
other countries.

115. CHAI conducted a multi-country analysis of treatment costs for HIV/AIDS (MATCH) in
Malawi and 4 other countries in Africa (Ethiopia, Rwanda, South Africa and Zambia). The
objective of the study was to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness of
HIV treatment.

116. When compared to other countries, the average cost of treatment per patient per year was
relatively the lowest in Malawi: US$136 (Cost ranges from US$80 – US$241 pppy) compared to
US$233 in Rwanda, US$186 in Ethiopia, US$278 in Zambia and US$864 in South Africa (figure
3). As a matter of fact, Malawi has the lowest costs in terms of personnel, ARV and laboratory
costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Summary of ratings, by components
117. OPCS guidelines for overall outcome rating of a project with formally revised project
objectives recommend using a weighting system that takes into account the performance of the
project in achieving its development objectives before and after the restructuring as well as the
level of disbursement associated with each period. This system was applied to rate the project’s
outcome in the tables below.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

119. HIV/AIDS transmission in Malawi as elsewhere has a significant gender dimension,
associated with gender inequality and poverty. The Government of Malawi implemented
interventions aimed at transforming cultural attitudes which place men and women at high risk
for transmission, expanding life-skills education for school children and adolescents, increasing
alternative income earning opportunities for female headed households, and reducing stigma for
PLWHA. MAP supported these interventions and so contributed positively to resolution of social
issues identified above.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

120. Throughout project implementation, NAC has been a stable agency in terms of both
governance and management – a particularly notable achievement within the challenging context
of Malawi. Through the years, NAC has been clarifying its roles and responsibilities,
consolidating its internal systems, and recruiting the necessary staff to perform its functions.

121. Representatives of civil society and the public sector were empowered during the
implementation of this project to: (i) oversee the implementation of the project in their capacity
as members of the Board of Commissioners of NAC and as members of the national TWG and
its sub-groups; (ii) implement HIV/AIDS interventions funded through the grants facility; and
(iii) benefit from the range of activities supported by the national program.

122. With contribution from the project, the Malawi Partnership Forum for HIV/AIDS has
been established, in addition to sectoral coordinating structures such as the Department of
Human Resource Management and Development for the public sector; the Malawi Business
Coalition Against HIV/AIDS for the private sector; the Malawi Interfaith AIDS Association for

124.   N/A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

125.   Rating: High.

126. Financial sustainability of the national response continues to be the major risk. The
national HIV/AIDS response is heavily dependent on partner funding, with an estimated 3
percent of resources from Government and 97 percent from external sources.

127. Available resources are estimated at US$181 million in 2012/13 but are expected to
decline to US$172 million in 2020/21, as a result of anticipated decline in international partner
support to the HIV/AIDS program.

128. Under this scenario, there is a financing gap of US$44 million in 2012/13, growing to
US$419 million in 2020/21. The financing gap in 2012/13 is equivalent to 0.7% of GDP and
2.6% of total Government expenditure. By 2020/21, this will rise to 5.5% of GDP and 19.8% of
total Government expenditure.

129. In order to fill this gap a number of additional domestic sources of financing were
explored, including increases in public sector integration and private sector contributions,
introduction of airline, airtime, alcohol and tobacco levies, increases in general taxation and
efficiency savings.

130. Even if all these alternative sources were implemented, the financing gap would still
remain very large. By 2020/21, the financing gap would reach US$ 284 million. This would
translate to 3.7% of GDP or 13.4% of Government expenditure for that year.

131. There is no short or medium term prospect of Malawi having the ability to afford its ARV
program. A key conclusion is that the current strategy of large scale up of ARV treatment is
unsustainable and will depend on external financing unless a significant reduction in new HIV
infections can be achieved.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

132.   Rating: Satisfactory.



                                               21
133. The preparation process was highly participatory, with extensive consultations with
PLWHA, representatives of national and international NGOs, partners, and various other
stakeholders. Project preparation involved a process of extensive consultations, analytical
activities, stakeholder analyses, and consensus building among key actors across multiple
organizations and agencies from the health sector.

134. The Bank and pool funding mechanisms partners strategically directed its funding
towards prevention and advocacy activities leaving treatment, care and support to the GFATM.

135. Risk assessment was thorough and realistic, with appropriate mitigation measures
proposed and implemented. Key identified risks included NAC limited capacity to coordinate
and administer the project, the risk of being unable to match demand for services with adequate
supply, and possible fiduciary difficulties faced by decentralized institutions and agencies with
weak capacity. Mitigation included such measures as working to attract additional financiers
(DfID provided additional resources), and establishing systems for training, capacity building,
and accountability in the NAC and decentralized entities.

136. Operational manuals, clarification of key responsibilities, formation of coalitions, and
assessment of institutional capacity were done during project appraisal.

(b) Quality of Supervision

137.   Rating: Satisfactory

138. The task team enjoyed relative continuity (three TTLs over the life of the project), and its
assessments of project performance were straightforward and frank.

139. The project team provided adequate technical and fiduciary support to NAC during the
project implementation. This positive contribution from the Bank was recognized during the ICR
preparation by both NAC and pool funding mechanisms partners.

140. Throughout the project implementation phase, Bank staff provided appropriate capacity-
building support for procurement.

141. Fiduciary challenges were met in a timely way and financial management performance of
the project improved through time, supported by Bank oversight and the development and
implementation of a Financial Management Improvement Action Plan.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

142. Rating: Given the rating for the Bank performance in ensuring quality (satisfactory) and
the quality of supervision (satisfactory), the overall rating for the bank performance is
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

                                               22
143.   Rating: Satisfactory.

144. During the project appraisal, technical working papers assessing the progress of the
national response and recommending priority actions were presented to the multi-stakeholder
Joint Review (JR) meeting which was opened by the Minister for Presidential Affairs and closed
by the Vice President of the Republic. These prior actions demonstrated the Government’s
commitment to the HIV/AIDS crisis response in the country.

145. The political commitment was also acknowledged through the search for long-term
sustainability response which resulted in the development of a “Sustainable Financing Options
Paper? for further guidance on in-country resource mobilization for the response.

146. The Government committed itself to providing US$ 2 million per year to NAC for
implementation of the SMP. Equally important, the Government introduced a separate
authorization within each public sector agency’s recurrent budget (2% Other Recurrent
Transactions ministerial allocations) to be used to initiate and implement HIV/AIDS programs
within their respective sector sphere of activities.

147. The Government provided an enabling environment for the project and supported the
development of a sector-wide-approach to managing the flow of external assistance to the HIV
management and control in the country. It successfully met the commitments made in the context
of this approach, including increasing its share in the pool funding mechanisms over years.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

148.   Rating: Satisfactory

149. The NAC, as implementing agency of the project, was strengthened in its capacity and
ability to become a true coordinating body throughout the course of the project implementation.

150. Over an eight year period, the NAC, as the implementing agency, developed and refined
its operational approach and implementation arrangements through independent periodic
assessments and internal and external audits of financial management, procurement, grant
facility management and the performance of grant recipient organizations (GROs).

151. The NAC provided timely quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) according to
the format in the Operational Guidelines at the end of each quarter. The quarterly FMR
contained information on financial activity, and procurement actions, including explanations of
the variance of expenditure against budget (if any).

152. In addition, NAC provided biannual Program Monitoring Reports according to the format
in the Operational Guidelines at the end of each semester. The biannual Program Monitoring
Report contained information on program output achievements, financial and procurement
activities including explanations of the variance of expenditure against budget (if any) and the
linkage between programmatic performance and financial performance, as well as the result of
any audits that were undertaken in the preceding period.

                                              23
153. NAC provided key guidance to decentralized entities and implementing agencies,
dedicating a significant amount of time to training and capacity-building of implementers,
particularly in relation to M&E and fiduciary/accounting requirements.

154. There were some shortcomings during the project implementation period but satisfactory
mitigation measures were taken by NAC to allow the implementation of the project to continue
with less difficulty.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

155. Rating: Given the rating for the Government performance (satisfactory) and for the
implementing agency (satisfactory), the overall rating of the borrower performance is rated
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

156. A sector-wide approach to HIV/AIDS can help a country with a generalized epidemic
achieve positive results, efficiently. This is achieved through (i) reducing the administrative
burden on the coordinating body (NAC) through joint work programming, accounting, and
reporting systems, (ii) enabling the coordinating body to develop a strategic, integrated approach
to coordinating the national response, and (iii) building local ownership of the national program
as a whole.

157. Pooled funding mechanisms are an efficient tool to support HIV National Strategic
Plan. The tool should be flexible enough to allow contributors to earmark their contributions.
The project demonstrated that the system can be flexible enough to accommodate earmarking for
some types of activities and this mechanism was the most preferred one for the new Bank
supported HIV/Nutrition project where approximately half of the funds have been earmarked for
specific prevention activities.

158. Government ownership and setting up proper functional institutional arrangements is
critical to achieving results. Under this project high level commitment and funding contribution
into the pool funding mechanisms certainly allowed the project to achieve its positive results.

159. There are benefits of centralized procurement for common items and high value capital
goods in addressing capacity constraints of sub-grantees. The implementing agency for this
project used this approach and sub-grantees were satisfied with the solution because this allowed
them to concentrate most of their time on implementing activities rather than on procurement
processes.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

160. The following comments were provided by the pooled funding mechanism partners
through the NAC on the draft ICR. These comments were addressed in the final ICR after


                                               24
discussion with present stakeholders during a meeting held on March 7, 2013 in the NAC Board
Meeting room.

a) General Comments
? The report is well balanced as it highlights both achievements and weaknesses
? The report is quite comprehensive in scope and adequately covers the original and additional
   financing period performance
? The issues are clearly articulated and easy to comprehend
? There is need to clearly explain the assessment criteria (during the presentation/meeting) to
   partners for common understanding

b)   Specific Comments
?    The acronym section needs to be revisited to make some corrections (typos and descriptions)
?    There are some sub-sections that are blank and it is not clear whether this is intentional
?    The duration of the NSP is supposed to be 2011 to 2016 (aligned to the MGDS II). This
     needs to be corrected throughout the document
?    “Pooling Funds Mechanism? should be replaced by “Pool Funding Mechanism? throughout
     the document
?    There is need for another round of editing to clean up the document
?    There is need to maintain consistency in the reporting tense (areas indicated in the document)
?    The indicator on condom use needs to add a bit of context i.e. there is an increase in condom
     use when the 2010 DHS indicator is retrofitted into the 2004 DHS data.
(b) Cofinanciers

1.1   Behavioral Change Communication/Information, Education and Communication
(BCC/IEC)

1.     BCC/IEC materials are crucial to facilitate behavioral change in the general population
and even population groups with special needs. There has been an increase in the number of
materials distributed from year to year until 2009/10 fiscal year, when a decreasing trend in IEC
material distribution was noticed and this was confirmed by the report of the Independent
Review of the National Response to HIV and AIDS. Good progress was also made on production
of IEC materials for people with special needs though in the 2011/12 fiscal year, nothing was
achieved in this category. Over the years there has also been a notable shift in behaviour change
communication messaging from the traditional development and distribution of Information,
Education and Communication (IEC) materials to one-on-one communication and interactive
performance sessions. This, therefore, led to a significant decrease in the production of IEC
materials as shown on the figure 1 below.

2.     As a way of complementing the print media and additional effort to reach out to all
populations, various HIV and AIDS messages and information were also aired on TV and
various radio stations. Figure 2 below shows the trend in the number of hours for both TV and
radio broadcasting of HIV and AIDS messages across the years. In the recent years, focus has
also been on supporting community radio stations to participate in HIV and AIDS message
broadcasting so as to reach the rural communities in the country.

3.      As a result of behavioral change interventions, there has been some level of achievement
as far as positive change of behavior is concerned. For example at baseline of the program, the
proportion of sexually active women (15-49 years) having sex with more than one partner (non-
regular partner) in the last 12 months was at 8.3 percent and has since decreased to 0.7 percent in
2010 and that for men has also decreased from 26% to 9.2%, respectively.

4.       Condoms are a common method of preventing HIV transmission during sexual
intercourse which accounts for 88% of HIV transmission (Malawi HIV Prevention Strategy).
Generally, there has been an increase in the number of condoms distributed over the years as
illustrated in Figure 3 below. It also shows very low distribution of female condoms, though
there has been an improvement over the years.

5.     As a result of increased condom uptake there has been an increase in the proportion of
sexually active population using the condom during high risk sex as reported by the MDHS 2010.
Table 1 below shows that the magnitude of change is more in women, compared to men.

1.3                     Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission

6.      The PMTCT program is crucial as it significantly contributes to HIV prevention efforts
of the national response to HIV and AIDS. There has been a change in the PMTCT policies from
2003 to 2012 following the 2006 and 2010 WHO PMTCT recommendations. Following the
adoption of the 2010 WHO guidelines/recommendations, Malawi started implementing an
integrated ART/PMTCT program from 1st July, 2011, through the introduction of the Option B+.
Option B+ entails the immediate initiation on ART for life for all HIV positive pregnant women,
regardless of their CD4 count, in an effort to reduce transmission of HIV from mother to child
and also improve the health status of the HIV positive mothers. This has then, resulted in
increased numbers of HIV positive pregnant women starting on ART. Figure 4 below shows the
coverage of PMTCT from 2004. There has been an increasing trend in provision of PMTCT

                                                                 29
services. There was a significant increase in PMTCT uptake in 2007 and 2008 and this is the
same period when the number of sites providing a minimum PMTCT/ART package also
increased significantly as shown in figure 5 below.

8.      HTC is very crucial in HIV and AIDS management as it is the entry point for all other
services, including treatment care and support. Over the years, HTC uptake has increased as a
result of innovative approaches that were put in place including door to door testing, moonlight
testing and mobile site service provision, to complement the traditional HTC in static sites. From
2003 to September 2012 a total of 10,072,349 HIV tests were conducted. Figure 6 below shows
HTC uptake across the years.

9.     The number of HTC sites has increased seven times from 2003 to 2012. There were only
118 static HTC sites in 2003 and by September 2012 there were 810 static sites. Figure 7 below
shows the trend in establishment of HTC sites; the increase in the number of HTC sites also
explains the increase in HTC uptake. Apart from these static sites there were also other 322
outreach HTC sites by September 2012.

10.    In a bid to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child, all pregnant women are
required to undergo HTC. This will enhance timely action and necessary referral by health care
workers when a woman is found HIV positive. Figure 8 below shows the trend in HTC uptake by
pregnant women in antenatal clinics.

1.5                                              Handling and Disposal of Health Care Wastes

11.    Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) Policy was developed in 2003 to guide
handling and disposal of health care waste in light of an imminent increase in the production of

                                                                                                          32
infectious waste that the then practices and disposal system could not handle adequately. The
National Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) Policy was also translated into a 5 years
national plan of action (July 2003-June 2008). In the same year the HCWM Guidelines were
developed as part and parcel of the Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) Policy.

12.    In 2007, the HCWM training manuals for support staff and qualified Health Workers
were developed and translated into vernacular language. The National Health Care Waste
Management coordinating body was also formed in the same year and continues to meet at least
twice a year. In 2008, procurement and delivery of Health Care Waste Management equipment
and supplies for the first 6 piloted districts was conducted as illustrated in table 2 below:

Table 2: Quantities of HCWM equipment and supplies procured

13.     To enhance quick roll out of the policy, training of trainers (TOT) on HCWM was first
conducted to 6 pilot districts of Mzimba, Salima, Mchinji, Ntcheu, Mangochi and Chikwawa in
2008. In 2011 TOT on HCWM was conducted to additional 3 pilot districts (Nkhata Bay,
Rumphi and Karonga) and one central hospital (Mzuzu). A total of 100 trainers (5 trainers from
each of the 10 institutions, comprising: the DEHO, In-charge of Clinical Services, In-charge of
Nursing Services, Infection Prevention Coordinator and EHO or Assistant Environmental Health
Officer responsible for HCWM) were trained. Dissemination of the HCWM and Injection Safety
(IS) Policies were done only to piloted institutions.

14.     A study was conducted in Malawi with support from CDC with the aim of reviewing the
HIV testing and counselling program and to make recommendations on how to improve the
quality of services. The study conducted in mid-2012 revealed that there are issues with handling
and disposal of health care wastes. The study showed that there is improper disposal of wastes
such that sharps, test device and paper napkin are sometimes disposed together in one bin despite
the universal guidelines that advocate that various types of biomedical waste be segregated from
each other. The Government is therefore working on strengthening adherence to the stipulated
guidelines on HCWM.

Component 2: Treatment, Care and Support

2.1      Treatment of Opportunistic Infections

15.    The weakened immune system due to HIV infection increase chances of illnesses arising
due to opportunistic infections (OIs). Ensuring consistent availability of necessary OI
prophylactic and treatment drug is therefore critical in managing HIV and AIDS clients.


                                                 33
16.     Over the years the availability of OI drugs has been monitored. In 2006/7 fiscal year 64%
of health facilities were reported to have no OI drug stock outs. In 2010/11 fiscal year, 69% of
the health facilities had no stock-outs, which represented a slight improvement from the last
reported data.

17.    Currently the country is continuously making efforts to address issues of persistent stock-
outs of OI drugs, among other pharmaceutical and medical supplies, by strengthening the
procurement and supply chain management system. This is evident through the on-going reforms
and technical assistance at the Central Medical Stores.

18.    The situation of four special opportunistic infections has been monitored over the years
and these are Tuberculosis (TB), Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS), Oesophageal Candidiasis (OC), and
Cryptococcal Meningitis (CM). The graphs on figure 9 below show the trends in these OIs.
Generally, there has been a decreasing trend in the new cases identified and treated for OIs over
the years, except for Kaposi’s sarcoma, whose trend is almost constant.

2.2                      Provision of Antiretroviral Therapy

19.     In Malawi, the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) program was introduced in 2003. In 2005,
the second ARV and OI scale up plan (2006-2010) was finalized. The main goal of the plan was
to scale up to about 250,000 patients ever started on ART by the end of the year 2010. In 2011
the new integrated ART/PMTCT Policy was developed following the WHO 2010
recommendations for HIV treatment. The new policy entails early initiation on ART for HIV
positive individuals as the CD4 count for one to be initiated on ART was increased from
250cels/mm3 to 350cels/mm3. Furthermore, the policy introduced Option B+, which entails the
immediate initiation on ART for life for all HIV positive pregnant women, regardless of their
CD4 count, in an effort to reduce transmission of HIV from mother to child and improve the
general health status of the HIV positive mothers. This has therefore led to increased numbers of
people on ART.

20.    The program initially started in nine sites in 2003, covering less than 4,000 people. Since
then the program has expanded, such that by September 2012, the country had registered a
cumulative total of 535,502 ART beneficiaries who had ever started on ART. Out of these,
391,338 were alive and on ART as at September 2012. Figures 10 below show the trend in the
ART program coverage.

number of health facilities certified to provide ART. Figure 11 below shows this rapid increase
over time.

2.3                     Community Home-Based Care

22.    As the number of PLHIV increases, the gap continues to widen between the demand for,
and the availability of health care services. Relying mainly on the family and community as
caregivers, community home-based care (CHBC) has become a significant contributor in
ensuring the continuum of services that includes treatment, care and support of those infected
and affected by HIV and AIDS. In the 2004 – 2005 fiscal year, Malawi developed the ‘guidelines
on HBC’ to guide all HBC programs in the country. The number of patients supported in CHBC
programs has been increasing until when the ART program was scaled up.

23.    In 2007/8 fiscal year the Integrated CHBC Model and training package was finalised and
adapted for Malawi. The model was disseminated in the following year. Since the
commencement of the CHBC program, there have been trainings for health care workers and
volunteers to manage the program in a skilled manner. By the end of 2009/2010 fiscal year 3,834
volunteers and 1,103 health care workers were trained in HBC.

24.    In 2009/10 fiscal year the country developed the Palliative Care Guidelines, which were
disseminated in the same year. Trainings for health care workers in palliative care also started in
the same fiscal year. Figure 12 below shows the number of households with chronically ill
persons receiving various kinds of support. Generally, there is a decreasing trend in the
households benefiting due to the rolling out of the ART program that has tremendously reduced
the number of PLHIV who are bed-ridden. The CHBC program, however, has experienced a


                                                                  36
challenge of inconsistent reporting by various players in the program, hence the unexplained
sudden increase in the year 2009/2010.

2.4                 Nutrition for HIV and AIDS Patients

25.     The HIV and AIDS epidemic has had a devastating impact on health in general and
nutrition in particular, hence the need for a special focus on and use of resources for nutrition as
a fundamental part of the comprehensive package of care for PLHIV. This is crucial as the HIV
and AIDS epidemic has extensively affected populations where malnutrition is already endemic.
It is also scientifically proven that improved nutritional status enhances ART acceptability,
adherence and effectiveness. Therapeutic foods were provided to PLHIV during the period of the
project. Therapeutic Feeding Guidelines and Protocols were developed in 2005 and were
reviewed in the 2009/2010 fiscal year. By the end of the 2010/2011 fiscal year 95% of ART sites
were providing therapeutic food for HIV patients. Figure 13 below shows that there has been an
increase in the number of HIV and AIDS patients accessing therapeutic feeding. This is because
with the rapid scale up of the ART program, it was also equally important to scale up nutrition
and nutrition education programs.

Component 3: Impact Mitigation

26.     A number of interventions aimed at mitigating the negative economic and psychosocial
effects of HIV and AIDS, through improvement in quality of life of PLHIV, OVC and other
affected individuals and households were implemented during the period 2003 to 2012. The
interventions implemented ranged from economic empowerment, provision of material and other
forms of support, such as building capacity in spiritual and psychosocial support for the affected
households.

3.1                                        Support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children

27.     Cumulatively, a total of 282, 234 Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) have been
supported with education bursaries between 2003 and 2012 as can be seen from Figure 14 below.
The support provided has mostly been financial in form of tuition fees. It will be noted that the
numbers for those supported has significantly declined as more and more resources are now
being directed towards high impact prevention (e.g. PMTCT, Voluntary Medical Male
Circumcision) and treatment interventions while still maintaining a fraction of support for impact
mitigation interventions, in the wake of declining resources for HIV and AIDS. This
notwithstanding, there are other implementing partners that are providing educational support but
their input has not been comprehensively and systematically reported over the years.




                                                                              38

3.2     Income Generation Activities for Vulnerable Households

28.     Interventions aimed at economically empowering households and communities affected
by the epidemic were implemented during the period 2003 to 2012. These were aimed at
assisting households to reduce their exposure to economic risk and improving their ability to
cope once a loss has occurred and building the capacity of community-based safety nets and
support groups. This would in turn help households to avoid jeopardising their long-term
survival by being able to meet their short-term needs.

29.      There is documented evidence of noticeable impacts of the IGAs implemented as in some
communities, fruits of the businesses and initiatives that were established some years back are
still enjoyed to this date. These IGAs included tailoring; carpentry; tinsmith; bakeries; livestock
and poultry rearing; crop and vegetable production. Some of the benefits that have been derived
from the various initiatives include general skills acquisition and availability of some income to
purchase basic needs.

3.3     Provision of Community-based and Institutional Care for Orphans

3.3.1 Legislative and Policy Environment

30.    The period under review saw a number of legislative and policy documents being drafted
and adopted. In 2003, the Government of Malawi and stakeholders developed the National
Policy for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children. In 2005, the National Plan of Action (NPA)
for OVC w a s de ve l ope d i ni ti al l y for the period 2005-2009, a nd l a t er extended to 2011.
The NPA called for the rapid scale up of interventions supporting children affected by the
HIV epidemic. The overall goal of the NPA was to build and strengthen Government, family
and community capacity to scale up the national response for the survival, growth, protection
and development of children affected by AIDS. The Policy and the NPA therefore, provide a

                                                   39
solid framework for the national response to the OVC crisis experienced in Malawi. Another
major milestone on issues related to OVC was the enactment of the Child Care, Protection
and Justice Act in 2010. This Act provides a comprehensive framework that addresses the issue
of children affected by HIV. The Act has provisions to protect children from discrimination
and exclusion from essential services on the basis of their HIV status. The Act further provides
for the establishment of alternative care structures for children affected by AIDS.

3.3.2 Establishment of Child Care Institutions

31.     Orphanhood has in some instances led some children to be temporarily or permanently
deprived of their family environment and such a context necessitates that they be provided
with alternative care in an institution. However, placing of orphans and other vulnerable children
in institutions should be the last resort after failing to take care of them in the community.
Factors such as HIV, child abuse and neglect, endemic poverty, migration and family breakdown
have contributed to an increase in the number of children requiring alternative care. A 2010
survey found that there are 104 Child Care Institutions (CCIs) in Malawi and these are
orphanages, special needs centers and reformatory centers.

32.     It was found that out of these CCIs 63 were orphanages. A total of 6,040 children were
in these institutions and 66% of these children were in orphanages. Seventy one percent (71%)
of the children in institutions were orphans. Children including orphans in these CCIs
appreciated the fact that they were in institutions because their needs such as food, clothes and
school fees for those in secondary school were being met. It is evident therefore, that CCIs in
Malawi are contributing significantly towards responding to the HIV epidemic by addressing the
needs of OVC.

3.3.3 Establishment of Community Based Child Care Centers

33.    Over the years, the Ministry of Gender, Children and Community Development has
been promoting the establishment and management of Community Based Child Care Centers
(CBCCs) as one way of responding to the needs of OVC in Malawi. These CBCCs are owned
and run by communities themselves. In such centers children are exposed to learning, they also
play using outdoor as well as indoor playing materials. Above all, they are given food. In most
cases, members of the community contribute food, money and other resources in order to run
these centers. They also have communal gardens, which are a major source of food for the
CBCCs.

34.     The attendance by children of these centers ensures that orphans have access to food at
least once a day. There is further evidence that pre-primary schooling as it happens in CBCCs,
enhances school readiness, increases enrolment and retention in schools, reduces class repetition,
improves academic performance, increases primary completion rates and overall, it also
improves the health and nutrition status of children. A study commissioned in 2006/2007 by
UNICEF and conducted by the Centre for Social Research shows that there are 5,665 CBCCs in
Malawi with half of them located in the southern region.




                                               40
35.    A total of 410,000 children were enrolled in the CBCCs in 2006 to 07. UNICEF
estimates that in 2011 a total of 771,000 children aged 3-5 accessed CBCCs and a further
187,500 accessed children’s corners. The CBCC study also looked at the proportion of children
who attend CBCCs who are orphans or children with special needs. Overall 21.9% of the
children enrolled in the CBCCs in Malawi are orphans while a smaller proportion (3.5%) are
children with special needs.

3.4     The Social Cash Transfer Program

36.     The Social Cash Transfer Program (SCTP) was designed to alleviate poverty, reduce
malnutrition and improve school enrolment by delivering regular and reliable cash transfers to
very poor households that are also labor constrained. It was designed to reach Malawi’s 10%
poorest households. The program started as a pilot in Mchinji District and was then rolled out to
Salima, Likoma, Chitipa, Mangochi, Machinga and Phalombe. Ministry of Gender, Children and
Community Development is the line ministry responsible for implementing the SCTP, in
collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. The SCTP
activity implementation is decentralized and managed by respective Local Councils, where the
District Social Welfare O f f i c e i s k e y . The N a t i o n a l S o c i a l S u p p o r t P o l i c y ( NSSP)
provides p o l i c y guidelines for the SCTP. On average, each household in the program
receives MK2, 000 (US$12) per month, depending on the size of the household and
number of school aged children in the household. Figure 15 below shows the number of
households that have benefited from the SCTP for the years 2008, 2010 and 2011.

37.     An evaluation of the program has generally shown that recipients reported that prior to
the transfers their households were living in destitute, lacking food and basic necessities, facing
HIV related stigma and were often sick. With the transfers, things changed: the prevalence of
under-weight went down; food security improved; and school enrolment and retention increased
among other benefits.

3.5    External Support for Households with Orphans and Vulnerable Children

38.    The huge problem of OVC that the country is experiencing, coupled with limited
coverage of the Social Cash Transfer Program and the generally opting out of communities from
having their children in institutional homes, necessitates the need for providing households
keeping OVC with support. Figure 16 below provides a breakdown of support provided to OVC
over the years.

39.     As can be seen from the figure, relatively high numbers of OVC are being supported in
their households and this is anticipated to be the case for the foreseeable future.

Component 4: Sectoral Mainstreaming

40.    In a bid to ensuring sustainability of the HIV and AIDS interventions under
implementation, the Government of Malawi, through the National AIDS Commission, has been
promoting integration of HIV and AIDS issues into the day-to-day operations of all sectors. Both
the National AIDS Commission and its partners have undertaking various capacity building and
technical support initiatives on both internal and external mainstreaming, targeting most
organizations. The efforts Undertaken have greatly been helped by the creation of the Malawi
Business Coalition against AIDS (MBCA), an institution responsible for championing HIV and
AIDS mainstreaming among the private sector in Malawi. The Department of Human Resource
Management and Development (DHRMD) on the other hand, is responsible for coordination of
HIV and AIDS mainstreaming activities for the public sector, including the parastatals.




                                                     42
4.1   Support to Public Institutions, Private Companies, and Civil Society Organizations
to Mainstream HIV/AIDS in their Policies

41.     Over the years some remarkable progress has been registered in the area of support
provision for mainstreaming. The Government has, among others, created a fully-fledged
Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS in the Office of the President and Cabinet to look into
issues of policies regarding HIV and AIDS in the country. In line with the mandate of the office,
five staff from the Department have been deployed in key Government ministries to coordinate
HIV and AIDS activities. The Government has also deployed District AIDS Coordinators in all
32 Local Councils to support coordination of HIV and AIDS activities at that level. These have
greatly helped in moving the response at that level as they have been instrumental in
coordinating activities for community based organizations and other players. Government has
also created a separate office in the DHRMD responsible for HIV and AIDS, where among
others policies governing Government employees and HIV and AIDS have been looked into. The
office has again come up with a position on the allocation of funds for HIV and AIDS
interventions in the workplace that has culminated into allocating 2% of Other Recurrent
Transaction (ORT) budget for use on HIV and AIDS related activities. This has been undertaken
so as to ensure effective utilization of HIV and AIDS resources, as well as enhance monitoring
of HIV and AIDS interventions in the public sector. By the time of compiling this report, an
evaluation of implementation of the 2% ORT had been planned and it is anticipated that the
results would inform the best modalities for implementation of the same.

42.    The MBCA on the other hand has done well in terms of ensuring that HIV and AIDS
mainstreaming is done in the private sector. Figure 17 below reveals that cumulatively a total
of two hundred and forty nine organizations have been mobilized to have functional
workplace programs by the Malawi Business Coalition against HIV and AIDS.
Mainstreaming HIV in the workplace especially in the private sector is done well both internally
and externally as private businesses and companies are an integral part in the response to the
HIV and AIDS.

43.      In terms of programming, notable areas that have been introduced include internal programs
within the workplaces that consist of training and peer education to ensure that workers are
aware of HIV transmission and how this can be prevented. Another notable area is that of
condom programming where condoms have been made easily accessible to staff members within
the various organizations through condom dispensers and peer educators. There has also been the
incorporation of the ART program in the workplace where people are able to access ART within
clinics in their own organizations.

44.     The incorporation of HIV programs in the workplace have helped t o reduce stigma
and discrimination. Some companies go further than their own workplace and advocate for
increased engagement in HIV and AIDS work by other companies, sectors, communities and
consumer groups. Several businesses and companies are seen as an additional financing source
in an environment of limited resource availability. MBCA h a s a b l y represented the
private sector response to the epidemic and has proven to be a good example of how
mainstreaming should be done and coordinated in the private sector.

45.     All of the above notwithstanding, specific grants from the NAC Grants Facility have been
given to Government Ministries and Departments, Civil Society and Parastatals among others, to
ensure that issues of mainstreaming are taken care of. These grants have enabled the various
constituencies of the response to train and mobilize many on issues of mainstreaming HIV and
AIDS and managing the same in the workplace. Figure 18 below gives a picture where in 2005
to 2006 fiscal year there were only 44 workplace committees, rising to 576 functional workplace
committees by 2012.

4.2  Establishment of institutional HIV and AIDS Focal Points Persons and Support
Groups

46.     The number of HIV and AIDS focal points persons trained per year over the years has
been on the increase as can be seen from the Figure 19 below; This implies that the number of
competent people providing support to colleagues in the workplace has been on the increase,
thereby making it easier for people to get the necessary support on HIV and AIDS related issues.
The focal point persons are also assisted by competent peer educators, who have also been
trained in large numbers over the years, so to ensure that the various cadres of people in the work
place are supported, in areas of HIV and AIDS education, counseling and referrals.

47.     There has also been formation of support groups that have served as one of the ways to
reduce issues of stigma and discrimination. Through these support groups, PLHIV get a sense of
belonging, support and encouragement to seek help after seeing colleagues declaring their sero-
status. The setting up of Malawi Network of People Living with HIV (MANET+) and the
National Association of People Living with HIV in Malawi (NAPHAM) has greatly assisted in
mobilizing PLHIV and also helped them share experiences of living positively through the
interactions that the membership does provide.

4.3   Development and Implementation of Human Resource Management and
Development Strategies to Manage HIV/AIDS Induced Attrition

48.     As explained above, the allocated 2% of Government’s ORT budget has been utilized
towards supporting HIV and AIDS activities in the workplace. One of the notable areas where
this fund has been utilized is the provision of nutrition supplements for PLHIV. This has been
done in order to encourage healthy lifestyles for the HIV positive staff, while at the same time
ensuring that they do not lose their productivity.

49.     The coming in of the HIV and AIDS focal point persons in the offices has also helped to
have staff that are living with HIV to be able to balance work related issues and their own health
needs. Depending on one’s own condition, organizations have been able to come up with flexible
task options on staff that are on lifelong treatment, in order not to overstrain their physical
capabilities due to ailments. These scenarios have in the long run helped staff to remain
relatively healthy and continue providing services in the workplace in the presence of HIV.

Component 5: Capacity Building and Partnerships

50.    A number of initiatives aimed at building capacity of all implementing partners and
enhancing issues of partnerships have been undertaken during the period under review. This has

                                               45
mainly been done in order to ensure increased capacity and participation in planning, decision
making and action, amongst all players in the national response.

5.1    Building the Capacity of Multi-sectoral Implementing Partners

51.     The HIV and AIDS response has been decentralized to Local Council level in order to
adequately reach out to the communities. The decentralization of the response was further
enhanced by the creation of the position of District and City AIDS Coordinator within the
District and City Councils. The position was introduced into the Local Government set up
around 2004. The creation of the position necessitated a lot of capacity building initiatives
directed towards the Councils so as to fully equip the post holders and in the process enable the
Councils to realign them towards embracing HIV and AIDS issues in a broader development
perspective. This position is at the heart of HIV and AIDS coordination at the Council level as
they help in streamlining Local Council plans so that they accommodate HIV and AIDS
programs. They also help in coordinating with NGOs and other players at that level on
implementation of HIV and AIDS activities.

52.    Councils have also over the years benefitted from substantial amounts of support that
have been provided to them by means of information technology equipment, vehicles,
motorcycles and bicycles to help towards mobility for effective monitoring and supervision.
Several training programs directed towards identified key players on a wide ranging of HIV and
AIDS management issues.

53.    Over the years, training institutions like the Malawi Institute of Management and the
Staff Development Institute have been contracted to deliver specialized and tailor made trainings
to support implementation on the ground. Through this initiative a number of people have been
oriented and equipped with such knowledge as monitoring and evaluation; financial
management; mainstreaming and general project management among others.

54.     Financial support has also been provided to the Local Councils through District
Implementation Plans in order to facilitate the role of the Councils in managing the response at
that level. This support enables Councils to ably coordinate implementation of HIV and AIDS
activities for all players, including Civil Society, Faith Based and Community Based
Organizations.

55.    During the period under review, support has also been provided towards the training of
medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, laboratory technicians and other health cadres. Table 3
below provides the numbers for those supported.

56.     Another important initiative during the period under review has been the provision of
salary top-ups to 6,798 health workers. This was specifically implemented in order to provide an
incentive that would improve staff retention, thereby ensure continued service provision by
qualified health workers.

5.2     Support for Leadership and Governance of the National Response to HIV and AIDS

57.     With policy and oversight support provided by the Department of Nutrition, HIV and
AIDS in the Office of the President and Cabinet, NAC as the coordinator of the National
Response to HIV and AIDS has been able to engage higher levels of authority in Government,
civil society and private sector on issues of HIV and AIDS programming. Several high level
meetings for the Cabinet, Members of Parliament, Principal Secretaries, Chief Executives,
District Commissioners and Directors have been held over the years. For example, in 2006 alone
32 Principal Secretaries, 193 Members of Parliament, 14 Cabinet Ministers, 90 Chief executive
Officers and 40 District Commissioners were courted on HIV and AIDS issues. This special
groups of senior position holders were targeted so as to secure good will and leadership at the
highest decision making levels to support HIV and AIDS initiatives within various institutions.

5.3 Strengthening Coordination of HIV and AIDS Programs at District and
Community Level

58.    A number of activities directed towards strengthening of the response at district and
community level have been undertaken. These have mostly been directed towards the structures
available at that level. Presented in detail below are activities that have been carried out
focussing on each individual structure:

59.     District Executive Committee (DEC): The main development coordination structure at
the district level is the District Executive Committee (DEC). The DEC comprises the District
Commissioner (DC), Director of Planning and Development (DPD), heads of assembly
directorates, representatives from other government institutions, representatives of NGOs and
nominated members. These are key members of the Council management by virtue of their


                                                  47
positions. As such, specific trainings and support have been targeted at them in order to ensure
that they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills on HIV and AIDS programming.

60.     District AIDS Coordinating Committee (DACC): DACC is responsible for
coordinating the district response. DACC membership includes 10-15 from all sectors
represented in the district assembly and serves for a period not exceeding two consecutive
calendar years. Members of DACC include District HIV and AIDS Coordinator (DAC) as
Secretary, Director of Finance (DoF), Director of Planning and Development (DPD), Human
Resources Development and Management Officer or Director of Administration, HIV and AIDS
Focal Point Persons from all Government Ministries or Departments (Health, Agriculture, Social
Welfare, Youth, Education, Police, etc.) NGOs, CBOs, and FBOs. NGOs, CBOs and FBOs
constitute 50% of DACC membership. Much support has been given to the DACC towards
strengthening their supportive role and responsibilities outlined under Box 1 below:

   Box 1: Responsibilities for DACCs (Adopted from NAC, 2004 p.36, full version refer to Guidelines for District Assemblies Response

  2.    To ensure that all community stakeholders are familiar with the procedures and requirements for submitting work plan proposals for
        funding, and that the process is transparent and equitable.

6.1         Assessment of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic and National Response

6.1.1 Sentinel Surveillance Surveys

62.      HIV surveillance is conducted in selected antenatal clinics in Malawi on a regular basis.
Initially the surveillance was conducted once every year but from 2001 the surveillance is
conducted once every two years. The main objective of the survey is to provide data for
monitoring HIV and Syphilis trends in Malawi. The surveillance targets pregnant women that
come for their first ante-natal care visit. These are tested for Syphilis and residual blood from

                                                                              48
syphilis testing is dried on a filter paper and sent to the Community Health Sciences Unit
(CHSU) reference laboratory for HIV testing. The Sentinel Surveillance Survey Reports
therefore computes trends on HIV and Syphilis as illustrated on figures 20 and 21 respectively.
Figure 14 shows that HIV prevalence has generally been declining in the country from 16.5% in
1994 to 10.6 in 2010.

Figure 20: National HIV trends in pregnant women




63.    On prevalence of syphilis, the report shows that although there has been an observed
decline in the overall syphilis prevalence trend from 1996 to 2007, in 2010, prevalence of 1.2%
was observed which was similar to 2007. Figure 21 shows yearly trend of syphilis prevalence.

      indicators on HIV and AIDS using the data for the year of the survey. Table 4 below shows the
      projections. Such statistics are vital as they aid in planning of the national response to HIV and
      AIDS.

      6.1.2 Behavioral Surveillance Surveys

      65.    From 2004 the National AIDS Commission has coordinated implementation of the
      Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BBSS). This survey is a monitoring and
      evaluation tool designed to track trends in HIV and AIDS related knowledge, attitudes and

                                                             50
behaviors in subpopulations at particular risk of infection. The first round of the survey focused
on behaviors only while the subsequent surveys included biomarkers namely HIV and syphilis
testing. The second survey was conducted in 2006. The third round of the survey is expected to
be conducted in 2013. Table 5 below shows some of the trends that are computed in the BBSS.

6.1.3 Demographic and Health Surveys

66.     HIV sero-prevalence in Malawi is routinely estimated using sentinel surveillance among
pregnant women attending selected health facilities. This methodology has significant limitations
because men are excluded and because pregnant women are not representative of all women due
to biases in their distribution by age as well as fecundity. Moreover, the number of sampled
clinics is small and less rural than the national population distribution and they are not randomly
selected, creating further possible bias. Due to this challenge it was agreed that some biomedical
indicators for HIV be assessed through the DHS. From 2004 the National AIDS Commission
has managed to track population based HIV prevalence through this survey. This has been
possible through funding from development partners. The DHS, therefore, computes trends on
various key indicators on HIV and AIDS. Table 6 below shows trends in HIV prevalence among
adults (15-49 years) by their location:

67.    The DHS also measures trends in age at first sex as shown in figure 22 below. The
percentage of women age 15-19 who have had sex by age 15 has steadily decreased over the past
three MDHS surveys, from 17 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2010. By contrast, the percentage
of men age 15-19 who have had sex by the age of 15 appears to have declined between 2000 and
2004, and then increased between 2004 and 2010 from 18 percent to 26 percent. The percentage
of men and women age 18-19 who have had sex by age 18 has declined modestly over the time
period of the three surveys.

68.     The DHS also shows that 10.6 percent of adults age 15-49 in Malawi are infected with
HIV. Among women age 15-49, the HIV prevalence rate is 13 percent, while among men age
15-49 the HIV prevalence rate is 8 percent. HIV prevalence increases with age for both women
and men. For women, HIV prevalence is highest among women age 35-39 (24 percent), which is
six times the rate among women age 15-19 (4 percent). For men, the prevalence increases
sharply from 1 percent among men age 15-19 to 21 percent among those aged 40-44, and drops
thereafter. Figure 23 below illustrates the age pattern of HIV prevalence for women and men.

6.2    Program Activity and Financial Monitoring

6.2.1 Program Activity Monitoring

69.     Monitoring and evaluation results are critical to bring about policy and programmatic
improvements. The national response to HIV and AIDS continued to be guided by ‘One M&E
System’ which is one of the tenets of the ‘Three Ones’ principle, advocated by UNAIDS for
effective coordination.

70.      In 2003 the first M&E plan was developed and covered the period 2003 to 2005. Being
the first one, this M&E plan had set the pace towards ensuring that all stakeholders and partners
are coordinated, as far as monitoring and evaluation is concerned. The next M&E framework
was for the period 2006 to 2010 and was developed to monitor strides made in achieving the
objectives of the National Action Framework (2005 – 2009). The third M&E plan was developed
for the period 2011 to 2016 and is fully aligned to the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan
(NSP) covering the period 2011 to 2016.

71.    Despite some challenges to do with alignment of all partners’ M&E systems to the
national one as stipulated in the three successive M&E plans, measuring progress in the national
response to HIV and AIDS has been meaningful with the guidance provided by these M&E
Plans.

72.     From the onset of the project the NAC AIDS Reporting system (NACARS) was
introduced to support monitoring of progress on key activities and was later changed to the Local
Authority HIV and AIDS Reporting System (LAHARS) after the decentralization of reporting
roles to Local Councils.

6.2.2 Financial Monitoring

73.     NAC has set up the common funding mechanism for the national response to HIV and
AIDS through the HIV Pool, which is also supported by the World Bank, among other Partner
Partners. Financial support to the national response to HIV and AIDS is by the Government of
Malawi (GoM), Multi-lateral and Bi-lateral Funding and Development Partners. The HIV Pool
is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). NAC has set up the Grants Facility,
which is the vehicle for channeling resources to implementing agencies. It was originally
managed by the Financial Management Agency (FMA) through a contract. In September 2007,
NAC established a new Grants Management Unit (GMU) to take over the management of the
Grants Facility from the FMA. Operation of the Grants Facility is governed by the NAC Grants
Facility Manuals.

74.     NAC has implemented the MAP through Grant Recipient Organizations with activity
implementation throughout the country. The program had a dedicated Grants Management Unit
that was used to monitor implementation of activities as well as ensure financial compliance.
Throughout the period of the program, the program has enforced quarterly reporting on the part
of the GROs for its financial monitoring purposes.

                                               55
75.     Over the period, financial capacity of GROs has been strengthened through trainings,
grant management clinics and supervisory visits. This has resulted in improved financial
management being realized over time from the GROs. Further, it has been a requirement that
GROs be audited annually. Management letter issues and recommendations made by the audits
have helped further improve financial systems and assisted in financial monitoring. There have
been improvements in the extent of management issues raised over the period, signifying
effectiveness of financial monitoring.

76.     As an overall coordinator, NAC has installed and maintained a computerized accounting
system which has continuously been used to produce reports and enhance financial monitoring
during the entire period of the MAP.

6.3    Specialized Studies

6.3.1 PLACE Study

77.    The Priorities in Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) method is a rapid assessment
method for identifying areas likely to have sexual partnership formation patterns capable of
spreading and maintaining HIV infection. The method requires gathering available demographic
and epidemiological data and conducting meetings with local stakeholders (community
members, HIV experts, and HIV/STD service providers) to describe areas likely to have high
HIV incidence and through key informant interviews, identifying sites within those HTAs where
men and women meet new sexual partners such as bars, market places, work sites, and schools.
Individual interviews are conducted with those that frequent these sites to assess their sexual
behaviors. The method provides indications of the extent to which HIV/AIDS prevention
programs and condoms are reaching these sites and provides data for future intervention
programs at these sites. The first study was conducted in 2004 in Mulanje district with
subsequent ones conducted in Nsanje (2005), Blantyre and Lilongwe (2007).

6.3.2 Drug Resistance Monitoring

78.      Laboratory monitoring of patients receiving antiretroviral drugs is limited because of
insufficient resources. Malawi ART program has largely monitored such patients using clinical
criteria and CD4 cell counts according to WHO recommendations. Some studies however, have
not found these determinants to be perfect predictors of viral logical failure. Consequently, the
Ministry of Health in Malawi periodically samples patients initiating treatment and follows them
up to monitor viral suppression and development of resistance at 12 months, following WHO
guidelines.

6.3.3 Know Your Epidemic and Response

79.     The Know Your Epidemic and Response exercise consolidates, assesses, analyses, and
synthesizes all epidemiological data including utilization of the Modes of Transmission model to
determine the major drivers of the epidemic in the country. It focuses on coverage, equity,
intensity, and quality of interventions, cost effectiveness of interventions and impact of the
national response. The first round of the ‘know your epidemic’ exercise was conducted in
                                               56
Malawi in 2008. The exercise helped the country to consolidate evidence on “modes of
transmission? that informed development of an evidence-based National Prevention Strategy
which focused on prevention efforts that effectively reduce new infections by addressing the key
drivers of the epidemic and vulnerability factors. It also helped to consolidate evidence on the
impact of the national response to justify Malawi’s efforts to mobilize additional resources to
finance the national response to HIV and AIDS. It assisted in consolidating evidence that
informed prioritized allocation of available resources for maximum impact in terms of reducing
infections, morbidity and mortality.

6.3.4 Assessment of the Impact of HIV Mainstreaming Interventions

80.     In 2009 the National AIDS Commission (NAC) commissioned a study to assess the
impact of HIV and AIDS mainstreaming interventions in Malawi. The main objectives of the
study were to generate strategic information that would be used to understand the extent to which
implementers had mainstreamed HIV and AIDS into their programs and organizations; and
assess the outcome and impact of implementing mainstreaming interventions in Malawi. The
findings generated information that provided an understanding of the extent to which
implementers had mainstreamed HIV and AIDS into their programs and also nurture the mid-
term review of the National Action Framework (mainstreaming component) and enlighten the
design and implementation of mainstreaming activities in the country. The study found out that
organizations were implementing very relevant HIV and AIDS interventions in line with the
national response as guided by the National HIV and AIDS Action Framework (NAF, 2004).
Most of the interventions were related to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. All the
organizations had agreed criteria to enable staff, their spouses and beneficiaries of their services
to access HIV and AIDS services.

81.    It was clear from the study findings that mainstreaming had just started in the country and
few organizations fully understood the concept of mainstreaming as a process of responding to
HIV and AIDS within the core functions, policies, programs and projects of the public, private
and civil society. Organizations were still struggling to clearly identify the entry points or themes
for mainstreaming HIV and AIDS that would ensure buy-in from all the members of staff.

82.     The study also concluded that HIV and AIDS mainstreaming was an essential approach
for expanding, scaling up and implementing multi-sectoral responses to HIV and AIDS in the
country. The study observed that mainstreaming was crucial for addressing vulnerabilities to
HIV infections and was a good starting point to engage sectors that ought to but had as yet not
participated in the overall national HIV and AIDS responses. Mainstreaming would help build
strong alignment to the NAF and a stronger monitoring and evaluation system coordinated by
NAC.

6.3.5 Situation Analysis of Non-biomedical Interventions

83.    After realizing that over the past 25 years a considerable amount of resources had been
spent on both biomedical and non-biomedical HIV and AIDs interventions, in 2010 the National
AIDS Commission, commissioned a study to assess coverage, intensity and quality of key non-



                                                 57
biomedical HIV and AIDS interventions that were being implemented as a response to HIV and
AIDS in Malawi.

84.     This study revealed Monitoring and Evaluation gaps that exist in the national response to
the HIV and AIDS epidemic. It indicated that the system is not proactive as it relies on the
stakeholders reporting to NAC but the reporting is not consistent and timely. The annual M&E
reports are based on such data. Previously, very low numbers of people reached with NBIs had
been reported; this study reported much higher numbers. It therefore called for periodic surveys
in future as it will show trends in coverage of NBIs in Malawi. This survey also revealed that
most stakeholders do not assess the impact of their interventions as they are just interested in
reporting the number of people reached with NBIs. Currently, the Impact Mitigation TWG
putting in place mechanisms that will effectively collect data on a quarterly basis that can be
used to monitor trends in coverage of NBIs.

Component 7: National Leadership and Coordination

7.1       The Office of the President and Cabinet-Department of Nutrition, HIV & AIDS

85.     The President is responsible for the Ministry of HIV and AIDS, and provides overall
leadership on matters of HIV and AIDS for Malawi. The Department of Nutrition, HIV and
AIDS (DNHA) in the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) is the lead Government agency
in the national response to Nutrition and HIV and AIDS, responsible for policy, oversight and
high level advocacy. DNHA is thus central for policy issues and overall guidance for all levels of
the national response.

7.2       The National AIDS Commission

86.     The National AIDS Commission (NAC) was established by the Malawi Government
under a trust deed to provide leadership and coordination for the national response to HIV and
AIDS in Malawi. It is governed by a Board of Commissioners led by the Chairman who is
appointed by the President. The other members are selected from all constituencies namely:
private, public, faith, civil society, youth and PLHIV. Major roles include reviewing and
approving NAC policies and procedures, annual work program and hiring of secretariat
executive staff. NAC has specific roles which include the following;

         Guiding the development and implementation of the NSP.
         Facilitate policy and strategic planning in sectors, including local government.
         Advocating and conducting social mobilization in all sectors at all levels.
         Mobilizing, allocating and tracking resources.
         Building partnerships among all stakeholders in country, regionally and internationally.
         Knowledge management through documentation, dissemination and promotion of best
          practices.
         Mapping interventions to indicate coverage and scope.
         Facilitating and supporting capacity building.
         Overall monitoring and evaluating of the national response.
         Facilitating HIV and AIDS research.

                                                 58
7.3    Sectoral Response Coordination
7.3.1 Department of Public Services Management

87.     The Department of Public Services Management (DPSM) is a department within the OPC
which coordinates the HIV and AIDS response, particularly workplace programs, in the public
sector. These include all government ministries, departments, training institutions and parastatal
organizations. There is also a public sector steering committee comprising of principal
secretaries and chief executives which provides policy leadership and guidance on the public
sector response. Workplace programs in Local Councils rely on DPSM on policy and central
level guidance on all aspects of planning and implementation to ensure effectiveness.

7.3.2 Malawi Business Coalition against AIDS (MBCA)

88.    MBCA coordinates the response for private companies and business institutions. Its
major roles are mobilization of companies, development of workplace programmes, reporting
and evaluation of the private sector response.

7.3.3 Malawi Network of People Living with HIV (MANET+)

89.    MANET+ coordinates all organizations for people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV).
These organizations serve and advocate for issues affecting PLHIV in order to improve their
welfare.

7.3.4 Malawi Network of AIDS Service Organizations (MANASO)

90.   MANASO coordinates local and international NGOs implementing various HIV and
AIDS activities.

7.3.5 The Malawi Interfaith AIDS Association (MIAA)

91.    MIAA coordinates all faith based organizations implementing HIV and AIDS
interventions.

7.3.6 National Youth Council of Malawi (NYCOM)

92.     NYCOM coordinates all youth organizations implementing HIV and AIDS interventions.
All these sectoral coordinating institutions are expected to collaborate with Local Councils when
coordinating the national response in the districts.

7.4      Support in Policy Development and Monitoring

93.      NAC has facilitated development of the following strategic documents among others:

     HIV & AIDS Policy, 2003, (2003 – 2008)
     National Strategic Framework, 2000, (2000-2004)

                                               59
     National Action Framework, 2005, (2005-2009; Extended to 2012)
     National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan, 2011, (2011-2016)
     Universal Access for HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, 2006, (2006 – 2010)
     HIV Prevention Strategy and Operational Plan, 2009, (2009-2013)
     Condom Programming Strategy, 2005
     Mutual Faithfulness Strategy, 2008
     Abstinence Strategy, 2008
     National HIV and AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, 2006, (2006-2010)
     Policy on Equity in Access to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) in Malawi, 2005
     National HIV and AIDS Impact Mitigation Conceptual Framework, 2006
     Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Policy, 2012
     Conceptual Framework for HIV and AIDS Mainstreaming and Guidelines, 2006
     Communications Strategy for NAC and HIV and AIDS Communication Guidelines, 2007
     Integrated Annual Work Plans

94.    In addition to the above, NAC has played a key role by providing input into the
development of the following strategic documents:

     MGDS I and II, 2006 & 2011, (2006-2011; 2011-2016): Overarching National Socio-
      economic Development Framework (HIV&AIDS under Pillar No. 6)
     National Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children (OVC)Policy,2005
     National OVC Plan of Action, 2004

95.     The documents produced have played a crucial role in ensuring that all players adhere to
certain standards and practices in implementation of activities. The documents have also made
implementation easy as they have provided the necessary direction needed for an effective
response.

7.5      Resource Mobilization

96.    The national response to HIV and AIDS in Malawi started to register notable program
scale up around 2004, when the Government of Malawi and Development Partners including
World Bank provided significant amounts of financial resources for priority intervention areas.
The period 2004-2012 saw the National Response accumulating funds to US$438,783,853.48.
The year 2012 saw the Rolling Continuation Channel and Round seven grants of the GFATM
consolidated into a Single Stream Funding (SSF). The period under review also saw the
successful implementation through to the expiry of a Memorandum of Understanding governing
the National Response. The expiry of the MoU has led to Government and Partners developing a
new framework that will continue to govern the funding arrangements through NAC in the
subsequent years.

97.    Table 7 below summarizes financial inflows received from partners, development
partners and the Government of Malawi:

7.6    Implementation of National Coordination Mechanisms

7.6.1 Malawi Partnership Forum

98.     The Malawi Partnership Forum (MPF) is an advisory body to the NAC Board of
Commissioners, comprising of high profile decision makers drawn from the following
constituencies: public sector, private sector, PLHIV, CSOs, academia, research, national
assembly and development partners. The MPF plays a very critical role in planning and
reviewing the national response to HIV and AIDS in Malawi. All the coordinating
structures outlined below are represented on the MPF. NAC provides management
support to the MPF.

7.6.2 Technical Working Groups

99.     Technical Working Groups (TWGs) are HIV and AIDS thematic groups
established by NAC to provide technical guidance and make recommendations on
various technical issues in the national response. They report to the MPF.

7.6.3 HIV and AIDS Development Group

100. The HIV and AIDS Development Group (HADG) is a grouping of HIV and AIDS
development partners. The objectives of the HADG are to harmonize and coordinate
development partner’s support to the NAF and to align development partners’ support to
the integrated annual work plan.

7.6.4 Principal Secretaries Steering Committee on Nutrition, HIV and AIDS

101. This is a committee comprised of selected Principal Secretaries in Government.
This was deliberately done by government so as to ensure that as technical heads, the
Principal Secretaries are in the forefront championing HIV and AIDS issues across
Government Ministries and Departments. The group meets bi-annually to discuss
program implementation as related to HIV and AIDS activities in their specific Ministries
and Departments.

7.6.5 International Non-Governmental Organizations Forum

102. This is a grouping for all international NGOs and was created so as to ensure that
as groups that are implementing various activities they should be able to mobilize
resources for HIV and AIDS interventions as well. It was also put in place so as to ensure
that activities that are undertaken are able to be reported on. The grouping meets on a
quarterly basis.

7.6.6 Local Non-Governmental Organizations Forum

103. This is a grouping of all indigenous NGOs and was put in place so as to ensure
that they are able to contribute towards the fight against HIV and AIDS in a well-

coordinated way. The group was also constituted so as to help in articulating issues on the
ground to relevant authorities. Lastly, the group was also formed so as to help on issues
of reporting on all HIV and AIDS related activities.

7.7    Strategic Planning and Annual Reviews

104. The national response to HIV and AIDS in Malawi has been guided by short,
medium and long term plans. The National strategic Framework for HIV and AIDS
(NSF) 2000 to 2004 was the first of such initiatives to guide the implementation of HIV
and AIDS programs. At its expiry in 2004, it was followed by the National HIV and
AIDS Action Framework that initially covered the period 2005 to 2009 and extended to
2012. Currently, there is the Malawi National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (NSP 2011 –
2016), covering the period 2011 to 2016. The NSP seeks to provide continued guidance
to the national response to HIV and AIDS, building on work done in the past decade. It is
informed by the findings of the Community and Stakeholder consultations on the
National HIV and AIDS Policy Review (March 2010), the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy II (2012 – 2016) and the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP)
2011 – 2016; as well as developments in medical and scientific knowledge.

105. In addition to these mid-term strategic plans, the government through NAC has
been producing specific thematic strategic documents in form of policies and guidelines
to help in giving direction to implementation of all HIV and AIDS activities. These
policies and guidelines include; Conceptual Framework for Mainstreaming HIV & AIDS
Response into Development Policies, HIV/AIDS and Research Strategy for Malawi
2005-2007, Universal Access for HIV prevention, treatment, care and support (2006 –
2010), HIV Prevention Strategy and Operational Plan, Condom Strategy, Mutual
Faithfulness Strategy, Abstinence Strategy, National HIV and AIDS Monitoring and
Evaluation Plans, Policy on Equity in Access to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) in Malawi,
National HIV and AIDS Impact Mitigation Conceptual Framework, Conceptual
Framework for HIV and AIDS Mainstreaming and Guidelines, Communications Strategy
for NAC and HIV and AIDS Communication Guidelines and Integrated Annual Work
Plans.

106. On the other hand, on an annual basis NAC does hold Joint Stakeholder Reviews.
These reviews are provided for in the Memorandum of Understanding between the
Funding Partners of the National Response to HIV and AIDS and the Government of
Malawi. These include the semi-annual and annual reviews. The objective of the semi-
annual review is to give the National AIDS Commission, local stakeholders and its
funding partners an opportunity to review implementation progress of the Integrated
Annual Work Plan (IAWP), over the first six months of every financial year. It also
provides an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of management, coordination and
monitoring systems. The main output of these reviews is an Aide Memoire that outlines
key issues and strategic actions to be undertaken in order to address the identified
challenges.




                                            64
107. In all of this, the Integrated Annual Work Plan (IAWP) continues to be the
operational tool for the National Strategic Plan that forms the basis for resource
allocation and tracking.

7.8    Development and Operation of Information Tools

108. The National Response to HIV and AIDS makes total and complete use of the
information products of the M&E System as established by the National M&E Plan. To
this effect, a number of achievements have been made in the national response with the
production of a wide range of information products based on both routine and non-
routine data sources. These information products have included M&E reports, research
and study reports, information briefs and newsletters.

109. The information products are then disseminated to all players in the response to
guide policy formulation and program planning and improvement. The reports
disseminated contain right information needs of stakeholders in keeping with the ever
changing nature of the epidemic and operating environment that is characterized by
innovations in the various interventions.

110. These products have been shared through a number of ways including the
following: national bi-annual and annual review conferences, research and best practices
dissemination conferences, stakeholder program planning and review meetings, regional
and zonal dissemination meetings, and websites, hard and electronic circulated mails.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The methodologies used in the two main studies used in the section on efficiency
in the main ICR section are described below.

   I.      Burden of Disease Estimates for 2011 and the potential effects of the
           Essential Health Package on Malawi’s health burden

Introduction

2.     An evaluation of the essential health package (EHP) using WHO Burden of
Disease (BOD) methods suggests significant health gains were made by the first EHP
associated with the first SWAp. An economic appraisal of the second EHP associated
with the Health Sector Strategic Program (HSSP) is a useful tool to help make priorities
and choose best buy interventions. This appraisal can use various approaches. One
approach is to build on previous work based on Malawi’s Burden of Disease as measured
by Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Various assumptions and adjustments are
required because of the shortage of vital statistical data. This paper describes the
methods used in updating the BOD estimates and how they have been applied to the
proposed HSSP.

Methods

2011 Burden of Disease

3.     The estimates of the BOD are the foundation of later analysis. The 2002 WHO
estimates for Malawi were assessed in 2004 and found to be robust. These estimates
were updated in 2008 and used in the evaluation of the EHP. WHO is in the process of
updating their estimates, using funding from the Gates Foundation, but these are not yet
available. The 2002 estimates have been used to update the Malawi estimates for this
study. The following approach was used:

(i) Age specific mortality rates were calculated from the 2008 census providing best
     estimates of current infant, child and adult mortality (including females of
     reproductive age) using National Statistics Office (NSO) published life tables created
     using INDEPTH methodology. Actual deaths for 2011 were estimated using the
     specific death rates and 2011 population figures.
(ii) NSO population projections published in November 2010 were used.
(iii)Incidence rates of the 159 conditions that make up the BOD model have been
     assumed to remain as in 2008 except for:
         a. HIV/AIDS where incidences of HIV and AIDS have been taken from the
             2010 SPECTRUM projections used by the MOH HIV Unit.
         b. Hypertension and diabetes disability levels increased to reflect results of
             STEP study for disability but not mortality (because the natural history of
             these conditions is unknown in Malawi).




                                            66
(iv) Important diseases causing a heavy burden such as malaria have been assessed using
     recent survey data and found to remain similar to those used in 2008.

Potential Burden averted by the EHP

4.      The EHP2 updated model containing the new interventions such as mental health
has been used to calculate the incidence and burden (in DALYS) of preventable or
treatable conditions chosen in the EHP.

Assumptions used to predict the resource based and the ideal budgets

5.     The ideal scenario budget uses the following assumptions:-
       a. Indirect costs are based on expert MOH groups looking at
               i. HR – not staff establishments which are being revised, but current staff
                  levels, attrition rates and recruitment rates based on planned pre-
                  service outputs
              ii. Infrastructure – based on a survey of health facilities – their location
                  for GIS analysis, their level of amenities such as water and electricity
                  and their functional equipment
             iii. Transport based on planning assumptions about ambulance
                  requirements – 1:50,000 etc.
       b. Direct costs are derived from the cost-model assuming all targets are met.
          Access is 100%.
       c. The overall apportionment of EHP to non-EHP costs assumes
               i. Same split as between central hospitals and other cost centers with HQ
                  costs split 25% non-EHP and 75% EHP between 2002/3 and 2009/10
                  which were 84% EHP and 16% non-EHP.
              ii. The apportionment does not change over the 5 years. This is because
                  while pressure to offer tertiary services such as the cancer center arises
                  from medical advances and the profession, pressure is equally coming
                  from the HSSP and the need to hit EHP targets.
             iii. This effects only direct costs as indirect costs are apportioned between
                  EHP and non-EHP services on the basis of location of cost centers:
                      1. All central and 25% of HQ HR goes to non-EHP
                      2. All CHAM and district HR goes to EHP
                      3. All central and 25% of HQ other indirect costs goes to non-
                          EHP

Assumptions used in the cost model for this exercise

6.     The MOH cost model used for the first EHP has been adapted by the Ministry of
Health (MOH) for EHP2. The costs have been revised. Staff numbers have been revised
to accommodate recent revisions of the staff establishment. A number of assumptions
have been used to derive the activity estimated from the model under different funding
scenarios. They are:-




                                            67
(i) The model has been calibrated using 2009/10 activity based on HMIS data and
     2010/11 estimated costs. The model over-predicts costs by 27%. This is due to
     drug and staff costs being less than predicted by the model because of staff
     absences and drug stock-outs. The effect is that activity over-predicts beneficial
     effect by some 20%. The model has been re-calibrated to take this into account.
     It is assumed that as staffing levels improve (as the Emergency HR plan increases
     pre-service outputs) and drug procurement and supply becomes more reliable, the
     resource based scenario will improve effectiveness to 90% of attendances and the
     ideal scenario to 100%.
(ii) The core scenario used is based on the MOH resource based estimate of budgets
     in 2011/12 and 2015/6. It is assumed that 75% of HQ activity is to do with the
     EHP and the remaining 25% other non-EHP activity, and that central hospital
     indirect costs including staff costs are non-EHP but that all district services are
     EHP. It also assumes that the overall proportion spent on tertiary services of
     government budget stays as it was on average and stable between 2002 and 2009
     at 16%. This clearly is an imprecise way of allocating the costs between EHP and
     non-EHP. For instance 70% of central hospital services are primary or secondary
     level care and staff time has been allocated only to non-EHP services. On the
     other hand all CHAM and MOH District level and below HR costs have been
     allocated to the EHP although a proportion of their work is non-EHP (perhaps
     10% in MOH and 20% in CHAM institutions).
(iii)The second scenario is based on an ideal estimate – all the funds required to
     implement the HSSP fully. This is based on an assessment by MOH expert
     groups looking at the indirect costs of HR, infrastructure, transport and equipment.
     For instance for HR they took the current staffing levels, adjusted for attrition and
     new recruits coming out of pre-service institutions to estimate the level of staff
     available in year 5 of the plan. The infrastructure costs are based on the building
     needs required to offer BEMOC access (8km) to over 95% of the population.
     Direct costs are derived from the cost model which calculates the number of
     patients required to receive the EHP intervention at the target level and their
     associated costs.
(iv) By 2016 the effectiveness of patient care is assumed to have increased from 80%
     to 90% for the resourced based EHP scenario as facilities are better staffed and
     stock outs are less. The ideal scenario is assumed will achieve 100% staffing and
     no stock outs.
(v) Access improves in both scenarios. For the resource based scenario from an
     access level of 65% access in 2011/2 the plan is to build new or upgrade
     dispensaries by 58 – 28% of the ideal level (206) required to provide 8km access
     to over 95% of the population – the BEMOC target. It should be noted that this
     95% target has not been checked using GIS but will be in the next 6 months. The
     28% increase planned for the resource based scenario improves access to 75%.
(vi) Total activity and associated burden averted for the 5 years is calculated from
     averaging the first and 5th years of the plans and multiplying the results by 5. The
     size of the burden of disease alleviated has been evaluated by assuming one
     DALY alleviated is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product of Malawi (based
     on IMF projections).



                                         68
Prevention interventions

7.     Various assumptions were used to estimate the burden of disease that has already
been prevented by prevention interventions such as immunizations as to stop these would
have the effect of increasing these diseases in future. To gauge what would happen if
immunizations were reduced; the Sub-Saharan incidence rates of vaccine preventable
diseases have been used to calculate the effect of a suboptimal immunization program,
adjusted by the estimated levels of disease pre-immunization era.

Clinical treatments

8.     For those interventions involving clinical treatment 2009/10 HMIS data have been
used, being the most recent year of currently available data. Treatments have been
adjusted in two ways; by a factor for treatment effectiveness (as an example, antibiotics
work in 84% of times for pneumonia in children); and by a factor measuring the affected
population (as an example, 50% of adults and 70% of children registered in HMIS as
malaria are not, so only half or less of the number treated will benefit from antimalarial
drugs). Treatment effectiveness factors are taken from recent authoritative sources and
referenced in the table.

Summation of benefits of the EHP

9.     The burden of disease calculated in DALYS for each intervention for 2011 (and
succeeding years) can be summed to provide an overall estimate of burden averted by the
program. As the costs are also contained in the EHP model it will be possible to measure
the cost effectiveness of each and all interventions combined at the levels of activity
agreed once funding is known.

     II.     Multi-Country Analysis of Treatment Costs for HIV/AIDS (MATCH):
                                         MALAWI

                            Ministry of Health – October 2012

1. Methodology

1.      For the purpose of this study, treatment is defined as the full range of HIV-related
medical services provided to the patient at the facility level. This definition excludes non-
medical interventions such as income-generating activities and orphans and vulnerable
children (OVC) interventions, but includes treatment-related interventions such as
nutritional support and adherence programs. It includes treatment-related costs incurred
outside of the primary facility that are a core part of delivering outpatient services at the
ART clinic, e.g. any lab costs incurred at a tertiary facility. It does not include the cost of
HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC). In-patient days are not included. For all costs
included, the primary recipient of the service was the HIV-positive individual (as
opposed to the patient’s family or the general community).

2.      The study design strikes a compromise between a detailed time-and-motion study
of provider behavior and patient cohort histories in a few facilities, and a less
comprehensive study of hundreds of ART facilities. The former would be ideal for
revealing the quality of care and the intensity of provider effort, but would lack external
validity beyond the facilities covered and have too little statistical power to support any
of the most obvious of findings. The latter would reveal the broad range of cost variation
across many regional and local settings, but would be unable to cast much light on the
detailed breakdown of costs in each individual facility or on the possible contribution of
policy instruments to reducing the cost of ART.

1.1 Site Selection

3.      The 30 facilities were selected by means of a stratified random sampling method.
Facilities were stratified by three criteria: (i) by region, (ii) by facility type, and (iii) by
administration. Upon application of the stratification criteria, sites were chosen randomly
from the available strata to ensure an unbiased and representative sample.

4.       Given the relatively small sample size, stratified random sampling ensured
adequate representation of facility characteristics (e.g. facility types). Several pilot
facilities were selected and visited in late 2010; however, these were not included in the
final analysis since the methodology changed after the pilot sites were costed. Below is
further detail of the site selection methodology. A comprehensive description of the
methodology used can be found in Annex 2.

5.      Inclusion/Exclusion: Site selection was based on a facility list provided by the
MoH; this list included all static sites providing ART in Malawi as of December 2010.
Sites that had been providing ART for less than 1 year at the expected time of costing
were excluded to allow for patient outcome analysis on both new and existing ART


                                              70
patients. Additionally, although private facilities made up nearly 18% of total static sites
in Malawi (51 out of 277), they only covered 3.1% of the total patient burden and were
therefore excluded from the sample to allow for greater emphasis on public sites.

6.     Stratification Criteria: The first stratification criterion used was the facility type:
Hospital, Health Center, or Other/Special. The second criterion used was region: South,
Central, or North. The third criterion used was Administration: MoH or Other.

7.      Since much of the facility level administration is centralized within a district, a
clustered approach was also taken to accommodate more robust data collection. If a
District Hospital was selected, Health Centers within that district were prioritized only if
they also fit the necessary criteria.

8.     Representation Per Stratum:

• Average of number of sites based on distribution of facilities and number of patients per
stratum.
• The average was rounded to zero decimals to determine the final number of sites per
stratum
• Any stratum with 0-1% representation was always rounded up to 1 so no stratum ever
had a probability of zero sites being selected unless its representation was actually 0.

1.2 Data Collection Overview

9.      Data collection took place over the course of 5 months, from May 2011 through
September 2011. One team of 1-3 data collectors was in the field, covering an average of
one site per week.

1.3 Data Sources and Collection Tools

10.   Three types of data were collected: descriptive information about the site,
comprehensive cost data, and patient-level data collected from charts.

11.    Key data sources include the following:

• Facility-level data, both electronic and paper based and other expenditure
records/reports
• Interviews with facility managers, accountants, patient record managers, and health care
providers
• Patient record review (as needed particularly for patient outcome indicators)
• Aggregate data available from the Ministry of Health or elsewhere (e.g. data on prices
paid for
CD4 machines)
• Comparable facility-level data from adjacent health care centers in the absence of data
from a specific facility (e.g. running costs at similar facilities)




                                             71
12.    Data collection was conducted using a standardized tool in a dedicated software
package, DatStat. DatStat is a web-based platform which was used at each facility to
capture data by cost element. The tool captures all sites’ data and stores it in a common
database. Data collection is built in DatStat surveys by cost element and consists of the
following information:

• Qualitative questionnaires
• Quantitative input tables
• Patient-level data questionnaire

1.4 Data Management

13.     Data was collected in multiple ways: some was captured using manual surveys
recorded on paper or on a computer, and some was provided as electronic data (i.e. some
quantitative information). Where survey data was collected on paper, the paper copies
were stored securely under direction of the principal investigator pending data entry into
the online system. Data provided in electronic format was also stored securely under the
direction of the principal investigator. All data entered in DatStat is stored in an oracle
database located in Seattle, Washington, USA. Data was controlled through security
features built into the tool and was not accessed by anyone without the appropriate
permissions.

1.5 Analysis of Cost data

14.    Costs were collected across five major cost categories: ARVs, Personnel,
Laboratory, Investment Costs, and Other Clinical Costs.

15.      As the objective was to estimate and project the real cost of ART delivery, this
study used an empirical “top-down? approach to quantify the current unit cost of ART.
Study teams collected the total cost of treatment at a given facility and made a series of
input cost allocations to arrive at a PPPY cost. Total costs were first allocated to the HIV
program, then to service delivery areas (SDAs) and to patient categories to calculate the
PPPY cost. This process was followed for each cost category (ARVs, Laboratory,
Personnel, and “Other Costs?). For example, in order to quantify the costs associated with
treating a single pre-ART or ART patient, the study team started with total personnel
costs at a given facility, assigned the portion of those costs that are incurred caring for
pre-ART and ART patients using a simple allocation metric such as proportion of patient
visits, and then divided the total pre-ART and ART related personnel cost by the total
number of patient years. In certain cost categories, the study team complemented the top-
down approach described above with a normative or “bottom-up? calculation of cost.

1.5.1 Allocation to HIV

16.   Shared costs were allocated to pre-ART and ART based on assessed proportion of
pre-ART and ART utilization to total facility utilization. Allocation to the HIV program
was made using directly relevant measures where possible; for example, facility costs



                                            72
were allocated based on the approximate relative share of space, equipment used for HIV
services; vehicle costs by approximate share of time; and staff costs by approximate
allocation of working hours per week/month. Where these estimates were unavailable, a
default HIV allocation was used, where the number of visits to the ART clinic was
divided by the total number of outpatient visits (including ART) to the facility in order to
determine the relative allocation of facility level costs to HIV.

1.5.2 Allocation to Patient Types

17.     Costs were then allocated proportionally to patient types, based on the number of
patients in each category. The study reviews costs for the following patient types:

1. Pre-ART patients
2. Adult First Line Patients
3. Adult Second Line Patients
4. Pediatric First Line Patients
5. Pediatric Second Line Patients

1.5.3 Allocation to Service Delivery Areas

18.    Total costs were allocated across eight service delivery areas found to be the main
contributors to HIV treatment cost in order to illustrate the greatest cost components of
service provision. The eight service delivery categories were determined primarily
through interviews, and are listed below with a brief description.

1. ARVs – this includes only the cost of ARVs
2. Clinical care – this includes any non-ARV clinical treatment cost such as personnel
time spent on clinical care, the cost of other drugs, etc.
3. Laboratory services – this includes any lab service such as lab personnel, the cost of
reagents and consumables, etc.
4. Supply chain management – this includes the cost of supply chain for drugs, lab
supplies, or personnel time dedicated to supply chain management
5. Outreach programs (e.g. adherence, retention) – this includes the cost of personnel or
expenditures for particular outreach programs
6. Training – this includes the cost of trainings which are not directly attributable to any
other service delivery area
7. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) and Health Management Information Systems
(HMIS) – this includes any personnel time or equipment related to reporting and/or data
collection
8. Facility administration and management – this includes any cost to administer and
manage a site (mainly personnel costs)

1.6 Cost Categories

1.6.1 Patient Numbers

19.      Aggregate patient data was collected to determine the patient population,
including, but not limited to, the number of patients on Pre-ART versus ART, the number
of initiations per month, the number of patients on PMTCT, and attrition rates. Although
this category does not contain specific cost information, it identifies the denominator
required to calculate per patient per year costs.

20.     The total number of ART patients was determined primarily from the MoH’s
Quarterly Cohort Reports. Patient numbers were recorded quarterly; to convert this to
monthly numbers, an assumed linear increase/decrease per month was applied between
data points. The number of patient years was then calculated by summing the total
patients per month and dividing by 12 months to get an average number of patients per
year. In the Cohort Reports, all 1L patients were aggregated; therefore, an assumed ratio
equal to the proportion of adult to pediatric initiations during the costing year was used to
disaggregate patients into Adult and Pediatric 1L. Since this study took place prior to the
implementation of a formal Pre-ART program, Pre-ART patient numbers were collected
primarily through an estimated ratio of Pre-ART to ART patients seen per
day/week/month by health facility staff. In rare instances, Pre-ART patient numbers were
collected through an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) database on-site.

1.6.2 Personnel

21.    Personnel data was collected from the site itself, from the administrative body
which governed that site, or from MoH centrally. The information collected includes the
number of direct and indirect10 FTEs (Full Time Equivalents) involved in clinical care
for ART patients, rank and salaries of each individual, funder, top-ups provided by Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) or other parties, benefits additions, and percent of
time dedicated to ART.

1.6.3 ARVs

22.     The costs for ARVs include the costs associated with providing ARVs to patients,
including the actual cost of drugs and supply chain costs associated with getting drugs
from the supplier to Malawi (but not the local supply chain costs of getting ARVs all the
way to the facility). Systems costs like supply chain management are captured in ARV
costs as a percent allocation to the supply chain SDA, and were calculated in consultation
with UNICEF, the procuring agent for the MoH. The unit cost for ARVs was based
primarily on the Malawi Quantification and Supply Planning Document (2011) with
additional unit costs from UNICEF and CHAI/UNITAID order trackers.

23.     Total consumption for the costed year was calculated by examining initial stock
of a given drug, adding the amount received per month during the year (and subtracting
the amount that was shared with other facilities), and then subtracting the final stock



                                             74
amount. These quantities were multiplied by unit cost per drug to calculate total cost,
which was then allocated by patient type and divided by patient years to determine the
PPPY cost for each patient type. In select cases where stock card data was considered to
be unreliable, bottom-up calculations were done using the patient regimen breakdown to
determine consumption.

24.     Direct personnel includes: Doctors, Clinical Officers, Medical Assistants, Nurses,
Nurse-Midwife Technicians, Counselors, Nutritionist, HSAs, Pharmacists, Lab staff.
Indirect personnel includes: Data Capturers, Administrative Clerks, On-site facility-level
management/ administration, Cleaners, Security, etc. This category does not include
supervisory staff at the MoH or NGOs that are not based at the facility but may visit
occasionally for supervision.

1.6.4 Laboratory

25.     Laboratory costs include the cost of all lab tests done for pre-ART and ART
patients, and exclude other laboratory costs such as personnel and equipment, which are
accounted for under other cost categories.

26.      This cost category includes tests done on-site as well as those done at external
facilities. The unit cost of lab tests includes the cost of consumables and reagents, along
with the associated supply chain costs and/or sample transportation costs (if applicable).
The total number of tests conducted was obtained from lab records on site and at referral
labs, where available, or derived from estimates of the number of patient referrals for
external labs tests (predominantly for CD4 tests) which were not recorded on site. Where
possible, these estimates were validated at the referral lab conducting the test.

1.6.5 Opportunistic Infections

27.      This category covers the cost of all non-ARV drugs taken by ART and pre-ART
patients at the ART clinic (OI drugs used in in-patient wards or provided in other
facilities or wards were not covered). As with ARVs, this cost included the actual cost of
drugs and supply chain costs associated with getting drugs from the supplier to Malawi,
excluding local supply chain costs. Costs were then allocated across SDAs to isolate the
total PPPY cost.

28.    The costing methodology for Opportunistic Infections (OIs) is similar to that for
ARVs except for one critical difference: drugs for OIs are not specific to pre-ART and
ART patients and can be used to treat many diseases or illnesses affecting patients
outside these programs. Therefore, the study team estimated the percent dispensed of
each drug to ART and pre-ART patients relative to all patients at a site, based on data that
was available at the site.

29.     Total consumption for the costed year was calculated by examining initial stock
of a given drug, adding the amount received during the year (and subtracting the amount
that was shared with other facilities), and then subtracting the final stock amount. These



                                            75
quantities were multiplied by unit cost per drug to calculate total cost which was then
allocated by patient type and divided by patient years to determine the cost per patient per
year for each patient type.

1.6.6 Nutrition

30.      This category covers the cost of all nutrition supplements taken by pre-ART and
ART patients. Unlike ARVs and OIs, this cost includes the actual cost of nutrition
commodities and the local distribution costs associated with getting commodities to the
facility. The costing methodology for nutrition is similar to that for OIs, as nutrition
commodities are not specific to pre-ART and ART patients and can be used to treat other
malnourished patients as well. Therefore, for each commodity the percent consumed by
pre-ART and ART patients was estimated.

31.     Total consumption for the costed year was calculated by looking at initial stock
plus total receipts less final stock for nutrition commodities. These quantities were
multiplied by unit cost per commodity to calculate total cost, which was then allocated by
patient type and divided by patient years to determine the PPPY cost.

1.6.7 Investment costs

32.     Building costs, equipment costs, training costs, and other running costs were
calculated using the top down methodology; the total cost for each category was allocated
to the facility, to HIV treatment, and then to patient category and SDA. These allocated
costs were then divided by patient years to calculate PPPY cost.

• Building costs included the cost of the building and any renovations that have been
completed, amortized if relevant.
• Equipment costs included all medical and non-medical equipment used specifically for
pre-ART and ART services as well as shared equipment for the entire facility. It included
heavy machinery such as vehicles, IT equipment such as computers and printers, and
other small equipment and furniture that are either leased or owned.
• Training costs included all in-service training activities held for ART staff either within
or outside the facility.
• Other Running Costs included utilities, non-clinical and clinical supplies, building
maintenance, security, administration/systems, and other miscellaneous recurring costs.

1.7 Categories of descriptive data included

33.    These characteristics provide information on the facility setting, administration,
and operations in order to additional potential determinants of cost. Categories of
descriptive data included:

• Facility characteristics
• ART service provision
• Other HIV service provision (i.e. prevention, testing, etc.)



                                              76
• Other health service provision
• Patient population characteristics
• Facility management and administration
• Personnel management, oversight, and administration
• Staff schedule, training, and task assignments
• Drug management and supply chain
• Laboratory systems
• Treatment of opportunistic infections
• General facility costs and operations

1.8 Assessing quality of care

1.8.1 Overview

34.     In order to comprehensively understand the efficiency and effectiveness of
funding spent on ART, it is necessary to evaluate not only the cost of providing treatment,
but also the quality of care currently provided at that cost. Lower unit cost does not
necessarily represent the most desirable outcome, and the quality of care must be
carefully considered before making policy recommendations.

35.     While data collection and allocations of costs are relatively unambiguous and
more quantitative in nature, quality of care is more complicated to assess. This section
outlines the approach used to assess quality of care within the scope of this study.

1.8.2 Approach

36.    The most appropriate methodology for assessing quality of service and patient
outcomes is a prospective cohort-based analysis, which follows patients over time and
can assess the impact of policy options such as choice of drugs and frequency of testing.
The most robust analysis adjusts the costs by calculating cost per QALY (Quality-
Adjusted Life Years) over several years and takes socio-economic factors into
consideration.

37.     This analysis, by contrast, provides a retrospective snapshot in time and is focused
on the facility level, assessing selected quality indictors across three categories:
complexity, process/service, and patient outcome. This approach provides limited ability
to assess the level of detailed patient data necessary to arrive at a robust analysis of
patient outcomes and, by extension, quality of service. Instead, this analysis provides an
indicative measure of quality that can be used to inform and help evaluate the cost data
for each facility.

Complexity Indicators

38.      Complexity indicators capture the variations of incoming cases seen by different
facilities, and include both clinical and non-clinical factors. These indicators include




                                            77
uncontrollable factors that might drive the cost and/or outcomes regardless of the
facility’s service provision.

• Environmental Factors provide an assessment of the overall level of health within the
catchment population for a specific facility. Examples of these factors include prevalence
of TB or Malaria and inform the costing analysis with epidemiological wellness
characteristics that could be expected in the patient population.
• Characteristics at Initiation provide a baseline from which clinical progress can be
measured.

39.     Understanding the HIV disease progression for patients upon initiation of pre-
ART and ART will provide a valuable starting point from which to monitor progress as a
result of enrolling in the pre-ART or ART program. Examples of quality indicators
include median CD4, WHO stage, and TB status at initiation.

Process and Service Quality Indicators

40.     These indicators capture the services and amenities provided to patients within a
health facility. They provide a perspective on factors that impact quality of care both
internal to a facility and external within the health system, and are likely to be correlated
with improved patient outcomes over time, compensating for the limited ability to
directly measure those within the context of this study.

• Facility Characteristics provide context from which to measure the level of care
available at a facility from the perspective of an observer. Examples of facility
characteristics include degradation of infrastructure, availability of utilities such as water
and electricity, and adequate space for patients.
• Process indicators provide insight into how closely patient management follows
protocol and best practice. On the whole, a facility that closely follows protocol is likely
to have better outcomes than a facility that fails to provide components of pre-ART and
ART. While indicators differ between sites, several indicators can be selected to provide
a proxy for good service.
Process indicators include adherence to minimum frequency of tests and doctor visits,
availability of essential services like laboratory testing and adherence management
programs, and sufficient time for clinical visits.
• System Characteristics provide context regarding the robustness of the health system
infrastructure supporting facility-based services. Examples of quality indicators include
the number of pharmaceutical stock outs per year, the availability of sample
transportation for lab tests, and the availability of reagents/consumables to perform lab
tests.

Patient Outcome Indicators

41.    Patient Outcome Indicators monitor the progress that has been made as a result of
enrollment in the pre-ART or ART program, taking into consideration appropriate
complexity indicators. Although some of these indicators are difficult to quantify due to



                                             78
data availability and quality, they are perhaps the most essential in determining the
overall quality of care for a specific pre-ART and ART program.

42.      Improvements in health must be captured along with the cost of care to allow for
a thorough comparison across facilities. Examples of patient outcome indicators include
median CD4 count after 12 months (where available), attrition (defaulted, stopped, died),
transfers, and adherence (where possible). The patient outcome indicators were collected
from a sample of patient charts and supplemented with information from central data
management systems where necessary. The primary indicator and most robust indicator
used for the descriptive analysis is patient retention in treatment at 12 months (patients
alive and on ART). For new patient, the 12-month timeframe is measured from the ART
initiation date, and for established patients, it is measured at the start of the costing period.

1.8.3 Patient Chart Sampling

43.    Patient chart sampling was done at all 30 facilities costed in Malawi with 100
randomly selected charts at each facility – 50 new patients and 50 established patients.
New patients were defined as those whose ART initiation date was within M-12, where
M represents the starting month of the costing period. Established patients were defined
as those starting ART prior to M-12 and who were considered alive and on ART on or
after M+6. In addition to the definitions for these patient types, several inclusion and
exclusion criteria were applied in order to capture data for patients who contributed to the
cost observed at the facility, and to measure patient outcomes that corresponded to the
costing time period.

44.     Several patient characteristics relevant to case complexity and selected patient
outcomes (i.e. retention and response at 12 months) were captured in the chart abstraction.
This includes initiation criteria, CD4 and weight monitoring over time, regimen data, and
adherence data where available. The team also documented the number of rejected charts
based on the sampling criteria and documented the respective reason for rejection. The
abstraction was done using an excel template not included here.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.      The Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS 2004) estimated HIV
prevalence for adults (15-49 years) at 11.8% which slightly declined to 10.6% in 2010.
The Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Project was designed around strategic frameworks that
guide the Malawi national response. The original project development objective (PDO)
was ‘to reduce the transmission of HIV, to improve the quality of life of those infected
and affected by AIDS, and to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS in all sectors and at all
levels of Malawian society’. This PDO was revised in the extended project and read ‘to
increase access to prevention, treatment, and mitigation services, with a focus on
behavioral change interventions and addressing the needs of highly vulnerable
populations, including those affected and infected by the epidemic’.

2.     The original Malawi Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project amounting to SDR 25.4
million (US$35.0 million equivalent) IDA grant was effective in February 2004 and
closed in September 2009. The project was extended for a period of three years and
ended in September 2012, with an additional funding of SDR 19.4 million (US$30
million equivalent) IDA grant for scaling up of activities under the original financing.
The project supported a comprehensive range of prevention, treatment, and social support
services and has focused on increasing and strengthening programmatic, as well as
management capacity.

3.     The MAP Project became part of the HIV AND AIDS Pool financing mechanism
which the borrower operates through the National AIDS Commission.

KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

4.     Factors that affected implementation between 2004 and 2009 included:
 Limited capacity to implement programs;
 Poor integration of HIV services and cross cutting issues such as gender, human
   rights and culture;
 Limited coverage of HIV and AIDS service;
 Funding gaps,
 Limited knowledge and skills in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

5.     From 2009 to September 2012, implementation was particularly affected by:
 Limited capacity for production of IEC materials targeting people with special needs
   as well as delays in finalizing procurement processes
 Weak procurement and supply chain management
 Inadequate access to Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) services
 Inadequate CD4 count testing
 Inadequate resources to implement impact mitigation


                                          84
   Non comprehensive mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS particularly in the informal
    sector and small and medium enterprises.
   Delayed and erratic reporting by strategic partners

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

6.      The project has overall registered positive progress towards achieving its
objectives and targets. HIV prevalence of adults (15-49 years) declined from 11.8% in
2004 to 10.6% in 2010 and so have new HIV infections, from about 80,000 in 2004 to
about 60,000 in 2009, then further down to 34,000 in 2012. The project objectives and
other indicators were achieved as summarized below:

7.      Reduction in the transmission of HIV has been achieved through partner
reduction, increased and consistent condom use as well as comprehensive knowledge to
be able to correctly identify ways of preventing transmission among others.

8.      Improve the quality of life of those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS as
shown by the number of households with chronically ill persons receiving various kinds
of support. Stigma and discrimination also reduced (although few isolated pockets still
exists) evidenced by increased percentage of the population expressing accepting
attitudes towards persons living with HIV/AIDS.

9.      Mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS in all sectors and all levels of Malawian
society. The percentage of orphans and other vulnerable children (OVCs) to whom
community support is provided has increased. Government has opened up to child
fostering and is encouraging families to foster or even adopt OVCs.

10.    Behavioral      Change     Communication/Information,        Education       and
Communication (BCC/IEC) was implemented through production and distribution of
both print and electronic communication products on various thematic areas of national
response, complemented by interactive/interpersonal communication, theatre for
development, video shows, radio listening clubs, community and social mobilization.

11.     Interventions for young people such as Life Skills Education (LSE) for both in-
school and out-of-school (including those physically challenged) young people were
implemented in order to empower them to make informed decisions about sex and
sexuality. The subject is now compulsory and examinable.

12.    Condom distribution increased over the project period despite some PSM
challenges. In 2011/2012, a total of 33.4 million condoms were distributed which is close
to the estimated 36 million condoms required per annum for the sexually active
population.

13.   Gender, human rights, and culture issues have been mainstreamed into HIV
and AIDS programs at national, district and community levels.




                                           85
14.    Innovative approaches in delivery of HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) have
been introduced. These include door to door testing, couple counseling and testing,
moonlight testing, and mobile services. There has been steady increase in number of
people tested despite frequent stock outs of test kits.

15.    Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTC) service delivery has
been scaled up and Government is implementing a new treatment policy where all
pregnant and lactating women are put on ARVs. The aim is to eliminate transmission of
HIV from mother to child and improve the general health status of HIV positive mothers.

16.      The Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) program started towards the end of 2003
and since then both sites and people initiated on ART has increased. To date, 391,388
people are alive and on treatment, provided from 641 sites. The program has also
maintained a relatively high 12 months survival rate of about 80% over the past years.
The program has also strengthened management of TB/HIV co-infection by offering HIV
testing to all TB clients and referring all HIV+ TB patients to treatment.

17.     Treatment of Opportunistic Infections (OIs) such as Tuberculosis (TB),
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), Esophageal Candidiasis (OC), and Cryptococcus Meningitis
(CM) have always been challenged by drug stock outs. Government is continuously
making efforts to address stock out issues by strengthening the procurement and supply
chain management system including improvements in commodity forecasting and
quantification.

18.     Community Home Based Care (CHBC) initiatives have scaled down due to the
scaling up and success on the ART program.

19.     Support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children through education bursaries
fluctuated due to decrease in financial resources for impact mitigation interventions.

20.      The Social Cash Transfer Scheme was introduced in 2006 to economically
empower the ultra-poor and reduce their vulnerability to HIV. It was first piloted in 1
district but eventually scaled up to 7 districts. Government is currently collaborating with
partners to scale up the program to more districts under the Social Protection Policy.

21.     Resource Mobilization and Utilization. The Government of Malawi and its
Development Partners/Partners, including the World Bank, signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) in 2003 and established a Pool Funding Mechanism to support the
national response to HIV and AIDS in Malawi. The MOU enabled Government to
mobilize significant financial resources for priority intervention areas. In 2004,
Government, through NAC, established the grants facility as a mechanism to provide
resources to grant recipient organization (GROs) in order to implement various
interventions in the national response. The funds provided by NAC to GROs have
steadily increased throughout the program period.

ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

World Bank Performance Assessment

22.    The World Bank (the Bank) is the first multi-lateral financial institution to
mobilize significant resources for HIV and AIDS in Africa and participating in a
countries’ Pooled Funding Mechanism. It has always been flexible with its resources in
support of the implementation of the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (NSP).

23.     The World Bank is a member of the HIV and AIDS Pool as well as the HIV and
AIDS Partner Group (HADG). The partners meet on a quarterly basis to share
information about country assistance programs of the different agencies, experiences and
concerns and reach consensus on decisions in their support to the NSP and
implementation of the Integrated Annual Work Plan (IAWP). These meetings have,
overall, improved transparency in the way the funding partners conduct their business.

24.     The World Bank reviews and provides clearances on all International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procurement on behalf of Pool Funding Partners. Through both
international and local teams, the Bank has always provided technical support to the
borrower during development of the MAP and has also effectively contributed to the
planning and monitoring of the national response.

Borrower’s Performance Assessment

25.     The borrower, among others, has established strong coordination mechanisms at
all levels, developed strategic documents, established funding mechanism which have
improved coordination in the funding, management and reviews of the national response.
The borrower has also developed and continuously improved its systems and procedures
in response to the lessons learned over time and the changing operating environment.

LESSONS LEARNED

26.    Some of the lessons learned include:
 The need to establish NAC through an Act of Parliament so that it can effectively
    deliver on its mandate.
 Substantial funding gap due to limited funding commitments has rendered the
    national response financially unsustainable.
 Delayed disbursements for approved grants affected continued implementation of
    some critical interventions.
 Weak Procurement and Supply Chain Management of health products has led to
    delayed      procurements,    frequent    drug   stock      outs,    as    well   as
    misappropriation/leakages.
 Strengthening capacity of implementing agencies improves their ability to
    effectively plan, manage and deliver HIV and AIDS.
 Coordination, linkages and integration of services amongst funding and
    implementing partners generates synergies that facilitate rapid scale up of programs


                                          87
    such as treatment. Furthermore, integration of services improves efficiency in
    service delivery.

CONCLUSION

27.    The overall HIV prevalence and number of new HIV infections has significantly
reduced. Although the new HIV infections have reduced, the current levels are still
unacceptably high.

28.    Recently, the funding gap is increasing and this may erode the sustainability of
the gains achieved, particularly from scaling up of the treatment program. Capacity
development of implementing partners will continue to strengthen and maintain the
knowledge and skills.
