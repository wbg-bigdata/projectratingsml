                         Project implementation is proceeding without any major obstacles. All audits and reports have been received on schedule. The 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey data
                         indicates positive progress in changing risky behaviors, such as significant reductions in the percentage of sexually active women and men (15-49 years) having sex with a more than
                         one partner (non-regular partner) in the last 12 months. For treatment, there is also good news as the number of HIV infected adults and children receiving ARVs has reached
                         267,000 exceeding the end of project target by 4,000. HIV prevalence is 10.6 percent for adults (age 15-49), down from 11.8 percent in 2004. Projections suggest that prevalence will
