HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008               Ministry of Health and Population
FOREWORD
Health care services inevitably generate waste that may be hazardous to health or have
harmful environmental effects. Some of them, such as sharps or infected blood carry a
higher potential for infection and injury than any other type of waste. Their improper
management can cause direct health impacts on the personnel working in the health
care facilities or on the communities. Sound management of health care waste (HCW) is
thus a crucial component of environmental health protection.
In both the short and the long term, the actions involved in implementing effective health-
care waste management programs require multi-sectoral co-operation and interaction at
all levels. Policies should be generated and co-coordinated nationally. Establishment of
a natlonal policy and legal framework, training of personnel and raising public awareness
are essentlal elements of successful health-care waste management. Improved public
awareness of the problem is essential in encouraging community participation in
generating and implementing policies.
To achieve this aim, the Ministry of Health and Population in collaboration with its
partners: UNICEF, WHO, World Bank set up a consultancy team to assess health-care
waste management and develop a Policy and Strategic Plan for HCWM for Malawi. This
document, the result of their efforts, is intended to be a comprehensive yet concise,
"user-friendly' strategic five year plan oriented towards practical management of health-
care waste in local facilities. It outlines the short, medium and long-term activities for
legal and institutional framework, capacity building & training of personnel, raising public
awareness, public private partnership and monitoring and evaluation to be implemented
in a sustainable and effective manner in health-care waste management programs in
Malawi
This strategic plan of action has been reviewed and approved during a National
Consultative Workshop held by the Ministry of Health and Population in May- June 2003.
It is my hope that the plan of action backed up by the Health Care Waste Management
Policy will stimulate collaborated efforts to implement the strategies so that effective
health-care waste management system can be achieved in Malawi

HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008                Ministry of Health and Population
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
This strategic plan of action is a result of the assessment of HCWM and injection safety
Initiated by the Ministry of Health and Population and its partners UNICEF, WHO, and
World Bank in Nov 2002 - Jan 2003 in response to introduction of AD syringes and the
subsequent formulation of HCWM Policy. The HCWM policy focused on four main
priority areas: institutional and legal framework, capacity building and training,
infrastructure , and public awareness and involvement of public sector in HCWM. In
order to adequately address these priority areas and put in place a sustainable health
care waste management system, a five year strategic implementation plan of the policy
has been developed.
The Strategic plan outlines the rationale, national goal and steps in achieving the
objectives of clean environment for all Malawians. The strategic plan has been
summarized in two logical frameworks. The first logical framework is a summary five
year implementation framework which explains the objectives, key targets, objectively
verified indicators and their means of verification, expected total cost of activity over five
years and further identifies sources of funding. The second logic framework outlines the
strategies and their specific yearly targets and budgeted activities.
In the Initial years, the strategic plan of action has taken into consideration the gaps in
the current health care waste management system as revealed in the findings of the
HCWM assessment and the thrust of HCWM and Injection Safety policies.
Key findings:
HCWM Assessment
*  HCWM is not a specific priority in the national health policy
* The institutional and legal framework is deficient
* Organization and equipment are not performing
*  Behavior and practices of the health workers are generally mediocre
*  Private sector are not involved in HCWM.
*  Financial resources allocated to HCWM are insufficient
Injection Safety Assessment
* Training and capacity building in injection safety is minimal
*  Injection equipment is mainly procured as single equipment except in EPI where
"bundling" is practised.
*  Injection practices are poor exposing patients, health workers, and community to
unnecessary risks
Purpose of the POA
The goal of the POA is to prevent and mitigate the environmental and health impact of
health care waste and protect health staff, patients and the general public from their
risks. In order to achieve this goal, the following strategic objectives will be carried out

1.0   INTRODUCTION
Health related activities produce a considerable amount of waste on a daily basis as a
result of preventive, curative and rehabilitative service delivery. The composition of
waste produced is in the form of sharps (needles, syringes), non-sharps blood and other
body fluids, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Health workers, waste
handlers, users of health facilities and the community are all exposed to health care
related waste that could cause ill health as a result of poor management. A good health
care waste management plan results in healthier communities, thereby reducing the cost
of health care, as well as creating opportunities for waste re-use and eventual waste
recovery.
A few important principles of sound management of health care related waste include:
(1) definition of a policy framework, (2) assignment of legal responsibility for safe
management of waste disposal to the waste producers, (3) allocation of adequate
financial resources and cost recovery mechanisms, and (4) high level of awareness on
proper waste disposal among all health workers in all cadres and among the general
public.
1.1   Background
MOHP commissioned a medical waste and injection safety assessment in mid-2002 with
funding from UNICEF, WHO and World Bank. This assessment was carried out in
November 2002 to January 2003 and was based on a participatory and consultative
methodology. The assessment report facilitated the development of HCWM policy and
the preparation of this five - year plan of action for Health Care Waste Management and
Injection Safety.
1.2   Geographical And Socioeconomic Situation
Malawi is a sub-Saharan country in South-Eastern Africa, with 94,276 square km of
land. Annual rainfall ranges from 700 to 1800mm. It has a population of 9,838,486
representing 104 people per square km and a population growth rate of 1.9% per year.
In 1995, Malawi was ranked as the ninth poorest country in the world in terms of GNP
per capita (USD 170). It still suffers from serious inequities in the distribution of income,
with over sixty percent of the population living below the absolute poverty line.
Agriculture is and will remain the mainstay of economic growth in Malawi. The country's
health indicators are among the worst in the world. Life expectancy at birth has fallen to
below 39 years. The infant mortality rate of 134 per 1,000 live births has only marginally
improved in the last 10 years. Under-five mortality is 234 per 1,000 live births and is
expected to rise as a result of HIV/AIDS epidemic. Under-five mortality is mostly due to
malnutrition, anemia, pneumonia and diarrhea diseases.
1.3   The National Health System
Health care services in Malawi are provided by three main agencies: the Ministry of
Health and Population (MOHP) provides 60%; the Christian Health Association of
Malawi (CHAM) provides 37%, and the Ministry of Local Government provides 1%.
Other providers, namely private practitioners, commercial companies, Army and Police,
provide 2% of health services.



HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008                 Ministry of Health and Populaton
The country has 585 health facilities for CHAM and the public. Of these 43 are big
hospitals, 4 referral hospitals, 22 district hospitals and 17 CHAM hospitals, 2 mental
hospitals and the rest are health centres and dispensaries. There are 147 private
registered health facilities in addition to those for MOHP and CHAM. The dispensaries
and health centres provide primary health care while the district hospitals provide
secondary health care and referral hospitals provide tertiary health care. At the primary
health care level the services are mainly out patients and integrated management of
child health including EPI, disease surveillance, family planning, and antenatal clinics. A
Medical Assistant, a Nurse, an Assistant Environmental Health Officer and Health
Surveillance Assistant technically run these services at this level.
The secondary health care acts as a referral centre for primary health care facilities
running admission facilities ranging from 150 to 250 beds. At this level there is integrated
services, paediatrics, maternity, medical, laboratory and radiology departments. At least
one medical officer, several clinical officers and medical assistants, laboratory
technicians, nurses and midwives, radiographer and assistant environmental health
officers technically man these facilities.
The tertiary health care offers specialist and consultant service in paediatrics, medicines,
surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, dentistry, intensive care, and
anaesthesiology. At this level the diagnostic capacity is higher than the secondary health
care. The bed capacity ranges 350 to 1,500 beds.
The public health service has approximately 16,0001 staff of which about7,000 technical
staff. The staffs for CHAM and the Private are not known. The MOHP takes leadership in,
policy making, direction and co-ordinating health care system. To ensure efficiency,
accountability and reduce duplications the Ministry is in the process of introducing sector
wide approach to health development. Decentralisation of management of physical,
financial and human resource to districts will allow the Ministry to concentrate on policy
formulation and co-ordination.
1.4   Main Areas Of Emphasis For The Five Year Strategic Plan Of Action
1.4.1 Institutional and legal framework
The institutional and legal framework on HCWM is weak. HCWM is not a specific priority
in the National Health policy. The institutional framework is characterized by a lack of
national strategy. There is no policy or document or any formal management procedure
for health care wastes. The legal framework, characterized mainly by an absence of
internal regulations in the health facilities, does not ensure sustainable HCWM, as the
roles, responsibilities and field competency of actors involved in HCWM are not defined
in a clear and precise way. The proposed law and regulations on HCWM is being
prepared without a proper policy framework and do not allow a standardization of HCW
collection, transportation, storage and treatment procedures. It would therefore, be
preferable to develop an institutional and legal package, including policy document, to
outline national goals and the key steps to achieve these goals before preparing a
HCWM law. To make the legal documents more operational, there is need to reinforce
the technical guidelines for HCWM, define a specific regulation for each level of health
facility and specify control procedures.

1.4.2 Capacity Building And Training
While the paramedical staff has knowledge and fairly good behavior in HCWM, auxiliary
staff , waste collectors, health workers (supply staff) and waste handlers are in a much
weaker position and higher risk from HCWM. Mostly these are at the receiving end of the
HCWM stream and are not conscious of the hazardous constituents of HCW.
This lack of awareness of workers is very often a source of accidents causing wounds
and infection. Moreover, the inappropriate collection, storage, and HCW disposal, result
in an extraordinary mixing of HCW with other solid non-toxic wastes (or less toxic ones),
which can cause environmental degradation. In these circumstances HCW becomes an
imminent occupational health hazard within the health sector. In this regard including
HCWM in pre-service training curricula in all health training institution for all cadres is
imperative. Further organising and conducting in-service training is a prerequisite to
improving occupation health and safety in the health facilities.
1.4.3 IEC And Advocacy On Community Involvement In HCWM
In general, the public's knowledge of risks linked with the handling of HCW is very weak,
particularly: (i) the scavengers looking for useful objects, (ii) children playing on the
landfill or looking for toys, (iii) population using recycled objects, (iv) population
performing or receiving home based health care, (v) people living near the landfills.
Awareness campaigns targeted to such audience will facilitate a reduction in exposure to
HCW.
1.4.4 Public Private Partnership
Municipalities and cities of Zomba, Blantyre Lilongwe and Mzuzu have some form of
waste management systems for general waste .Generally these Assemblies waste
management systems are unable to effectively and efficiently collect, treat and dispose
waste to the required standards. No private companies are involved in solid waste
collection in Malawi at the present time. Hence there is need to explore involvement of
the private sector in waste management. For instance, collection and transportation of
waste including HCW, there is non-existence of specialized companies/agencies in this
venture which constitutes a major constraint for waste management. This equally, poses
a limitation to managing HCW in a professional manner as the management skills and
financial resources of the private sector are not being tapped. Therefore, any proposed
action plan for HCWM should support private initiatives and develop a partnership
between public and private sectors with civil society. To accomplish this there is need to
develop sustainable financial resources for HCWM.
1.4.5 Improvement of HCW Collection, Treatment And Disposal
HCW management inside health facilities revealed many weaknesses; despite the
efforts noted in some health centres. The major constraints are: lack of planning or
internal management procedures, absence of viable data about HCW production and
characteristics, no monitoring system or staff member designated to monitor HCW
management, insufficiency of secure collection materials and protective gear, mixing of
HCW with household and office waste, and inefficient treatment and final disposal. As a
result, health care workers, non-technical health facility staff, municipal landfill workers,
and landfill scavengers are at serious risk of infection. Appropriate HCW facilities need

4.0   INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
4.1   Improvement Of The Institutional And Legal Framework
The Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) will be responsible for the improvement
of the institutional and legal framework. These activities should be conducted in the first
year of the programme by the Department of Preventive Health Services (DPHS) and
through the Environmental Health Service (EHS).
4.2   Training
The training activities should be led by the DPHS / EHS of the MOHP. This structure has
competence in HCWM and could be assisted by training institutions in this field. At
district levels, management of training activities should be assigned to the District team.
Specific training activities will be done in the first two years of the programme
4.3   Improvement Of Health Care Waste Collection, Treatment, And Disposal.
EHS and Health facility managers will work together to introduce improved HCWM
systems at health facilities. EHS will regulate the HCW management in health facilities,
DPHS will supply health facility managers with HCWM equipment and materials, and
execution of HCWM improvement programs will be conducted by health facility
managers and their staff.
4.4   Public Awareness
The Health Education Unit of the MOHP will lead the activities intended to makeM the
general public aware about HCW. At the local level, the District team will do the
supervision. These activities will take place over a five year period, through district public
meetings, radio and television messages, posters, etc.
4.5   Private Sector Involvement
Ministry of Health and Population through the HCWM unit will liaise with City Assemblies
who are currently operating waste management collection systems to engage
contractors on a pilot basis for collection of waste including HCW. In order to maximise
the utilisation of the contracted waste collection system, a number of health facilities will
be involved in recycling programs. Financing mechanism need to be put in place in
advance. Both the collection and recycling pilot programmes will be assessed in six
months in order to establish viable alternatives.
4.6   Control and Monitoring of the POA
At the local level, the control and monitoring of HCWM plan implementation should be
done by the District team which will ensure monthly monitoring, while the yearly follow
up will be realized by EHS/DPHS.
4.7   Evaluation And Supervision Of The POA
The evaluation of the HCWM Plan should be assigned to international/ local consultants
(under supervision of EHS/DPHS), to ensure objectivity. This evaluation should be done
halfway through (at the end of the 2nd year) and at the end of the first phase program
(year 5).

5.0   PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
5.1   Potential Partners And Field Of Intervention
Delivery of essential health services and the fight against HIV/AIDS and sound
environmental management relies on the involvement of a wide range of actors: public
and private sectors, NGOs, and civil society. So it is necessary to establish a partnership
framework to identify the roles and responsibilities of each category of actor.
Table 2:    Potential field of intervention
Actors                           Potential field of intervention
Technical services -  inform the local and national authorities
of the State     -  facilitate co-ordination of HCWM plan activities
(MOHP / MNREA) -    supply technical expertise
- execute control and monitoring activities
- train the health staff
- supervise the training process, monitoring and evaluation
City Assemblies /  -  participate in the mobilization of populations
District         -  ensure HCW are properly disposed in their landfill
Governments      -  participate in training, monitoring and evaluation
Public health    -  participate in training activities
facilities / Private  -  supply staff with security equipment
health facilities  -  elaborate internal plans and guidelines about HCWM
- allocate financial resources for HCWM
- ensure HCW management plan is implemented
Private operators  -  invest in HCWM (eg, treatment, transport, disposal)
-  operate as sub-contractors (City Assemblies / District Govts
Health Facilities)
NGOs and CBOs    -  inform, educate and make population aware
- participate in / offer training activities
Training Institution -  provide health staff training
5.2   Involvement Of Private Companies In HCWM
HCW collection is a major concern for public and private health facilities. According to
environmental regulations, health facilities must ensure sustainable management of their
wastes. However, in practice health facilities have very limited financial resources, and
no public health establishment has funds to pay for collection or disposal services for
wastes. For health facilities having incinerators, waste collection is less of a concern. For
private facilities, the major constraints are the absence of alternative solutions to their
present practices. Most of them can't afford appropriate equipment for treatment.
Both public and private facility managers and staff express a willingness to participate in
an institutional arrangement whereby costs of treating their HCW could be shared under
a common agreement. Such a public-private partnership arrangement could be put in
place on the basis of the following principles:
-  selected public health facilities would be equipped with incinerators to serve a
defined geographic radius;
19



HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008                   Ministry of Health and Population
- health centres equipped with incinerators would agree to accept and treat HCW from
private facilities and smaller health centers within their service area;
- private health facilities receiving such HCW treatment services would agree to pay a
collection / treatment fee as per the terms of the cost sharing agreement.
Long-term private sector involvement in the HCWM business will depend on whether
national, district, and municipal governments are able to put in place self-sustaining
sources of financing to cover investment and operating costs for this critical
environmental and public health service. If the financial equation is solved, then private
sector operators can be expected to identify their individual comparative advantage and
explore contractual arrangements to provide a range of services for health facilities and
landfill sites (e.g, transport, treatment, disposal).

HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008               Ministry of Health and Population
6.0   COST OF THE HCWM PLAN
Solid waste management suffers from inadequate financing from the state and local
collectors. The financial resources for HCWM are symbolic in health centres: priority in
recurrent budgets is given to purchase of medicines and medical supplies, as opposed
to purchase of waste storage or disposal equipment. This is the reason why major
constraints are encountered at all stages of the HCWM cycle. Collectors are not
motivated, equipment is hardly replaced and collection is irregular. Without a regular
budget allocated to HCWM (mainly in health facilities) it is nearly impossible to improve
management. Without a sustainable financing mechanism for waste disposal in general,
it will not be possible to attract the private sector into playing a greater role for HCWM.
In consideration of the total absence of appropriate HCWM systems in place, the cost of
implementing this five year HCWM plan of action amounts to US$7,113,835 in total. By
area of focus the budgets have been allocated as follows in absolute figures:-
*  Institutional and legal framework  US$ 86,745.22
* Capacity building              US$ 1,103,890.00
*  Improve the delivery of HCWM  US$ 5,598,280.00
*  Public private partnership    US$ 87,920.00
*  IEC and advocacy              US$ 217,000.00
*  Monitoring and evaluation     US$ 88,500.00
Annual budgets based on targeted activities could be obtained from the five year
strategic Plan of Action Chapter 9.0

7.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
7.1   Measures For Reduction Of Incinerators And Landfill Negative Impacts
The operation of incinerators has negative impacts on environment and health.
However, the quantities of waste to be incinerated daily by each establishment are quite
small, so environmental and health impacts will not be significant and the harm caused
will not be big. Nevertheless, the following measures should be taken
* When installing incinerators inside health facility ground, a location should be
selected that is distant from the admission rooms and health care rooms
* To minimize noise disruption and smoke discomfort during working hours of the
facility, the incinerator should be operated at night
* To reduce polluting by products from solid waste incineration, non chlorine plastic
containers should be promoted, for example, they should be recommended as
dust bin for collection
* Moreover, the promotion of the use of non-chlorine plastic containers is a
recognized means of reducing the pollutant products from solid waste incineration.
In this way, they should be recommended as dustbins for waste collection.
For large central disposal sites, wire fencing and locks should be installed to reinforce
security and to minimize the access of scavengers and children. These protection
measures will allow site managers to (i) control and regulate access to the landfill, (ii)
identify the scavengers and (iii) make users aware of danger
7.2   Measures For Mitigating Negative Social Impact
Implementation of HCWM Plan might have negative social impacts on scavengers
earning their daily living at landfills. Their income may decrease with an well-organized
management of HCW, particularly when segregation is done at the source. Health
facilities should explore developing a mechanism for giving local scavengers non-
infectious reusable objects (such as empty bottles
For the populations neighboring the landfills, the risks of being driven away and resettled
in other areas are minor. Generally, these populations did not come to settle around the
landfills: instead, the disposal sites have been created inside these districts.
There are cultural issues relating to disposal of anatomical wastes (amputated body
parts, placenta, etc.), which communities may be strongly sensitive to. These cultural
aspects should be taken into account in the action plan, to better ensure the populations
involvement in the implementation. For example: the placenta could be buried or put in
septic pits, as it is the case presently in some health facilities; generally, anatomical
wastes such as the body parts are buried inside the hospital; they can also be given to
the patients or their family if they claim for it; liquid wastes from washing of the dead are
generally evacuated in septic pits. Generally, people don't find any harm in these
methods.

a. Microwave disinfection
This method is used to disinfect bio-medical waste in stationary or mobile plants. The waste is
heated by means of microwave energy. This method needs high investment and operating costs.
b. Autoclave sterilization
This type of treatment is used in health facilities (medical analysis laboratories) for the sterilization
of reusable medical equipment. In this process, a dry heat sterilizer is used and heat of 180C is
generated for 30 minutes or longer, for activating vegetative microorganisms and most bacterial
spores. This process is able to handle only limited quantities of waste and therefore is commonly
used only for highly infectious waste such as microbial cultures from clinical or research
laboratories. Autoclaving is environmentally sound, requires fairly high investment and moderate
operating costs, and ensures good disinfection efficiency under appropriate operating conditions.
However, it cannot be used for all type of waste and generates contaminated wastewater. In
addition, operation requires qualified technicians and its shredders are subject to frequent
breakdown.
c. Incineration
Waste incineration is a thermal treatment, which aims at destroying organic waste parts by
oxidation. Various types of equipment are in use:
*  Pyrolitic incinerator: This has a treatment capacity ranging from 500 to 3,000 kg wastes daily,
at a combustion temperature of 12000 or 16000 C; its initial cost is very expensive. It also needs
highly qualified staff . The remnants of wastes are sent to landfill disposal sites.
  Pyrolitic incinerator (modem incinerator): its treatment capacity is from 200 to 10,000 kg/daily,
with a combustion temperature ranging from 800 to 900 C; its requirements in terms of
investment and care taking are somewhat high; it needs qualified staff; the remnants of wastes
are sent to the landfill disposal sites.
*  Incinerator with combustion room (artisanal construction, with local materials): Its investment
and care taking costs are relatively low; it can work effectively, even with low-qualification
staff.
Incineration provides very high disinfection efficiency and drastic reduction of weight and volume
of waste. It is relatively low in cost and does not need qualified staff for operating. But it generates
significant pollutant emissions.
d. Chemical disinfection



HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008                       Ministry of Health and Population
Chemical disinfection, frequently used in health facilities to destroy microorganisms on medical
equipment, floors and walls, is now being extended to the treatment of biomedical wastes.
Chemicals are put in the waste to destroy or inactivate the pathogens. This treatment usually is
more efficient as in disinfection than in sterilization. Chemical disinfection is most suitable for
treating liquid waste such as blood, urine, stools or hospital sewage. Solid (and even highly
hazardous) biomedical wastes, including microbiological cultures, sharps, etc., may also be
disinfected chemically. Chemical products such as hypo-chlorine and other acids are used to
destroy pathogens, before wastes are burned or transported to disposal sites. The most frequent
chemical disinfectants are:
  Chlorine - which is a universal disinfectant, very active against micro-organisms. In case of
possible HIV/AIDS infectious materials, concentration of 5 g/liter (5000ppm) of chlorine is
recommended.
*  Formaldehyde - which is an active gas against all micro-organisms except at low temperature
(<20C); the relative humidity must be near 7 %. It is also sold in the form of gas dissolved in
water at concentrations of 370 g / liters. This disinfecting product is recommended for Hepatitis
and Ebola virus (but not for HIV/AIDS). The risk associated with formaldehyde is that it can
cause cancer.
The drawback of this system is that the disinfected wastes are still there and other methods of final
elimination must be devised. This method gives highly efficient disinfection in good operating
conditions, and some chemical disinfectants are relatively inexpensive. But it requires highly
qualified technicians for operating the process.
e. Burial in municipal landfills
This practice consists in disposing of HCW directly in municipal landfills. In fact, this is not a
treatment system: the wastes are stored with household wastes. This system requires very low
investments, but it presents huge health and environmental risks, in view of scavenging practices at
public landfills. However, landfilling is better than leaving hazardous wastes accumulated at
hospitals or other publicly accessible places. More suitable treatment methods should immediately
be envisaged.
f. Burial inside health facilities
Burial at the origin of HCW production - the health facility - is another form of elimination, mainly
used where there is no treatment system or means of waste transportation to public landfills. The
risk in this case is that the destruction of infected wastes is not sure, according to the burial place.
Also, there is always the risk of digging out wastes, most of all, the sharp objects.
g. Open air burning
When done in open air, the burning of HCW constitutes a factor of pollution and harm to the
environment. Since HCW is generally burned in a hole, the destruction is never complete: often the
quantity of unburned residue constitutes 70 % of the original wastes. This encourages children and
scavengers to look for toys and reusable objects.
h. Encapsulation
This method consists of disposing of wastes by filling metal or plastic containers /4 full with waste
materials and topping the container up with plastic foam, bituminous sand, cement mortar or clay
material. The process is cheap, safe and very appropriate for health centres that cannot envisage
other methods to treat sharps, chemical and pharmaceutical waste. Encapsulation is not
recommended for non-sharps infectious waste. The main advantage is to prevent the risk of
scavengers getting access to these wastes in landfills and to reduce mobilization of toxic
substances.

j. Recommendations
The comparative analysis, based oh the above mentioned economic and technical criteria, leads to
the following recommendations:
* Modem incinerators in Central / national / and district hospitals, because of its fairly low cost
and operating skills requirements;
* Local incinerators (built with local material) in health centres and urban health posts, because
of its very low cost and small quantities of HCW produced in these facilities;
*  Pit latrine in rural health posts, because of very low HCW production.
Inadequate incineration, or incineration of non- incinerable (halogenated plastic, radioactive waste,
reactive chemical waste, silver salts or radiographic waste, mercury or cadmium, heavy metals,
etc.) waste can release pollutants into the air. The incineration of materials containing chlorine can
generate dioxins and furans, which are classified as possible human carcinogens and can have other
adverse effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high metal contents (in particular:
lead, mercury and cadmium) can increase the spread of heavy metals in the environment. Dioxins,
furans and metals are persistent and remain in the environment. Materials containing chlorine or
metal should therefore not be incinerated.
To ensure that inappropriate materials are not incinerated, the waste incineration system must be
based on a strategy of segregation at source, to reduce as much as possible the infectious waste
stream and to prevent the contamination of other wastes (papers, plastic objects, etc.). All types of
wastes must not be incinerated, mainly the non-incinerable ones mentioned above.  Waste
segregation will allow the non-contaminated, non-infectious and non-incinerable wastes to be
disposed at municipal landfills. Only the contaminated wastes (needles, sharp objects, blood stained
cottons, etc.) are reserved for incineration. The latter don't produce (or produce very little) toxic
elements. In addition, this system of treatment allows a complete melting of needles, which are the
main vectors of accidental transmission of HIV/AIDS.
Modem incinerators, with special emission-treating equipment, are able to work at 800-1000 C,
and can ensure that no dioxins and furans, or only insignificant quantities are produced. Smaller
models, built with local materials and able to operate at these high temperatures are currently being
field-tested and implemented in some countries.
In the health centres, the quantities of HCW produced are insignificant. If waste segregation is
performed well, the quantities to be incinerated will be reduced and negative impacts on the
environment will be insignificant. In addition, promotion of the use of non-chlorine plastic
containers can reduce polluting by-products in solid waste incineration.
Although incineration has its critics, it is difficult to choose another system for developing
countries such as Malawi, given the economic and technical conditions. The proposal is not to
incinerate all solid urban waste (household wastes, industrial wastes, etc.), but only selected
contaminated health care wastes. Appropriate incinerator technology is supported by the WHO
elsewhere in Africa. For example, during vaccination campaigns against tuberculosis in Togo and
Benin, the WHO has supported, since 2001, a program to produce craft incinerators (made of local
materials, cement with clay), in order to destroy the syringe needles used in the vaccination
program. WHO organized a workshop in Bamako in 2001 to train some African technicians in the
building of these types of incinerators. These models can reach very high temperatures (800 C)
able to get the needles and sharp objects melted (the model is shown in annex xx).
Presently, there are no environmentally sound options at low-cost for safe disposal of infectious
wastes. Incineration of wastes has been widely practiced, but alternatives, which may be preferable
under certain circumstances, are becoming available, such as autoclaving, chemical treatment and
microwaving. Landfilling, when safely practiced, may also be a viable solution for part of the
already segregated wastes.

Disinfection is clearly the most efficient way to deal with liquid infectious wastes. That is
why this option should be favored among the other interventions, because the HCWM
plan is focused especially on HIV/AIDS related waste management. Consequently, a
combined system (disinfection then storage in septic pits) is recommended for the
provincial hospitals, district hospitals and health centres, which don't produce much liquid
waste. For the central and general hospitals, a physic and chemical treatment, comprising
a disinfection system, is recommended. The implementation of this option requires a
feasibility study.
A.2.3 Choice Of Landfill Sites
In big cities such as Lilongwe and Blantyre, incineration residues, which are considered as
household waste, can be disposed in the public municipal landfill, if specific burial areas
are prepared, mainly to receive sharp objects not melted during the process. These types
of waste hurt scavengers and street children even though they are sterilized during
incineration. At District and local level, the remaining wastes after burning can be buried
inside health centers, away from patient treatment areas
A.2.4 Decision Tree Scenario
Five scenarios have been developed to describe the context within which health care
facilities operate and must find solutions for the safe management of their wastes. The

scenarios mainly distinguish between the population density -of the area, the proximity to
modern waste treatment facilities, and whether facilities are located in urban, peri-urban
or rural environments. Five decision trees corresponding to each scenario are presented
to show treatment choices and disposal options:
*  Scenario 1 (Annex 4.1 ): Urban area with access to a modem waste treatment facility or
located reasonable distance of a larger health-care facility with treatment facility
* Scenario 2 (Annex 4.2 ): Urban area without access to modem waste treatment facility
* Scenario 3 (Annex 4.3 ): Peri-urban area
* Scenario 4 (Annex 4.4 ): Rural area without access to modem waste treatment or disposal
facility
* Scenario 5 (Annex 4.5 ): Rural area with access to modern waste treatment or
located reasonable distance of a larger health-care facility with treatment
facility.



HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008                      Ministry of Health and Population
Annex 3: Training and Public Awareness Strategy
A3.1 OBJECTIVE
Correct attitudes for effective HCWM result from knowledge and awareness regarding the potential
risk of healthcare and administrative procedures for handling the waste. Apart from a general
understanding of the requirements of waste management, each category of actors (doctors, nurses,
caretakers, ward attendants, ground workers, administrative staff, etc.) working within the health
facility has to acquire his or her own individual waste management skills. Staff cannot be assumed
to have the theoretical knowledge and practical skills, but must be taught and trained. For the
training to be successful and to lead to changed behaviour, participants must become aware of the
risks linked to HCWM.
A3.2 TARGET GROUPS
In health facilities, two target groups may be distinguished:
-      Principal group: (i) Management and administrative staff; (ii) Medical and laboratory staff;
(iii) ward attendants, caretakers, ground workers and other support staff;
-      Secondary group: Patients and visitors.
i)     Management and administrative staff
It is the task of the management to build up the awareness of waste management in each type of
health facility. However, often the management itself is not totally aware of all the risks resulting
from HCW, and in many cases does not know about appropriate waste management technologies
and procedures. Some guidance is needed before the management staff of health facilities will be
able to install a proper waste management structure and procedures.
ii)    Medical and laboratory staff
Due to their professional training, doctors, nurses and the other medical staff have the broadest
knowledge about health risks resulting from HCW. They, in turn, should create awareness among
the other members of health facility staff. Although, they may be aware of the health risks, doctors,
nurses and other medical staff also need training in proper waste management and handling
technologies and procedures.
iii)   Ward attendants, ground workers, caretakers and other support staff
Ward attendants, ground workers, caretakers, cleaners, kitchen and laundry personnel constitute
the group of people having the greatest daily contact with HCW and the least knowledge about
health risks or waste management practices. Therefore, they need extensive training and regular
supervision to ensure the desired improvement in waste management practices actually occurs.
iv)    Patients and visitors
Due to the permanent fluctuation of patients and visitors, it is virtually impossible to teach this
group of people systematically about the principles of HCWM. One possibility may be to offer
advice on basic HCWM subjects during the waiting periods. Patients and visitors should be made
aware of the proper use of waste containers to dispose of their waste. Attentive hospital staff might
guide patients and visitors from time to time regarding their waste management practices. Relevant
posters may often provide the public with additional information.



HCWM Strategic Plan of Action 2003-2008                     Ministry of Health and Population
v)     Waste Management Operators
The waste operators have a daily and direct contact with HCW because they are mainly responsible
for waste handling. For this reason, they need to be informed on risks and advised about infection
prevention and security protection.
vi)    Waste Transportation Staff
Waste transportation staff (mainly off-site transportation) need to be trained because HCW should
be collected in specific containers and specific vehicles. In addition, procedures for HCW handling
(loading and unloading) need to be known because of the special characteristics of HCW, and
because handling and transport require specific protection equipment to prevent infection by HCW.
vii)   Treatment Systems Operators              '
HCW treatment systems require specific capacities. That is why the operators in charge need to be
trained in order to master the operating process, to know health and security related to the operating
system (mainly the procedures in emergency cases), to learn how to care for the equipment.
viii) Disposal Managers
The staff (municipal staff) who manage landfills disposal need to be informed about health and
security linked to HCW. The must be aware of the necessity of protection equipment and personal
hygiene and they must control scavenging activities and recycling of used instruments inside these
specific sites.
A33    TRAINING STRATEGY
The training program aims to operationalize the HCWM plan by: promoting the emergence of
experts and professionals in HCWM; raising the sense of responsibility of people involved with
HCWM; and safeguarding health and security of health staff and waste handlers. The training
strategy will be articulated around the following principles:
-  Training trainers: this involves training the senior officer in health centres (doctors, EHO, and
technical services' supervising staff in City Assemblies).The training sessions will be held in
every health district, (5 trainers per district and LCH, for 22 districts, during 5 days, nearly 600
person/day);
-  Training health care staffs in health centres (medical staff, nurses), by the already trained senior
staff member. These training sessions will be held District by District and will be performed by
the already trained key staff ( 40 participants for each district and LCH, during 3 days, nearly
3000 person/days);
-  Training HCWM    supporting staffs in health centres (ward attendants, ground workers,
cleaners). These training sessions will be held in health centres and will be performed by
already trained key staff (3000 person/days, with 3 agents during 2 days, for nearly 500 health
facilities).
The training modules will deal with risks in the handling of HCW : sustainable management
process (collection, storage, transportation, treatment, disposal) ; good behaviors and practices;
caring for installations; protection measures. The training of medical and paramedical staff remains
a priority if the program is to have a major impact on HCWM. The recommended content of these
training modules is presented below:

A.3.4 Population Awareness Strategy
The awareness raising strategy will aim at the general public and scavengers. They must be
informed about dangers in HCW handling. This objective can be achieved through information and
awareness campaigns on local radio (120 messages, 2 message per month, durant 5 years) and
television (30 messages, 6 messages per year, during 5 years), but mostly, by animation sessions in
popular districts, organized by NGOs and CBOs active in health and environment management
(nearly 110 animations, 5 per district x 22 districts). These actions can be reinforced by education
campaigns (1000 posters, 20 unit for 500 health facilities) in health facilities in other highly
frequented places.
Another concern is to ensure that HCW from home care'are well-managed. In fact, advances in
medicine now allow monitoring family health and treating some sickness at home. Such activities
have the effect of introducing infectious wastes closer to households. These health care wastes
include: used needles, syringes and lancets, medicine unused or outdated, broken thermometers,
etc. They must also be managed at home where health care is practiced, to avoid their mingling
with household wastes and increasing hazardous risks. For example, it is noticed that razor blades
are widely used at home (scarification, etc.) and they can be sources of infection if they are not well
managed. For this reason, it is necessary to elaborate information and awareness programs (radio or
televised) towards the health agents (professionals, traditional, and family members) who exercise
in the home. The targeted actors must be advised to have specific containers for needles, sharp
objects (box, empty bottles, etc.) and other HCW (cotton, gloves, bandages, etc.) and not to mix the
HCW with the general household or office wastes.
Used needles, syringes, lancets and other sharps may be safely disposed with other home solid
wastes, provided that special care is taken while packaging them. The safe packaging of these
wastes may be done very simply at home: one can use rigid plastic bottles (with a tight fitting lid),
such as empty laundry detergent bottle; and one must not put sharp objects in any container to be
recycled or returned to a store; needles and syringes don't need to be recapped. The rigid bottle will
minimize possible needle pricks and when they are full, the lid should be tightly fixed and the
bottle placed with other solid waste for disposal.
Unused and outdated medicines stored at home are considerable risks for children and careless
people. These medicines may be safely disposed by throwing them into a flushing toilet. A
thorough cleansing of empty medicine containers with warm water should then be done. After that,
close the lid tightly and dispose with other home solid waste. Medicines should be out of reach of
children who should not play with unclean empty medicine containers.
Contaminated bandages, pads, gloves, etc., may be double bagged in standard plastic waste bags
and securely fastened. This material may then be combined with other household waste for
disposal.
Condoms are not considered as Health Care Waste (they are protective materials against HIV/AIDS
infection). It is possible, in the programs for public awareness raising, to draw people's attention to
the necessity of managing these wastes well: condoms should not be dropped anywhere; after use,
they should be disposed of by throwing them into flushing toilets, burying them safely, or double-
bagging them in standard plastic waste bags (securely fastened) for combination with other
household waste disposal.
Health agents (both formal and informal) who exercise at home must have collection containers,
