PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
MIHO WATERSHED AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1319-KO)
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT STAGE II (LOAN 1364-KO)
PREFACE
This is a completion report (PCR) of two irrigation projects in
Korea:  the Miho Watershed Area Development Project, for which Loan 1319-KO
was approved on July 27, 1976, in the amount of US$75.0 million, and the Yong
San Gang Irrigation Project Stage II, for which Loan 1364-KO was approved on
January 25, 1977, in the amount of US$95.0 million.   The two loans were
closed on December 31, 1984, after cancellation of US$4,000 and US$5,000
respectively.
A PCR was prepared for each of the two projects by the East Asia
and Pacific Regional Office.   The PCRs are based on the Appraisal Reports
(No. 1130a-KO and 1247-KO, dated July 8, 1976 and January 3, 1977), the
President's Reports, the Loan Agreements dated August 1976 and February 1977,
and the relevant Bank files and information provided by the Agricultural
Development Corporation (ADC), the implementing agency.   The two PCRs have
been combined in one report as the projects are similar in nature, have been
affected by similar problems and give rise to similar lessons.
The projects were not selected for audit by OED as their most
important findings and lessons are similar to those noted in the first Yong
San Gang Irrigation PPAR and the Rural Infrastructure Project II PPAR now
under preparation.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower on February 24, 1986, for
comments. A telex received from the Borrower stating their satisfaction with
the report is attached as Annex I.
The assistance provided during the preparation of this report by
the Government of Korea and the staff of ADC is gratefully acknowledged.

KOREA
MIHO WATERSHED AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1319-KO)
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT STAGE II (LOAN 1364-KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The main objectives of the Korean Government for the agricultural
sector during the past decade have been a high level of self-sufficiency in
food, equality of farm and non-farm household incomes and minimal seasonal
fluctuation in producer and consumer prices for agricultural products.   In
order to achieve its objectives, the Government has supported investments in
irrigation and land development, introduced farm price supports and imposed
restrictions or bans e. imports of many agricultural products.
Objectives
The two projects aimed at developing areas of rainfed or unculti-
vated land through the construction of irrigation facilities.   The Miho
Watershed Area Development Project, located in the center of the country,
consisted mostly of: the construction of dams and canals to irrigate 8,315 ha
in five different subprojects; the conversion of 2,045 ha of cultivated up-
land to paddy fields; land consolidation; improvement of river channels and
construction of village access roads.  Total project cost was estimated at
US$75.0 million to be disbursed over 6 years. The Yong San Gang Irrigation
Project Stage II was the continuation of a first project aiming at developing
the Yong San Gang basin in the southwest of the country, and comprised the
following components:   construction of an estuary dam (4,500 m long) and a
sea dike (4,000 m long);  construction of irrigation facilities including
pumping stations and canals to serve about 20,000 ha; land consolidation,
land reclamation, and construction of roads and project buildings.   Total
project cost was estimated at US$167.0 million, to be disbursed over 7 years.
Implementation Experience
Soon after project start-up, changes were introduced in the scope
of the Miho Watershed Area Development Project:  the total project area was
reduced from 12,665 ha to 11,137 ha, while the area to be provided with irri-
gation was increased from 8,315 ha to 10,910 ha. The land consolidation pro-
gram was considered uneconomic  and deleted.   Changes in the number and
locations of dams were made, both on technical and economic grounds.   The
total length of canals was increased and the area of upland to be converted
to paddy fields was reduced.   Construction of project works was delayed
mostly by Government's difficulties in maintaining adequate budget alloca-
tions and low priority being given to the project as self-sufficiency in



cereals was nearly attained.   Final construction, which was expected to be
completed by December 1981, is not likely to be completed before December
1988. When the loan was closed in December 1984, only 64% of the total proj-
ect area was developed. Total project costs on completion are now estimated
at US$140.3 million, a 185% cost overrun, partly due to inflation and higher
unit costs.
Construction of the Yong San Gang Project was also delayed by Gov-
ernment's insufficient budget allocations, and the low priority given to the
project. The construction of the estuary dam and the sea dike was completed
in 1982. Changes in project design were introduced for the pumping stations,
irrigation canals, land development works and tidal land reclamation.   The
area to be developed was reduced by about 20%.  Current estimates indicate
that the final construction is not likely to be completed until December 1989
instead of December 1983, at a total cost of US$318.7 million, a 190% cost
overrun due to higher unit costs and inflation. When the loan was closed on
December 31, 1984, about 50% of the project area was equipped with irrigation
facilities.
Both projects were executed by the Agricultural Development Corpor-
ation (ADC), a semi-autonomous authority within the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries. ADC's performance was of high standard. Project works were
well designed and properly constructed. Problems of delays and cost overruns
have resulted from inadequate funding, a factor beyond the control of ADC's
management.
Results
As there were changes in the project descriptions and scopes during
project implementation, the actual crop development has not taken place as
originally envisaged. In the Miho Watershed Project, rice and barley produc-
tion increased by 75% and 340% in the three completed subprojects due to an
increase in cropping intensity and higher yields for rice. However, use of
high-yield varieties (HYVs) of rice has been less than expected because of
consumer preference for, and higher per-hectare return of traditional rice.
Farmers' incomes are about 23% higher than without the project, but less than
anticipated (59%).
Based on the cropping pattern and yields of the three completed
subprojects, the overall project ERR is now estimated at 7%, compared with an
appraisal estimate of 15%.  The main factors contributing to this marginal
ERR are: implementation delays, high cost overrun and reduction of the proj-
ect scope.  Although its economic viability is low, the project has made a
valuable contribution towards the development of the Miho Watershed Area and
had a sigrificant institutional impact as ADC has gained technical experience
in dam construction.
As for the Miho Watershed Project, investments of the Yong San Gang
Project were expected to increase production of rice and barley by about
300%. However, the expected change in land use has not been realized because
of the delay in project implementation.   The use of HYVs of rice has been
less than expected.   There has been some diversification of winter crops,



- vi -
resulting in increased cropping intensity, and yields of rice have increased
significantly.  Overall CrOp production increased by 163% for rice and 19%
for barley.   The farmers' net incomes have increased by 27%, compared with
42% estimated at appraisal. The constructiov. of the estuary dam, with a road
on top, has generated transport benefits not estimated &t appraisal.   The
project ERR, which was estimated at 13% at appraisal is now estimated at 8.5%
if transport benefits are accounted for, or 5% if they are excluded.   The
main reasons for this poor performance are similar to those of the Miho
Watershed Project. A significant achievement of the project, however, is the
successful completion of the estuary dam, the key to the development of the
lower Yong San Gang basin.
Sustainability
The benefits of the two projects are likely to be sustained as the
beneficiaries have shown their ability to obtain high yields earlier than
expected and to diversify their traditional cropping pattern. Korea has also
a good record of adequate operation and maintenance and cost recovery of
irrigation projects.
Findings and Lessons
The two projects have shown a similar pattern of implementation
delays, reduction of scope and large cost overruns, resulting in low
cost-effectiveness and marginal rates of return.
The major lessons of the projects are that:
(a) final designs of engineering works have to be prepared before loan
negotiations;
(b) commitment from the Borrower to allocate necessary funds for
project implementation should be obtained; and
(c) chances of securing agreement for the execution of the components
that require farmers' consent should be carefully assessed.

MIHO WATERSHED AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1319-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The Republic of Korea (ROK) has achieved one of the most impressive
economic growth records (average annual growth from 1960 to 1982 of 8%),
transforming itself over the past three decades from a poor, densely-
populated, and resource-scarce country into an industrial nation and one in
which the benefits of growth have been widely distributed. The agricultural
sector has contributed substantially to this achievement. During this period
ROK's agricultural policies have emphasised investment in irrigation and
land development, introduced farm price supports and imposed quantitative
restrictions or b&ns on imports of many agricultural products. These have
helped to achieve the major objectives set for the agricultural sector,
which  include  maintenance  of  high  levels  of  self-sufficiency  in most
foodstuffs that can be produced domestically, near equality of farm and non-
farm household incomes and minimal seasonal fluctuation in producer and
consumer prices for agricultural products. This supportive and protective
environment has allowed food prices to rise increasingly above international
levels.
1.2      As set out in  Table  1,  over  the  past  decade  the  sector  has
undergone many changes. More important among these have been closer
integration  of  farm  households  into  the  cash   economy,   rapid   farm
mechanisation, a decline in the importance of agriculture relative to other
sectors in terms of both employment and gross product and almost full
development of the country's land and water resources.
1.3      ROK   recognises  that  continuing  past  policies  would  lead  to
persistent agricultural surplus particularly of rice. To sustain its income
equality objectives, commodity price supports would probably have to be
maintained at levels that would probably lead to increasing Government
subsidies and/or consumer prices for food. Moreover, because the most
attractive and least costly investments have already been undertaken (with
financing from domestic as well as external sources, Table 2) further water
and land development would entail more costly and lower return resource
development. These factors in combination with changing conditions economy-
wide suggest a need for policy changes.
1.4      The Bank has been associated with the irrigation  sub-sector  since
May 1969 when it approved a loan of US$45 M for Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation
Project (Loan 600-KO). This was followed by Yong San Gang Irrigation Project
Stage I (Loan 795/Credit 283-KO) for US$48 M , Rural Infrastructure I
Project  (Loans  1216  and  1218T-KO)  for  US$60 M, Miho   Watershed   Area
Development Project (Loan 1319-KO) for USS29 M, Yong San Gang Irrigation
Project Stage II (Loan 1364-KO) for US$95 M, Rural Infrastructure II Project
(Loan 1530-KO) for US$95 M, and Ogseo Area Development Project (Loan 1503-
KO)   for US$36 M.



-2-
1.5      The Miho Watershed Area Development Project, the  subject  of  this
completion  report,  was designed to provide irrigation and land development
for some 12,700 ha at a total project cost of US$75 M, with the objectives
of increasing self-sufficiency in rice and barley and improving the incomes
and living standards of the farming population.
1.6      The report is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (1130
a-KO) dated 8 July 1976; the loan agreement dated 5 August 1976 together
with information obtained from the Agricultural Development Corporation
(ADC) the implementing agency; a review of supervision reports and project
files; field visits in March and September 1985 to selected project sites;
discussions with project staff in ADC and the staff of local offices of the
Office  of  Rural  Oevelopment  (ORD),  National  Agricultural   Cooperative
Federation   (NACF)   and  Farmland  Improvement  Associations  (FLIA);  and
interviews with Bank staff who have been associated with the project.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification
2.1      In  line with its rural development policies, the Government during
the 1970s placed an emphasis on land and water development in the interior
regions of Korea. Two approaches have been followed. One was a nationwide
programme of minor irrigation projects and upland reclamation as part of the
Saemaeul Movement. These activities were supported by the Bank under the
Rural Infrastructure Projects I and II (see para 1.4). The second approach,
typified by the Miho project, was area specific and involved the execution
of larger and more complex project components than would be appropriate for
implementation under the Saemaeul Movement. The Miho Watershed was selected
as being broadly typical of the interior regions of Korea in terms of
topography, present land use and potential for further development.
2.2      The  concept  of  comprehensive  development  of selected areas was
introduced to Korea by two UNDP-assisted studies for which FAO was the
executing  agency.   These  studies  span  11 years in all,  the first study
(ROK 7) from 1962-1967, which dealt mainly with upland reclamation and
management; and the second study (ROK 67/522) from 1967 to 1973, which had a
broader objective of comprehensive development of the physical and human
resources of selected watersheds. The latter study produced 15 volumes of
working papers one on each component of the development programme - pasture,
small dams, upland reclamation, channel improvement, fish ponds, community
development and so on in addition to some more generalised studies of
hydrology   and   economic   evaluation.  UNDP/FAO  experts  and  Government
counterpart staff evolved procedures for resource inventories and project
formulation and in addition, implemented several small watershed projects.
2.3      The Bank's interest in comprehensive watershed development in Korea
stems largely from the 1973 Agricultural Sector Survey 1/ which recommended
that an area and regional development approach be adopted in planning and
carrying out projects to raise agricultural productivity and to improve
rural incomes. In its tentative list of projects for external financing, the
Sector 'mission included two watershed development projects.
1/ Report No.2139-KO dated 13 November 1973.



-3-
Preparation
2.4      As  a  follow-up  to these recommendations, the Office of Watershed
Development (OWO) in the Agricultural Development Corporation carried out
the  feasibility study - "Comprehensive Development of the Naeseong and Miho
Watershed" April 1975 - which provided the basis for the Miho  project.  OWD
was assisted by consultants who had formerly worked on the two UNDP
projects. {he feasibility study was begun in late 1973, partly financed by
the Bank under the Seeds Project (Loan 942-KO) and partly by UNOP. In April
1974, focus of the Bank project was  changed  from  two  watersheds  in  the
Nakdong basins to one each in the Nakdong and Kumgang basins, that is
Naeseong and Miho Watersheds. The study, was completed in April 1975.
However, development of the Naeseong Watershed area was deferred due to
budgetary considerations.
Pre-appraisal
2.5      Project  poposals contained in the feasibility report were reviewed
by a pre-appraisal mission which visited Korea in July 1975. The project, as
originally proposed, envisaged a comprehensive and integrated approach to
area development. Thus, in addition to works designed to increase crop
production through irrigation and land development, the project included
other components such as village water supply, rural electrification,
pasture development for beef cattle, village credit cooperatives, fuelwood
plantations and erosion control on small areas of uncultivable mountain
side. Implementation of such a project would have required the creation of
either an independent project authority or special arrangements for inter-
agency   coordination.   The  risks  inherent  in  such  new  organizational
arrangements did not appear commensurate with the eventual benefits expected
from a number of diverse components. The benefits of increased crop
production from irrigation and land development could still be realised
without a pa-allel programme to provide such amenities as electricity and
village water supplies. Moreover, the pre-appraisal mission found that
certain components would readily be implemented under on-going Government
programmes (village water supply, rural electrification andw fuelwood
plantations)  and  others could not be economically or technically justified
(pasture development and erosion control). The project was therefore revised
*                by  the  mission  in  discussion  with  the Government to include only those
elements  which  would  have  the  primary  objective  of   increased   crop
production.  Further  studies  were then made by the OWD on designs and cost
estimates for the various project co;mlponents.
2.6      The mission suggested that the  project   include  an  agricultural
extension   component  aimed  primarily  at  increasing  production  on  the
cultivated uplands which had been largely ignored in  the  original  project
proposal. ORD presented an outline propnsal for farmer training as well as a
scheme for-small farmer credit throLgh establishment of revolving funds
administered by village committees under ORD supervision. The Economic
Planning Board did not favour financing the extension component because the
loan would be made to ADC and involvement by another agency would lead to
coordination problems. However, there was agreement that the ORD proposal
would be implemented under the Government's on-going programme. The problem
of credit  (for  more  intensive  cultivation  of  upland  areas)  was  left
unresolved as this has to be reviewed in the context of Bank's agricultural
credit operations in Korea.



-4-
Appraisal
2.7      A Bank mission visited Korea  in  November  1975  to  complete  the
appraisal. It endorsed the revised powposals with some minor changes. These-
included an additional component for ^-rveys and mapping; and reduction in
channel improvement from 148 km to 80 km. An issue raised at appraisal was
the Government's  request  that  the  proposed  loan  include  financing  of
interest  during  construction  as  in  the  case  of previous loans to ADC.
However, this was not acceded to by the Bank.
Project Description
2.8      The  project,  as  planned  at  appraisal,  comprised the following
components:
a) construction of dams and canals to irrigate 8,315 ha;
b) conversion of 2,045 ha of cultivated upland to irrigated paddy
fields in areas commanded by the above canals;
c) land consolidation, including construction of ditches, drains and
farm roads together with land levelling and boundary realignment on
4,600 ha (3,150 ha on presently irrigated land and 1,450 ha in
areas to be irrigated by the project);
d) development of 495 ha for irrigation of upland crops, and 550 ha
for orchards within the area to be irrigated;
e) upland reclamation, primarily bench-terracing, of 1,200 ha of
presently uncultivated land;
f) improvement of 80 km of river channels to increase their flood
discharge capacity;
g) construction of about 150 km of village access roads;
h) aerial photography, surveys, and mapping for the design of project
works; and
i) provision of technical assistance, procurement of vehicles, and a
feasibility study for a second-stage project in the Miho Watershed.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Negotiations and Effectiveness
3.1      The negotiations for the loan took place during  17-22  June  1976.
The Bank's Board of Directors approved the loan on 27 July 1976. The loan
was signed on 5 August 1976 and became effective on 21 October 1976.

The Project Area
3.2      The project area of 12,665 ha anticipated at appraisal was part  of
the Miho Watershed, encompassing sections of 3 counties in Chungcheon Bug-
province. The project was originally divided geographically into 5 divisions
for purposes of design and construction - Kumwang, Maengdong, Weonnam,
Baegkok and Kwanghae. During implementation, Weonnam and Baegkok divisions
were sub-divided making in all 8 sub-projects, each to be constructed under
separate contracts. This was done partly to allow effective use of the
limited budget allocations granted to ADC by the Government. Each sub-
project comprised storage dams, canals, land consolIdatiOn and conversion of
upland to paddy (Table 3).
Project Changes after Appraisal
3.3      During  implementation  the  projected  benefit  area  was  revised
froml2,665 ha to 11,137 ha. Similarly the area pf rainfed cropland to be
provided with irrigation was revised from 8,315 ha to 10,910 ha. The
shortfall in the benefit area was mainly duet to the deletion of land
consolidation, which, because of rapid price escalation in construction
costs, had become uneconomic. Furthermore, surveys for Sub-project I and II
revealed that local development had already started on bench terracing of
uplands for rice paddies. ADC had therefore proposed and the Bank agreed to
the plan to convert to paddy 2,245 ha of uplands which were proposed at
appraisal to be developed for furrow irrigation (495 ha), orchards (550 ha)
and upland reclamation (1,200 ha). The changes in area and location are
further discussed in paras 5.4 to 5.6. The planned and revised project areas
are shown below.

Implementation Schedule
3.5      Appraisal  estimated  construction to be completed by Oecember 1981
with a project closing date of December 1982. Current estimates indicate
that final construction is not likely to be completed until December 1988,-
although the loan was closed on 31.12.84. Because of long delays in
implementation, loan disbursements were limited to three of the five sub-
projects.
3.6      The first year was expected to be taken up by purchase of right-of-
way, preparation of designs and contract documents, and award of contracts.
Construction of the project works was scheduled to begin in October 1977 and
all works completed by mid-1981. As shown in Tables 3 and 4. Sub-projects 1,
II IV-1 have been substantially completed. However, some land consolidation
work still remains to be done in these sub-projects. Sub-projects IV-3 and
III-1 are expected to be completed in November 1985 and December 1985
respectively, while Sub-projects III-2 in February/December 1987 and Sub-
project V in August 1988. Completed sub-projects in 1984 have an area of
7,180 ha accounting for 64% of the revised total project area of 11,137 ha.
3.7      Delays   in   implementation   were  primarily  attributed  to  the
Government's difficulties in maintain'ng adequate budget allocations to ADC
due to rapid inflation in the early years of the project. Between 1976 and
1981 the wholesale price index has more than doubled. Thereafter inflation
dramatically dropped to about 2%. But by 1982, self-sufficiency in cereals
was nearly attained resulting in low priority being given by the Government
on such projects. Annual shortfalls in budget allocations have thus risen
from Won2.9 billion in 1977 to W5,8 billion in 1985 (Table 5).
Project Cost
3.8      Table  6  gives a comparative statement of appraisal cost estimates
and actual costs up to 31.12.84, while Table 7 relates total appraisal cost
estimates to final costs.
3.9      The  total  cost  of  the  project,  on completion, would be W103.9
billion (US$140.3 M) compared to W36.4 billion (US$75 M), a 185% cost
overrun.  Expressed  in  dollars, which reflects the depreciation of the Won
(75% over the period 1976-85), the total overrun would be 87% (Table 7). As
is  seen  in  Table  8,  the  overrun  was  primarily due to sharp inflation
particularly during the early stages of the project.
3.10     The major part of the cost increase was attributable  to  dams  and
canals, whose cost in Won terms increased by 202% over the appraisal
estimates, accounting for 57% 1/ of total project costs compared to 47% at
appraisal. Expressed on a per hectare basis, the cost of dams and canals was
US$6,300  per  ha  or  about  48%  above  the   appraisal   estimate.   Land
consolidation works finally affected only 1,740 ha compared with 4,600 ha.
Therefore although per unit cost increased sixfold, the total cost of the
component was only 171% higher than the appraisal estimate. Compensation
costs for right of way increased by 311% mainly due to price escalation
resulting from delayed land purchase which was, in turn, due to insufficient
budget allocation. The engineering and administrative expenses increased by
288% above the appraised estimate.

Implementation of Individual Project Components
3.11     During project implementation, changes in the number and  locations-
of dams were made partly on technical grounds, but mostly because of
excessive cost and limited local funding. These changes have in turn,
influenced the extent of benefit area, details of which are set out in Table
4 and Map 1. At appraisal, 6 big dams 1/ and 22 small dams and weirs were
proposed to serve 8,315 ha. During the course of implementation, these were
revised to 7 big dams and 10 small dams and weirs serving 10,910 ha. By
December 1984, a total of 7 main dams and 4 minor small dams and weirs had
been constructed serving 8,186 ha. These areas include 2,000 ha from the
Miho dam in the Weonnam division that was not financed by the Bank loan, and
around 1,300 ha serviced by pumping water from the Baegkok dam (Division IV)
which was not foreseen at appraisal (see Table 4).
3.12     Minor  dams and weirs.  The main changes in the number and location
of these structures were made after more detailed data became available
through  on-going  surveys.  As  implementation was delayed and construction
prices rose sharply, first, all dams that served less than 50 ha were
deleted from the programme, consistent with Government policy that the
development of such schemes were the responsibility of the local authority.
Secondly, some minor dams had to be cancelled where higher construction cost
led to such an increase In anticipated water charges that no approval could
be obtained from the farmers involved. To start construction, this approval
is required as 30% of the investment costs has to be recovered through water
charges. The original target of 22 minor dams and weirs was consequently
changed to 10 minor dams and weirs. Of these, four had been completed by
December 1984.
3.13     Main Dams:  Principal deviations from the original plans formulated
at the time of appraisal were:
I) Kumwanq division. Instead of two big dams, three smaller dams were
built by nterconnected tunnels. This promised to be a cheaper
alternative. As shown in Table 8 the overall cost increase of this
sub-project of Won4.5 billion can be seen to be largely attributed
to price increases (Won4.2 billion and only partly to design
modifications (WonO.3 billion). The major part of this 0.3 billion
is due to an increase of canal length from 59 km to 90 km and
extensive use of concrete lining.
ii) Maengdong  division.   Longer  canals and more concrete lining made
sub-project 1 more expensive but cancellation of a minor dam (Dong
Eum) that was originally included, resulted in an overall price
i4hcrease less than price escalation for this sub-project as a
whole.
iii) Baekqok division. An existing dam of 13 m height without central
core had to be raised to 22 m, requiring insertion of an
impermeable core. On-going irrigation could not be interupted and
full-floodspill capacity had to be maintained throughout the
construction period. Ultimately an almost complete new dam body
behind the old one, was constructed at 27 m height. This allowed
for an increase in irrigation capacity from 1,605 ha at appraisal
to 3,074 ha (Table 4).

iv' Weonnam division. At the time of appraisal, the Weonnam darm in
Weonnam division and the Maengdong dams no. 1 and 2 in Maengdong
division (see Map), were planned to be constructed in the catchment
area of the old Miho dam. 1/ This would reduce the inflow into the
old  Miho  reservoir  but  this  reduction  would  be   more   than
compensated   for  by  the  combined  capacity  of  the  three  new
reservoirs.  In  addition  to  this,  ADC,  however  took  up   the
construction of yet another (smal'i) dam in the Miho catchment, 2/
that was not foreseen at appraisal. 'he Bank consequently excluded
the Weonnam dam from financing, leaving ADC to find its own funds
to construct a new Miho dam, 2 km downstream from the old one.
3.14     Canals.   The  total  length  of  canals  increased  from 270 km at
appraisal to 283 km, in December 1984 and is expected to reach  414  km,  at
completion of the project in 1988. Instead of the originally appraised 8,315
ha, ultimately 10,910 ha will then be under command (Table 4). To reduce
maintenance, and to simplify operation of the system, extensive use has been
made of concrete conducts. The detailed data to determine to what extent
this particular deviation from the original design contributed to the higher
costs were not available.
3.15     Conversion to paddy. development of furrow irrigation,  and  upland
reclamation for which the farmers had to contribute 50 % of the costs were
only partly accepted by the farmers. Orchard land development was not
executed  under the project as the  farmers had  already developed tubewells
for this purpose. (Table 4).
3.16     Of the 150 km of village access roads proposed at appraisal only 11
km were built. Budgetary problems and lower priority were main re3sons for
the shortfall.
3.17     From the 4,650 ha of land consolidation  a total of 1,138  ha  have
been implemented, mainly because MAF did not accept land consolidation with
project funds in FLIA areas. This was not foreseen at appraisal. Channel
improvement formed part of the land consolidation programme and was
consequently limited from 80 km to 19 km.
3.18     Technical Cooperation Agreement with  an  international  consulting
firm allowed for assistance and training in design through interchange of
staff by ADC and the firm. In 1981 ADC finished a feasibility study of Miho
II while survey and mapping was done through local agencies. Standard of
consultancy services was good. No special difficulties were encountered
other than delays for budgetary reasons. ADC's standard of engineering both
in designs and execution remained high.
Project Financing
3.19     The Bank was expected to finance 39% of the total project cost with
a loan bf US$29M representing the foreign exchange component; the balance
61% was to be met by Government contribution. Because of considerable cost
overruns, loan disbursements ultimately covered only 21% of the total cost.
The final disbursement was made in July 1984, and a loan balance of US$3,740

was cancelled effective 1 March 1985. Loan disbursements were far behind
schedule until 1980, but following concerted efforts by Bank supervision
missions it gathered momentum in 1981 and 1982 (Table 9).
Amendments to Loan Agreement and Loan Allocation
3.20     At the borrower's request several amendments were made to the  loan
agreement in line with the changing needs of the project. These included
addition of a feasibility study for Naeseong Watershed, a change in
disbursement rate, and reallocation of loan proceeds. The disbursement rate
for civil works was increased from 40% to 65% for the period from June 1980
to November 1982 as a temporary measure to compensate for the budgetary
shortfall. In addition, ADC requested reallocation of the proceeds of the
loan in August 1982 and March 1983 using unallocated funds and transfer
between categories 1, 2 and 3. A comparison of the planned and revised
allocation, and actual disbursements reflecting these changes are given

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
The Agricultural Development Corporation
4.1      The  Agricultural  Development Corporation, the implementing agency
of the project, is a semi-autonomous authority within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF). It was founded in 1940 as the Korean Union
of Irrigation Associations and reorganised into the present Corporation in
February 1970. The main activities of the ADC are the promotion of
agriculture through development of land and water resources, and the
provision of technical assistance to Farmland Improvement Associations. ADC
is managed by a President assisted by a Vice-president and a six-man Board
of Directors. There are three executive directors (Administration, Project
Implementation and Technology). The Corporation has a staff of some 1,834
individuals composed of irrigation engineers (1,022), mechanical engineers
(33), architectural engineers (10) electrical engineers (31), geologist and
hydrogeologist (110), economists (19), agronomists (50), pedologists (26),
administrative and other support staff (533), serving headquarters, 9
provincial   offices,   and   7  project  offices  (see  Chart).  Since  its
reorganization in 1970, ADC has completed eight large scale comprehensive
agricultural   development  projects.  Its  on-going  portfolio  includes  7
comprehensive and 91 medium-scale agricultural development projects.
4.2      A project office was established in Cheonju, the provincial capital
of project province, with project funds under the direct supervision of the
Director of Project Implementation and made responsible for design and
supervision of construction for the Miho project. The project manager and
other staff were appointed at the beginning of project implementation.
4.3      As expected  at  appraisal,  ADC's  performance  in  executing  the
project  was  of  a  high  standard.  This  was mainly due to the stability,
continuity and competence of project management. However, as in other
projects, ADC has however faced problems concerned mainly with delays and
cost overruns. These problems have resulted mostly from inadequate funding,
a factor beyond the control of ADC's management.
4.4    - A  side  effect  of  funding  difficulties  is  seen  in  declining
financial performance as evidenced by the slow completion of contracts in
progress  which increased from W448 billion in 1982 to W576 billion in 1984,
and falling profitability as measured by the ratio of operating profit to
operating assets (see Tables 10 and 11). The Corporation which had earned an
operating profit of Wl billion in 1982 and W1.6 billion in 1983 barely
managed to break even in 1984. Over 60% of ADC's long-term funds has come as
advances for work carried out on behalf of the Government.
4.5      Experience gained in Miho and other projects  has  enabled  ADC  to
undertake with success, consulting services in about 9 countries, preparing
feasibility studies of its own projects, and conducting technical training
programmes in the field of agricultural engineering and water management for
some 460 participants from about 27 countries.
4.6      ADC's analysis of projects could be strengthened by  improving  the
method and data base of economic analysis as currently practised. To
illustrate, the economic price of rice is derived based on Thai rice
(polished) to which are added inappropriate costs such as polishing costs
and interest on loans. This procedure overstates the projected price thereby



- 11 -
distorting investment decisions. Also the economic data are not routinely
updated. ADC is r,w aware of these shortcomings and can be expected to take
corrective measures speedily, given the competence of its staff.
Consulting Services
4.7      After  some  delays,  ADC  entered   into   technical   cooperation
agreements with an international consulting firm for reviewing dam and canal
designs. It made good use of the consultants in the design and construction
of these structures.
Procurement
4.8      Following implementation of several Bank-financed  projects,  ADC's
procurement procedures became well established and coordinated with the
Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea (OSROK). Consequently, no major
difficulties were encountered in meeting the requirements of 'Bank Group
Guidelines for Procurement'. The successful contractors for the civil works
were all Korean firms.
Operation and Maintenance
4.9      Until 1979, after completion of a project, ADC turned over as  soon
as possible all the constructed facilities of the project to the Local
Farmland  Improvement  Association.  Since  1980,  ADC  has   operated   and
maintained all the facilities of the newly implemented projects for a period
ranging from 2 to 5 years. Under the project only Sub-project I has so far
been transferred. This was taken over by E4m Sung FLIA in January 1983.
4.10     FLIAs  are  parastatal bodies set up by and responsible to the MAF.
Their job is to operate and maintain systems above 50 ha, to improve
paddylands under the system and to cover costs bv collecting charges from
the beneficiaries. The Eum Sung FLIA's current performance indicates that
works are being maintained satisfactorily and that cost recovery is almost
100%.
Training
4.11     Although  no  specific  arrangements  were  made  for  provision of
training under tne project, ADC's regular training activities proved to be
adequate. After the establishment of its Training Institute in 1977, about
5,200 ADC staff members have received training in the field of irrigation,
drainage   improvement,  agronomy,  mechanical  engineering,  geology,  soil
sciences  and  administration.  In  addition,  ADC  has  provided  technical
training  to  over 3,500 persons from FLIAs and an unspecified number of HNG
leaders.
Accounting and Reporting
4.12     AOC  has  maintained project accounts in a satisfactory manner, and;---
as required under the Loan Agreement, had its final accounts for each fiscal
year audited by a recognised firm of chartered accountants who have issued
unqualified reports.



- 12 -
4.13     Quarterly reporting on physical  and  financial  progress  followed
practices and formats established under Yong San Gang Irrigation Project-
Stage I. The reports were submitted regularly but were found to be
lnadequate. Bank supervision (August 1978) suggested certain improvements
and provided sample formats indicating the information to be included. A
quantitative analysis of agricultural performance was also requested to be
compiled in the annual report for the project. ADC saw the advantages of
these improvements and implemented the changes as suggested by the Bank.
Agricultural Inputs and Supporting Services
4.14     Progress in the irrigation development under the project caused  an
increase in the use of farm inputs. As shown in Table 12, powertillers
utilised in the area increased over the period 1977-1983 from 3,244 to
11,623, tractors from 24 to 107, power sprayers from 2,501 to 5,928, combine
harvesters from 1 to 80, binders from 40 to 175, and transplanters from 4 to
637. Fertilizer use (NPK) has increased from a total of 17,354 MT in 1977
peaking  in  1979  at  23,265  MT.  Reflecting  the  decline  in  HYV   rice
cultivation,  fertilizer  use  dropped  to  17,730 MT in 1981 and further to
14,126 MT in 1983,  consistent  with  the  national  trend.  The  supply  of
agricultural chemicals increased from 766 MT in 1977 to 987 MT in 1983.
4.15     Agricultural  services  in  the  area  are  well organised and have
adequately supported the farmers  in  realising  the  benefits  of  improved
irrigation and land development. The Office of Rural Development (ORD), a
department of MAF, is responsible for research and agricultural extension
services. Although the number of extension agents have not been increased in
the area, services available to the farmers are considered adequate given
the high level of efficiency of Korean agricultural agents and responsive
and  market-oriented  farmers.   The   National   Agricultural   Cooperative
Federation (NACF) has been active in the area supplying agricultural credit,
marketing farm products and inputs and providing storage. Loans extended by
NACF have increased enabling farmers to purchase the needed inputs.
Farmers' Organizations
4.16     Farmers' organizations in the project area  consisted  of  3  FLIAs
with 17,125 farmers, 211 Heung Nong Gye (HNG) with 6,879 members, and 27
agricultural cooperatives with 38,174 farmers (Table 13). Of the three
FLIAs, the Eum Sung FLIA had taken over for the operation and maintenance of
Sub-project I. A total of 166 HNGs were formed from the beginning of the
project. The HNG, a voluntary organization of farmers' action groups each
comprising about 30 farmers, supports FLIA activities such as equitable
distribution of irrigation water, operation and m4intenance of canals and
collection of water charges. No new agricultural cooperatives were organized
during the project implementation period as the existing 27 units were
considered adequate to service the area.
Compliance With Covenants
4.17     Table  14  sets out the position with regard to the compliance with
covenants by ADC. Brief explanatory details on each covenant are also noted
therein. It is seen that all the covenants agreed on in the Loan Agreement
were complied with satisfactorily except the one relating to prompt
provision of funds by the Government. Inadequate funding is the dominant
cause of delay in project implementation.



- 13 -
Cost Recovery
4.18     The  Loan  Agreement  provided for at least 30% of the construction'
cost of the project to be financed with the proceeds of a loan from the NACF
to the appropriate FLIA who would be the sub-project owners. While sub-
project I has been handed over by ADC to the concerned FLIA, sub-projects II
and IV are expected to be handed over soon after completion. Farmers are
expected to pay the full cost of operation and maintenance through a water
charge imposed by the FLIA, as well as repay the FLIA loan at an interest
rate of 5.5% p.a. over 35 years, including a grace period of five years.
Recovery of water charges from the farmers, and the repayment of the loan by
FLIAs are found to be regular.
V. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Impact on Agricultural Production
Intended Impact
5.1      The major production impact intended by the project was an increase
in annual rice production 1/ to about 97,000 tons, from the pre-project
24,000 tons, and annual barley production to about 12,500 tons from the pre-
project 3,600 tons. These were expected to be achieved principally by
accelerating the adoption of high yielding variety (HYV) of rice in the
summer and by expanding barley planted area in the winter (see Table 15).
5.2      In  addition,  the  project  was expected to increase production of
fruits and of other upland crops by reclaiming uncultivated lands outside of
the area to be served by the irrigation works. It was projected that the
above full development production would be reached in 1986.
5.3      Since there were significant changes in  the  appraised  irrigation
and land development plan during the course of project implementation, the
actual crop development has not taken place as originally envisaged. The
impact of the project on crop production is therefore not stricly comparable
with appraisal estimates. However, an attempt has been made, to the extent
possible, to compare such changes as use of HYV rice, development of barley
cultivation, per hectare crop yields, and cropping intensity, with those
projected at the time of appraisal;
Change in the Appraisal Irrigation and Land Development PlaI
5.4      Table 16 sets out the revised irrigation and land development  plan
compared with that at appraisal, together with the corresponding pre-project
land use status. As can be seen, six major irrigation and land development
works included in the appraised project were reduced to three, for reasons
explained in Chapter III. All the upland and orchard development plans were
cancelled, and the plan was revised to develop only irrigated paddyland.
1/ All rice and barley production figures in this report are on polished
basis.



- 14 -
5.5      There was a substantial change in location of th, project  area  as
reflected in the different pre-project land use betwec  the revised and the
original plan. About 5,400 ha included in the app iised project were
excluded, and about 3,800 ha located outside the original project area were
added to the revised project area. The revised project area was reduced to
about 11,100 ha in total from the original of about 12,700 ha.
5.6      The development works completed so far by the project include about
7,180 ha in the sub-projects 1, II and IV 1/ (including the additional 1,300
ha serviced by pumping water from Baegkok Dam, which is outside the
appraised area), and about 2,000 ha serviced from the Miho Dam and located
outside the original project area. 2/ Since the Bank loan disbursements
were limited to the above three sub-proJects, the assessment of the project
impact dealt with below is confined to 7,180 ha in the above sub-projects'
areas.
Overall Crop Development
5.7      The  data  used  for compiling the crop development which has taken
place over the past eight years in the impact area are largely based on
various data estimated by ADC.
5.8      Land  use.   Annual changes in land use during the past eight years
In the sub-projects I, II and IV are summarised in Table 16. The irrigated
paddyland has increased from the pre-project (1978) 230 ha to the current
7,180 ha, including about 1,140 ha of the project consolidated paddyland.
5.9      Use of HYV rice.  Estimates of  annual  planted  area  of  HYV  and
traditional  varieties  3/  of rice are shown in Table 16. At present, about
2,900 ha or 40% of total rice cropped area is estimated to be planted with
HYV rice. The remaining area (about 4 300 ha or 60%) is planted with
traditional rice. In comparison with the appraisal projection the current
use of HYV rice is substantially lower than expected. At appraisal it was
estimated that on average 90% of the area would be planted with HYV (100% in
the consolidated paddyland and 80% in the non-consolidated paddyland).
1/ See Chapter III.
2/ The area is reported to have been partially irrigated before the project
(see Table 15). With the construction of Miho Dam (ADC-funded) in the
sub-project III, the area is now receiving full irrigation supply.
]/ HYVs are commonly known in Korea as "Tongil" type varieties developed
from crosses between indica (IRRI lines) and japonica. Traditional
varieties in this report refer to the improved japonica either developed
in Korea or introduced from Japan. Use of these terms (HYV and
traditional) are somehow misleading as the yield difference between the
two is not so great. However, to maintain consistency with the appraisal
report, they are also used in this report.



- 15 -
5.10     The lower actual use of  HYV  rice  is  mainly  attributed  to  the -
inferior varietal characteristics (other than its high yielding capacity) of
the presently available HYVs. Compared to traditional varieties, HYVs are
inferior in eating quality as reflected in its lower market price. 1/ In
addition, HYVs require more  fertilizers  to  obtain  the  potential  hTgher
yield, 2/ and are less tolerant to occasional lower temperature in September
when the crop is entering its ripening stage immediately after flowering. 3/
A broad analysis carried out, summarised in the table below, shows that per
hectare returns from traditional rice are higher than those from HYV rice,
using 1985 prices. rn terms of 1976 prices (at the time of appraisal) the
situation was the reverse. This is a reflection of the changes in relative
prices with the higher national production of rice, and consumer preference
for traditional varieties of rice.

5.11     Non-rice  crops.   Crops  other  than rice, include barley, potato,
garlic and other high value horticulture crops. 4/ Other than barley,
growing of these crops was not foreseen at appraisal. However, attainment of
near self-sufficiency in rice in the late 1970s led to reduced Government
support for a grow-more-barley campign, which resulted in the lower
purchasing quotas for barley by the Government. Consequently, farmers looked
for more profitable alternative crops.
1/  Average annual farm gate prices for HYV and traditional rice in 1984
were Won52,390 and Won6O,340 per 100 1 (80 kg), respectively (Grade a
rice), for the first six months of 1985 they were Won56,100 and
Won65,600 respectively.
2/ The current recommended fertilizer rates are 150:95:110 kg per ha (NPK)
for HYVs and 110:70:75 kg per ha (NPK) for traditional varieties.
(Average for the plain area in Korea).
3/ Low temperature during this crop stage affect the rate of grain filling
and the decrease the yield. Low temperatures occured in September 1980,
and resulted in a nationwide reduction in crop harvest (2 million tons
less than 1979 harvest). Since then, the use of HYVs has significantly
declined.
4/ These include strawberry, pepper and off-season vegetables intensively /
cultivated in the hot house. The area cf this type of cultivation is
very limited as it requires high investment and intensive crop
management.



- 16 -
5.12      In this context it is difficult to claim that  the  diversification
of winter cropping is attributed to the project works, because these crops
are virtually grown under rainfed conditions, and this change has taken
place throughout the country. However, it is likely that the general
development within the project area resulted in a more rapid growth In the
area devoted to winter crops, as compared to what would have occurred
without the project.
5.13     Cropping intensity.  It is  estimated  that  the  overall  cropping
intensity has increased from the pre-project lq8% to the present 149% (see
Table 16). This increase is due to the increased area under non-rice crops
in the winter. The estimated cropping intensity at present is about 10%
higher than that projected at appraisal for the irrigated paddyland. The
irrigation intensity has increased from 3% to 100%.
5.14     Crop yields. Table 17 sets out the pre-project and the current crop
yields estimated by ADC, compared with the appraisal projection. The ADC
estimated 'actual' pre-project rice yields are higner than those estimated
at appraisal. This is due to the delay in project implementation; the actual
pre-project year is 1978, whereas the appraisal pre-project year is 1975.
5.15     Rice  yields presently attained in the irrigated (non-consolidated)
paddyland are considerably higher, at 5.0 ton/ha for HYVs and 4.3 tons/ha
for traditional varieties, as compared with the appraisal full development
yields (1986) projected at 4.4 and 3.5 tons/ha respectively. The present
rice yields in the irrigated paddylands with land consolidation are
estimated by ADC at 4.8 ton/ha for traditional rice and 5.5 ton/ha for HYV
rice. At appraisal the latter 1/ was projected at 4.8 ton/ha.
5.16     The  mission  has  some  reservation  on  the  above  higher yields
estimated  for  the  consolidated  paddyland.  Although  it   is   generally
recognized  by  the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries that the paddyland
consolidation in Korea leads to an average yield increase of 330 kg/ha, no
survey has been conducted to quantify the effect of the consolidation on
rice yields in the project area. Moreover, the mission's discussion wi4h
agricultural staff of ADC, Office of Rural Development (ORD), and interviews
with a few benefitted farmers in the project area reveal that it is
difficult to quantify the actual extent of yield increase.
5.17     Land  consolidation itself may not necessarily result in much yield
increase compared with yield  attained  in  the  ron-consolidated  irrigated
paddyland,  particularly  in  a country like Korea where high level of yield
has been attained in the non-consolidated paddylarid. It appears that the
real effect of the land consolidation on rice cultivation is in terms of
reduction in the production cost due to saving of labour input through easy
crop management and mechanization, and saving of irrigation water. Available
information, however, is inadequate to assess the effect in this regard.
Furthermore, farmers tend to apply a higher level of fertilizers and with
mechanization have better land preparation on consolidated areas which could
result in higher yields.
1/ No traditional rice was expected to be grown in the consolidated land
according to the appraisal projection (see para. E.9)



- 17-
5.18     Barley yields projected at appraisal (2.4 ton/ha) are in line  with
those currently obtained (2.3 ton/ha). However, the appraisal estimate is
made on the assumption that barley would be irrigated. 1/ Barley presently
cultivated after rice is not irrigated. The existing FLIAs in the project
area do not operate the irrigation system during the non-rice crop season.
5.19     Crip yields other than rice and barley cannot be compared with  the
appraisal projection as these crops were not expected to be cultivated in
the irrigated paddyland according to the appraisal report.
5.20     With regard to the yield development period, the  appraisal  report
assumed that farmers would achieve the projected yield levels over five
years. ADC estimates on this show much earlier attainment of the current
high yield levels which exceeded the appraisal projection. This fast
achievement of high yield levels is probably due to farmers' very good  crop
management technique.
5.21     Overall   crop   production.   Development  of  annual  total  crop
production over the  past  eight  years  is  summarised  in  Table  3.  Rice
prnduction  has  increased within the three sub-projects (I, I1 and IV) from
the pre-project 19,000 tons to the current 33,000 tons. Barley production
has also increased from about 1,000 to 3,400 tons.
5.22     Use  of farm inputs.  Since no survey has been conducted on the use
of farm inputs in the project area, accurate assessment on  this  cannot  be
made. Annual statistics on farm use of inputs for three counties 2/ involved
in  the  project  summiarised  in  Table  18,   indicate   some   Tnteresting
developments taking place during the project implementation.
5.23     Fertilizer  use  has  significantly  declined county-wide since the
late 1970s. This decline appears to be reflected by the declining use of HYV
rice which requires more fertilizers than traditional rice. There was a
sharp increase in insecdicide use in 1978 and the increased level has
continued. Use of herbicide indicates a steady increase since 1977.
5.24     There  has been a substantial increase in numbers of farm machinery
including tractors, power tillers and power sprayers since 1977. Paddy
transplanters, combine harvesters and binders were first introduced in the
counties in 1978 and their increase has been also noticeable. It is
generally considered that the continued high subsidy on rice price as well
as profitable job opportunities in non-agricultural sectors have largely
contributed to the increase in mechanized f rming. It is not possible to
assess to what extent the consolidation, whic:n it is claimed facilitates
farm   mechanization,  has  accelerated  the  above  increase,  as  no  such
information is presently available for the three counties.
Farm Incomes
5.25     A farm budget has been prepared for an average 1.5 hectare holding.
Sitice paddy conversion by ADC did not materialise as envisaged at appraisal,
the representative budget excludes such areas from the assumed cropping
patterns. Details of the crop budgets and the farm budget are shown in
Tables 19 and 20. As exp' ined above, cropping intensities both with and
1/ See page 2, Annex 7, SAR.
2/ Jincheon-gum, Eumseong-gum and Gaesam-gum



- 18 -
without project are higher than those assumed at appraisal. In the without
project case, the assumed cropping intensity is expected to materialise six
to seven years later than the full development cropping intensity with
project. The estimated net income with the project exceeds by 23% the income
without project, as compared with the 59% estimated at appraisal for a 1.5
ha holding. The reduced impact is principally on account of the higher
cropping intensity without project (123% at appraisal, as compared to 137%
as revised); furthermore, there has been a decline in the plantings of HYV
rice, due to the change in its relative profitability vis-a-vis traditional
rice.
B. Economic Re-Evaluation
5.26     An economic re-evaluation has been undertaken for three (numbers I,
II and IV) of the five sub-projects. Work on the other two sub-projects
(numbers III and V) has only started recently in 1984/85 (completion
expected in 1988), and it is too early to undertake any economic re-
evaluation. Furthermore, virtually no funds have been disbursed from the
World Bank loan for these two sub-projects.
5.27     The analysis has  been  carried  out  in  1985  prices,  with  past
expenditures  restated  in  1985  price  terms  by using the wholesale price
index. Phased investment costs in current terms, as well as in economic
terms for the purposes of the analysis, are shown in Tables 21 to 23 for the
three sub-projects respectively. The details regarding irrigated land
development and cropping patterns actually obtained, as compared with the
assumptions at the time of appraisal, are discussed above. Cropping patterns
for the total cropped area both with and without project, used for the
analysis are shown in Tables 26 to 28. As mentioned earlier, the mission was
unable to obtain any survey data for the project area which showed the
impact of land consolidation activities on crop yields. The ADC in its
computations for this project has estimated that rice yields are 500 kg/ha
higher, and barley yields 400 kg/ha higher on consolidated areas, as
compared with non-consolidated areas. In the absence of any other data, the
mission has accepted the above increments in estimating the revised economic
rates of return (ERR).
5.28     1990  border  prices,  in 1985 constant terms, for rice, barley, 1/
soybean, and fertilizers, derived from IBRD commodity price forecasts, have
been used in the analysis (Table 25); no distinction has been made in the
prices for incremental production prior to 1985 as it is insignificant in
the context of the total project. 2/ The following conversion factors have
been used in converting the financial prices of non-traded items:
Unskilled Labour, including Farm Labour               0.64
Heavy Equipment Cost                                  0.84
Fuel and Lubricant Costs                              0.76
Indirect Labour Costs                                 0.79
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)                      0.94
1/ The price of barley is estimated at 85% of wheat border prices.
?y The project generated incremental production really began in any
significant quantity in 1983.



- 19 -
The financial prices of non-traded project output such as potato, garlic and
red pepper are based on the average price for the past five years, restated
in 1985 terms, adjusted by the SCF. Table 24 summarises prices used. A 35
year period of analysis has been used for the purposes of estimating ERRs;
in view of the much longer estimated life of the irrigation facilities a
residual value of 25% of total investment cost has been assumed in Year 35.
5.29     Based on the above assumptions,  the  cropping  pattern  and  yield
assumptions shown on Tables 26 to 28, the current estimate of ERR, for the
three sub-projects re-evaluated as a whole, is around 7% (see Table 29) as
compared with the appraisal estimate for the total project of 15%. If the
yield increment on land consolidated ar:eas as compared with non-consolidated
areas, were to be taken at two-thirds of the level assumed by ADC, the ERR
would fall to 6.3%. While the SAR estimates different ERRs for the four
major dam works proposed, as well as the small dams, land consolidation, and
upland reclamation, these have not been individually re-estimated at this
stage. This is on account of the fact that the number of dams, their
locations and the geographic locations of many of the areas serviced have
changed (8 reservoirs were constructed as against 12 planned), thereby
making any comparisons between sub-component ERRs no longer valid. However,
current estimates of the ERRs of the sub-projects as a whole have been
derived as follows:
Irrigated Area        Land            Paddy        ERR
Developed      Consolidation    Conversion       XT

Sub-project II           2,170              365              520          7.0

1/  Includes 180 ha of previously irrigated area, which was consolidated
under the project.
2/ Includes 50 ha of previously irrigated area which was consolidated
under the project.
5.30     The principal factors which have contributed to the  lower  ERR  as
compared with the appraisal estimates, are the following:
l) There were considerable delays in completion of project works and
land development works were completed in 1985/86 as compared with
the appraisal estimate of 1981.
11i) Against the SAR target of 9,347 ha to be developed under the
project within sub-projects I, II, and IV, a total of 7,180 ha were
actually developed.
Mii) Combined with the above, investment costs were considerably higher
than those estimated at appraisal (see Table 7). SAR estimates for
the costs of dams and canals were US$4,250/ha for the total
project, as against actual costs of around US$6,300/ha; for land



- 20-
consolidation   the  figures  are  US$1,820/ha  versus  US$8,160/ha
respectively.
iv) In contrast to the expectations at appraisal that farmers would
increasingly take to planting HYV rice which gives between 15-20%
higher yields as compared to traditional varieties, there has been
a decline in HYV plantings in favour of traditional varieties. In
addition, upland reclamation of 1,200 ha, which accounted for 5% of
total Investment costs in economic terms and yielded an SAR
estimated ERR of 35% was not implemented.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
6.1      Despite  delays  in  implementation, Bank assistance to the project
allowed acceleration of investment programmes in irrigation and land
development  to  support  ROK's efforts to achieve food self-sufficiency and
improved incomes and living standards of the farming population. To this
end, and also to be in line with rural development policies of the
Government, the project design adopted an area specific approach involving
execution of an integrated package of irrigation and land improvement works
in a specific area typical of the interior regions of the country. Given the
adequacy of the provision of agricultural extension, input supply and
credit, implementation of works to provide complementing irrigation water
and land improvements was entrusted to a single agency (AOC). The project
formulation within this context is therefore considered appropriate and
justified.
6.2      A  strong  feature  during  project  implementation  has  been  the
constructive dialogue and rapport between Bank staff and the executing
agency. The project did not encounter any major problems during its
preparation, appraisal, and implementation. This relative success is mainly
due to ADC's long experience with irrigation and land development works.
Project implementation was monitored closely by the Bank, drawing attention
to potential difficulties and eliciting appropriate action from Government
agencies such as Economic Planning Board and Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries. In particular, the importance of adequate budgetary allocations,
which  remained  the  single  greatest  problem   throughout   the   project
implementation period, was stressed by the Bank during supervision.
Supervision
6.3      The  Bank's  supervisory  effort  was  adequate. The Bank fielded 8
supervision missions in the five year implementation period. Mission
composition wis technically strong, and there was good staff continuity
between missions (see Basic Data Sheet). As a result of suggestions made by
the Bank during supervision, improvements were made resulting in improved
reporting and better provision of budgetary funds. Nevertheless, inadequate
funding has plagued the project, considerably delaying the completion of
project works, a factor beyond the control of the ADC ur the Bank. In
discussions with the Government, the Bank decided to limit disbursements to
selected sub-projects. This was deemed necessary and seems justified.

VIH. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1      The project has made a valuable contribution, along with the  other
rural investments implemented under the on-going programmes, towards the
comprehensive and integrated development of the Miho Watershed area.
Although work on some sub-projects are still in progress, all major dam and
canal construction have been completed making it possible for farmers to
have a reliable supply of irrigation water. This has promoted increased
production of rice and alleviation of balance of payments deficits. Incomes
of farmers in the project area have also increased and are now well above
poverty level.
7.2      The institutional impact of the project has been  significant.  ADC
has gained useful technical experience in dam construction allowing it to
concurrently implement several irrigation projects in the country and
provide consulting services overseas. ADC must be rated a success in
attracting funds for irrigation and land development. In addition to the
Bank, Asian Development Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan
have provided loans to ADC.
7.3      The project, however, seems unattractive  in  economic  terms.  The
economic rate of return suggests rather low cost effectiveness.
7.4      Major  lessons which can be learned from the project are that it is
desirable to:
a) obtain a specific commitment from the borrower Government in the
Loan Agreement to allocate the necessary local funds;
b) ensure adequate preparation of the final design of sub-projects
particularly in respect of command areas and engineering works
prior to loan negotiations; where this is not possible and designs
are finalised during project implementation, sub-projects should be
reassessed   according  to  previously  agreed  selection  criteria
including minimum economic rate of return.
c) assess carefully in advance the chances of securing agreement for
the execution of construction components that require farmers'
consent;
d) have continuity of technically strong team of Bank supervising
staff as has occured in this project.

YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT STAGE II
(LOAN 1364-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Yong San Gang Irrigation Project  Stage  II  is  one  of  a  series
promoting new or improved irrigation and land development, and specifically
is a follow-on to the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project Stage I (Loan
795/Credit 283-KO) supporting the Korean Government's effort to achieve food
self-sufficiency, income equity for rural families and price stability.
1.2      The Bank has been associated with this sub-sector  since  May  1969
when it approved a loan of USS45 M for Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project
(Loan 600-KO) followed by  six other   projects  including   Yong  San  Gang
Stages I and II (Table 1). Yong San Gang Irrigation Project I was the first
stage in the development of the Yong San Gang basin. This project, costing
US$172.3 M for which a loan of US$33 M and a credit of US$15 M were approved
by the Bank, enhanced production on 32,300 ha. The project included four
storage dams, main and secondary irrigation canals, irrigated paddy, and
improvement of existing on-farm distribution and drainage systems. The
project was completed in November 1978, two years later than originally
planned.
1.3      In January 1977, the Bank approved a second loan of US$95 M  for  a
seven-year  period  (1977-83)  aimed,  as  in  the  first  stage project, at
continuing support for irrigation and land development with the objectives
of achieving self-sufficiency in rice and barley, and improving the incomes
and living standards of the farming population. The project, estimated to
cost US$167 M (including a foreign exchange component of US$87 M) 1/ was
designed to provide irrigation and land development on 20,700 ha.
1.4      This project is the subject of this completion report.  The  report
is based on a study of the Staff Appraisal Report (1247-KO) dated 3 January
1977, Loan Agreement dated 11 Febru4ry 1977 together with information
provided by the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), the implementing
dgency; a review of supervision reports and project files; field visits in
March and September 1985 to selected project sites; discussions with ADC
project staff and the staff of local offices of the Office of Rural
Development (ORD), National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) and
Farmland Improvement Association (FLIA), and interviews with Bank staff who
have been associated with the project.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation
2.1      The  project was prepared during 1973-75 by ADC with the assistance
of consultants whose services were financed through the first stage project.
Both projects were based on a Basin Master Development Plan produced by ADC
and the consultants.
2.2      The project was to develop the lower basin below the town of Na Ju
which contains large areas of presently cultivated and uncultivated tidal
flats. Yong San Gang river was tidal for a distance of some 60 km from its
mouth and under the then existing conditions, the river flows were rendered
unusable for irrigation by salt water intrusion. Flooding was also a problem
in low-lying areas along the lower reaches of the river due to high tides
impeding  surface  run-off  following  heavy  rains.   To   overcome   these
constraints,   an   estuary   dam  was  proposed  along  with  complementary
investments in pumping stations, irrigdtion systems and land development
around the periphery of the freshwater reservoir formed by the estuary dam.
The dam was also expected to open up possibilities for divertirg river flows
to lands surrounding the Mu Am Bay to the west and the Hae Nam Bay to the
south (see Map). There was potential for irrigating more than 50,000 ha in
these areas; about 25,000 ha of which would be reclaimed tidal flats.
Furthermore, the estuary dam and sluice would provide a water supply for the
future stages of development.
Appraisal
2.3      A Bank mission visited Korea  in  December  1975  to  appraise  the
project.   An  important  issue  during  appraisal  related  to  the  Korean
Government request for the financing of interest during construction, which
was estimated at US$20 M. The Bank agreed to finance only USS8 M which,
together with the proposed loan of US$87 M, brought the Bank loan to US$95
M. The sum of US$8 M was to cover the interest and other charges payable
during the grace period of 3 1/2 years. Further, during negotiations,
consultants' input proposed at appraisal was reduced from 220 man-months to
200 man-months.
Project Description
2.4      The  project,  as  agreed  at negotiations, comprised the following
components:
a) construction of an estuary dam across the mouth of the Yong San
Gang, consisting of a 4,500 m long embankment, a 240 m wide
concrete sluice and a navigation lock;
b) construction of a 4,000 m long sea dike;
c) construction  of  irrigation  facilities  comprising   16   pumping
stations, and 315 km of main and secondary canals;



- 59 -
d) land development comprising land consolidation on 3,200 ha of
existing paddy, conversion of 3,250 ha of upland to irrigated
paddy, development of 1,050 ha of upland for irrigation, and
tertiary canals and drains on 4,400 ha of existing paddy;
e) reclamation of 5,500 ha of tidal land including land levelling and
construction of canals, drains and farm roads;
f) construction o? project buildings, access roads and a temporary
pier;
g) providing   the  services  of  consultants  to  assist  in  project
implementation and in preparation of a feasibility study for future
development stages of the Yong San Gang Basin.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Negotiations and Effectiveness
3.1      The  negotiations  for  the  loan  took place during 11-17 November
1976, with approval by the Bank's Board of Directors given on 25 January
1977. The loan was signed on 11 February 1977 and became effective 22 April
1977.
Implementation Schedule
3.2      At appraisal it was estimated that construction would be  completed
by December 1983, with a project closing date of December 1984. Current
estimates indicate that final construction is not likely to be completed
until December 1989 although the loan was closed on 31 December 1984.
Because of considerable implementation delays, loan disbursements were
limited to six of the seven sub-projects (see para 3.22)
3.3      Conpletion  of individual components of the project was phased over
1977 to 1983. During appraisal, construction of the access road had already
started  with  Government  funding (September 1976). The estuary dam and sea
dike  (including  sluice  gate  and  navigation  lock)  were  scheduled  for
completion  by 1981; construction of pumping stations, irrigation canals and
land development by mid-1981; reclamation of the tidal land behind  the  sea
dike  (810  ha) in 1982; and the remaining tidal land reclamation (4,690 ha)
in areas bordering the reservoir in late 1983. As shown in Table 2, all  the
components except access road and embankment have experienced delays, with
tidal land reclamation being most affected. The estuary dam and sea dike
were completed in October 1982; pumping stations, (14 of the total 16) were
completed by May/June 1983; irrigation canals (390 km of the revised 613 km)
by  December  1984  and  some  7,600 ha out of the total land development of
15,200 ha by December 1984. Tidal land reclamation faced serious delays
resulting in the development of only 470 ha by December 1984.
3.4      The  most  important  factor  which  contributed  to the delays was-_
Government's difficulties in maintaining adequate budget allocations to ADC
due to rapid inflation in the early years of the project. Between 1977 and
1981,  the  wholesale  price  index  doubled.  Since  then,  inflation   has
dramatically dropped to about 2% p.a. but by 1982, self-sufficiency in
cereals has been nearly attained, resulting in lower priority being given by



- 60 -
Government to such projects. Annual shortfalls in budget allocations had
thus risen from Wonl.2 billion in 1978 to Won3.6 billion in 1985 (see
Table 3).
Project Cost
3.5      Table 4 gives a comparative statement of appraisal  cost  estimates
and actual costs (i.e. up to 31.12.84), while Table 5 presents a comparison
of appraisal cost estimates with final costs. As stated in para 3.3, the
project as envisaged at appraisal was only partially completed by the loan
closing date of 31 December 1984. When allowance is made for costs to
complete, the total final cost of the project would amount to Won234.5
billion (US$318.73 M), a 190% cost overrun. Expressed in dollars, which
reflects the depreciation of the Won (75% over the period 1977-85), the
total overrun would be 91% (Table 5). As seen in Table 6, the overrun was
caused mainly by price escalation (80%) and partly by quantity changes
(20%). 1/
3.6      The cost  of  the  estuary  dam,  sluicegate  and  navigation  lock
increased by 70% over the appraisal estimate. 2/ The cost of main and
secondary canals increased by 223% above the appraisal estimate. This was
mainly due to almost doubling of canal length and concrete lining in more
cases than estimated at appraisal.
3.7      Despite substantial reductions in the area developed, the  cost  of
land development had risen by 75% due to unit cost increases caused by price
escalation. The cost of tidal land reclamation shows the sharpest rise in
cost, a 450% increase over the cost foreseen at appraisal, and forms 31% of
the total project cost as against 16% at appraisal. Appraisal estimates were
however based on preliminary surveys. When detailed surveys were made,
development cost was revised to about Won75 billion with construction phased
over the period 1985-1989. The engineering and administration expenses
increased by 319% above the appraisal estimate. Further details on these and
other components are given in paras 3.10 to 3.17.
Implementation of Individual Project Components
Oesign
3.8      The project works have been split into seven  sub-projects  and  14
contracts (see Tables 6 and 9). Sub-project 1 covers all works associated
with construction of the estuary dam and sluiceway and the Dae Bul sea dike.
Design of the works was completed by consultants, in 1977. Sub-projects 2,
3, 4 and 5 cover design and construction of independent irrigation units
each comprising irrigation pumping stations, canals and land consolidation,
while sub-projects 6-1 to 6-4 and 7-1 to 7-4 covered land reclamation of
tidal lands. Design of sub-projects 2 to 7 have been carried out by ADC. The
standard of execution was high, and revisions from original designs were
based on sound engineering considerations.
1/ Excludes tidal land reclamation works.
i/ This (PCR figure) understates the cost increase because cost of
materials procured and supplied by ADC to contractors has been excluded
due to difficulty in identifying expenditure within expenditure
category. These have been assigned according to sub-projects.



- 61 -
Progress
3.9      Project  implementation  proceeded  on  schedule in the first year,
1977, but shortfall in budget allocation started in 1978 and continued,
causing serious delays (Table 7). Combined with high inflation, which caused
construction costs to rise sharply, the construction of pumping stations,
power lines, irrigation canals, land consolidation and tidal reclamation
started behind schedule. 1/ No particular difficulties were encountered in
design preparation or awarding of contracts of the major civil works to
international contractors.
3.10     Access road. Part of the access road was already under construction
under Government funding at time of appraisal. The contract of access road
plus part of the estuary dam was awarded to a local contractor at 40% lower
price than the estimate.
3.11     Estuary  dam,  navigation lock and sluices. Construction by a local
contractor proceeded on schedule for the first two years as high priority
was given by the Government to the completion and consequently all funds
were channelled to this component. In April 1980 the Government requested
and obtained from the Bank an increase from 50% to 65% of expenditure on
civil works. Considering the sharp increase in contract price (65% between
1978-1980),  the closure of the estuary in March 1981, and its completion in
1982 can be considered a good achievement. Besides a slightly different
alignment,  the  design  as  prepared  by a foreign consulting firm was only
slightly modified during the first year. The more important design changes
were cheaper foundation (less sand required for base), a stronger wave
protection, and minor changes in the sluices. Design and construction
standards reflect sound engineering. Between September 2 to 6, 1981 the
effects of a 100 years river flood streaming into the estuary reservoir were
recorded. Reservoir levels followed closely the patterns anticipated in the
design. The protection from tidal flood and proper operation of the sluice
gates reduced significantly the flooding of areas bordering the reservoir.
In June and July 1982 the dam also proved its value when drought stricken
areas could be irrigated from the reservoir that presently provides more
than 4,000 ha tidal flat with irrigation water.
3.12     Dae Bul sea dike. This dike separates 810 ha of  tidal  flats  from
the sea, directly south west of the estuary dam. The dam has been completely
protected by concrete. Some deep and soft spots in the original alignment
that had to be evaded made It longer than foreseen at appraisal. With prior
proper sounding of the intended alignment, these changes could have been
foreseen.
3.13     Pumping  stations.   Adjustments in lay-out that were made when new
survey data became available during project implementation, resulted in the
following changes (see Table 8). The Myung San station replaced the one
planned in Ilro, the Cheong Ho station planned  for  210  ha  was  built  in
another location with a capacity for 1,540 ha where it could also serve the
command area of the cancelled Mang Weol station (680 ha) plus an  additional
860  ha.  The  Si  Jong  and Seo Ho were constructed on locations other than
originally planned. The. Oo Po and Sam Hyang stations were cancelled and the
Keum Song and Hag Dong stations added to the list. To finance these changes
1/ The development of upland irrigation and the conversion of upland areas
into paddy fields had to be shifted to the farmers.



- 62 -
the Government required and obtained inclusion of sub-project 4-1 A in the
loan disbuv'sement in November 1982. The total length of power lines could be
reduced from 95 km to 70 km as a result of the changes in number and
locations of pumping stations(see Table 7).
3.14     Irriqation canals. Instead of  the  315  km  irrigation  canals  as
proposed  at appraisal, a total of 613 km is now foreseen for 1989, of which
390 km were completed by the end of 1984. In addition  concrete  lining  has
also  been  applied  in many more cases than foreseen at appraisal. This has
been done to minimize maintenance. The strong demand from farmers to
increase canal density in these areas has not been foreseen at appraisal.
3.15     Land  development.   As  stated  in  para 2.4 (d), land development
works included various forms of land improvements. As shown in Table 7 land
consolidation on existing paddyland had been rev!sed from 3,200 ha to 3,173
ha of which 2,060 ha was completed by December 1984, the remaining 1,113 ha
is now estimated for completion by June 1988. Conversion to paddy was among
the first items to be postponed when limited budgets made priority ranking
necessary. ADC however, expects that the farmers themselves would undertake
conversion of part of the areas. Upland irrigation was excluded from project
financing. ADC has plans to make water available if the farmers take up the
required works on the same areas covering 2,096 ha. Improvement of drains on
850 ha was cancelled as funds became short. Instead of the construction of
tertiary canals and drains on another 4,400 ha as proposed, ADC covered
almost twice that area, reflecting the demands by farmers (Table 7).
3.16     Tidal  land  reclamation  was taken up only after repeated requests
from the Bank, resulting in a rescheduled approach in 1982. In November
1982, 810 ha behind the Sea Bul dike was included as sub-project 6-1 for
loan disbursement. Meanwhile, the estimated cost had risen from US$4,900/ha
at appraisal to US$15,600/ha. By December 1984, 470 ha had been completed.
As shown in Table 9 the remaining area would be contracted out in 7 sub-
contracts. The final contract is to be completed in 1990.
3.17     Closure  of  the  estuary  dam  formed  a reservoir with water that
gradually became sweet. As it prevented daily inundation with sea water at
high tide, it allowed the tidal flats surrounding the reservoir to
desalinate. Farmers quickly took up irrigation with reservoir water by means
of pumps and temporary channels and presently more than 4,000 ha tidal flats
out of the 5,500 ha are under paddy. Completion of the land reclamation
works would involve the protection against high reservoir levels, of 5,600
ha with polder dikes plus infrastructure inside the polders. The high costs
involved 1/ would have to be paid back by an increase in cropped area to
5,500 ha pTus a possible yield increase (better water management) and lower
risks of flooding. A solution with higher accepted risks but minimal
additional investment would probably be a more viable alternative.
3.18     Training in design was given through interchange of staff with  the
foreign consult1ng firm involved, and sending trainees abroad for special
topics.
AJ For Stage IV of the Yong San Gang project land reclamation costs were
estimated at US$22,400 per ha.



- 63 -
3.19     Studies. Feasibility studies for Yong San Gang Stages  III  and  IV
were completed in 1984 by ADC assisted by a foreign consulting firm. Stage
III includes irrigation development in 36,000 ha plus 16000 ha tidal land
reclamation; Stage IV, respectively 24,000 ha and 11,000 ha. 1/ ADC
completed in 1984 a technical and economic analysis for tidal land
reclamation of stage II(see para 4.4).
Inter-relation Between Stage II and III
3.20     In Stage HII, a diversion channel is envisaged to divert water from
the Yong San Gang reservoir to the Yeong Am reservoir (see Map) to make it
sweet (it has no other river inflow) and allow irrigation of surrounding
areas. ADC is at present designing this diversion channel. The ultimately
chosen channel capacity however will, according to ADC, have only a slight
influence on flood levels in the Yong San reservoir (some 3-5 centimeters as
provisionally estimated) and have no influence on the height of the polder
dikes that are planned for protection of the tidal lands around the Yong San
Gang reservoir.
Project Financing
3.21     The Bank was expected to finance  the  project's  foreign  exchange
requirements of US$87 M, and interest and other charges on the Bank loan of
US$8 M, or 52% of total project cost. Local expenditures, representing the
estimated balance of project costs, were to be met through annual Government
budgetary allocations to ADC. Because of substantial cost overruns, loan
disbursements contributed only 30% of total project cost.
3.22     Due  to  considerable  implementation  delays,  the  Bank  and  the
Government agreed in early 1981 that the Bank's disbursements would be
limited to the first eight contracts awarded by May 1981 and scheduled for
completion by mid-1984. Subsequently two more contracts were included in
Bank financing. The contracts financed by the Bank are the estuary dam,
construction of irrigation systems on 10,500 ha and reclamation of 810 ha of
tidal land, which constitute about 55% of the appraised project area. Work
to be completed solely with Government funds includes two contracts for a
total of 3,045 ha of irrigation (both under way) and a number of contracts
(7) still to be awarded for 4,690 ha of tidal reclamation.
3.23     In June 1980, the disbursement rate for civil works was raised from
50% to 65X, as a temporary measure, for the period June 1980 to November
1982, to compensate for shortfall in budgetary allocations. By and large,
disbursements moved in line with appraisal projections (Table 10).
1/ The Bank suggested to sub-divide these stages in smaller investment
packages to minimize budget allocation problems.

Amendments to Loan Agreement and Loan Allocation
3.24     At borrower's request, several amendments were effected to the Loan
Agreement in line with the changing needs of the project. These included,-
addition of overseas training for project staff, increase in disbursement
rate noted above, increased loan allocation for interest charges, and
reallocation of loan proceeds. ADC requested reallocation of the proceeds of
loan using the unallocated funds and transfer between different categories
of expenditure as shown below:

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
The Agricultural Development Corporation
4.1      The Agricultural Development Corporation, a semi-autonomous  agency
operating under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, is responsible
for project implementation. Within ADC, responsibility for execution of the
project rests with the Yong San Gang Project Office, which implemented the
first stage project and was primarily responsible for the Stage II
feasibility study. The project headquarters was moved to a new office at
Mokpo constructed with project funds. Most of the staff employed on Stage I
and some additional staff were assigned to Stage II.
4.2      As  expected  at  appraisal,  ADC's  performance  in  executing the
project was highly commendable. This was mainly due to the stability,
continuity and professional competence of project management. Consultants
assisted ADC in review of designs and cost estimates, and preparation of
bidding documents for the estuary dam, sluice and navigation lock in a very
satisfactory  manner.  They  had  also  assisted  in  the   supervision   of
construction. In the early years of project construction, ADC concentrated
its efforts on the construction of access road and estuary dam since these
features were considered critica' to the success of the project. By July
198O, all funding had been usea for construction of the estuary dam



- 65 -
resulting in delays in the implementation of other components. However, the
completion of the estuary dam has yielded large benefits allowing farmers to
cultivate  over  4,000  ha  of tidal land with paddy, drawing water from the -
reservoir  formed  by  the  estuary  dam.  This  was  in  addition  to   the
considerable flood control benefits realised in 1981.
4.3      A  major  problem disrupting an orderly implementation programme is
the level of funding for construction. Over 60% of ADC's long-term funds
come from the Government as advances for work done on behalf of the latter,
implying ADC's virtual dependence on Government funding for its survival. A
side-effect  of  this  is  reflected  in  declining financial performance as
evidenced by the slow completion of contracts in progress which increased
from Won448 billion in 1982 to Won576 billion in 1984 (Table 11), and
falling profitability as measured by the operating profit to operating
assets ratio (Table 12). The Corporation, which had earned an operating
profit of Wonl billion in 1982 and Wonl.6 billion in 1983 barely managed to
break even in 1984. The delays in implementation have also severely affected
the economic performance due to delayed benefits and higher costs.
4.4      ADC's analysis of projects could also be strengthened by  improving
the method and data base of economic analysis as currently practiced. To
illustrate, the economic analysis of tidal land development (carried out by
ADC at Bank's request) is deficient in that the 'without project' situation
takes no account of crops grown on tidal land reclaimed by estuary dam. 1/
Moreover, economic price of rice has been derived based on Thai rifce
(polished) to which are added inappropriately costs such as local polishing
costs and interest on loan. This procedure tends to overstate the economic
rate of return and distort investment decisions. Also economic data are not
routinely updated to reflect changing economic conditions. ADC is now aware
of these shortcomings and can be expected to improve on project analysis,
given the competence of its staff.
Consulting Services
4.5      Project consultants provided valuable assistance to  ADC  reviewing
designs and cost estimates and preparing bidding documents for the estuary
dam, sluice and navigation lock. They also assisted in supervision of
construction. A good relationship existed between the consultants and ABC.
It is worth noting that the same consulting firm assisted ADC in preparing
the Yong San Gang Basin Master Development Plan and the feasibility study
for Stage I and Stage II. They have also provided consulting services to AOC
for study of future stages of development of the Yong San Gang Basin.
Procurement
4.6      Following  implementation  of several Bank-financed projects, ADC's
procurment procedures became well established and coordinated with the
Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea (OSROK). As a result, no major
difficulties were encountered in meeting the requirements of 'Bank Group
Guidelines for Procurement'. The successful contractors for civil works were
all Korean firms.
1/ No crops could be grown prior to the construction of estuary dam.
Farmers took to cultivation on dam completion but prior to further
development of the reclaimed land. This reflects the true 'without
project' situation for further investment envisaged.



- 66 -
Operation and Maintenance
4.7      Until  1979, after completion of a project, ADC turned over as soon
as possible, all the constructed facilities of the project to the local
Farmland Improvement Association (FLIA). Since 1980, ADC has started to
operate and maintain all the facilities of the newly implemented projects
for a period of 2 to 5 years. No sub-project under Stage II has been
transferred to a FLIA. Available evidence on operation of other projects
indicates that the facilities are maintained satisfactorily and that the
cost recovery is usually high reaching almost 100% in many projects.
Training
4.8      During  implementation, training needs were identified by ADC which
requested provision of funds for overseas training. Accordingly the Loan
Agreement was amended to include overseas training for an estimated amount
of US$170,000 covering 67 man-months (36 staff). Altogether 11 fellowships
(totalling 87 man-months) were arranged for training and study tours in
specialized fields. Of this, seven fellowships, each extending for 12
months, were arranged at the US Bureau of Reclamation for Irrigation
Drainage and Hydrology, one for one month at Environmental Estimate
Commission, Japan.
Accounting and Reporting
4.9      ADC has maintained project accounts satisfactorily, and as required
under the Loan Agreement, had its final accounts for each fiscal year
audited by Independent auditors who have issued unqualified reports.
4.10     Quarterly reports were submitted regularly. Initially these  lacked
a   feel   for  the  problems  encountered  in  implementation  as  well  as
quantitative data on agricultural performance. A Bank supervision mission
(August 1978) therefore suggested improvements and provided sample formats
indicating the information to be included. Realising the benefits of this
arrangement, ADC has revised their annual reports by incorporatinv the
changes suggested by the Bank.
Agricultural Services
4.11     As appraised,  the  project  did  not  include  any  provision  for
strengthening of agricultural services in the project area as these services
were considered adequate to meet the anticipated needs of the project
beneficiaries. Although these services have not been tested fully due to
implementation delays, available evidence indicates that the servicing
agencies are well organized to provide adequate services and help project
beneficiaries in realising the benefits of irrigation and land development
promoted by the project.
4.12     The  Office  of Rural Development under the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries is responsible for research and extension with headquarters in
Seoul and field offices throughout the country. Its office in Mokpo serves
the project area. The number of  extension  agents,   serving  the  counties
encompassing the project area, increased from 228 in 1977 to 235 in 1984
corresponding to a ratio of one agent for every 400 farm households or 500
ha. This is considered satisfactory given the efflency of the extension
agents and the farmers who are responsive and market-oriented.



- 67 -
4.13     The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation has been active in
the area supplying farm inputs, marketing farm products and providing
storage and agricultural credit. As shown in Table 13, use of farm inputs
has,  in  general,  increased  in  the  area  over  the period 1977-1983. 1/ I
Powertillers have increased from 5,798 to 14,583; tractors from 60 to 392,
power sprayers from 1,613 to 5,689; combine harvestors from 77 to 295,
binders from 86 to 916 and transplanters from 242 to 509. Fertilizer sales
have increased from 34,272 MT in 1977 to a peak in 1981 at 37,103 MT. Since
then, and reflecting the decline in HYV rice cultivation, fertilizer sales
had by 1983 dropped to 28,254 MT, in line with the national trend in
fertilizer consumption. The supply of agricultural loans extended by NACF
have increased significantly from Won3l billion in 1978 to Wonll3 billion in
1984; short-term loans from Won8 billion to Won38 billion and term loans
from Won23 billion to Won75 billion, implying increasing availability of
credit for  investment  by  farmers  in  farm inputs  and   machinery   (see
Table 14).
Farmers' Organizations
4.14     Farmers' organizations currently serving the project area are three
FLIAs (85,968 members), 332 Hueng Nong Gye (20,671 members), and four
agricultural   cooperatives   (71,415   members).   FLIAs  and  agricultural
cooperatives have remained constant throughout the project implementation
period while some 115 new Heung Nong Gye have been organized during this
period (see Table 15). The performance of these organizations has been
satisfactory.
Compliance with Covenants
4.15     Table  16  sets out the stdtuS of compliance with covenants by ADC.
Brief explanatory details on each covenant are also noted therein. It is
seen that all the covenants have been complied with satisfactorily except
the one relating to prompt Government funding. The level and timely release
of   funds   have   caused   increasing   concern   throughout  the  project
implementation period.
V. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A.   Impact on Agricultural Production
Intended Impact
5.1      The major production impact intended by the project was an increase
in annual rice production 2/ to about 87,600 tons from the pre-project
32,000 tons and annual production of barley 1/ to 43,000 tons from the pre-
project 14,100 tons. These were expected to be achieved by accelerating the
adoption of high yielding varieties (HYVs) of rice in summer, and by
expanding the planted area of barley in the winter, on about 19,650 ha of
the irrigated paddyland to be developed under the project (see Table 17). In
1/ Latest date for which data are available.
2/ All rice and barley production figures in this report are on polished
basis.



- 68 -
addition, the project was intended to increase production of high value
upland crops such as pepper, tobacco and chinese cabbage and other
vegetables under irrigated conditions on 1,050 ha of the irrigated upland to
be developed under the project.
5.2      Total project area appraised for irrigation  and  land  development
was 20,700 ha. It was projected that full development production would be
attained in 1989, five years after expected completion of the project works
in 1984.
Changes in the Appraised Irrigation and Land Development Area
5.3      Table  17 sets out the revised irrigation and land development area
compared with that at appraisal, together with the corresponding pre-project
land use status and the completed area as at end 1984. As can be seen, the
upland irrigation development of 1,050 ha included at appraised project, has
been cancelled for reasons explained in Chapter [II, and the area consisting
o. rainfed upland (700 ha) and forest (350 ha) is added to the paddyland
conversion to be developed by farmers.
5.4      Except  for  the  above  change  and a few minor adjustments in the
location of the project area, there has been no other variation in the
original development area. Total project area therefore remains at 20,700
ha. However, since all the paddy conversion (4,300 ha) is now to be done by
farmers and no development has taken place so far, the assessment of project
impact dealt with below is confined to the remaining 16,380 ha.
Overall Crop Development
5.5      The data used for compiling the crop development  which  has  taken
place over the past four years in the impact area are largely based on data
provided by ABC.
5.6      Land use.  Table 18 sets out the actual change in land  use  status
compared  with the appraisal projection. The expected change in land use has
not been realised largely because of delay in project implementat n. It
should be noted that farmers started paddy cultivation on the tidal flats on
a temporary basis, 1/ since 1983 after completion of the estuary dam. About
80% of total tidal reclamation area (5,500 ha) have been planted with paddy
in 1985. This was not foreseen at the time of appraisal.
5.7      Use of HYV  rice.   Estimates  of  the  area  planted  to  HYV  and

HYVs are commonly known in Korea as "Tongil" type varieties developed
from crosses between indica (IRRI lines) and Japonica. Traditional
varieties in this report refer to the improved japonica either developed7
in Korea or introduced from Japan. Use of these terms (HYV and
traditional) are a little misleading as the yield difference between the
two is not so great. However, to maintain consistency with the appraisal
report, they are also used in this report.

projection are given in Table 19. About 30% of rice cropped area 1/ is
presently planted with HYV. There has been no change in this proportion
since the pre-project year (1982). In the irrigated area developed by the
project, HYV use has declined from 40% in 1983  to  30%  in  1985.   As  the
appraisal projection for 1985 on HYV use is not given in the appraisal
report, no comparison between the two can be made. The appraisal target  was
to cover 70% of total rice cropped area with HYVs at full development
(1989). Realisation of this appears to be most unlikely as use of HYVs has
been declining since 1982 throughout the country.
5.8      The declining use of HYVs is mainly attributed to inferior varietal
characteristics, other than its high yielding capacity, of the presently
available HYVs. Compared to traditional varieties, HYVs are inferior in
eating quality as reflected in their lower market price. 2/ In addition,
HYVs require more fertilizers to obtain the potential higher yield, 3/ and
are less tolerant to occasional low temperatures in September when the crop
is entering its ripening stage immediately after flowering. 4/ A broad
analysis carried out, summarised in the table below, shows that per hectare
returns from traditional rice are higher than those from HYV rice, using
1985 prices. In terms of 1976 prices (at the time of appraisal) the
situation was the reverse. This is a reflection of the changes in relative
prices with the higher national production of rice, and consumer preference
for traditional varieties of rice.

5.9      Non-rice crops. Crops other than rice cultivated after  the  summer
rice, include barley, 5/ rape seed, potato and high value early season
vegetables and garlic. Barley was the main crop grown in the pre-project

available for this area.

4/ Low temperatures during this crop stage affect the rate of grain filling
and decrease the yield. Low temperatures occured in September 1980, and
resulted in nationwide reduction in crop harvest (2 million tons less
than 1979 harvest). Since then, the use of HYVs has significantly
declined.

years, except for a limited cultivation of rape seeds. There has been a
slight increase in the barley area since 1982. 1/ The current area planted
to winter crops is about 55% of total paddyland, 2/ which is about 15% less
than the appraisal projection.
5.10     In addition, there has been  some  diversification  of  the  winter
cropping. Potato, early season vegetable and garlic cultivation has been
introduced. The cultivation of rape seed has become more popular than
before. These crops were not expected to be grown according to the appraisal
projection.
5.11     It is difficult to attribute the diversification of winter cropping
to the project works because these crops are grown under rainfed conditions
and this change has taken place throughout the country. However, it is
likely that the general development within the project area has been more
rapid than it would have been without the project.
5.12     Craning intensity. It is estimated that the cropping intensity  3/
has  increased from  50  pre-project to 171% at present (see Table 19). Thils
increase is due to the larger area under non-rice crops in the winter. The
estimated cropping intensity at present has reached the level projected at
appraisal for the irrigated paddyland.
5.13     Crop Yields.  Table 20 sets out the  pre-project  and  the  current
crop yields estimated by ADC, compared with the appraisal projection. The
estimated actual pre-project rice yields are higher than those estimated at
appraisal. This is due to the delay in project implementation; the actual
pre-project year is 1982, whereas the appraisal pre-project year is 1976,
and during these six 'without project' years yield increased gradually.
5.14     Rice  yields presently attained in the irrigated (non-consolidated)
paddyland are considerably higher at 5.2 ton/ha for HYVs and 4.5 ton/ha for
traditional varieties, as compared with the appraisal full development
yields (1989) projected at 4.5 and 3.8  ton/ha  respectively.   The  present
rice yields in rice paddylands with land consolidation are estimated by ADC
at 4.8 ton/ha for traditional  rice  and  5.3  ton/ha  for  HYV  rice.   The
appraisal projection was 4.0 ton/ha and 5.0 ton/ha respectively.
5.15     It  is  estimated  that  the  yield  attained  from  the  temporary
cultivation in tidal flats in 1984 was 3.4 tons/ha on an average. 1985 yield
forecast reported by the project office is 4.5 tons/ha, which exceeds the
appraisal  yield  projection  made  for  the  irrigated   and   consolidated
condition.

in Korea since 1976 (appraisal time), such reduction in the Southern
provinces where the.project area is located has not been observed.
2/  Excluding temporary rice planted area (4,400 ha). It is reported that no

5.16     Barley  yields  projected  at  appraisal  (2.8  tons/ha  for   non-
consolidated and 3.0 tons/ha for consolidated) are in line with those
currently obtained (2.9 tons/ha and 3.0 tons/ha respectively). The appraisal
estimate is made on the assumption that barley would be irrigated. However,
the existing FLIAs in the project area do not operate the irrigation system
during the non-rice crop season, and consequently barley is presently not
irrigated.
5.17     With regard to the yield development period, the  appraisal  report
assumed that farmers would achieve the projected yield levels over five
years. ADC estimates show much earlier actual attainment of the current high
yield levels which exceeded the appraisal projection. This fast achievement
of high yield level is probably due to the high level of crop management by
the farmers.
5.18     Overall   crop   production.   Development  of  annual  total  crop
production over the past four years together with the appraisal projection
are summarised in Table 19. Rice production 1/ has increased from the pre-
project 43.800 tons to the current 70,000 tons. Barley production has also
increased from about 12,700 to 15,100 tons.
Farm Incomes
5.19     As  discussed  above,  the pre-project situation of areas receiving
irrigation as a result of the project (other than the reclaimed areas) was
either cropping under rainfed conditions or under partial irrigation. For
the pre-project and future without project situations two representative 1.0
hectare farm budgets have been prepared to reflect the incomes of the two
types of farms (either wholly rainfed, or receiving partial irrigation);
with project, the farms are fully irrigated. Details of the crop budgets and.
the farm budgets are shown in Tables 21 and 22. As explained above, cropping
intensities without project are higher than assumed at appraisal (154% for
rainfed and 158% for partially irrigated areas assumed at appraisal; 165%
and 168% respectively assumed now, for the farm budgets). The 176% with
project cropping intensity assumed for the farm budget, compares with the
172% assumed at appraisal. In the without project case, the assumed cropping
intensity is expected to materialise six to seven years later than the full
development cropping intensity with project. As can be seen from the farm
budgets prepared, the estimated net income with project exceeds by 27% the
income without project for the pre-project rainfed farmers, and by 20% the
Ircome without project of the pre-project partially irrigated farmers. This
compares   with  the  42%  and  31%  increments  respectively  estimated  at
appraisal. The somewhat lower impact is principally on account of the higher
cropping intensities without project.
B. Economic Re-Evaluation
5.20     An  economic  re-evaluation  has  been  undertaken  of the project,
excluding the element relating to the poldering, and irrigation and land
development of the 4,690 ha reclaimed area. Work on these activities has
only recently begun (completion, subject to funds availability, expected in
1989/90); furthermore, no funds have been disbursed from the World Bank loan.
for these activities.

5.21     At the outset, it is important to recognize that the  comprehensive
development of the Yong San Gang Basin involves a five-stage development
programme, of which the project reviewed in this report is the second stage.
In view of the inter-relationships between some of the stages, evaluation in
isolation of one of the stages does not truly reflect all the benefits given
the complementarity of investments in different stages. This is particularly
relevant in the case of Stages II and III, as under the latter a diversion
channel is envisaged to direct water from the Yong San Gang reservoir into
the Yeong Am reservoir, for irrigating a substantial part of the Stage III
area. The detailed desigr,, costs and likely implementation period for Stage
III have not yet been finalised and hence cannot be incorporated into the
analysis.
5.22     The  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  1985  prices, with past
expenditures restated in 1985 price terms by using the wholesale price
index. Phased investment costs in current terms, as well as in economic
terms for the purposes of the analysis, are shown in Table 23. The cost of
poldering and land development of the reclaimed areas have been deducted
from  the  total  project  cost.  The  details  regarding   irrigated   land
development and cropping patterns actually obtained, as compared with the
assumptions at the time of appraisal are discussed above. Reclaimed areas
are being cultivated by farmers on the basis of temporary land rights given
to them by Government. Regarding land consolidation areas, the mission was
unable to obtain any survey data for the project area, which showed the
impact of such activities on crop yields. Estimates provided by the ADC have
been used for the purposes of the analysis, in the absence of any other
data.
5.23     1990 border prices, in 1985 constant terms, for rice, barley 1/ and
fertilizers, derived from IBRD price forecasts, have been used Tn the
analysis; no distinction has been made in the prices for incremental
production prior to 1985 as it is insignificant in the context of the total
project. 2/ Conversion factors used for converting the financial prices of
non-traded items were 0.6a for unskilled labour, including farm labour; 0.84
for heavy equipment cost; 0.76 for fuel lubricant cost; 0.79 for indirect
labour costs; and a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.94. The financial
prices of non-traded project output such as potato, garlic, vegetables and
rape seed are based on the average financial price for the last five years,
restated in 1985 prices terms, and adjusted by the SCF. Table 24 summarises
the prices used for the analysis.
5.24     In  addition  to  the  direct agricultural production benefits, the
construction of the estuary dam, with a road on top, has generated
significant transport benefits. These, however, were not considered at the
time of appraisal. Due to the availability of the road, the motoring
distance between Mokpo to Yong Am (via Geumsung) has been reduced by 60 km,
1/ The price of barley is estimated at 85% Of wheat border prices.
2/ The project generated incremental production really began in any
significant quantity in 1984.

resulting in an estimated travel time saving of one hour. In 1984 ADC
surveyed  the  traffic  on  the  dam and estimated that an average of 28,000
people travelled across the dam per day. The total time saved per year,
allowing  for an annual 5% increase In traffic, 1/ valued at the opportunity
cost of labour has been included in the analysiss.
5.25     In  estimating  the  economic  rate  of return, a 35 year period of
analysis has been used; however, in view of the much longer estimated life
of  the  irrigation  facilities, a residual value of 25% of total investment
cost has been assumed in year 35. Based on the above assumptions, the
cropping pattern and yield levels shown in Table 26 and other detailed
tables attached to this report, the current estimate of ERR Is around 8.5%
(see Table 27) as compared with the appraisal estimate of 13%. If the
transport benefits and related 0 & M costs are excluded, as in the case of
the SAR, the ERR is estimated to be 5%. 2/ As mentioned earlier, that while
the re-estimated ERR is relatively low, additional benefits would be
generated from the investments already undertaken, once Stage III of the
Yong San Gang Basin programme is implemented.
5.26     The  principal  factors which have contributed to the lower ERR  as
compared with the appraisal estimate are delays in completion of project
works (appraisal estimated completion in 1983); higher investment costs (for
example, sluice and navigation lock, and sea dike cost US$116,100/m as
against the appraisal estimate of US$40,925/m); and finally the fact that
appraisal expectations that a large part of the developed area would be
planted to HYV rice (with between 15-20% higher yields and net returns as
compared to traditional varieties) did not materialise. On the other hand
significant benefits have been generated by the farming of the reclaimed
areas, prior to their poldering, and irrigation and land development, as
farmers with temporary permits issued by the local authorities took up
cultivation on tidal lands after completion of estuary dam. However, as a
result of this, further investment in the reclaimed areas for poldering
etc., estimated to cost US$15,600 per hectare 3/ will not be economically
viable,  as  the area is already being cropped at 145% intensity and average
rice yields of 4.8 tons for HYV and 4.3 tons for traditional  varieties  are
already being obtained.
/ ADC had estimated between 10-11% annual increase. However, it is
extremely difficult to forecast and a conservative estimate of 5% over
ten years has been used for the analysis.
2/ It is not possible to identify the share of investment costs, which
could be excluded for the purposes of the analysis, i.e. that part which
directly facilitates the transport.
3 Appears to be overestimated.

VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
6.1      Bank's  assistance  to the project is the second one supporting the
Korean Government's efforts towards developing Yong San Gang Basin and
expanding its arable land base principally for the cultivation of rice. The
key to the development of the lower basin was the estuary dam which would
serve  as  a  barrier  to  tidal  inflow  and  make  it  possible to use the
substantial run-off of the Yong San Gang river for irrigation. Pumping
stations,  irrigation  systems  and  land  development  seemed  necessary to
maximise the benefits. Implementation responsibility was entrusted to a
single agency - ADC. Agricultural services in the area - research and
extension, farm input supply and credit - were well organized to adequately
support  the  farmers  in  realising the benefits of improved irrigation and
land development. The project formulation within this context is therefore
considered appropriate and justified.
6.2      The  project  did  not  encounter  any  major  problems  during its
preparation and appraisal. The success of implementation was mixed. While
the key structure, the estuary dam, was successfully completed, poldering
works in tidal land reclamation has been considerably delayed. Original cost
estimates of reclamation derived from basic surveys have more than doubled
when detailed surveys and design became available. In addition, rapid
inflation in the early years of the project and low priority given to such
projects by the Government in later years have affected the level of
budgetary funds allocated to the project. In view of the above, delay in
implementation has become inevitable. The  Bank  has  enjoyed  an  excellent
cooperation   and  workitrg  relationship  with  ADC.  In  addition,  project
implementation was monitored closely  by  the  Bank,  drawing  attention  to
potential  difficulties  and  eliciting  appropriate  action from Government
agencies such as the Economic Planning Board and the Ministry of Agriculture
and  Fisheries.   In particular, the importance of budget allocations, which
remained the critical issue throughout the project implementation period,
was stressed consistently by the Bank during supervision.
Supervision
6.3      Supervision  of  the  project was timely and satisfactory. The Bank
fielded 8 supervision missions in the seven-year implementation period.
Mission composition was technically strong and also there was staff
continuity between missions (see Basic Data Sheet). As a result of
suggestions made by the Bank during supervision, improvements were made
resulting in improved reporting, better provision of budgetary funds, &nd
evaluation of tidal land develcpment. Nevertheless, inadequate funding, by
delaying implementation particularly of tidal land reclamation, has delayed
disposal of reclaimed land and hence a corresponding delay of revenue to the
Government, a factor beyond the control of ADC or the Bank. Under these
circumstances, the Bank's decision, in agreement with the Government, to
limit disbursements to selected sub-projects was necessary and appropriate.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1      Because of the Bank's  systematic approach  to  water  development,
the project, second in the series to develop the Yong San Gang Basin, is a
major contribution to the promotion of new or improved irrigation and land
development.   Another   significant  achievement  of  the  project  is  the
successful completion of the estuary dam, the key to the development of the
lower  basin.  This  has made it possible to reclaim tidal lands and use the
substantial run-off of the Yong San Gang river for irrigation. The arable
land base has increased substantially raising production considerably, and
also providing a source of financial revenue to the Government by the sale
of the reclaimed lands. Although some sub-projects, particularly the further
development of reclaimed land, are still in progress, expected benefits are
being achieved. Incomes of the farmers have also increased and are now well
above the poverty level.
7.2      The institutional impact of the project has also been  significant.
ADC has grown into a strong and competent technical agency able to implement
concurrently  several  complex  projects  in  the  country   and   providing
consulting services overseas. Towards this end, it has attracted funds for
irrigation and land development.
7.3      In terms of  the  re-estimated  ERR,  the  project  appears  to  be
unattractive, suggesting rather low cost-effectiveness. In this context, it
is important to recognize as stated earlier, that in view of the inter-
relationships between some of the stages of the total basin development,
evaluation in isolation of one stage does not truly reflect all the benefits
(see para 5.24).
7.4      Major  lessons which can be learned from the project are that it is
desirable to:
a) obtain a specific commitment from the borrower government in the
Loan Agreement to allocate necessary funds;
b) ensure, adequate preparation of the final design of sub-projects
particularly in respect of  command  areas  and  engineering  works
prior to loan negotiations; where this is not possible and designs
are finalised during proJect implementation, sub-projects should be
reassessed   according  to  previously  agreed  criteria  including
minimum economic rate of return;
c) obtain, pre- and post project base production data yields, input
usage and returns through sample crop cutting trials and supporting
farmer interviews, to facilitate more accurate assessment of
financial and economic performance.
d) assess carefully in advance the chances of securing agreement for
the execution of the components that require farmers' consent;
e) have continuity of technically strong team of Bank supervising
staff as has occurred in this project.
