APPRAISAL OF THE
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT: STAGE II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1.        The Government of the Republic of Korea has requested Bank
assistance in financing the second stage of the Yong San Gang Irrigation
Project. The project would provide irrigation and land development for
some 20,700 ha and would directly benefit about 29,000 farm families or
approximately 174,000 people. An estuary dam, constructed near the mouth
of the Yong San Gang river, would create a reservoir from which water
would be pumped to irrigate the surrounding lands. In addition to
pumping stations and canal systems, the project would include the reclama-
tion of about 5,500 ha of uncultivated tidal flats. Land development on
the remaining 15,200 ha would include conversion of 3,250 ha of uplands
to paddy; land consolidation on 3,200 ha of paddy; and upland irrigation
on 1,050 ha. The project also includes construction of buildings, access
roads and temporary piers, and engagement of consulting firms to assist
in project implementation and a feasibility study for future development
stages of the Yong San Gang Basin.
2.        Major Government objectives in the agricultural sector are to
achieve and maintain self-sufficiency in rice and barley production, and
to raise incomes and living standards of the farming population. The
proposed project would help the Government achieve these goals through
increased productivity of existing lands and development of presently
uncultivated lands. Other Bank Group investments in irrigation and land
development include the Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan
600-KO) and Yong San Gang Irrigation Project: Stage I (Loan 795/Credit
283-KO) covering 30,000 ha and 33,000 ha respectively; the minor irri-
gation (13,500 ha) and upland reclamation (4,500 ha) components of the Rural
Infrastructure Project (Loan 1216-KO/1218T-KO), and the Miho Watershed Area
Development Project (Loan 1319-KO), which would benefit some 12,700 ha.
3.        Total cost of the project is estimated at US$167 million (Won
81 billion), including provision for price increases of US$55.2 million,
or 33% of total project costs. The proposed Bank loan of US$95 million
would finance the foreign exchange component of US$87 million, or 52% of
the project cost and interest and other charges on the Bank loan of
US$8 million. Contracts for construction of civil works (US$74.0 million,
excluding expected price increases) and supply of sluice gates, pumping
equipment, and construction materials (US$19.5 million) would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines for procurement. Contracts for the construction of the access
road together with the left embankment of the estuary dam (US$2.5 million)
and for buildings and other site facilities (US$0.8 million) would be awarded
after Local competitive bidding.



- ii -
4.        The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-
autonomous agency operating under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries (MAF), would be responsible for project implementation. Within
ADC, responsibility for execution of the project would rest with the Yong San
Gang Project Office, which is presently engaged in implementation of the
first-stage project and was primarily responsible for the Stage II feasi-
bility study.
5.        The project would increase rice production by nearly 56,000 tons,
and barley by nearly 30,000 tons. Farm income on an existing rainfed 0.3 ha
farm benefitting from the project would increase from US$610 to US$850 at
full development in 1989. For 1.0 ha and 2.0 ha farms, the respective
increases in incomes would be from US$1,560 to US$2,350 and from US$2,960 to
US$4,300. About one-third of the farmers in the project area own 0.5 ha or
less; one-third between 0.5 ha and 1.0 ha; and about one-third between 1.0 ha
and 3.0 ha. Some 3,800 new farms would be established on the reclaimed tidal
land. The project's economic rate of return is estimated at 13%. The rate
of return is only moderately sensitive to increases in costs and delays in
benefits.
6.        The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$95.0 million
for a period of 17 years, including a three and one-half year grace period to
the Agricultural Development Corporation, with the guarantee of the Republic
of Korea.



KOREA
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT: STAGE II
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Korea has requested Bank
assistance in financing construction of Stage II of the Yong San Gang
Irrigation Project in the south-western part of Korea. The project would
irrigate 20,700 ha from a reservoir created in the lower reach of the
Yong San Gang river by construction of an estuary dam. The project was
prepared by the Agricultural Development Corporation assisted by Sanyu
Consultants International of Japan whose services were financed through
the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project: Stage I (Loan 795/Credit 283-KO).
1.02      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission which
visited Korea in December 1975, comprising Messrs. W.T. Smith, R. Baskett,
C. Goldfinger (Bank), J.C. Douglass and R.A. Pearse (Consultants).
Mr. M. Saddington assisted in preparation of the report.
2. BACKGROUND
The Agricultural Sector
2.01      The Republic of Korea covers some 98,000 sq km, with about one-
fourth its area in farms and two-thirds in forests. The 1975 population
is estimated at 34.0 million, with a recent annual growth rate of 1.7%.
Agriculture provides 25% of the GNP and 50% of the total employment.
The rural population, consisting of almost 2.4 million households,
accounts for 40% of the total population.
2.02      About 23%, or 2.3 million ha, of Korea's total land area is
cultivated.  Lowlands used primarily for rice production occupy just
over 1.3 million ha and cultivated uplands account for nearly 1.0 million
ha. Annual rice production in years of favorable rainfall is on the order
of 4.2 million tons. Production of winter cereals, chiefly barley,
generally approaches 2.0 million tons annually on a cropped area of some
1.0 million ha; about 45% of the winter cereals is grown on the lowlands
after the rice harvest and the remainder as a winter crop on the uplands.
Soybeans occupy the largest area of the summer crops grown on the uplands;
annual production is about 300,000 tons on about 30% of the uplands.
Other important upland crops are fruits, vegetables, tobacco and ginseng.



- 2 -
2.03      Annual food grain production has grown little over the past
decade. A steady rise in rice production has been offset by declines
in barley and wheat production due tc conversion of uplands to paddy.
Population growth coupled with rising per capita consumption has caused
annual grain imports to grow from 700,000 tons in the early 1960s to an
average of 3 million tons in the period 1971-75. In 1975, food grain
imports cost US$724 million. Wheat and corn account for nearly two-thirds
of the tonnage of imported food grains.
2.04      The Government places high priority on expanding food grain
production to achieve self-sufficiency to the extent possible. While
it is realized that overall self-sufficiency will not be possible,
efforts are being made to expand production of rice, barley and soybeans
to meet domestic requirements. This will have to be achieved mainly
through higher yields on presently cultivated land since future expansion
is limited to about 300,000 ha of uncultivated upland and tidal flats.
Rice yields are already high (3-4 ton/ha of polished rice)/1 but are
still below yields achieved in a similar environment in Japan. Yield
increases are therefore possible through irrigation coupled with wider
use of high yielding varieties. Areas devoted to winter cereals on the
ricelands can also be increased where the construction of improved
irrigation and drainage works allows more timely planting and harvesting
of the rice crop. On the uplands, some increase in barley production
should be possible through wider use of high yielding and early maturing
varieties. Some increase in wheat production in the uplands is possible,
but it would be insignificant in relation to domestic requirements.
Yields of other upland crops could also be increased through use of new
varieties and by lime application, which would increase the response to
fertilizer.
2.05      Investment in agriculture during the Third Five-Year Plan (1972-76)
was close to Won 800 billion compared with Won 260 billion in the Second Plan
and Won 130 billion in the First Plan. Emphasis was being placed on increas-
ing the productivity of existing cultivated land through irrigation, drainage
and flood control, and by increasing the area under high-yielding varieties
of rice and other crops.
2.06      The average farm size in Korea is about 0.9 ha, of which
0.5 ha is paddy land, while the remainder is upland used for crops, such
as barley, maize, soybeans, fruit, vegetables, tobacco, mulberries (for
/1 Yields of rice and barley are expressed in terms of polished grain
after milling, assuming a milling yield of 67% for rice and 75% for
barley.

silkworm production) and other cash crops. Nearly two-thirds of farm
households have less than one ha of cropland but only 4% of farm house-
holds are landless. Most farmers own the land they cultivate. This
equitable distribution of land ownership is the result of the Farmland
Reform Laws of 1945 and 1950, which imposed a ceiling of 3.0 ha on
cultivated land per household.
Rural Incomes and Employment
2.07      Government policy of raising and stabilizing prices of major
farm products and subsidizing farm inputs had the effect of raising rural
household incomes relative to urban incomes over the last five years.
However, it is expected that productivity gains in mining and manufacturing
will continue to outstrip those in agriculture, and it is unlikely that the
terms of trade for agriculture will improve much in the future due to the
need to hold down food prices and reduce budget deficits. To prevent a
relative deterioration of rural incomes, it will therefore be necessary
to improve productivity in agriculture through investments in irrigation
and land development, and to stimulate opportunities for off-farm employ-
ment in rural areas.
2.08      Since the late 1960s, rapid growth in employment opportunities in
manufacturing and services has led to a decline in the percentage of the work
force engaged in agriculture, but the number of agricultural workers has
slightly increased. The farming population is now fully occupied from April
through November and labor shortages are common during planting and harvesting
of the rice and barley crops. The use of small-powered implements such as
tillers, threshers and sprayers is growing rapidly to alleviate labor short-
ages. There continues, however, to be considerable underemployment during
the winter months.
Project Formulation
2.09      The Yong San Gang, with a drainage area of over 3,000 sq km,
is the fourth largest river in Korea. Located in the southwestern part
of Korea, the basin has a milder climate and longer growing season than
other parts of Korea but is subject to damaging droughts and floods.
In the late 1960s, several severe droughts prompted intensive studies
and investigations of the river's irrigation potential and this led, in
1970, to the preparation of a project for irrigation development on several
of the Yong San Gang river's major tributaries. A first-stage development to
benefit 33,000 ha, Young San Gang Irrigation Project Stage I, commenced in
1972. It includes construction of four storage dams, canal systems, and
on-farm development comprising tertiary canals and drains, land levelling,
farm roads, and where necessary rearrangement of farm boundaries. The Bank
is assisting the Government in financing the project, through a loan of US$45
million under Loan 795/Credit 283-KO. This project will be completed in 1978,
about 18 months later than anticipated at appraisal. The delay was caused by
difficulties in maintaining the required level of budget allocations during a
period of rapid inflation. Apart from this problem, which has now been
overcome, ADC's engineering and administration of project implementation has
been of a high standard.



- 4 -
2.10      The proposed second-stage project would develop the lower basin
below the town of Na Ju, (Map 12066) which contains large areas of
presently cultivated land and uncultivated tidal flats.  However, the
river is tidal for a distance of some 60 km from its mouth, and under
present conditions the river flows are rendered unusable for irrigation
by salt water intrusion. Flooding is also a problem in low-lying areas
along the lower reaches of the river because high tides impede surface
run-off following heavy rains.
2.11      The key to development of the lower basin is therefore the proposed
estuary dam which would serve as a barrier to tidal inflow, and make it
possible to use the substantial runoff of the Yong San Gang river (averaging
nearly 2,000 million cu m per year) for irrigation. In addition to the
estuary dam, the Stage II project would include the construction of pumping
stations, irrigation systems, and land development around the periphery of
the fresh-water reservoir formed by the estuary dam. The dam would also open
up possibilities for diverting river flows to lands surrounding the Mu An Bay
to the west, and the Hae Nam Bay to the south. There is a potential for
irrigation of more than 50,000 ha in these areas (about 25,000 ha would be
reclaimed tidal flats) and ample water would be available since the Stage II
project would use just over 10% of the river's annual runoff. The proposed
study would investigate the feasibility of future irrigation and tidal
reclamation in these areas.
2.12      With increasing pressure on Korea's limited land resources for
industrial and urban development, any increase in food grain production has
to be achieved by raising yields on existing land and, where possible, by
developing uncultivated uplands and tidal flats. Although yields of rice are
already high, there is considerable scope for improvement through irrigation
and land development (para. 3.09). Also, with better drainage and more
timely irrigation, the cropped area and yields for the winter barley crop can
be increased significantly. The project's per hectare cost of US$5,500 is
similar to other Bank-financed irrigation projects in Korea, but higher than
projects of a similar nature in other Asian countries with the exception of
Japan. This is due to the high costs of building canals in rugged topography
and also the intensive modes of on-farm development needed to satisfy the
Korean farmers' high standard of farn management and water control. The cost
per farm family of US$3,900 is somewhat lower, however, than other recent
Bank-financed projects in the region, involving a large element of new
facilities. It is also to be noted that newly developed land accounts for
about 25% of the area served by the project. Furthermore, the estuary dam
and sluice (30% of the project cost) will provide a water supply for future
stages of development.



3. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
3.01      The project is located in the southwestern part of Korea, about
300 km south of Seoul. It encompasses parts of four counties in Jeonla Nam
province. The largest town in the project area is the port of Mok Po with a
population of over 200,000. The provincial capital of Gwangju, with a
population of over 500,000 lies about 50 km to the northwest of the project
area. The proposed estuary dam, built across the Yong San Gang river about
4 km upstream of Mok Po, would create a freshwater lake as the chief source
of irrigation water for the project area. The project lands (Map 12066),
extending along both sides of the reservoir for about 30 km upstream from the
dam, would consist of 16 independent irrigation units, each with its own
pumping station. The project would irrigate 20,700 ha of which 5,500 ha
would be reclaimed tidal flats. The estuary dam would include a navigation
lock to pass the occasional small vessels, mostly oil tankers, which use the
river at present.
Climate and Hydrology
3.02      Korea lies in the path of warm, moist southeasterly air currents in
the summer, and a northwesterly flow of cold, dry air from the Asian land
mass in the winter. The southern location of the project moderates the
extremes of climate found further north in Korea. The summer extends from
May to September with temperatures reaching 300C. December and January are
the coldest months with temperatures often below freezing. The project area
has about 210 frost-free days. Annual precipitation averages about 1,240 mm
with two-thirds occuring during the rainy season (May through September).
Even in the summer, rainfall is unreliable, especially during the critical
rice transplanting period (June). In addition, droughts occur sometimes in
August and September. Irrigation is therefore required to obtain optimum
yields from high-yielding varieties of rice. Annex 1 presents climatological
data.
3.03      Streamflow data for the period 1940-1972 are available for the
Yong San Gang river at Na Ju where the river regime is unaffected by tides.
Average annual runoff at Na Ju is about 1,300 million cu m. It is estimated
that the drainage area of the river between Na Ju and the estuary dam would
contribute about 650 million cu m annually, so the annual inflow to the
proposed estuary reservoir would be about 1,950 million cu m (Annex 1).
About 70% of the runoff occurs in the period May through September.
3.04      In its lower reaches, extending some 60 km from the river mouth,
the Yong San Gang river is tidal. At spring tides, high water is about +3.7
m and low water about +0.5 (all levels in this report refer to the Mok Po
Harbor Datum). Tidal intrusion renders the flows of the Yong San Gang river,
in its lower reaches, unsuitable for irrigation. The tides also impede
drainage of low-lying paddy lands bordering the river and, during floods,
large areas of cultivated land are inundated.



- 6-
Topography, Land Use and Soils
3.05      A dominant feature of the project is the estuary of the Yong
San Gang river where most of the lani is presently uncultivated because of
tidal inundation. The "hinterlands", the term used in the feasibility
report to denote the areas outside of the tidal influence, consist of
low, rolling hills, interspersed by broad tracts of paddy land. The
lower slopes of the hills are intensively used for cultivation of a wide
range of upland crops, and the higher slopes are forested. The tidal
lands to be reclaimed would be between elevations +1.5 m and +3.5 m after
allowing for about 0.5 m of subsidence during reclamation. Most of the
hinterlands which would benefit from the project are between +4 m and
+15 m with small areas at higher elevations. About two-thirds of the
project area has slopes between 0 and 2%, one-quarter between 2% and
5%, and most of the remainder between 5% and 10%.
3.06      The soils of the existing ricelands, silty clay loams and clay
loams, are good rice soils without any significant limitations. Upland
soils, loams and clay loams, have fairly high acidity and their producti-
vity could be increased by applications of lime. The soils of the tidal
lands are silty clays, with a clay content of 40-45%. In their present
condition they are highly saline and have low permeabilities. Leaching
of these soils for a period of one to three years would remove the salts.
Thereafter these soils would be well suited to rice cultivation and, if
adequately drained, for other crops.
3.07      Present and projected land use for the area benefitting from the
project is summarized below. The principal changes as a result of the
project would be as follows:

Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.08      About 24,900 farm families, consisting on the average of six
persons, have all or part of their holdings within the 15,200 ha of
hinterland to be included in the project. These families farm a total
of 23,300 ha; thus the average farm size is just over 0.9 ha of which



-7 -
about 0.6 ha would benefit from the project.  The distribution of holdings
according to farm size is shown below.  All farms are owner-operated and,
as is the case throughout Korea, all farm holdings are restricted to 3 ha
under the Land Reform Act of 1950. The tidal flats are Government lands
and after reclamation would be sold in plots of 1 ha and 2 ha to individual
farmers.  A breakdown of farm holdings in the project area is presented
below:

Agriculture
3.09      Of the 10,900 ha of riceland, 5,700 ha are dependent on
rainfall and 5,200 ha are irrigated from numerous small reservoirs.
Land consolidation (para 4.08) has been carried out on 3,300 ha of the
irrigated land. Yields are depressed in most years by droughts, espe-
cially in the rainfed areas, but also in the irrigated areas where
existing reservoirs cannot meet the demands during spells of dry weather.
Traditional rice varieties with yields averaging 2.7 ton/ha are grown
in the rainfed areas. On the irrigated lands, high-yielding varieties
(HYVs) with yields averaging 3.5 ton/ha are grown on about 50% of the
area, and traditional varieties on the remainder average just over 3
ton/ha. The most widely used HYV is "Tongil", a short stiff-strawed,
nitrogen-responsive variety introduced in 1972. With a reliable irriga-
tion supply, a higher proportion of the land would be planted to HYV's
and overall yields of 4.5 to 5 ton/ha would be attainable. Under good
conditions, many Korean farmers have achieved yields of 6 ton/ha with
the Tongil variety.
3.10      Naked barley, a variety in which the husk is not attached to
the kernel, is planted on about 30% of the riceland as a winter crop.
The crop does not tolerate excessive soil moisture and is generally
limited to the better drained areas. Yields are about 2 ton/ha. At
present, any water remaining in the reservoirs at the end of the rice
crop is retained until the next rice growing season, and consequently
the barley is not irrigated. With an adequate water supply, barley
could be irrigated in April and early May when the crop is normally
short of water. Yields of 3 ton/ha would then be possible through
irrigation and wider use of recently developed high-yielding varieties.

3.11      The upland areas included in the project comprise 3,700 ha of
cultivated land and 600 ha of forest. The summer crops on the uplands
include soybeans, tobacco, and a wide range of vegetables. Naked barley
is the main winter crop with some rape seed. The annual cropping intensity
on the uplands is about 150%. The areas planted to barley are limited to
about 50% because it conflicts with the planting and harvesting of the more
profitable summer crops. Despite the intensive cropping of uplands, the per
hectare return is less than for a rice crop. Consequently, farmers favor
conversion of uplands to irrigated paddy where possible. Upland crops are
not irrigated at present, and they suffer to some extent from droughts.
With irrigation, yields of upland crops could be increased by 20% to 40%.
3.12      Most farmers own approximately equal areas of lowland and up-
land. Farming is highly labor intensive and most land preparation is
by draft bullocks. In recent years, however, there has been a steady
increase in the use of powered implements such as tillers, sprayers
and threshers. Fertilizers and pesticides are used on nearly all crops
with fairly high application rates on rice, barley and the higher value
upland crops. Herbicides are little used at present, although they are
becoming more widely accepted to alleviate labor shortages.
3.13      Despite the relatively high yields and intensive land use in
the project area there is a considerable potential for further increases
in agricultural production through irrigation and land development. Rice
farmers throughout Korea have shown their ability to take full advantage
of irrigation and drainage facilities. The provision of a timely and
reliable water supply would increase rice yields and also have the effect
of reducing peak labor demands since crop calendars would no longer be
governed by rainfall. Better timing of the rice crop would also lead to
an increase in the area planted to barley. In irrigated areas, land
consolidation wonlld have a number of advantages: higher yields through
better water C4ontrol; lower labor requirements as a result of easier
access and conditions more suitecd to mechanical land preparation; and an
increased area under barley due to better drainage.
Existing Infrastructure
3.14      There are about 60 small reservoirs and ponds in the project
area formed by earth dams ranging in height from 5 m to 16 m. The total
storage capacity of the reservoirs is 25 million cu m with nearly 50% of
the capacity accounted for by the five largest reservoirs. Many of the
reservoirs consist of small ponds constructed at the head of the paddy
terraces with the main purpose of providing water for seedbeds. During
prolonged droughts, the ponds are rapidly depleted and are unable to meet
irrigation requirements in their service areas.



- 9 -
3.15      The project area is encircled by paved, all-weather highways
connecting the county towns. Mok Po, the largest city in the project
area, is connected by paved national highway to Gwangju, and then by
expressway (partly along Jeonju-Busan Highway, financed by the Bank under
Loan 769-KO) to Seoul in the north and Busan in the east. The larger
towns within the project area are served by gravel-surfaced county roads,
and access roads to the villages are being upgraded as part of the
Saemaeul (New Community) Movement, a nation-wide rural development
program. The Bank's Second and Third Highway Projects (Loans 956-KO and
1203-KO) are further improving roads within the region. The Mok Po -
Gwangju railway crosses the western side of the project area. These road
and rail systems adequately meet the transportation needs of the project.
With the reclamation of tidal lands, the estuary reservoir will also
provide for water-borne transportation of inputs and commodities. A
Bank-financed project, the Secondary Cities Regional Project (Loan
1070-KO), is providing an organizational framework for regional investment
planning and development of an industrial belt in urban areas along the
region's south-eastern coast.
3.16      About 50% of the farm households have electricity.  Wells
are used for domestic water supply; the quality of water is good but
only the larger villages have piped systems. A considerable increase
in the number of households with electricity and piped water supplies
is likely over the next few years through the programs being carried
out under the Saemaeul Movement.
4. THE PROJECT
Project Description
4.01      The proposed project is the second stage of a plan for irriga-
tion, drainage and land development in the lower reaches of the Yong San
Gang. The project would benefit 20,700 ha througn irrigation of the entire
area, reclamation of 5,500 ha uncultivated tidal flats and land development
on 11,900 ha (land consolidation has already been carried out on 3,300 ha to
be irrigated by the project). Rice would be the main crop in the summer,
followed by a winter crop of barley on about 70% of the area. The principal
features of the project are summarized below and further details are given in
Annex 2:
(a) constructing an estuary dam across the mouth of the Yong
San Gang, consisting of a 4,500 m long embankment, a 240 m
wide concrete sluice and a navigation lock;
(b) constructing a 4,000 m long sea dike;
(c) constructing irrigation facilities comprising 16 pumping
stations, and 315 km of main and secondary canals;
(d) reclaiming 5,500 ha of tidal land including land levelling
and construction of canals, drains and farm roads;



- 10 -
(e) land development comprising land consolidation on
3,200 ha of existing paddy, conversion of 3,250 ha
of upland to irrigated paddy, development of 1,050 ha
of upland for irrigation, and tertiary canals and
drains on 4,400 ha of existing paddy;
(f) constructing project buildings, access roads and a
temporary pier;
(g) providing the services of consultants to assist in project
implementation and in preparation of a feasibility study for
future development stages of the Yong San Gang Basin.
Estuary Dam
4.02      The estuary dam, which would be located about 10 km upstream of
the river mouth, would exclude tides from the lower reaches of the Yong
San Gang and thereby create a fresh-water reservoir to serve as a source
of irrigation water for the project area. For most of the year, when
river flows are low, the pool level upstream of the dam would be held at
+1.0 m (Mok Po Harbor Datum) in contrast to the present situation in which
the high tide levels are between +3 and +4 m. The lower water levels
would permit reclamation of about 5,500 ha of tidal flats and allow
better drainage of about 800 ha of cultivated land in low-lying areas.
During floods, the level would rise above +1.0 m for short periods
because flood waters would be stored during the upper part of the tidal
cycle when tide levels downstream of the dam are higher than the pool
level. The effect of fluctuating reservoir levels on the reclaimed tidal
lands is discussed in Annex 4.
4.03      The main embankment closing the river channel would be about
2,000 m long with a maximum height above the river bed of 20 m. Two dams
of similar design have been constructed successfully by ADC in the Bank-
financed Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan 600-KO). The down-
stream portion of the dam would consist of dumped rock and the upstream
portion would consist of sand protected with a layer of rock. An 8 m
wide road would be located on a 20 m wide berm on the upstream side of
the dam. Over a part of its length, the damsite is overlain by a layer
of silt. To provide a more stable foundation, this would be removed and
replaced by sand to a depth of about 6 m under the rockfill section.
The tidal flats on the left bank of the river would be closed by a 2,500 m
long earth embankment with a height of about 3 m. This embankment would
also carry the access road to the damsite. The two embankments would
together contain about 3.5 million cu m of material.
4.04      The sluice and navigation lock would be founded on rock on the
left bank of the main channel. The sluice would contain eight, 30 m by
14.3 m single-leaf, vertical-lift gates. The navigation lock would be
30 m long and 10 m wide with double-leaf control gates at each end. The
sluice and navigation lock would contain about 40,000 cu m of concrete.



- 11 -
Sea Dike
4.05       A sea dike, extending downstream of the estuary dam along the
left bank of the river, would be constructed to reclaim 830 ha of tidal
flats (para 4.12). The dike would be 4,000 m long and about 8 m high.
The body of the dike would be compacted earth with a rock zone on the
seaward face. A sluice would be constructed at the downstream end of
the dike to permit drainage of the reclaimed area at low tides.
Pumping Stations
4.06       Each of the 16 irrigation units forming the project area would
be served by its own pumping station. Thirteen stations, with an average
lift of 10 m, would be sited on the edge of the reservoir, and three,
with an average lift of 28 m, would be located inland to serve about
3,000 ha of higher land. The total installed capacity of the pumping
stations would be about 15,000 HP. Facilities to supply power to the
pumps would include 95 km of 22 kV distribution lines, and four sub-
stations containing 12,500 kVA of transformer capacity.
Main and Secondary Canals
4.07       The 16 irrigation units would each be served by a system of
main and secondary canals. Altogether there would be 165 km of main
canals and 150 km of secondary canals. The soils on the canal align-
ments are relatively impervious and canal lining would be needed only
in short sections. About 40 km of the main canals and 20 km of the
secondary canals would consist of flumes, tunnels and culverts. The
main canals would serve areas of 300 ha or more, and areas served by
secondary canals would average about 150 ha.
Land Development
4.08       Land Consolidation.  Land consolidation has already been
carried out on 3,300 ha and would be provided by the project on 3,200 ha
of existing paddy land where slopes are less than 2%. On steeper land,
consolidation cannot generally be justified because earth moving costs
become prohibitive. Land consolidation, which consists of replacing
the existing uneven pattern of small irregular plots with larger level
plots in a rectangular grid of ditches, farm roads and drains, has been
carried out on large areas of irrigated land in Korea. For the farmer,
the advantages of land consolidation are that (a) it facilitates mechanical
land preparation, (b) it allows easier access to the fields and improved
standards of farm management, and (c) it allows more efficient control
of irrigation and drainage. The improvements in crop and water manage-
ment lead to higher rice yields. Also, more timely land preparation
combined with effective drainage at the end of the rice-growing season
facilitates the planting of a winter barley crop. Boundary rearrange-
ment leads to minor changes in size of individual holdings, but there
is no change of ownership. Up to the late 1960s most of the land



- 12 -
consolidation in Korea was carried out on large blocks of flat land (less
than 0.5% slope), and topography was not a significant factor in the
designs. As land consolidation came to be applied to steeper land (up
to 2% slope) design procedures were modified to take account of topo-
graphy in order to minimize earth-work quantities. The Bank has parti-
cipated in the evolution of design principles for land consolidation
through its supervision of ongoing Bank-financed projects.
4.09      Conversion of Uplands to Paddy.  In areas to be irrigated by
the project works, 3,000 ha of cultivated uplands and 250 ha of forest
would be converted to paddy cultivation. The areas to be developed have
slopes up to 10% and they would be converted into a series of horizontal
benches with widths ranging from 10 to 20 m depending on the slopes.
Uplands to be converted have been carefully selected to ensure that soils
are suited to paddy cultivation and to avoid disturbing high-value crops
and orchards.
4.10      Upland Irrigation.  An area of 1,050 ha of uplands, of which
700 ha are presently cultivated and 350 ha are forest, would be developed
for irrigation of upland crops where soils are too shallow to be benched
for paddy cultivation. About 30% of the area has slopes below 5%, and
70% has slopes between 5% and 10%. Development would include some land
clearing and grading. The area consists of small plots close to the main
and secondary canals, and water conveyance and distribution would be left
to the farmers.
4.11      Tertiary Canals and Drains.  On 4,400 ha of existing paddy
land where slopes are too steep for land consolidation, the existing
tertiary canals and drains would be improved on 1,900 ha and new systems
would be constructed on 2,500 ha. The main and secondary drainage
systems would also be repaired and realigned in a block of 850 ha within
the area served by existing tertiaries. Construction and improvement of
quaternary canals would be carried out by the farmers. In Korea, it is
common practice for farmers to join together in construction of on-farm
distribution systems.
Tidal Reclamation
4.12      The estuary dam and sea dike would eliminate tidal inundation
of a large area of uncultivated tidal flats. The net area proposed for
reclamation is 5,500 ha (including 830 ha protected by the sea dike),
after allowing for 15% of the land to be taken up by ditches, drains, and
roads. During reclamation the land is expected to subside by about
0.5 m, and the ground level of the reclaimed land after subsidence would
be between +1.5 m and +3.5 m. Development of the tidal lands would be
similar to that provided in the land consolidation areas and would
involve land leveling and construction of a rectangular grid of irriga-
tion ditches, drains, and farm roads. Temporary drains about 1.0 m deep
and at spacings of about 20 m would be provided to permit the salts in
the soil to be leached out by flooding and draining. In some areas where



- 13 -
soils have a fairly high clay content, a lower-cost drainage system may
be feasible using mole drains at about 6 m spacing. It would take about
a year for the soils to be desalinized sufficiently to plant the first
rice crop.
4.13      As explained in Annex 4, reservoir levels would rise during
floods and cause some inundation of the reclaimed lands for short periods.
Hydrologic and agronomic analyses indicate that the depth and duration of
flooding would not cause significant damage to the rice crop, except when
exceptionally high floods coincide with the critical flowering stage of
the rice crop. It will be necessary, however to verify these results
by checking the mathematical simulation of reservoir hydrology by field
observation in the first one or two years of reservoir operation. Re-
clamation of the higher parts of the tidal flats would begin during this
period while the economic and technical feasibility of reclaiming the lower
areas is under further study. Assurances were obtained that before inviting
bids for reclamation of tidal lands below elevation +3 m, ADC would submit to
the Bank for review an economic and technical analysis of the reclamation of
such lands.
Water Supply, Demand, and Quality
4.14      The estimated average annual inflow to the estuary reservoir is
about 1,950 million cu m, compared to an annual demand of approximately
160 million cu m for irrigation and other purposes. The reservoir, with a
gross storage below +1.0 m of 250 million cu m, would supplement the river
flow in months when it falls below the water demand. Operation studies for
the period 1940-72 show that the maximum annual draft on storage was about
60 million cu m (Annex 3).
4.15      Final closure of the estuary dam would take place during a period
of low river flow and salt water would be trapped in the reservoir. In the
following flood season the salt water would be flushed out and studies by
ADC and its consultants indicate that the salinity of the water above the
sill of the sluice, at -7.0 m, would drop quickly to about 500 ppm which
would be suitable for irrigation and many industrial purposes. It would be
some time, however, before the salinity of the reservoir water would reach
that of the natural river flow which is about 100 ppm. Sediment inflow to
the reservoir is estimated to average about 1.2 million cu m/year (Annex 1).
A substantial part of this inflow would be carried through the reservoir
since flow velocities would be sufficient to keep a large part of the load
in suspension. With a dead storage capacity of over 70 million cu m below
the sill of the sluice dam, and assuming 50% of the sediment to be deposited,
it would be over 100 years before any depletion of the active storage would
occur.
Status of Designs
4.16      The design of the major engineering works - estuary dam, sea dike,
pumping station, and irrigation canals - are in sufficient detail to provide
a basis for accurate quantity estimates. The designs are based on up-to-date



- 14 -
1:4,000 maps and a thorough investigation of soils, foundation conditions,
and sources of construction materials. In preparing these designs, ADC has
drawn from its experience on the Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan
600-KO) and Yong San Gang Irrigation Project:Stage I (Loan 795/Credit 283-KO).
Detailed designs of sample areas have been made for each of the various
forms of land development and for tidal reclamation, and these have formed
a basis for quantity estimates. Before proceeding with detailed engineering
and preparation of bid documents, a further review of the designs would be
carried out by consultants to be employed by ADC (para. 5.03), with partic-
ular emphasis on the estuary dam, sluice and navigation lock.
Implementation Schedule
4.17      The project would be implemented over a period of seven years,
including one year of pre-construction activities. Construction of the
access road and the embankment across the left bank tidal flats, to provide
access to the main river channel, began in October 1976. A contract for
the estuary dam and sea dike, including the sluice and navigation lock
would be awarded in late 1977. The estuary dam would be closed in early
1981, salt water would be flushed out of the reservoir during the 1981
flood season, and pumping for irrigation would begin in 1982. Construc-
tion of pumping stations, irrigation canals, and land development would
begin in 1979 and be largely completed by mid-1981. Reclamation of the
tidal lands behind the sea dike would take about two years beginning in
1980. Tidal land reclamation in areas bordering the reservoir would begin
in 1981 after closure of the estuary dam and continue until late 1983.
Cost Estimates
4.18      The total project cost is estimated at US$167 million, of which
US$87 million or 52% is foreign exchange. The relatively high foreign
exchange component reflects the large volumes of earth and rock movement
for which virtually all equipment and fuel has to be imported. Construction
costs are based on quantity and unit price estimates prepared by ADC. Unit
prices were calculated using a standard government procedure which, for each
work item, estimates equipment use (depreciation and operation), labor,
materials and contractor's profit. The unit prices, which include about 10%
for taxes and duties, are in line with recent bid prices for similar work.
Physical contingencies of 20% have been applied to the base cost estimates
for the estuary dam to reflect uncertainties inherent in underwater work
under tidal conditions. Similarly, a physical contingency of 20% has been
applied to tidal reclamation where field conditions cannot be adequately
assessed before the estuary dam is closed. Physical contingencies of 15%
have been applied to civil works, materials and equipment for all other
features of the project. Engineering and administration amounts to about
12% of the construction cost (including physical contingencies). The base
cost estimate, expressed in January 1977 prices, was obtained by increasing
January 1976 estimates by 15% for civil works and 12% for equipment and
services. Costs due to expected price increases over the implementation
period amount to about 33% of total project costs and assume the following
annual rates of price escalation:

Financing
4.19      The proposed Bank Loan of US$95 million would finance the proj-
ect's foreign exchange requirements of US$87 million and interest and other
charges on the Bank loan of US$8 million. Local expenditures, representing
the estimated balance of project costs, would be met through annual Government
budgetary allocations to ADC.
Procurement
4.20      Contracts for civil works construction and the supply of equipment
and materials, except as noted in para 4.21, would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
The total value of all civil works contracts (including physical contingencies
but excluding price contingencies) would be about US$74 million. The estuary
dam, sluice, navigation lock and sea dike would be awarded as a single con-
tract with an approximate value of US$22 million. Other civil works would be
packaged together by areas to form about ten contracts with an average value
of about US$5 million. Major equipment contracts would be the manufacture
and installation of sluice gates (US$12 million) and pumping station equipment
(US$5 million). Contracts for cement (US$2.4 million) and reinforcing steel
(US$2.2 million) would be divided into contracts of about US$0.5 million in
order to keep the supply of materials in line with requirements.
4.21      The domestic construction industry has grown rapidly in recent
years and has demonstrated considerable capacity and competence to perform
major public works in Korea as well as overseas. Most local contractors
are well equipped and are expected to be the successful bidders on all civil
works contracts under the project. ADC's policy is to supply contractors
with the cement and steel to be incorporated in the works. Materials and
equipment would be procured on behalf of ADC by the Office of Supply,
Republic of Korea (OSROK). A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price
of imported goods or the customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended
to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Contracts for the con-
struction of the access road together with the left embankment of the estuary
dam (US$2.5 million), and for buildings and other site facilities (US$0.8
million) would be awarded after local competitive bidding. Miscellaneous
equipment (US$100,000) would be purchased through normal government pro-
curement procedures.
Disbursements
4.22      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment and materials, or at the rate of
100% of ex-factory costs for equipment and materials manufactured locally.
For consultants' services, disbursements would equal 100% of total expendi-
tures. Disbursements for civil works carried out by contractors would be at
50% of total expenditures, to be disbursed against monthly contractors'
progress payments. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by
June 1984. Estimated schedules of expenditures and disbursements are shown
in Annex 6, and the allocation of the proceeds of the loan is shown in Annex 7.



- 17 -
Accounts and Audits
4.23      Assurances were obtained that ADC would maintain separate accounts
for the project and would employ independent auditors, acceptable to the
Bank to audit project accounts annually; and that the audited accounts,
together with the auditor's comments, would be sent to the Bank within four
months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
4.24      The project would improve water quality in the lower reach of the
Yong San Gang through elimination of sea-water intrusion. This would create
a large source of irrigation water for use in the proposed project area and
potential developments to the south and west of the project area. The impact
of the project on fisheries in the estuary of the Yong San Gang and on
sedimentation in Mok Po harbor have been studied by ADC and its consultants.
A survey by ADC showed that about 800 households in the vicinity of the
project engage in fishing to supplement farm income, but nearly all of the
fishing is in shallow coastal waters. Therefore construction of the estuary
dam will have no significant effect on fisheries. As regards effects on Mok
Po harbor, a study by an expert in sedimentation concluded that the estuary
dam would not increase and might, in fact, reduce the annual dredging require-
ment (about 130,000 cu m) in the harbor.
5. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Organization
5.01      The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-autonomous
agency operating under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF),
would be responsible for project implementation. ADC was created by the
Rural Modernization Promotion Law (Law No. 2199) of January 12, 1970, which
merged the Union of Land Improvement Associations (ULIA) and the Ground Water
Development Corporation.  The predecessor   institution of the ULIA was
formed in July 1940. The main activities of ADC are the promotion of agri-
culture through development of land and water resources, and the provision of
technical assistance to Farm Land Improvement Associations (FLIA) (para
5.12). ADC is headed by a president, who is assisted by a vice president,
and a six-man board of directors. The president, who nominates all his staff
including department heads, is appointed by the President of the Republic
of Korea, while the vice president, auditor and directors are appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Chart No. 15825).
Project Implementation
5.02      Responsibility for designs, procurement and construction super-
vision would rest with ADC's Yong San Gang Project Office, which is presently
engaged in implementation of the first-stage project and was primarily



- 18 -
responsible for the Stage II feasibility study. Most of the staff now
engaged on Stage I will be employed on Stage II and additional staff will be
assigned to the project as necessary. The project headquarters, now at
Gwangju, will be moved to new buildings to be constructed at Mok Po. This
approach is in line with ADC's normal policy whereby special units, under a
project manager, are set up with the necessary technical and administrative
staff to implement specific projects. The office would be under the general
supervision of one of ADC's directors.
5.03      ADC would employ consulting firms to assist in project imple-
mentation and in carrying out feasibility studies for future development
of the Yong San Gang Basin. The estimated consultant input is 120 man-months
for project implementation and 80 man-months for the feasibility studies.
The estimated cost is US$6,600 per consultant man-month. In employing these
consultants, ADC would be supplementing its own senior technical staff who
face a considerable workload from ongoing and planned projects and ADC's own
technical assistance activities. Assurances were obtained that ADC would
employ the above consultants on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
5.04      The reclaimed tidal land would be sold in plots of 1.0 ha and
2.0 ha to persons with farming experience. A majority of the purchasers
would be farmers, mostly from other parts of Korea, whose land has been
purchased for public works projects or for industrial development. Assur-
ances were obtained that, before disposal of reclaimed tidal lands, ADC
would submit to the Bank for review a disposal plan including (a) eligibility
criteria for selection of purchasers and (b) terms and conditions for sale of
the lands (para 5.13).
5.05      Land acquisition for right-of-way and property compensation on ADC
projects is handled by the provincial authorities with funds provided by ADC.
Assurances were obtained that land and rights to land and property would be
acquired in a timely manner to avoid any delays in project construction.
Agriculture Supporting Services
5.06      Agricultural services in the project area, described below,
are well organized and would adequately support the farmers in realiz-
ing the benefits of improved irrigation and land development.
5.07      Research and Extension.  The Office of Rural Development (ORD)
is the agency in MAF responsible for research and extension. ORD's
extension work is carried out through province, county and district offices.
The Jeonla Nam Province ORD operates an experimental farm, conducts field
trials, multiplies foundation seed, and supervises the county ORD's. Each
of the four county ORD's serving the project area has 12-15 specialists in
crops, livestock, soils, plant protection, farm management, and oversees
two or three branch offices each staffed by four to six general extension
agents. Excluding specialists, there is one extension worker for 300-400
farmers in the 15,200 ha of presently cultivated land. ORD would employ
additional staff to serve the 5,500 ha of tidal land to be reclaimed; an
assurance to this effect was obtained from the Government.



- 19 -
5.08      Cooperatives.   Almost all supplies of inputs and credit origi-
nating from Government sources are supplied through the cooperative system.
It also handles marketing of a number of crops. Some 90% of farmers in the
project area are members of cooperatives serving one or more villages. These
village cooperatives are successively grouped into county cooperative feder-
ations and ultimately the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation
(NACF). While the Government effectively channels inputs and credits and
assists farmers in marketing farm products through the cooperatives, these
also serve the farmers in making their needs known to the Government. Other
farmer organizations in the project area are the Farm Land Improvement
Associations (FLIA) which operate and maintain irrigation and drainage works
(para. 5.12).
5.09      Fertilizer.   Annual fertilizer use in the project area is pres-
ently about 5,000 nutrient tons (50% nitrogen, 26% phosphate, and 24% potash).
At full development, annual consumption would rise to about 7,000 nutrient
tons. NACF currently supplies all fertilizer through the village cooper-
atives and there would be no difficulty in meeting the additonal demand.
5.10      Seeds.  The Jeonla Nam ORD multiplies foundation rice, barley,
wheat, soybean and potato seed to produce registered seed at the provincial
ORD seed farm. Selected seed growers in the villages then use the registered
seed to produce certified seed, which they sell to farmers. At full develop-
ment the project would use approximately 100 tons of certified rice seed and
100 tons of certified barley seed annually. A new national system for quality
seed supply presently being established with financial assistance from the
Bank (Loan 942-KO) is aimed at improving quality control and expanding pro-
cessing facilities. No problems are expected in obtaining the quantities
of seed needed for the project.
5.11      Credit.   An estimated 15% of project area farmers finance their
requirements of farm inputs and hired labor from their own resources. The
remainder use credit from the NACF, money lenders, millers or relatives.
The NACF supplies approximately 50% of the farmers' production credit needs,
providing six-month loans at 1% interest per month. NACF's annual production
loans in the area amount to some Won 15,000 million (US$3.1 million), and are
limited by budgetary constraints. Credit from other sources is usually much
more expensive, with money lenders charging 3%-5% interest per month. At
full development, about 26,000 farmers would require an estimated Won 3,200
million (US$6.6 million) production credit annually. The NACF project area
operations would have to expand by more than 100% to supply this sum. An
additional US$3.7 million of longer term credit would be required for all
farm machinery purchases. Administratively, there would be no difficulty
in handling the increased volume of credit, provided the funds are made
available. Because of the necessity for production credit to finance the
larger volume of farm inputs under the project, assurances were obtained
that the Government would make the necessary arrangements to finance the
farmers' requirements of farm equipment, inputs, and hired labor.



- 20 -
Operation and Maintenance
5.12      Responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M) of existing
irrigation projects in Korea rests with the Farm Land Improvement Associa-
tions (FLIA). These associations operate as independent units although
their annual operating budgets must be approved either by the Provincial
Government or the MAF, depending on the size of the project. Most FLIAs
also engage extension workers to assist their members. Three FLIAs,
presently operating 5,200 ha in the project area, would be expanded to cover
the additional areas to be developed by the project. The FLIAs would
operate and maintain the irrigation systems, schedule water deliveries,
allocate and collect project charges, and enter into cooperative arrange-
ments with other agencies, such as NACF and ORD, for various kinds of
assistance to the farmers. The estuary dam, sluice, navigation lock and
pumping stations would be operated and maintained by ADC, but the costs would
be borne by the FLIAs. The annual cost of management, operation and mainten-
ance is estimated at Won 35,000/ha (US$72/ha) which includes US$15/ha for
pumping, US$25/ha for maintenance, and US$32/ha for salaries and other
expenses. It is to be noted that the project is staffed not only to operate
and maintain the works but also to collect water charges and assist in
organizing supporting services. Salaries are also set at a high enough level
to attract qualified and experienced personnel. An assurance was obtained
that ADC would prepare by December 1980, and submit to the Bank for review
and comment, a detailed plan for the operation and maintenance of the project,
including proposals for turning over the irrigation service area works to the
FLIAs.
Cost and Benefit Recovery
5.13      Korea has a well established system of charges applying to govern-
ment-planned land development projects. These charges are split into
recurrent or O&M costs, and capital repayments. While farmers must pay full
annual O&M costs, the capital repayment terms vary according to the type of
land development. For example, for irrigation works farmers repay 30% of
capital costs over 35 years at 3.5% interest per year, with an initial
five-year grace period followed by 30 years of repayment. For tidal
reclamation, farmers buy the developed land by repaying 100% of capital costs
(US$6,600/ha) over not more than thirteen years at 7% interest per year with
an initial three-year grace period followed by ten years of repayments. In
addition farmers also pay production taxes of 6% of the gross value of pro-
duction on all foodgrain production above 1.4 ton/farm, and 6% of the gross
value of production on upland crop production above Won 85,000/ha.
5.14      In determining the extent of cost recovery and the relation
of project charges to benefits, two indices have been used, which are
defined as follows for the presenit project:
(a)  Cost Recovery Index:   the ratio of the present
worth of incremental project charges paid by project
farmers to the present worth of incremental project
construction and operation and maintenance costs;
and



- 21 -
(b) Rent Recovery Index: the ratio of the present worth
of incremental project charges paid by a typical farm
family to the present worth of incremental "project
rent" accruing to the family before paying project
charges, where "project rent" is defined as net incre-
mental income less the incremental cost of the value of
family labor, general taxes, depreciation, returns to
management and incremental investments, allowances for
uncertainty and water fee collection costs.
All project charges, costs and benefits are measured at present values
discounted at 10% annual rate of interest over the 50-year evaluation
period, and in terms of 1977 constant prices (Annex 11).
5.15      In the cost recovery analysis, US$105.4 million construction
costs, (base cost estimate plus physical contingencies of US$111.8 million
less feasibility studies and taxes) are charged against the project. Annual
incremental O&M costs are Won 33,600 (US$69)/ha. The present value of
construction and O&M costs, discounted at 10%, is US$79.2 million. At full
project development, and during the period of maximum capital repayments,
incremental project charges total US$8.0 million per year. Discounted at 10%
and assuming no inflation over the project's life, their net present value
totals US$32.3 million, giving a 41% cost recovery for the project. At
annual inflation rates of 5% and 10%, the corresponding cost recovery indices
are 34% and 30%.
5.16      In the rent recovery analysis, indices are calculated for the
existing farms, and for the proposed new farms on the reclaimed tidal land.
For the existing farms, three farm sizes, 0.3 ha, 1.0 ha, and 2.0 ha are
used to represent small, average, and large farms. Two situations are
considered, one where the farms are entirely rainfed at present, the second
where they are partially irrigated. For the tidal reclamation, the proposed
farms would be 1.0 ha and 2.0 ha. Rent recovery varies from 28% to 50% on
the existing farms, and from 71% to 100% on the proposed tidal land farms
(Annex 11).
5.17      Under the Government's present repayment policy, farmers would pay
approximately 30% to 40% of project rent. This is considered satisfactory
because:
(a) although government pricing and subsidy policies
have raised rural incomes relative to urban incomes
over the past five years, it is unlikely that terms
of trade for agriculture will improve much in the
future. The proposed level of charges is therefore
consistent with the objective of preventing a widen-
ing gap between urban and rural incomes;



- 22 -
(b) the absolute level of project charges and general
taxes at full development is considerable, varying
from US$245 to US$375,1fhe on the existing farmland;
and
(c) the collection of water charges in Korea are commonly
greater than 98% of assessments.
5.18       Based on experience gained in selling tidal lands under the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan 600-KO), the proposed annual
charges for reclaimed tidal lands of about US$995/ha are about as high
as farmers would be willing to pay. Thus the rent recovery rates of
70% to 100% are satisfactory. Eligible applicants for the tidal lands
would most likely come from one of the following two categories. First,
farmers who have been displaced from reservoir areas or whose land has
been acquired for industrial purposes. Second, farmers who have small
but valuable holdings and are willing to sell them in exchange for larger
though initially somewhat less productive land. Since the development
cost of tidal land is less than the market value of prime agricultural
land, both groups of farmers should have sufficient capital resources at
their disposal to meet the high annual repayment costs (approximately
US$923/ha plus O&M charges of US$72/ha), as well as finance the cost of
new housing and additional farming implements.
5.19       Assurances were obtained from the Government that project
farmers would contribute to the capital and annual costs of the project
facilities at the levels described in para. 5.13.
6. PRODUCTION, PRICES AND FARM INCOMES
Production
6.01       The project would increase agricultural production through
reclamation of uncultivated land, and more intensive cropping and higher
yields on presently cultivated land. The cultivable area would increase
from 14,600 ha to 20,700 ha through reclamation of 600 ha of forest and
5,500 ha of tidal land. At present 5,200 ha of paddy is partially
irrigated but, as a result of the project, the entire cultivable area
would be fully irrigated. The annual cropping intensity for the project
area would increase from 150% to 177%. Average yields of rice would
increase to 4.6 ton/ha per crop on the rice land and 4.1 ton/ha per crop
on the tidal land; and barley yields to 2.9 ton/ha per crop. Farmers are
expected to achieve these yields five years from the time adequate and
reliable irrigation is established. At full development, about five years
after completion of project works, annual rice production would reach
87,600 tons compared to 32,000 tons at present. Barley production would
increase to 43,600 tons compared to 14,100 tons at present.



- 23 -
Prices
6.02      All prices have been adjusted to January 1977 levels; where
possible crop prices for economic analysis have been based on the Bank's
projections of 1985 world market prices. Thus, the world market price was
used for rice, soybeans, tobacco and fertilizer. In the absence of price
forecasts for polished barley for human consumption, a price equal to 85%
of that projected for wheat flour was used because, based on observed price
trends, this is the price ratio between the two products on the local market.
For other crops, and for farm income analysis, average farmgate prices for
the last five years (adjusted for inflation) have been used.
Farm Incomes
6.03      For the purpose of farm income analysis, three farm models (0.3 ha,
1.0 ha and 2.0 ha) were examined for the presently cultivated land and two
farm models for the reclaimed tidal lands (1.0 ha and 2.0 ha). For the
present condition, land use and cropping patterns broadly reflect averages
for cultivated land in the project area. As existing farmers have about
one-third of their holdings outside of the project area, the project would
affect on average two-thirds of the area of the existing farms. The existing
farms were examined under two present operating conditions: (a) the entire
area rainfed, and (b) the paddy land partially irrigated. The future con-
dition with the project assumes that the existing farmlands would have
irrigation facilities for 67% of the net cultivable area, and the reclaimed
tidal land for 100% of the net cultivable area. The results of the analysis
are summarized below and shown in further detail in Annex 10. Net farm
income is equal to the gross value of production less cash inputs, hired
labor costs, taxes, and irrigation O&M charges and capital repayments; plus
income earned off-farm or from nonfarming sources. Excluding the initial
grace periods, capital repayments would be over 30 years for the existing
farmlands, and over ten years for the reclaimed tidal lands.

/b  This represents income with the project during the capital repayment
period (that is, 30 years for existing farmlands, and ten years for
reclaimed tidal lands).
/c  At present the families who would occupy the tidal lands are assumed to
be earning income, either from farms or from salaries.
6.04      Present net farm incomes vary from Won 295,000 (US$610) on a
0.3 ha rainfed farm to Won 1,435,000 (US$2,960) on a 2.0 ha partially
irrigated farm. Similarly at full development net farm income would vary
from lion 410,000 (US$850) on 0.3 ha to Won 2,085,000 (US$4,300) on 2.0
ha. This represents a 40%-45% income increase, and even allowing for the
additional cost of family farm labor and management (Annex 11), indicates
that the farmers would have sufficient financial incentive to achieve the
projected yields and cropping intensities.



- 25 -
6.05      Although comparisons of farm incomes based on farm budgets with
income data based on national accounts aggregates must be interpreted
with caution, they do present a rough picture of the relative position of
project beneficiaries. With an estimated six persons per family and one
family per farm, present per capita farm income (US$100-US$495) is about
20%-85% of the estimated per capita GNP of US$585. Providing the farming
population remains constant, at full project development in 1989 the
projected per capita farm income (US$140-US$715) is estimated to be some
15%-70% of the then per capita GNP. The project would enable farmers in
the area to roughly maintain the relative position of their incomes with
regard to the national average per capita income. Without the project
this income gap would widen.
6.06      About 45% of the project's farm families (0.6 ha farm or less) are
presently at or below the estimated absolute poverty level of around US$175
(1977 prices). At full agricultural development the project would increase
this group's incomes on average by 40%.
7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The proposed project would increase yields and production on
20,700 ha through irrigation and land development, including reclaiming
of 6,100 ha of forest and tidal land. It would directly benefit some
29,000 farm families or approximately 174,000 people. Although not
included in the economic benefits, the project would provide, through
the estuary dam and reservoir, a road link between Mok Po and the eastern
river side and, providing the reservoir salinity levels fall sufficiently,
a possible source of industrial and municipal water for Mok Po city.
Providing they are feasible the dam could also divert irrigation flows
for future developments in the west and south. The project would support
the Government's policies to attain self-sufficiency in rice and barley
production, and reduce income disparities between rural and urban areas.
7.02      The project's overall economic rate of return would be 13%,
using a fifty-year evaluation period; full project benefits being attained
by 1989, five years after completion of construction; farm-gate prices
for rice, soybean, tobacco and fertilizer based on the Bank's commodity
price forecasts for 1985 expressed in January 1977 constant prices; a
shadow foreign exchange rate; and an average shadow wage rate for unskilled
labor of Won 1,600 per man-day (Annex 12).
7.03      The project's economic rate of return showed little sensitivity
to variations in the cost estimate or assumptions made concerning the
timing of agricultural benefits. It showed most sensitivity to a reduction



- 26 -
in the level of benefits, but in none of the cases tested did the rate of
return for the entire project fall below 10%. On the other hand, if project
benefits turn out to be 25% higher than forecast because of higher commodity
prices, the rate of return would be 15%.
7.04      At full agricultural development the project would result in rice
import savings of Won 10,600 million (US$22 million) annually at the pro-
jected world market price c.i.f. Incheon/Busan (Annex 12). After deducting
the incremental cost of imported fertilizers, chemicals, fuel and other farm
inputs, annual net foreign exchange savings would amount to about Won 7,300 mil-
lion (US$15 million).
7.05      Given ADC's experience with projects of similar scope and complex-
ity, no organization or management problems are expected. Rapid inflation in
1973 and 1974 led to sizable cost overruns on projects initiated in the early
1970s. Inflation is now being brought under control and larger provisions
for price increases have been made for this project and other projects
recently financed by the Bank. The estuary dam is technically the most
challenging feature of the project, but ADC's experience with similar works,
combined with detailed investigations, should keep unforeseen quantity and
cost increases within the allowance of 20% for physical contingencies.
8. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      Assurances were obtained during negotiations on the following
principal points:
(a)  Before inviting bids for reclamation of tidal lands
below elevation +3m, ADC would submit to the Bank for
review an economic and technical analysis of the
reclamation of such lands (para. 4.13);
(b)  ADC would maintain separate accounts for the
project and would employ independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, to audit project
accounts annually; and the audited accounts
together with the auditors' comments, would
be sent to the Bank within four months of the
close of each financial year (para. 4.23);
(c)  ADC would employ consultants to assist in project
implementation and a feasibility study for future
development on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank (para. 5.03);
(d)  ADC would prepare a disposal plan for reclaimed
tidal lands and submit it to the Bank for review
before disposal of such lands (para. 5.04);



- 27 -
(e) ADC would make the necessary arrangements to
ensure the purchase of land and the rights to
land and property in a timely manner to avoid
any delay in project construction (para. 5.05);
(f) ORD would employ additional staff to provide
agricultural extension service for the tidal
lands reclaimed under the project (para. 5.07);
(g) The Government would make the necessary arrange-
ments to finance the farmers' requirements for
farm equipment, inputs, and hired labor (para. 5.11);
(h) ADC would prepare by December 1980 and submit
to the Bank for review a detailed plan for the
operation and maintenance of the project including
proposals for turning over the irrigation service
area works to the FLIAs (para. 5.12); and
(i) Project farmers would contribute to the capital
and annual costs of the project facilities at
the levels described in para. 5.13 (para. 5.19).
8.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$95 million for a period of 17 years including three and
one-half years of grace to the Agricultural Development Corporation with the
guarantee of the Republic of Korea.

YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT: STAGE II
Climate and Hydrology
Climate
1.        Climatological data for Gwangju, which is representative of
the project area, are shown in Table 1. Although 60% of the annual rain-
fall occurs in the June-September rice growing season, monthly rainfall
varies widely and in most years there are periods of 20-30 days when
rainfall is well below crop requirements. Temperatures reach 28oC in
the summer months and fall below freezing in January and February.
The frost-free period is about 210 days.
Hydrology
2.         Streamflows.  Runoff records for the Yong San Gang have been
maintained since 1962 at Na Ju, just above the point where the river enters
the lower basin. ADC has estimated runoff for the period 1940-61 by a
rainfall-runoff correlation. Average annual runoff at Na Ju for the period
1940-1972 is 1,300 million cu m; monthly runoff at Na Ju for the period
1962-72 is shown in Table 2.
3.        The drainage area above Na Ju is 2,063 sq km, hence the average
annual unit runoff is 630 mm, or about 50% of the annual rainfall. At the
site of the proposed estuary dam, the drainage area is 3,471 sq km or 168%
of the area above Na Ju. Annual runoff at the estuary dam, which for
practical purposes can be considered as inflow to the reservoir, has been
assumed as 150% of the runoff at Na Ju. This reflects the flatter terrain
and the large area of paddy which retains rainfall in the lower basin, and
where unit runoff would be slightly less than the area above Na Ju. Thus,
average annual reservoir inflow would be about 1,950 million cu m.
4.        Floods.  The maximum recorded flood at Na Ju in August 1974 reached
a peak discharge of 3,850 cu m/sec and had a five-day volume of 650 million
cu m. This flood was estimated to be approximately equal to a 100-year event.
A flood routing study was carried out by ADC to assess the effect of such a
flood on water levels upstream of the estuary dam. The study showed that,
with a sluice of the dimensions proposed (Annex 2), the estuary dam would not
cause a significant increase in water levels above those observed during the
1974 event. Further studies showed that a larger sluice would not materially
reduce water levels, but a reduction in sluice capacity would significantly
increase flood levels. The proposed sluice would safely pass a much higher
flood than the 1974 event without overtopping of the estuary dam.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.        Annex 4 describes the studies made to assess the effect on the
reclaimed tidal lands of flood inflows to the estuary reservoir. For
these studies the five-day volumes of independent flood events in each
year were taken from daily runoff data at Na Ju for the period 1940-1972.
These were then increased by 50% to obtain estimated inflow to the reser-
voir (para. 3).
6.        Tides.  Tide levels downstream at the site of the estuary dam
summarized below, are based on the Mok Po Harbor Datum (MHD):
Meters (MHD)
High water, spring tide                 +3.7
High water, mean tide                   +3.4
High water, neap tide                   +3.0
Low water, neap tide                     +1.3
Low water, mean tide                    +0.9
Low water, spring tide                  +0.5
7.        Exceptional tides can exceed the above limits.  High water for a
100-year tide is estimated at +4.8 m, and low water at -0.8 m. The crest of
the estuary dam has been set at +8.0 m, so that it would be safe against a
100-year high tide combined with a 30 m/sec (108 km/h) onshore wind.
8.        Sedimentation.  A relationship between suspended sediment load
and river flow was derived from a ten-month period of sediment sampling
at Na Ju in 1967. This relationship, applied to the runoff record for the
period 1940-72, resulted in an estimated average annual suspended sediment
load of 500,000 cu m. Increasing this in proportion to the drainage areas,
the sediment inflow to the estuary reservoir would be about 800,000 cu m.
The bed load, which cannot be measured in practice, was calculated to be
400,000 cu m, or 30% of the total sediment load of 1,200,000 cu m. The trap
efficiency of the reservoir cannot be estimated with any precision but would
be quite low because flow velocities would continue to be fairly high during
floods. Assuming a relatively high trap efficiency of 50% the annual sediment
deposit of 0.6 million cu m would not significantly reduce the gross storage
capacity of 250 million cu m during the life of the project.

ANNEX 2

KOREA
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT: STAGE II
Project Works
Estuary Dam
1.        The estuary dam would serve as a barrier to tidal inflows which
presently render the waters of the Yong San Gang unusable for irrigation
as far upstream as 60 km from the river mouth. With the dam in place, the
flow of the Yong San Gang, which averages nearly 2,000 million cu m per year,
would be available for irrigation of the project area and for diversion to
other areas which may be developed in the future to the west and south of
the project area. The fresh-water reservoir, with a gross storage of about
250 million cu m, would supplement river flows in months when demand exceeds
the river flow. Elimination of high tides in the lower reaches of the river
would also have significant benefits through reclamation of 5,500 ha of
uncultivated tidal land, and improved drainage of some 850 ha of low-lying
rice land.
2.        Design and Construction.  ADC and their consultants investigated
three possible alignments for the estuary dam: Alignment 1, the selected
alignment about 4 km upstream of Mok Po; Alignment 2, about 2 km further
downstream; and Alignment 3, just upstream of Mok Po. Although the main
channel is wider at the selected site than the other alternatives, it has
the advantages of a rock ledge for siting the sluice, a higher bed level,
and shallower depth of silt overlying bedrock.
3.        The dam would consist of a 2,000 m section across the main channel
with a maximum height of 20 m, and 2,500 m section across the left bank tidal
flats with a maximum height of 3 m. Map 12270(R) shows a plan and typical
cross-sections of the proposed dam. The top of the dam at +8 m is set high
enough to prevent overtopping under a combination of high tides and high
onshore winds. The dam has a considerable bed width, about 200 m at the
maximum section, to minimize seepage and prevent "piping" of the foundation.
The maximum head across the dam would be about 6m with a high tide of +4 m
and with the inside pool level drawn down to -2 m in the dry season. This
would be a rare event since the pool would seldom be drawn down below zero,
and the normal head across the dam would be about 4 m. The main structural
feature of the dam is the rockfill section on the seaward face, referred to
in the feasibility report as the "stone mound." The face of this would be
protected by stone set in a matrix of asphalt. The body of the dam on the
reservoir side would be of river sand with stone protection.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        Bedrock over much of the main channel is at about -20 m, and
is overlain by silts, clays, and sandy silts to depths of 8 to 15 m.
The silt layer which occurs mostly in the center of the channel to
depths of 5 to 8 m would be removed under the stone mound and replaced
by river sand. At the site of the sluice and navigation lock on the
left bank, the rock is at -10 m at the lowest point. The overburden
of silt and clay would be removed and the structures founded on rock.
5.        The construction of the dam and the sluice would proceed in
parallel so that the sluice could be used to pass the river flow during
final closure of the dam. The first stage in construction of the dam
would be the dredging of the silt layer and backfilling with sand. The
sand would then be protected against scour by a heavy plastic "mattress"
weighted by a layer of rock. The rock mound would then be placed,
starting on both banks until a closure section is left in the mound
with a level of -2 m and a width of 200 m. Final closure would be
timed to take place in the period between mean tide and neap tide. All
construction equipment would be mobilized to haul and place rocks of up
to 1,000 kg in the closure section. Similar techniques were successfully
employed in the closure of two dams in the Pyongtaek-Kumgang Project
(Loan 600-KG).
6.        The sluice would have 14.3 m x 30 m vertical-lift gates and
a sill level of -7 m. ADC investigated a wide range of sluice dimensions
and that proposed is close to the optimum; a larger sluice would not
significantly reduce upstream flood levels and a smaller sluice would
be a constraint on flood releases and cause prolonged inundation of the
reclaimed tidal lands. During floods, the gates would have to open and
close twice a day (open at low tide and close at high tide). The hoisting
mechanisms would be designed to provide a lifting speed of 0.3 m/minute.
7.        The site was investigated by 11 borings to determine the depth
of rock and characteristics of the overburden. In-place tests of the
foundation were made at 24 locations using the Dutch Cone Apparatus
and numerous laboratory tests were made on samples obtained from the
borings. Materials investigations revealed ample deposits of rock, earth-
fill and river sand for dam construction in the vicinity of the site. A
granite outcrop near the dam site would be used as a source of both coarse
and fine aggregate for concrete; there are no deposits of sand suitable
for fine aggregate.
8.        A navigation lock would be provided to allow normal traffic,
mostly small oil tankers, to pass the dam at any stage of the tide. The
lock chamber would be 30 m x 10 m and be controlled at each end by double-
leaf, vertical-lift gates. Large vessels used during construction would,
on completion of the work, pass downstream through a sluice opening at low
water.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
The Dae Bul Sea Dike
9.        The sea dike, constructed to reclaim tidal flats with a gross
area of about 1,100 ha, would be 4,000 m long and about 8 m high. A
typical cross-section is shown in Map 12270(R). A sluice with six, 3 m x 3 m
gates, located at the south end of the dike, would permit drainage of the
area at low tides. The net area of land developed for farming would be
about 830 ha, after deducting land taken up for canals, drains and roads.
The area would be irrigated from the San Ho pumping station located just
upstream of the dam in the estuary reservoir.
Pumping Stations
10.       The project area would be served by 16 pumping stations with
a total installed capacity of about 15,000 HP. Thirteen of the stations
would be sited around the edge of the reservoir to serve the tidal flats
and the inland areas.  The maximum pumping head would be about 9 m for
the tidal flats and 14 m for the inland areas. Because of the difference
in lift, separate sets of pumps, each with two or three units, would be
provided for each area served by a pumping station. Reserve capacity
would not be provided, but adequate spare parts would be kept on hand to
ensure prompt repairs. Three pumping stations would be constructed to
serve high-level canals feeding some 3,000 ha; maximum lifts would be
about 30 m. Facilities to supply power to the pumping stations would
include 95 km of 22 kV transmission lines and four substations containing
12,500 kVa of transformer capacity. Preliminary designs have been prepared
for all of the pumping stations and associated electrical works.
Main and Secondary Irrigation Canals
11.       The project area would be divided into 16 irrigation units, each
served by a system of main and secondary canals. Main canals would serve
areas of over 300 ha and secondary canals would serve areas averaging
150 ha. Soils are relatively impervious on the canal alignments and only
a few short sections would be lined with concrete. As indicated below,
numerous canal structures would be required because of the irregular
topography:

ANNEX 2
Page 4
12.       Plans, profiles and the type and location of structures were
prepared using 1:4,000 scale maps with 1 m contour intervals. Additional
topographic surveys were made to check the designs of the main canals.
For the secondary canals, checking was limited to field inspections of the
alignment.
Land Consolidation and Tertiary Canals
13.       The project would irrigate 10,900 ha of existing paddy fields.
Land consolidation has already been carried out on 3,300 ha, and would
be provided by the project on a further 3,200 ha where slopes are less
than 2%. On the 4,400 ha which will be without land consolidation,
existing tertiary canals and drains will be improved on 1,900 ha which
are at present partially irrigated and new tertiaries would be constructed
on 2,500 ha which at present are rainfed. Construction and improvement of
quaternary canals would be carried out by the farmers. In Korea, it is
common practice for the farmers to join together in the construction of
on-farm distribution systems. On a block of 850 ha of presently irrigated
land, drainage systems would be improved by repair and realignment of main
and secondary drains. Drainage problems in this area, created by high
tides, would be eliminated by the construction of the estuary dam.
14.       Land consolidation has been carried out on about 200,000 ha in
Korea over the past 20 years. Priority was given to large, flat blocks of
land with slopes not exceeding 0.5%. Under these conditions, earth-moving
quantities were low and uniform standards for the layout of the drains and
farm roads were developed. However, land consolidation is now increasingly
being carried out where slopes are steeper (0.5%-2.0%) and topography is
more irregular. Such conditions have been encountered in recent Bank-
financed projects /1 and attempts to follow standard design procedures led
initially to excessive earthwork quantities. ADC, its consultants, and
Bank staff have devoted considerable attention to the problem. As a
result, design principles have been evolved and are being applied which aim
at minimizing earthwork quantities by adjusting layout to topography.
15.       Of the 3,200 ha of land consolidation, about 80% has slopes
below 0.5%. The ditch-to-drain spacing would be 100-150 m, and individual
plots would be about 30 m wide. Farm roads, 4 m wide, would be located
alongside the ditches. ADC has prepared detailed designs for four sample
areas, each with different land slopes in the range 0-2%, to provide a
basis for quantity and cost estimates.

Conversion of Uplands to Paddy
16.       Of the 3,250 ha of uplands to be converted to paddy, 3,000 ha
are presently cultivated and 250 ha are uncultivated. Some 1,300 ha have
slopes in the 0-5% range and the remainder between 5% and 10%. The land
would be converted into a series of horizontal benches with widths ranging
from 10 m to 20 m depending on slope. The areas to be developed would
generally be narrow strips of land averaging about 150 m wide commanded by
the secondary canals. Tertiary canals and drains would be spaced at 150 m
to 200 m. This type of development has been successfully carried out by
ADC on a number of projects in recent years. For estimating purposes,
designs were prepared from sample areas covering a total of 180 ha.
Upland Irrigation
17.       Of the 1,050 ha of uplands to be developed for irrigation of crops
other than rice, 700 ha are presently cultivated and 350 ha are uncultivated
forest. About 300 ha have slopes in the 0-5% range and 750 ha between 5%
and 10%. Development would include some land clearing and grading. The
area consists of small plots close to the main and secondary canals, and
water conveyance and distribution would be left to the farmers.
Tidal Reclamation
18.       With the estuary dam and sea dike in place, a large area of tidal
flats would no longer be inundated by tides and would become available for
reclamation. Table 1 shows the distribution of the tidal lands according to
ground elevations. Experience elsewhere in Korea has shown that subsidence
of about 0.5 m occurs during the process of reclamation. Therefore, in
Table 1 and the following discussion, the ground levels referred to are
those obtained by deducting 0.5 m from existing levels based on the Mok Po
Harbor Datum. The total net area to be developed would be 5,500 ha as
described below. For planning purposes ADC divided the area into 16
blocks.
19.       Blocks 1 and 2.   These two blocks, with a gross area of 1,105
ha, would be protected from tidal inundation by the Dae Bul Sea Dike.
Lands above +1.25 m are considered available for reclamation. This would
allow gravity drainage at low tide, except for a few days in each month
during neap tides when low water would be about +1.3 m. The net area
reclaimed after deduction for roads, ditches, drains, etc., would be 830 ha.
20.       Blocks 3-12, 14 and 15.  These blocks, with a total gross area
of 5,972 ha, border the estuary reservoir. Since the reservoir will be
at +1.0 m, except during floods, the lowest ground level for land to be
reclaimed has been chosen as +1.5 m. The net area reclaimed would be
4,410 ha. A high groundwater table in the areas up to +2.0 elevation
should not be a serious constraint to agricultural product-ion since the
main crop will be rice; also the groundwater would be of good quality once
the salts have been leached from the soil. During floods, the reclaimed
lands would be inundated for short periods as discussed in Annex 4.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
21.       Block 13.   This area of 423 ha, on the right bank of the
estuary reservoir, has over 200 ha between levels +1.0 m and +1.5 m.
All of the areas above +1 m would be developed by enclosing the area
with a dike and providing drainage pumps. Block 13 would be developed
in this way to serve as a guide for reclamation of similar low-lying
areas in the project area and elsewhere in Korea.
22.       Irrigation and Drainage.   The reclaimed area would be levelled
and a rectangular grid of canals, drains and roads would be constructed.
The layout would be much the same as in areas with land consolidation.
The ditch to drain spacing would be 160 m. The 4 m wide farm roads spaced
at 320 m would have a tertiary irrigation ditch on each side. Borders
would be provided at about a 60 m spacing so that the individual plots
would have an area of 1 ha. A feeder canal extending from the pumping
station along the upper edge of the reclaimed area would supply the ter-
tiary canals. A collector drain would be provided to carry away the flow
from the tertiary drains.
23.       Reclamation Methods.   Temporary drains, about 1.0 m deep and at
20 m spacing, would be constructed perpendicular to the tertiary drains.
In some areas where soils have a fairly high clay content, a lower-cost
drainage system may be feasible using mole drains at about 6 m spacing.
After completion of the canals and drains the area would be flooded with
fresh water. Material from the drains would be used to form dikes to hold
the water on the land. The salts would be leached out by the flow of water
through the soil profile into the drains. It is estimated that it would
take about one year for desalinization to proceed to the point where the
first rice crop would be planted. Yields in the first year would be low
but would improve over three years to levels comparable to long-established
rice lands.

Water Demand, Supply and Quality
Irrigation Demands
l.        Annual water'requirements for rice for the period 1963-73 are
shown in Table 1. Crop consumptive use was estimated by multiplying
observed pan evaporation in the project area by crop coefficients based on
recent experimental data in Korea. Effective rainfall for each month in the
growing season was estimated from daily rainfall records. For the period
1963-73, effective rainfall during the growing season averaged 73% of total
rainfall. The average irrigation requirement for the period is 5,350 cu m/ha.
A typical calculation of monthly demands in an average rainfall year is shown
in Table 2.
2.        The loss due to seepage and operational waste in the main canals
and laterals is estimated at 15%. Below the tertiary outlet the chief source
of loss would be deep percolation, which has been allowed for in estimating
the farm irrigation requirement. In addition, a loss due to operational
waste of 10% in the tertiary systems has been assumed. After taking account
of the above losses, the average nnual diversion requirement (that is the
requirement at the head of the iaain canals) is 6,990 cu m/ha.  Of the
20,700 ha served by the project, 19,650 ha would be paddy and 1,050 ha would
be upland crops. Thus, the average annual diversion requirement would be
about 140 million cu m (assuming upland crop demands are 50% of paddy require-
ments); in a dry year the annual demand would be about 190 million cu m.
Domestic, Municipal And Industrial Demand
3.        The city of Mok Po is presently supplied from the Yong San Gang
at Na Ju through a pumping plant and a 55 km long pipeline. During most
of the year the river flow far exceeds the pumping requirement for Mok Po.
However, by the early 1980's, it will no longer be possible to meet Mok Po
demands during periods of low river flow in the winter months (November-
March). Also, demands fot the city and new industries in the vicinity of
Mok Po will exceed the capacity of the existing pipeline. A reservoir is
therefore under construction at Dae Dong, 45 km north of Mok Po, to augment
the existing deliveries from Na Ju. Projections of industrial growth in
the Mok Po area indicate, however, that additional sources of supply will
have to be developed by the 1990s. As explained below (para. 5), the
salinity of water in the estuary reservoir, particularly in the lower reaches
near Mok Po, may be too high for domestic and municipal use but would be
acceptable for many industrial purposes. Preliminary estimates indicate
that daily withdrawals from the reservoir for industrial use may reach
50,000 cu m (an annual demand of 18 million cu m) by the mid-1990s.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Water Supply
4.        Of the annual demand (dry year) of 190 million cu m, about 30 million
cu m would be supplied by existing reservoirs. The residual of 160 million
cu m would be spread over the four-month period, June through September. The
minimum reservoir inflow for this period is 272 million cu m (1951), and the
average is 1,490 million cu m. On rare occasions the monthly inflow would be
less than the irrigation demand, but the deficit would be easily made up
through withdrawals from the estuary reservoir. The demand for industrial
water would also be easily satisfied from the reservoir during periods of low
inflow (November through March). Operation studies for the period 1940-1972
show that the maximum withdrawal from storage would be about 60 million cu m.
Water Quality
5.        Final closure of the estuary dam would take place in the 1980/81
low flow season. Salt water trapped in the reservoir would mostly be flushed
out during the 1981 flood season. Studies by ADC and their consultants indi-
cate that the salinity of reservoir water at the end of the flood season
would drop to about 500 ppm. This estimate is supported by experience in
the Pyongtaek-Kumgang Project. It is expected that the salinity of the
reservoir would gradually approach that of the natural river flow which is
about 100 ppm, but how long this would take cannot be predicted with any
certainty.

YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT: STAGE II
Effect of Floods on Reclaimed Tidal Lands
Flood Levels in Estuary Reservoir
1.        The estuary reservoir would normally be maintained at +1.0 m, but
there would be a rise in reservoir levels during floods. Levels would be
determined primarily by the volume of flood inflows rather than peak dis-
charges. ADC made operations studies of floods with five-day inflow volumes
of 650, 450, 250 and 150 million cu m as shown in Figure 1. These studies
assume spring tide conditions downstream of the estuary dam; levels in the
reservoir would be lower under neap or mean tide conditions. The sluice
gates were assumed to be open whenever the reservoir level was higher than
the outside tide level, and closed when the tide level was higher than the
reservoir.
2.        In practice, the flood levels over the tidal lands would lag
behind the rise and fall of the levels in the main channel.  As a result,
the peaks and troughs shown in Figure 1 would to some extent be smoothed
out, that is, the depth of flooding would be less than shown but the dura-
tion would be somewhat longer.
3.        Effect of Floods on Rice Production.  Table 1, based on research
in Japan, shows estimated yield reductions due to floods at three stages
of crop growth; vegetative, booting/flowering and heading/ripening. Loss
of production in the reclaimed area subject to overbank flooding (Blocks
3-12, 14 and 15, see Annex 2) for floods up to 900 million cu m is shown
in Figure 2 for the three crop growth stages.
4.        The method used to derive Figure 2 was as follows:
(a) The total net area was subdivided according to ground level
as shown in Annex 2, Table 1 as follows:
Ground Level          Net Area (ha)          % of Total
1.5 - 2.0 m               1,540                  35
2.0 - 2.5 m                1,440                 33
2.5 - 3.0 m                  790                 18

4,410                100



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(b) The portion of each subdivision where the crop would be
submerged by the floods shown in Figure 1 was estimated taking into
account the height of the plant (70 cm at booting/flowering and 100 cm
at heading/ripening).
(c) Based on Table 1, the yield loss in areas inundated was
assumed as follows (flooding was 24 hours or less in all cases);
vegetative              10%
booting/flowering       50%
heading/ripening        30%
(d) For each growth stage, the percentage loss in production
for the 4,410 ha was computed and plotted to obtain the curves shown in
Figure 2.
5.        Figure 2 was used to estimate annual production, as a percentage
of potential production, for the period 1940-1972 (Table 2). Following
reclamation and desalinization, the potential average yield at full
development for the tidal lands is estimated at 5 ton/ha, or potential
production on the 4,430 ha of 22,150 tons. Estimated average annual pro-
duction over the period would be 88% of the potential (19,500 tons).
According to the analysis the minimum production for the period was 58%
of the potential in 1965 when three floods occured during the booting/
flowering stage.
6.        The above estimates of the effects of floods are based on conser-
vative judgments of areas inundated and reductions in yields. However, the
underlying hydrologic analysis is a simplified representation of the complex
hydraulics of the reservoir. Field observations will therefore be made in
the flood seasons immediately following closure of the estuary dam to check
the calculated fluctuations in water levels. Even if no large floods occur
during this period, observations of moderate floods in the 150-250 million
cu m range would provide valuable information.

YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT: STAGE II
Cost Estimates
1.        The principal engineering features of the project - estuary dam,
sluice, navigation lock, sea dike, pumping stations and canals - have been
designed in sufficient detail to permit accurate quantity estimates. ADC
used a standard government procedure to estimate unit prices for each work
item. This procedure is set out in a handbook published by the Government
in January of each year. For a wide range of construction activities, the
handbook provides labor and equipment inputs; prices for labor materials
and equipment; and various coefficients and factors to be employed in the
estimating process. The unit prices computed by ADC for the project works
take into account the revision to basic prices published by the Government
through November 1975 and therefore can be considered as representing
January 1976 price levels. These were then raised to January 1977 levels
by adding 15% for civil works and 12% for equipment and services. The com-
puted prices are in line with unit prices (adjusted for price escalation)
quoted by contractors for ongoing Bank-financed projects. A check of the
ADC quantity estimates showed them to be adequate.
2.        For land development works and tidal reclamation, ADC prepared
detailed designs and quantity estimates for sample areas.  Unit prices
were derived as above and overall per hectare costs were obtained. For
land consolidation and development of upland areas, the per hectare
costs varied according to land slope, and these were then applied to
project areas according to slope categories. The per hectare costs derived
by ADC are consistent with recent bid prices on Bank-financed projects in
Korea.
3.        ADC has surveyed the areas of land to be acquired for construction
of project works. Unit costs for land acquisition in January 1977 prices
are:
Won M/ha      US$/ha
Paddy                         5.4         11,130
Cultivated Upland             2.8          5,770
Uncultivated Upland           0.9          1,860
Compensation would also be paid for houses and farm buildings and for the
removal and relocation of graves. These costs would, however, be small in
relation to costs for land acquisition.
4.        Costs for engineering, construction supervision and administration
were estimated by applying the following percentages:

/1 Including furnished materials.
5.        Physical contingencies amount to 20% of the base cost estimate
for the estuary dam, sluice, navigation lock and sea dike to allow for
uncertainties inherent in underwater construction under tidal conditions.
Similarly, a physical contingency of 20% has been used for tidal reclama-
tion where earthmoving requirements and soil conditions cannot be accur-
ately assessed until closure of the estuary dam. Physical contingencies
of 15% have been applied to construction costs for all other work items.
6.        Expected price increases (Table 3) were computed by applying
the following percentages for annual price escalation:
1977-79    1980-82    1983-84
Civil Works                    12         10           8
Equipment & Services           10          8           7
7.        Project cost estimates are summarized in Table I and further
details for individual project features are given in Table 2. ADC's
estimates are based on detailed bills of quantities containing several
hundred work items. Table 2 presents these estimates in a condensed
form to show the main cost elements of the project features.

Consulting Services
A. Project Implementation
1.        Terms of reference for the consulting services required to assist
ADC in implementing the project are summarized below:
2.        Part 1
(a) Review of designs and cost estimates for the estuary dam,
sluice and navigation lock, with particular reference to:
(i) design and construction procedures for the embankment
across the main channel;
(ii) appropriate span of the sluice gates and their design,
taking into account the need for frequent opening and
closing during floods;
(iii) structural design of the piers and foundations of the
sluice;
(iv) quantity estimates, unit prices and overall costs; and
(v) construction schedule.
(b) Review and summarize quantities, unit prices, and costs for the
main and secondary canals and pumping stations on the basis
of the designs prepared by ADC. The designs should be
reviewed in sufficient detail to ensure that all necessary
structures are included in the cost estimate.
(c) The services under Part I should be completed within three
months from the date ADC notifies the consultants to proceed.
3.        Part 2
(a) Preparation of bidding documents and evaluation of bids.
(b) Supervision of construction of the estuary dam, sluice and
navigation lock.
(c) Inspection and acceptance of equipment and materials
procured for the project.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(d) The deployment of specialists to advise ADC on particular
aspects of the project, including reclamation and develop-
ment of tidal lands, and the design of irrigation systems
for upland areas.
4.        The estimate of man-month inputs shown in Table 1 is intended
to serve as a guide to the consultant in preparing his proposal and would
be developed in more detail during negotiations with the selected firm.
The estimate assumes that consulting services would be required over a
period of five years. Some key personnel would be on permanent assignments
in Korea of varying durations during this period and others would be
deployed on short-term assignments. Staff to be employed on the project
in Korea should have an adequate command of spoken and written English.
B. Feasibility Study for Future Development
of the Yong San Gang Basin
1.        Consultants would be employed by ADC to assist in carrying out
the above feasibility study. Detailed terms of reference would be
prepared by ADC in consultation with the Bank, taking into account the
technical staff available for the study within ADC. This annex outlines
the proposed phasing and timing of the study and presents a preliminary
estimate of the required input of consultants.
2.        The construction of an estuary dam on the Yong San Gang will
create a source of water for irrigation development in areas to the south
and west of the Stage II project area. A feasibility study for future
development of these areas will be carried out in three phases as described
below.
3.        Phase 1:  Project Selection
The two future stages of development of the Yong San Gang Basin
to the south (Hae Nam Bay) and the west (Mu An Bay) would have the fol-
lowing main features:
(a) sea dikes at the entrance to the bays to exclude tides and
allow reclamation of tidal flats;
(b) diversion channels linking the bays to the estuary reservoir;
(c) pumping stations and canal systems to serve presently cul-
tivated lands and reclaimed tidal flats; and
(d) other forms of land development (land consolidation, conversion
of uplands to paddy).



ANNEX 8
Page 3
4.        Preliminary studies place the development potential for Hae Nam
Bay at 21,000 ha (9,500 ha of tidal flats) and Mu An Bay at 30,000 ha
(15,000 ha of tidal flats). Both schemes would involve such large invest-
ments that they would have to be developed in sequence rather than in
parallel. Therefore, the first step in the study would be to decide
which scheme has priority, and would require costs and benefits to be
assessed in sufficient detail to form a basis for such a decision. This
phase of the study should also investigate the feasibility of displacing,
with fresh water from the Yong San Gang, the large volume of salt water
trapped in the tidal basin by the sea dikes. Also of importance would be
an assessment of the social and economic impact of disturbing the existing
shallow water aquaculture in the project areas.
5.        Phase 2:  Project Formulation
After selection of the area to be developed, the next step would be
to formulate the project in further detail. This would involve optimization
of the various elements of the project (that is, capacity of diversion
channels, sluice capacities, alternative dike locations).
6.        Phase 3:  Project Preparation
The final step in the feasibility study would be detailed prepa-
ration of the project. Costs and benefits would be assessed in suffi-
cient detail to form a basis for an investment decision by the Government
and external financing agencies.
7.        Timetable
A proposed timetable for the study is as follows:
Phase 1:      January - December 1978
Phase 2:      January - June 1979
Phase 3:      July 1979 - March 1980
Consultant Personnel
8.        Table 2 shows the estimated man-months of different specialists
ADC would require to assist it in carrying out the study.

Present and Projected Cropping Patterns and Production
1.        The project would increase agricultural production on 20,700 ha
by improved irrigation and drainage on 10,900 ha of existing paddy;
irrigation of 3,700 ha of cultivated upland of which 3,250 ha would be
converted to paddy; and reclamation and irrigation of 600 ha of forest and
5,500 ha of tidal flats. These changes in land use are summarized below:

2.        Present and future yields are shown in Table I and discussed
below. Table 2 shows present and future cropping patterns and production.
Present Cropping Patterns
3.        Of the 10,900 ha of existing paddy land, 5,700 ha are rainfed,
and 5,200 ha are partially irrigated from existing dams and ponds. Land
consolidation has been carried out on about 3,300 ha of the partially
irrigated land. All of the existing paddy lands are planted to rice
in the summer. Rice is transplanted from seedbeds to previously puddled
fields during the last two weeks of June, and harvested in late September
and early October. High-yielding rice varieties (HYV's) are grown on about
50% of the partially irrigated lands, but because of drought risks the
rainfed lands are devoted almost entirely to traditional varieties.
4.        Barley is grown as a winter crop following the rice harvest.
The crop is planted as soon as the soil is dry enough for land preparation
(mid-October to mid-November) and harvested in May. Barley does not



ANNEX 9
Page 2
tolerate excessive soil moisture and is therefore generally confined to
the better drained lands. In areas with land consolidation, which includes
a tertiary drainage system, barley is grown on about 40% of the land. On
the remaining paddy lands, barley occupies about 30% of the area in the
wint -. In rainfed areas, barley plantings are also sometimes reduced in
years when planting of the preceding rice crop is delayed by late rains.
5.        The upland area included in the project covers 4,300 ha of
which 3,700 ha are cultivated and 600 ha are under forest. Soybeans (40%
of the cultivated area), vegetables (30%), sesame (15%), and tobacco
(10-15%), are grown on the uplands in the summer. Barley occupies about
70% of the cultivated uplands in the winter together with small areas of
rape seed. The area presently under forest is used as a source of fuelwood.
Future Cropping Patterns
6.        Without the project there would be no significant change in
cropping patterns. The area planted to HYV's on the partially irrigated
paddy would possibly increase and wider use of early-maturing varieties
might lead to some increase in the area of barley on the paddy lands.
7.        With the project, the paddy land would increase to 14,150 ha
through conversion of uplands, and the area would be fully irrigated. The
area of paddy with land consolidation would increase from 3,300 ha to
6,850 ha. With a reliable supply of irrigation water the area under
HYV's is expected to reach about 70% of the total paddy land. Irrigation,
coupled with a larger area of land consolidation, would give the farmers
better control of crop calendars and increase the percentage of paddy
land under barley to about 70%.
8.        The remaining area of cultivated upland (1,050 ha) would be
irrigated and used more intensively than at present for production of
high-value crops such as peppers, tobacco, and chinese cabbage; double-
cropping of summer vegetables is also expected to increase.
9.        The reclaimed tidal lands would be devoted to rice in the summer
and barley in the winter. With an intensive irrigation and drainage system,
over 60% of the area would be planted to HYV's and barley would be grown on
about 65% of the area in the winter. Since most of the newly-settled
farmers on the reclaimed tidal lands would not own upland areas, it is
expected that about 800 ha of vegetables would be planted, mostly for their
own consumption.
Yields and Production
10.       A reliable supply of irrigation water would lead to  yield
increases for all crops presently grown in the project area. Average



ANNEX 9
Page 3
yields of traditional rice varieties at present are 2.7 ton/ha /1 for
rainfed paddy and 3.2 ton/ha for partially irrigated land. HYV's
under partially irrigated conditions yield between 3.4 and 3.8 ton/ha.
Improvements in water control as a result of the project would raise
yields of traditional varieties to about 3.8 ton/ha, and HYV's to 4.5 to
5.0 ton/ha (the higher figure would apply to areas with land consol-
idation). Barley yields would also increase through irrigation as the
crop is maturing. At present scarcity of water precludes irrigation
of barley. Yields of up to 3 ton/ha /2 should be attainable compared to
an average of 2 ton/ha at present. Vegetable yields which are currently
depressed by untimely and often inadequate rainfall should significantly
increase as a result of irrigation.
11.       The increase in cropped areas and higher yields would raise rice
production from 32,000 tons at present to 88,000 tons at full development
(Table 2). Barley production would increase from 14,000 tons to 44,000
tons.
Development Constraints
12.       The project would bring an increased cropping intensity, a 51%
increase in labor requirements, an increase in mechanized land prepar-
ation and threshing, and a demand for more fertilizer, agro-chemicals,
and facilities for drying, storage and processing. The most important
issues are examined briefly.
13.       Cropping Calendar. Chart No. 16100 shows the typical annual
cropping activities in the project area. Two critical periods occur during
the cropping season. The first is in June, when barley has to be harvested
so that rice can be transplanted, the second in October when rice must be
harvested as quickly as possible so that barley can be sown early enough
to be established well before the onset of heavy frosts. With irrigation,
both the rice and barley crops can be planted at the correct time, avoiding
yield reductions due to late planting and interference with the following
crop. Land consolidation would also improve drainage on ricelands, thus
increasing the area which can be double-cropped to barley.
14.       Labor Availability.  The labor supply is presently a constraint
during the "barley harvesting-rice transplanting," and "rice harvesting-
barley planting" periods. With the project, the increased cropping inten-
sity and production would substantially increase annual labor demand. In
addition, the number of agricultural workers in the area has been declining
/1 Milled rice, assuming a 67% milling yield.
/2 Polished barley, assuming a 75% milling yield.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
over recent years. Land consolidation, which would facilitate mechani-
zation of land preparation, threshing and hauling, would help to offset
this problem. In addition, rice and barley varieties are being bred for
earlier maturity. This would increase the time available at the critical
harvest and planting periods, easing peak labor demands.
15.       Mechanization.  About 20% of land preparation is now done by
power tillers, the balance by animal drawn implements. There are few
four-wheel tractors available. With land consolidation, improved water
management and better access to fields under the project, power tillers
and some four-wheel tractors would be used for an estimated 90% of rice
land preparation, 90% of barley and 100% of other upland crop land prepa-
ration. Rice and barley are cut by hand and either stacked in the fields
awaiting threshers, carried to threshers or hand threshed in the field.
At present, 35% of rice and barley are mechanically threshed with the
drum-loop type thresher. These are usually linked with the power take-off
on the power tiller. Use of the power threshers is rapidly increasing and
it is estimated that 85% of rice and 90% of the barley would be threshed
mechanically in the future. The use of machine powered sprayers is also
increasing rapidly and this is expected to continue in the future.
16.       Drying, Storage and Processing.  Farmers have sufficient sun
drying areas in their villages or at their farms to handle the present
crops. These can be easily expanded for the expected production increase.
On the other hand, farmers have limited rice and barley storage capacity.
NACF has 49 warehouses with a capacity of 21,000 tons in the project area
and plans to build more as part of a nationwide program. There are also
12 private warehouses with a capacity of 4,200 tons. NACF's planned
storage capacity would be sufficient to handle the expected production
increases in the project area. There are 136 rice and barley mills,
mainly privately owned, which have sufficient capacity (30,000 tons/year)
to handle the present crop. However, additional milling capacity would
be required at full project development. This would be provided either
by the private sector or by the Government through the NACF.
Marketing
17.       Over 90% of farmers in the project area belong to village or
county cooperatives and thus can sell their surplus produce through the
NACF. Nevertheless, most farmers sell to private traders. These traders
are usually small scale with inadequate financing and deficient facilities.
The market channels are diverse and frequently include middlemen. Govern-
ment policy is to improve marketing channels by means of increased financial
support for the cooperative organizations, particularly NACF. The government
role in marketing is of considerable importance because it is involved in
the implementation of price policy for farm inputs and produce, the encour-
agement of exports and the procurement of farm produce for government use.
NACF presently markets some 25% of agricultural produce. The Government
plans to increase this percentage in the future and to increase the range
of NACF's marketing services, including modernizing processing and storage
facilities.

ANNEX 10
Page 1
KOREA
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT STAGE II
Crop and Farm Budgets
1.        Annex 9 contains the existing and proposed cropping patterns.
This annex shows:
(a) Production costs for irrigated and rainfed crops at present
and in the future "with" and "without" the project (Tables 1-3). Present
production costs are based on the results of surveys conducted by ADC,
and interviews in the area during appraisal. In the future without the
project, fertilizer inputs would increase moderately (up to 13%), and
agro-chemical use considerably (45% to 75%). Mechanical land preparation
and threshing would also increase (5% to 20%) in rice and barley production.
Future input levels for "with project" conditions are based on recommenda-
tions by the Office of Rural Development, and observed shifts to mechanized
cultivating, threshing, and input-output hauling when irrigation and land
consolidation are provided. Table 4 shows assumed input quantities used in
the present and future situations;
(b) Crop budgets for the present and for the future "with" and
"without" the project (Table 5). All prices have been adjusted to January
1977 levels. Prices used for rice, barley and tobacco are government
purchase prices. As prices for other crops are subject to severe seasonal
fluctuation, prices used were an average of farm gate prices over 1970-75
adjusted for inflation; and
(c) Farm budgets for typical family farms of 0.3 ha, 1.0 ha and
2.0 ha on the riceland and upland areas, and budgets for the proposed family
farms of 1.0 ha and 2.0 ha on the reclaimed tidal land. Labor costs include
only hired labor, not farm family labor, and were determined by calculating
the excess of total monthly labor requirements over an estimated 45 man-days
of family labor per farm per month. Hired farm labor is costed at Won 1,800
per day. As farm holdings are fragmented, the project would affect an average
67% of the existing farms' area. At present, the entire area of small farms
(0.3 ha) is under cultivation, consisting of 67% riceland and 33% upland.
The 1.0 ha and 2.0 ha farms include some 5% uncultivated forest, from 59%
to 62% riceland, and 33% to 36% upland. With the project, all the existing
farms would have irrigation facilities for 67% of their net cultivable areas.
The remaining 33% would be rainfed. The uncultivated forest would be brought
into production for rice and upland crops. In addition, the 0.3 ha farm would
have a slightly higher cropping intensity than either the 1.0 ha or 2.0 ha
farms. The reclaimed tidal land would be split into 1.0 ha and 2.0 ha farms
and alloted between existing small farmers in the area, farmers whose land
would be inundated by the proposed dam, persons with farming experience and
the necessary financial backing to purchase the land, and war veterans. The
tidal land farms would have irrigation facilities for their entire areas.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
With the project, farmers would pay full O&M costs, estimated at Won 34,900
(US$72)/irrigated ha. They would also repay part of the project's capital
costs, calculated for irrigation works as 30% of capital costs over 35
years at 3.5% interest per year, with an initial five-year grace period
followed by 30 years of repayments; and for tidal land reclamation as 100%
of capital costs over thirteen years at 7% interest per year, with an initial
three-year grace period followed by ten years of repayments.

ANNEX 11
Page 1
KOREA
YONG SAN GANG IRRIGATION PROJECT STAGE II
Cost and Rent Recovery
1.        The annex examines the implications for public revenues and
farmers' incomes of the government's policies towards the recovery of
the capital and recurrent costs of the project. In determining the
extent of cost recovery and the relation of project charges to benefits,
two indices have been used, which are defined as follows for the present
project:
(a) Cost Recovery Index: the ratio of the present worth
of incremental project charges paid by project farmers
to present worth of incremental project construction
and operation and maintenance costs; and
(b) Rent Recovery Index: the ratio of the present worth
of incremental project charges paid by a typical farm
family to the present worth of incremental "project
rent" accruing to the family before paying project
charges, where "project rent" is defined as net incre-
mental income less the following incremental costs;
the value of family labor, general taxes, depreciation
of farm assets, returns to management and incremental
investments, allowances for uncertainty, and water
fee collection costs.
The upper limit of the rent recovery index is 100%, but it would normally
be less than that because of political difficulties, tax disincentives,
and costs of collecting taxes. Rent is a difficult concept to measure
in practice but an attempt is made to determine reasonable quantitative
estimates of its various components based on qualitative considerations.
2.        All water charges, costs and benefits are measured at present
values discounted at 10% annual rate of interest over the 50-year evalua-
tion period, and in terms of 1977 constant prices. Costs and benefits
represent financial flows and in determining the cost recovery index,
project capital costs are net of taxes. To allow for inflation in cal-
culating the cost and rent recovery indices, the annual debt service
payments (because they are in nominal terms) are reduced by a fixed
percentage per year.
3.        Korea has a well established system of charges applying to
government-planned land development projects. These charges are split
into recurrent or O&M costs, and capital repayments. While farmers must
pay full annual O&M costs, the capital repayment's terms vary according
to the type of land development. For example, for irrigation works farmers



ANNEX 11
Page 2
repay 30% of capital costs over 35 years at 3.5% interest per year, with
an initial five-year grace period followed by 30 years of repayments; and
for tidal land reclamation, farmers repay 100% of capital costs over 13
years at 7% interest per year with an initial three-year grace period
followed by ten years of repayments.
4.        In the cost recovery, US$105.4 million construction costs are
charged against the project. Annual average incremental O&M costs are
Won 33,600 (US$69)/ha. The present value of construction and O&M costs,
discounted at 10%, is US$79.2 million. At full project development,
incremental project charges total US$8.0 million per year. Discounted at
10% and assuming no inflation over the project's life, their net present
value totals US$32.3 million, giving a 41% cost recovery for the entire
project. At annual inflation rates of 5% and 10%, the corresponding cost
recovery indices are 34% and 30%.
5.        In the rent recovery analysis, indices are calculated for the
existing farms, and for the proposed new farms on the reclaimed tidal land.
For the existing farms, three farm sizes, 0.3 ha, 1.0 ha, and 2.0 ha are
used to represent small, average, and large farms. Two situations are
considered, one where the farms are rainfed in the future without the
project, the second where they are partially irrigated. For the tidal
reclamation, the proposed farms would be 1.0 ha and 2.0 ha. Farm budget
data (Annex 10, Tables 5 and 6) are used to derive the net incremental
income due to the project for each farm size.
6.        In deciding project rent, farm depreciation was calculated at 3%
of the incremental cost for buildings and 2% for land development works.
Incremental family labor was valued at Won 1,600 per man-day, while the
farmers' management was valued at 10% of gross incremental income. The
return on the farmers' own investment was calculated at 10% of its market
value, while an uncertainty allowance of 20% of gross incremental income
was assumed for all farms. As farmers' organizations collect the project
charges, the cost of this was subtracted also from project rent. Production
taxes are 6% of the gross value of grain production in excess of 1.4 ton/
farm on riceland; and 6% of the gross value production after'deducting
Won 85,000/ha on upland. Due to insufficient data, other taxes, such as
import duties and sales tax, were not considered. Under these assumptions
and discounting incremental project rent and charges over the 50-year
evaluation period, rent recovery varied from 28% to 50% on the existing
farms, and from 71% to 100% on the proposed tidal land farms (Table 1).
7.        Assuming that all project rent is spent for consumption and
not saved, the optimum water charges would be zero for those households
with incomes below the absolute poverty level (US$175/capita), and 100%
of the project rent for those with incomes above that level. At present
an estimated 45% of the farmers (0.6 ha farm or less) have incomes below
this level. At full project development an estimated 25% of the existing
farmers (0.4 ha farm or less) would be below the absolute poverty level
if it remains constant in real terms.



ANNEX II
Page 3
8.        Under the Government's present repayment policy farmers would pay
approximately 30% to 40% of project rent. This is considered satisfactory
because:
(a) although government pricing and subsidy policies
have raised rural incomes relative to urban incomes
over the past five years, it is unlikely that terms
of trade for agriculture will improve much in the
future. The proposed level of charges is therefore
consistent with the objective of preventing a widen-
ing gap between urban and rural incomes.
(b) the absolute level of project charges and general
taxes at full development is considerable, varying
from US$245 to US$375/ha on the existing farmland;
and
(c) the collection of water charges in Korea are com-
monly greater than 98% of assessments.
9.        Based on experience gained in selling tidal lands under the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan 600-KO), the proposed annual
charges for reclaimed tidal lands of about US$995/ha are about as high
as farmers would be willing to pay. Thus the rent recovery rates of
70% to 100% are satisfactory. Eligible applicants for the tidal lands
would most likely come from one of the following two categories. First,
farmers would have been displaced from reservoir areas or whose land has
been acquired for industrial purposes. Second, farmers who have small
but valuable holdings and are willing to sell them in exchange for larger
though initially somewhat less productive land. Since the development
cost of tidal land is less than the market value of prime agricultural
land, both groups of farmers should have sufficient capital resources at
their disposal to meet the high annual repayment costs (approximately
US$923/ha plus O&M charges of US$72/ha), as well as finance the cost of
new housing and additional farming implements.

Economic Analysis
Prices
1.        All prices have been adjusted to January 1977 levels.  All farm-
inputs and output were evaluated at projected 1985 farm-gate prices expressed
in January 1977 constant prices.
2.        The farm-gate rice price is calculated as follows:
US$/ton (milled basis)
Forecast 1985 world market price
(in January 1977 constant dollars) /1              375
Ocean freight and insurance                            36
Import price c.i.f. Incheon/Busan                    411
Rice price, project area /2                           411
Value of by-product (straw)                            30
Farm-gate rice price                                 441
(Won 247,000) /3
/1 The commodity price forecast for Thai 5% broken f.o.b. Bangkok in 1985
(in terms of 1974 constant dollars) is US$295/ton. This price was
adjusted to a January 1977 unit value by using a conversion factor
equal to 127 (1974=100). Most of Korea's rice imports are of U.S.
origin and are equivalent to or better than Thai 5% broken in quality.
/2 The value of port handling charges is taken as equal to the value of
inland transport costs. The cost of milling has been assumed offset
by the value of bran produced.
/3 Using a shadow foreign exchange rate of Won 560=US$1.

3.        Since no world market price projection is available for barley
intended for human consumption, polished barley was assumed to be worth
85% of the value of wheat flour, based on observed trends. This ratio
reflects the taste preference of Korean consumers for wheat flour. Prices of
soybean, tobacco and fertilizer are based on the Bank's projection of 1985
world market prices. For the remaining crops, which are not traded inter-
nationally, prices used were actual farm-gate prices averaged over five years
(1971-75) and adjusted for inflation. All prices for internationally traded
commodities were converted from an f.o.b. to a farm-gate basis by adding
US$35/ton, to represent the average value of insurance, shipping and inland
transport to the major market centers minus the cost of transporting the
farm produce to the market centers. Table I shows all present and future
prices used in the economic analysis and farm budget analysis.
Foreign Exchange
4.        Due to the existence of import taxes, quantitative restrictions
and export subsidies, the official exchange rate of Won 485=US$1 understates
the cost to the economy of foreign exchange used in carrying out the project
and savings through increased foodgrain production. According to the results
of studies conducted by the Korea Development Institute, the effective rate
of foreign exchange is about 15% higher than the nominal rate. Therefore,
a shadow foreign exchange rate of Won 560=US$1 has been used to value the
internationally traded commodities and the foreign exchange component of
inputs and construction costs.
Labor Analysis
5.        The demand for labor in the rural areas of Korea is highly seasonal
in character. During the cropping season (April to October) there is little
unemployment and in peak months (June and October) labor shortages may even
develop. As the rural labor force is relatively mobile, the labor market
works fairly efficiently and therefore the observed market wage rate for
the hired labor provides a good estimate of the opportunity cost of farm
labor during the cropping season. Thus labor has been valued at Won 1,800/
man-day during the cropping season. During the winter season, there is
little wage farm employment. There is, however, some self-employment,
notably the weaving of bags from rice straw. The net income from this
activity is about Won 500/man-day and the value has been used as the
opportunity cost of unskilled labor in the winter months, November to
March. For the purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that on the
average, 85% of farm labor requirement occurs during the main season and
15% during the off-season. The resulting weighted average labor cost is
Won 1,600/day.
Benefits
6.        Benefits are estimated from the increased crop production resulting
from irrigation and land development. Annex 10 shows the expected crop



ANNEX 12
Page 3
production costs and labor requirements per ha, while Tables 2-4 give the
expected crop yields, gross returns, and net returns (without accounting
fci labor) per ha. Chart 16100 shows the proposed cropping calendar.
Tpl-e 5 shows the expected annual agricultural benefits at full agricultural
de-oIopment of the project.
Investment Costs
7.        As calculated for the economic analysis and expressed in January
1977 prices, the total investment cost is US$95.6 million. This consists
of civil works (US$58.5 million), engineering and administration, consulting
services, equipment and other (US$36.7 million), and farmers own investment
for the reclaimed tidal area (US$0.4 million). In determining the US$ value
of investment costs, local costs were converted at the shadow exchange rate
of US$1=Won 560 (para 4). Investment costs have been adjusted to exclude
taxes and transfer payments (civil work's cost reduced 10%), and reflect
the use of unskilled labor in off-season periods (civil work's cost reduced
5%). Costs include physical contingencies, but exclude price contingencies.
Estimated annual 0 & M costs are US$67/irrigated ha (financial 0 & M cost
is US$72/ha; the local cost portion is converted to US$ at the shadow
exchange rate). US$1.0 million costs are incurred twice during the project
evaluation period to replace the pumps. The investment costs do not include
any allowance for the farmers' own investment in on-farm development in
areas to be irrigated, as this is a small proportion of total costs, highly
variable between different areas and thus difficult to quantify. As the
work would be spread over several months and would be done at times when
the farmer would be otherwise unemployed, the opportunity cost of this
labor would be small and hence has been neglected.
Development Period
8.        According to the project implementation schedule, the estuary dam
would be closed in January 1981. Allowing one year for the water behind the
estuary barrier to be sufficiently desalinated to allow pumping for irriga-
tion, the 1982 rice crop would be the first grown under improved conditions.
Excluding the tidal lands, project works would be completed so that farmers
could irrigate a net 7,600 ha in 1982 and 15,200 ha in 1983. Commencing
with the first crop grown under upgraded conditions, farmers would achieve
the projected yield levels over five years in equal installments. The
reclaimed tidal land would become available for cropping as follows: 400
ha in 1982, 2,030 ha in 1983; 3,630 ha in 1984; and 5,500 ha in 1985. Crop
yields would reach their maximums over five years, and during this period
the estimated rice yield per ha would be 1.0 ton, 2.5 ton; 3.5 ton; 3.9
ton; and 4.1 ton. The project would reach full development in 1989.
9.        Using the foregoing assumptions and discounting the project's
benefits and costs over 50 years the economic rate of return is 13% (Table 6).



ANNEX 12
Page 4
Sensitivity Analysis
10.       Sensitivity of the rate of return was tested to cost overruns;
reductions and delays in benefits; a reduction in the tidal land reclaimed;
and a 25% increase in project benefits. The effects of these changes
in assumptions were as follows.
Alternative                                Rate of Return
(%)
(a)  A 20% increase in construction costs                   11
(b) A two-year delay in reaching full project
benefits                                               13
(c) A combination of a 20% increase in construc-
tion costs and a two-year delay in reaching
full project benefits                                  11
(d) A 25% decrease in project benefits because
farmers fail to attain projected yields and/or
cropping intensities                                   10
(e) The reclamation of 3,500 ha of tidal land
instead of 5,500 ha                                    12
(f) A 25% increase in project benefits due to higher
commodity prices                                       15
