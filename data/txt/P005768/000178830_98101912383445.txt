YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
APPRAISAL OF
TIHAMA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II (WADI RIMA)
I. BACKGROUND
A. Project Background
1.01      The Government of Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) has requested the
International Development Association (IDA) to help finance an agricultural
development project namely Tihama Development Project II comprising: (i)
agricultural development of Wadi Rima located adjacent to Tihama Development
Project I (Wadi Zabid) which is being developed by the Tihama Development
Authority (TDA) with financial assistance from Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Devielopment (KFAED) and IDA; (ii) construction of a Headquarter's camp for
Tihama Development Authority in Hodeidah; (iii) providing funds for Phase II
of the UNDP project for the Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agricul-
ture, and Phase II of Central Agricultural Research Station (CARS) at Taiz.
The objective of the project is the development of the country's agricul-
tural sector in general and the Tihama coastal plain in particular.
1.02      The Tihama Development Project II (Wadi Rima) is in part based on
an investment plan prepared by the Land Resources Division of the British
Ministry of Overseas Development (LRD/ODM) under the British Technical Assis-
tance program to the YAR. The headquarter's camp for Tihama Development
Authority is based on estimates prepared by the Tihama Development Authority.
The Institutional Support for the Ministry of Agriculture Phase II and the
Central Agricultural Research Station Phase II are continuations of the UNDP's
special support projects, the estimates of which were prepared by the UNDP
and which the Government wishes IDA to assist it to finance.
B. The Agricultural Sector
Present and Future Role of Agriculture in the Economy
1.03      Agriculture is the single most important sector of the Yemen Arab
Republic (YAR). It generates 45-50% of the country's GDP, employs 73% of
the resident labor force, and accounts for more than 90% of the total exports.
The role of agriculture is changing, however, due to the dynamism of other
sectors, emigration of rural labor, and the structural transformation of the
economy as a whole. During the short period of six years (1969/70-1975/76)
for which national accounts are available, the share of agriculture fell
from 53% of total GDP to about 48% (average 50%), and agricultural employment
was reduced by approximately 10%. Nevertheless, agricultural GDP at market
prices increased at an estimated average annual rate of 6.3% during 1979/71-
1975/76, which compares favorably with 8.2% for the economy as a whole.



-2-
1.04      Until the late 1960's most of YAR's agriculture was largely for sub-
sistence, with a marketable surplus sufficient to supply only the basic food
needs of a small portion of the population. It was then estimated that the
sector contributed 70-80% to GDP and employed 80-90% of the economically
active population. Given the relatively low base at which its growth began,
the performance of agriculture during the last few years has been encouraging
in view of the known constraints on the sector (paras. 1.12-1.15), the perva-
sive poverty of most rural areas, and the emigration of rural labor to other
sectors and abroad. A contributing factor is that two favorable periods of
rainfall occurred during the last few years. There are, moreover, clear
indications that agriculture is slowly changing from a subsistence to a mar-
ket orientation.  Indications are that:  (a) area planted in major crops
expanded from 1.1 to 1.4 million ha during 1969/70-1975/76; (b) greater area
was planted in crops such as cotton, fruits and vegetables;.and (c) average
yields of several crops have increased due to the introduction of modern
inputs and equipment, especially in the irrigated areas of the Tihama coastal
plains.
1.05      The years during which agriculture began to demonstrate its capacity
for growth have been too few to affect the pervasive rural poverty of YAR.
Because at least 90% of the country's resident population of 4.7 million in
February 1975 is rural, it is directly affected by the low productivity of
agriculture. Assuming equal distribution of agricultural GDP and no other
source of income from other sectors, per capita rural income amounted to
YRls 545/year (US$121) at 1975/76 prices, or less than one-half of the national
average of approximately YRls 1,125 (US$250). With bare annual subsistence
requirements estimated at YRls 675-700 (US$150-156) per person, of which
YRls 350 (US$78) was for a basic 1,309 calorie diet, the entire rural popu-
lation theoretically lived below the subsistence level in 1975/76.  In the
absence of income distribution and household budget data, it is impossible to
estimate the proportion of the rural population actually above or below the
subsistence level, although 1976 Bank estimates indicated that 80% were below
the poverty level.
1.06      The future role of agriculture is defined only in general terms in
the recently prepared Five Year Development Plan for 1977-81. While GDP of
the economy as a whole is expected to grow at 8.2% annually, the growth of
agriculture is planned at 5.5%. This target seems realistic, although it
implicitly assumes no major setback caused by one or more years of low rain-
fall and that major constraints on the sector can be overcome. Increases in
output of recent years indicate that, barring protracted drought periods the
target could be achieved or even surpassed with the rapid introduction of
yield increasing techniques in well endowed areas.  Rising labor costs due
to the emigration of unemployed and underemployed rural labor are expected
to induce wider adoption of modern technology where natural conditions are
suitable and increase the average productivity of agricultural workers. A
generally favorable economic climate, whereby farm prices reflect high effec-
tive demand and price changes in the economy as a whole, has made farmers
eager to raise yields and output.

Source:  ECWA, Summary of the First Five-Year Plan of the Yemen Arab Republic
(November, 1977).
1.07      During the present Five Year Plan (1977-1981), the rapid growth of
other sectors would reduce the share of agriculture from the average of 50%
of total GDP (at constant 1975/76 market prices) during the last few years,
to 39% in 1980/81, and agricultural employment would concurrently drop from
73 to 69% of the total. If the number of persons employed in the sector
rises, however, from 854,000 to 876,000 as contemplated in the plan, agri-
cultural GDP per worker would thereby decline relative to the national average
and all other sectors. This would have undesirable effects as agriculture
would find it more difficult to retain labor than anticipated in the plan
and real agricultural incomes could decline. Consequently, it is necessary to
accelerate the transformation of the agricultural sector from a subsistence to
a market orientation, based on the utilization of modern inputs and equipment.
1.08      One aspect of agriculture which is of some concern to the authori-
ties is the growing imbalance in agricultural trade, due to YAR's small range
of agricultural exports and its growing dependence on agricultural imports,
especially food. Although almost all (90%) of YAR's exports are of agricul-
tural origin, 80% of its modest export earnings, about US$12 million/year
in recent years, are generated by only three commodities--cotton and cotton-
seed, coffee and hides. The contribution of 13-14 other commodities to
exports is so far insignificant.

1.09      While total exports doubled over the period 1971/72-1975/76 from
YRls 24.7 to 50 million during the period, total imports rose eightfold--from
YRls 204.4 to 1,707 million. Imports of foodstuffs alone rose from YRls 90.9
to 741.6 million, mainly as a result of higher domestic incomes and workers'
remittances from abroad. Approximately 85% of the upsurge in demand for im-
ported food has consisted of cereals, sugar and sugar preparations, fruits and
vegetables, edible fats and oils, which have a relatively high income elastic-
ity of demand due to the low income base at this juncture of YAR's economic
development. Unfortunately, however, neither the agricultural sector as a
whole nor certain specialized production activities such as fruits and edible
oils are yet equipped to respond to the effective demand generated by higher
aggregate personal incomes. Consequently, the country is expected to continue
to expand food imports well into the 1980's, except for a projected small sur-
plus of coarse grains and possible self-sufficiency in red meat.
Trends in Agricultural Production and Resource Utilization
1.10      Although Yemen receives good rainfall compared to the rest of the
Arabian peninsula, its erratic occurrence can damage agricultural production
every two or three years. Consequently, agricultural output has fluctuated
sharply from one year to the next with, for example, a decline of 10% and a
gain of 28% during 1973-75. Nevertheless, even with the short period for
which data is available, it appears that crop production is on an upward
trend. Production during years of good rainfall exceeds that of a previous
similar year, while there has been no precipitous decline in crop production
during low rainfall years. Livestock, fisheries and forestry sub-sectors,
however, have failed to keep up with crop production.

1.L1     The somewhat encouraging performance of crop output is also reflected
in indices of value of production relative to area planted. More than one
factor, however, explains the improvement in crop production: (a) cotton cul-
tivation was expanded in the early 1970's as a substitute for sorghum or millet;
(b) some land was shifted from coffee to higher value qat 1/; and (c) with the
stimulus of external assistance, the use of modern inputs and equipment began
to expand, especially in irrigated areas, for the cutivation of cotton, maize,
sorghum and vegetables.

Prospects for Agricultural Development
The Land Base and Climate
1.12      Even though YAR extends over approximately 20 million ha, its climate
and ecology at the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula along the Red Sea
1/   No qat is grown in the project area.



-6-
limit its agriculture to only about 1.5 million ha which are regularly culti-
vated. An additional 2 million ha of marginal agricultural land is infrequently
cultivated during years of high rainfall. Sparsely wooded areas cover about
1.6 million ha. About 15 million ha are mountainous, desert, and semi-arid
to arid range lands with very sparse vegetation. About 85% of the cultivated
land depends solely on rainfall, 8% (120,000 ha) is supplied with a single
irrigation by spate flood flow and 7% (100,000 ha) is perennially irrigated
from wells, streams and springs.
1.13      YAR has a well-marked rainy season corresponding to the monsoons of
India and East Africa. The monsoon rains, which occur in July-September,
supply the heaviest precipitation of the year. A second, lighter, rainy
season occurs in April and May. Precipitation, however, is by no means
uniform throughout the country and varies considerably from year to year. The
variable topography of the country results in an equally variable rainfall
pattern. In the Tihama along the coast of the Red Sea, the average annual
rainfall is in the range of only about 100-200 mm. Further inland precipi-
tation increases to about 300 mm annually and reaches to more than 800 mm in
upper catchments.
Agricultural Regions
1.14      In spite of the poor overall resource endowment in land and water
and unfavorable climatic conditions, which sharply limit the scope of agri-
culture, YAR has untapped agricultural resource potentials within three of
its four major natural regions:
(a) The Tihama plain, along the Red Sea, has the greatest poten-
tital by virtue of its location, accessibility, abundant land
and reasonably good soils, surface and groundwater irrigation,
and incipiently diversified production, including livestock.
This is the only area of YAR where planted area could be
expanded, assuming improved water management;
(b) The western slopes, between the Tihama and the central high-
lands, are characterized by intensive land use and diversified
production which ranges from sub-tropical to temperate crops.
Virtually all cultivated land is terraced;
(c)  The Highlands, which consist of several ecological sub-zones,
are the "breadbasket" of YAR, with wheat, barley and other
temperate zone crops with long-range potential for improve-
ment in productivity; and
(d)  The Eastern slopes, which represent 40% of YAR's total area,
are poorly endowed in agricultural resources.
Land Distribution and Tenure
1.15      Yemen's agriculture is generally conducted on small family owned
or tenant operated farms. The 1975 census reports that some 800,000 house-



- 7 -
holds are engaged in agriculture, which would mean that the average culti-
vated land per household is 2 ha.  Actural average size of holdings may
range from .25-1.5 ha in the Western slopes to 2-5 ha in the Tihama. No offi-
ci'al data are available on either the number and size distribution of land in
farms nor of sharecroppers' plots. The ownership of agricultural land by
broad classes has been roughly estimated as follows: state owned, 2-3%; Waqf
(religious endowment), 15-20%; and privately owned, 77-83%. It is generally
acknowledged that there is great concentration of ownership of cultivable
land and that tenancy through sharecropping is widely practiced. Estimates
of extent of tenancy range from very low (15-25%) in the central highlands
to up to 40-50% and even 90% in some areas. Owners of even small farms employ
sharecroppers to do the actual farm work.
1.16      Despite the absence of legal security of tenure under traditional
tenancy and sharecropping arrangements, such arrangements tend to be permanent
within cultural kinship groups such as sheikhdoms. With the need to invest in
the modernization of agriculture, however, the terms of sharecropping have
become anachronistic, because under the traditional system tenants are expected
to bear the full burden and risks of higher operating costs and capital expendi-
tures, while sharing with landlords the returns from such outlays on a 50-50,
or less favorable basis when irrigation is utilized. In order to ensure that
tenants' incentives to increase productivity are not stifled cropsharing
arrangements between landlords and tenants need, therefore, to be altered
concerning sharing input costs. The government has stated its intention to
take action in this respect (paras. 5.03 and 6.11).
1.17      The present land distribution pattern and system of tenancy also
clepress rural incomes. Tenants in rainfed areas who typically reap about 450
kg/ha of millet on 5 ha derives, after tax (Zakat), approximately YRls 3,000,
50% of which must be shared with the landlord. This leaves a net income of
about YRls 1,500 (US$333) for a family of 5-6 persons.
iaAor Constraints on Future Development
1.18      In addition to the physical constraints which limit the scope of
agriculture in YAR and those imposed by land tenure, several obstacles stand
:in the way of rapidly achieving agriculture's potential. The lack of comple-
mentary infrastructure, especially rural roads, affects the transition of
agriculture from a subsistence to a market economy probably as much as the
still low level of use of modern inputs. The dynamic growth of the economy
has contributed to shortages of all types, especially skilled and semi-
skilled labor, with escalation in wages that outstrip inflation. Port con-
gestion in Hodeidah delays the arrival of vital equipment and inputs for
agriculture and other sectors, and hence add to their costs. The M4inistry
of Agriculture and other related organizations, which were only established
a few years ago, are chronically short of manpower with the requisite tech-
nical and managerial skills. Credit and extension reach relatively few
farmers.
1.19      Under such constraints the conversion of a traditional and rela-
tively inefficient agriculture in YAR's inflationary climate accentuates the



-8-
difference between high domestic market prices for agricultural products and
the lower Hodeidah cif price of similar imported products. Given the govern-
ment's determination to minimize its intervention in freely determined market
prices, the sector needs time and considerable external assistance, therefore,
to acquire the competitive edge that modern techniques and inputs can give it.
Multilateral and bilateral external assistance is playing an important role
in overcoming constraints in the sector. In addition to four IDA credits for
investment and institution-building which have attracted co-financing from
several sources (para. 1.27). Assistance from the UNDP, United Kingdom, Federal
Republic of Germany, The Netherlands, United States, USSR and People's Republic
of China, has introduced YAR to diverse means of agricultural modernization
during the last few years.
Government Institutions and Development Plans
1.20      Initiatives for the development of YAR's agriculture date back only
to the post-revolutionary years of the late 1960's and early 1970's.  The
earliest efforts were confronted with very little tangible knowledge and the
limited absorptive capacity of the sector due to the constraints summarized
above. Comprehensive planning was deferred until government institutions,
mainly the Central Planning Organization (CPO) and key economic and social
ministries, had the data and the basic manpower to tackle the tasks. A
three-year development program (1973/74-1975/76), however, was formulated,
with 15% of investment allocated to agriculture. For agriculture the main
emphasis was to enhance the absorptive capacity of the sectors' institutions,
acquire basic data, train manpower, establish needed organizations, conduct
resources surveys and undertake a few projects which would also contribute
to long term growth, e.g., Tihama Development I, Southern Uplands Rural
Development.
1.21      During the three-year program, external assistance enabled the
Government to reorganize and strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture, estab-
lish a central research station in Taiz (CARS) with a substation in Ibb, plus
several experimental stations and nurseries. A department of Fisheries was
established within the Ministry of Agriculture. The Agricultural Credit Fund
(ACF) and an Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) were created and will shortly be
merged into a single organization. Agricultural extension was introduced in
both the Southern Uplands and areas under the jurisdiction of the newly
established Tihama Development Authority (TDA). The latter was recently
assigned full responsibility for land and water resources development for
agriculture in the Tihama region. Its survey of the development of irrigated
agriculture in Wadi Mawr, financed under the Tihama I Project, is nearly
completed and others are under way in Wadi Surdud and Wadi Rima. With the
help of both the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds for Arab Economic Development
a feasibility study of Wadi Siham is about to begin. Studies on fisheries,
financed with the help of the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and FAO will be the
basis for a future integrated fisheries project.
1.22      A First Five Year Plan (1976/77-1980/81) was initiated in 1977.
It sets broader objectives for agriculture than the three-year program and
focusses on specific projects. Resources allocated to agriculture are set



-9-
at YRls 2.6 billion (US$587.4 million), or 14% of the total investment outlays
envisaged in the Plan. In achieving a GDP growth rate of 5.5% annually for
crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries, the Plan contemplates public sector
investment among some 50 public sector projects amounting to YRls 856.6 mil-
lion (US$190.4 million), plus YRls 477 million for administering development
in the Tihama and YRls 121.6 million for livestock development. Unspecified
private sector investment in agriculture would amount to YRls 980 million
(US$218 million).
1.23      Irrigated agriculture and areas with adequate rainfall are assigned
high priority in seeking to raise yields, diversify production and, to a lesser
extent, expand area planted, as follows:

1.25      For agriculture, implementation of the Plan will depend on consider-
able external financing.  Approximately YRls 1.5 billion, 55% of total outlays,
would be financed from domestic sources, of which 18% (YRls 263 million) would
be from government, and the rest presumably by the private sector. External
financing on the order of YRls 1.2 billion (US$265 million) would be sought.
1.26      Due to the continuing acute shortage of skilled manpower and the
time needed to edusate and train Yemeni technicians and administrators for
agriculture, the Government is aware that the staffing gaps to implement the
Plan will have to be filled with expatriates.  About 85-90 high level expa-
triates will be needed in agriculture plus those needed to fill posts that
would normally be held by Yemeni counterparts. This situation is expected
to persist well into the 1980's. As a result of massive efforts in the edu-
cational sector, however, manpower constraints in middle level skills such
as extension and credit should ease somewhat in the early 1980s. During
Plan period, other constraints such as port congestion, agricultural market-
ing and those related to land tenure are expected to also ease.
Previous Bank Assistance to the Agricultural Sector
1.27      The Bank's role in the development of YAR's agriculture has sig-
nificantly contributed to institution-building and filling the financial
resource gap. Up to date IDA has provided about $41 million to help finance
four projects in agriculture and agro-industries. It has helped introduce
extension, credit, improved crop varieties and farm inputs to increase pro-
ductivity. In addition to its financial support the Bank is acting as
executing agency for the UNDP-financed project under which substantial
institutional support is given to the Ministry of Agriculture (para. 1.30-
1.31). Furthermore, in view of the increasing costs of projects and limited
IDA funds available, the Association has helped attract other donors--e.g.,
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED), the Abu Dhabi Fund for



- 11 -
Arab Economic Development, the Netherlands, the U.K., the Saudi Fund for
Development--to co-finance projects.
1.28      The first IDA agricultural project, the Tihama Development I, co-
financed with the Kuwait Fund, should be completed on schedule (December 31,
1978), in spite of start-up difficulties and cost overruns in its early years.
The original IDA credit for this project of US$10.9 million and the KQuwait
Fund loan of $6.4 million had to be supplemented by US$10.3 million and US$9.6
million, respectively, because of cost overruns.  A second project, the South-
ern Uplands Rural Development Project, financed with an IDA credit oE $10 mil-
lion and co-financed with $10 million from the Abu Dhabi Fund, is progressing
very satisfactorily. The third project for Grain Storage and Processing,
financed with $5.2 million from IDA and $11 million from the Saudi Fund, is
progressing well. A fourth IDA credit of $5 million, approved in 1976, for
a Livestock Credit and Processing Project, is co-financed by the Kuwait Fund,
with $11.6 million, the Netherlands, $8.9 million, and the United Kingdom,
$2.4 million. Since overcoming start-up difficulties during the first year,
mainly due to cost overruns, delays in contracting consultants, securing land
for farms and abattoirs, and securing counterpart Yemeni staff, this project
is now progressing satisfactorily.
1.29      The proposed project in Wadi Rima builds upon the experience acquired
in nearby Wadi Zabid under Tihama Development I. Wadi Rima will benefit from
the administrative and technical capability of the TDA, developed under the
first Tihama project, especially the crop variety trials, agricultural train-
ing and extension services, plant protection and agricultural credit. The
project will also benefit from the applied research conducted by CARS in Taiz.
1.30      Moreover the Bank has been executing agency for one of twc, UNDP
projects to assist the Government in overcoming the lack of an effective
agricultural infrastructure and the acute shortage of skilled agricultural
manpower at all levels.  The UNDP approved the two projects in 1973, namely:
(a) Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture, executed by the
Bank; and (b) The Central Agricultural Research and Training Organization,
executed by FAO.  The duration of both projects is five years and they are
due to close on September 30, 1978 and June 30, 1978, respectively.  The
project documents foresaw the need for the continuation of the projects.  The
objectives of the projects are briefly as follows:
(a)  Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture:  To
create an agricultural service which would facilitate effec-
tive utilization of the country's own resources and of
external assistance in the fields of agriculture and enhance
the capability of the Government to absorb an increased amaount
of foreign technical and capital assistance for agricultural
development.  To this end some seven experts were employedl to
assume definite responsibilities within the Ministry of Agri-
culture and train their counterparts.
(b)  The Central Agricultural Research and Training Organization,{J-
Taiz.  To establish an agricultural research organization,                 -
t-- f. ,,t

including research stations, in the Ministry of Agriculture.
The research station was organized on a discipline basis and
included divisions of agronomy (field and vegetable crops),
horticulture, plant breeding, entomology, plant pathology,
soils and water, economics and statistics and administration.
A training component was included for fellowships as well as
for the training of local extension agents for the agricul-
tural projects underway in the Taiz area. A small extension
component was also included. To this end 17 experts were
employed out of 22 originally planned.
1.31      In general both projects achieved their objectives but at a slower
pace than was anticipated because of the financial constraints experienced by
UNDP and the acute shortage of suitably qualified Yemeni counterparts. All
parties concerned are unanimous as to the need for both projects to be con-
tinued for a second five-year phase, the more so because of the ambitious
agricultural component of the First Five Year Plan. This will require a well
organized, trained and expanded Ministry of Agriculture to implement the pro-
gram supported by an expanded and coordinated applied agricultural research
program, covering the whole country, and stressing a commodity approach to
applied research on the major crops.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Location
General
2.01      Tihama is the YAR's coastal plain, 30 to 60 km wide, paralleling the
Red Sea.  It is crossed by seven major wadis which originate in the western
slopes of the country's highlands and flow westward to the sea. The Project
activities for the Tihama Development Project II would be concentrated in
Wadi Rima which is about 80 km southeast of Hodeidah, the main port and com-
mercial center of YAR (Map IBRD 13401). The Project would cover a gross area
of about 64,000 ha out of which about 24,000 ha is regularly or periodically
cultivated. This area is adjacent to the Wadi Zabid area which is presently
being developed by Tihama Development Authority (TDA) under the IDA/KFAED
financed Tihama Development Project I. The area does not have any known
mineral resources, though ample scope exists for its agricultural development.
Climate
2.02      The climate of the Wadi  Rima area, like that throughout the Tihama,
is hot and arid. From weather data collected in and around the Project area,
mean monthly temperatures are estimated to range from 24 0C during the coolest
months to 35 0C during the warmest months. Severe dust storms occur from



- 13 -
February to July. Average annual rainfall varies from about 350 mm in the
eastern part of the Project area to about 100 mm in the west. Average rela-
tive humidity ranges between 50% to 70%. Despite the relatively high coastal
humidity, annual evaporation is about 2,500 mm.
B. Resources
Water Resources
2.03      The main source of surface water in the Project area is Wad:i Rima
itself, which drains about 2,500 km2 upstream of the main irrigated area.
The catchment comprises mountainous terrain with an average annual raLnfall
of about 400 mm. Wadi flows have been monitored at Mishrafa (just upstream
of where Wadi Rima leaves the hills) and the best estimate of the mean annual
discharge at this point is 80 Mm3. This equates to a runoff of about 9% from
the average rainfall of 400 mm in the catchment. During the dry season, from
October to March, the base flow at Mishrafa fluctuates between 0.25 to 1 m3 per
sec. A short flood season occurs between March and May and contributes about
25% of the Wadi's annual flows. The main flood season of 3-4 months' duration
begins about July and contributes about 50% of the annual flow. In most years
the entire surface flows are consumed by irrigation and seepage to the
aquifer and no water reaches the sea. The Wadi Rima water has quite low
salinity concentration with conductivity measurements between 300 and 600
micromhos/cm and is very suitable for irrigation. The present irrigation
system comprises 25 main canals, fed by low rubble and brushwood deflectors
in the upper reaches and earth dikes in the lower reaches of the Wadi. The
present diversion and distribution system needs improvement to provide assured
and rotational supplies to cultivators for optimum utilization of available
water for irrigation. The Government, with bilateral assistance from the
Kingdom of Netherlands, is undertaking an engineering study for improving the
existing irrigation distribution system.  ODM in their studies had considered
coinstruction of gabion bed stabilizers in the wadi bed to improve the wadi's
diversion system. However, as the diversion capability of the proposed bed
stabilizers, the structural strength of the gabions under spate flow condi-
tions and the hydraulic performance of the design were not proven, ODM have
proposed hydraulic model and prototype studies of the gabion bed stabilizers
before adopting the concept.
2.04      Unconfined aquifers exist under the entire Project area with the
water table varying from the ground surface near the coast to more than 90 m
depth at the eastern end. The main known source of the aquifer recharge is
the Wadi, followed by deep percolation losses from irrigation fields. No
information on any direct contribution from the mountain front is available.
The study's estimate of recharge from the Wadi and the fields is about 40 Mm3.
There has been a rapid increase in ground water abstraction for irrigation
over the last decade and the present total abstraction is estimated at 45 Mm3.
The water quality under most of the area is good with conductivity values
less than 1,000 micromhos/cm equivalent to a salt content of about 775 mg/l
which represents an acceptable salinity hazard for irrigation. Further



- 14 -
monitoring and ground water evaluation work is required to firm up the estimate
of annual recharge and to observe changes in the sea water/fresh water inter-
face, as affected by the abstraction in the pump irrigated area.
Land Resources
2.05      The Project area which lies below the mountain front and associated
spurs comprises an extensive featureless sedimentary coastal Plain with
alluvial fans merging into the western alluvial plain and sloping almost
imperceptibly towards the Red Sea. Towards the coast variation is provided by
discontinuous expanses of sand dunes. The lower dunes which generally border
the irrigated areas are partially stabilized by a thin vegetation cover of
salvadora bushes. In wadi-irrigated areas, the land surface is bunded to form
irrigation basins.
Geology
2.06      The main Wadi Rima valley is floored by unconsolidated bouldery and
cobbly alluvium several meters thick flanked by a series of alluvial terraces.
The coastal plain consists of entirely sedimentary deposits which, away from
the mountain front, are at least 200 m thick.
Soils
2.07      Generations of spate irrigation on the alluvial fan, which extends
about 20 km from the mountain front, has led to the accumulation of uniform
silty surface deposits. These soils are medium to fine textured with infil-
tration rates from moderate to moderately slow. The soils of the alluvial
plain are in contrast more variable and range from sand to silty clay loam.
Infiltration rates in these soils vary according to their surface texture
and are generally moderately rapid. As regards soil properties they are
generally low in organic matter content (<1%) in all surface horizons. High
calcium carbonate content (about 10%) characterize Wadi Rima soils leading
to an alkaline reaction with a pH range 7.5-8.0 and reaching 10 in some sodic
soils adjacent to the coast near Al Mujalis (date plantations). Detailed soil
analysis by ODM revealed that total nitrogen content is very low (0.1%) while
total phosphorous and exchangeable potassium are moderate to high. Available
phosphorous is low due to fixation by free calcium carbonate. Micronutrient
levels are suspected to be rather low due to the high pH.
Land Use
2.08      The cultivated land (24,000 ha) comprises three main categories:
(i) pump irrigated land (4,000 ha); (ii) spate irrigated land (8,000 ha);
(iii) dryland farming (12,000 ha). The pump irrigation has mostly developed
in the last decade. Presently there are about 350 individually operated pumps
irrigating about 4,000 ha. The spread of pump irrigation has largely been con-
fined to a central area within the Project (Map IBRD 13401) where, due to rela-
tively shallow water table, the benefits of installing the pumps are most
immediate. Sand dunes form natural limits to further expansion to the south
and west. Development in the east has not yet extended beyond the line where



- 15 -
the depth of water table exceeds 45 meters. The areas irrigated by spate flows
vary from year to year with an average of 8,000 ha per year. Out of this about
800 ha receive perennial irrigation and about 2,400 ha regular spate irriga-
tion. In the perennially irrigated areas farmers plant three crops a year
and receive about three irrigations per crop; in the regular spate irrigated
areas, they average about two crops a year with two irrigations per crop.  The
rest of the spate irrigated area receives only one irrigation to one crop a
year. Average cropping intensity for the wadi irrigated areas is about 1.53
and for the well irrigated areas 1.66.

2.09      The Project area is inhabited by some 44,000 people (1975 census)
living in about 200 villages and hamlets, only five of which have populations
exceeding 1,000. More than 90% of the population is engaged directly in agri-
culture.  About 6% of the population is working abroad.  Despite increases in
family incomes from remittance of those working abroad there is widespread
pov(erty in Wadi Rima. The average agricultural income of 5,800 poorest
families, or 77% of the 7,500 families in Wadi Rima, was estimated to be
YRls 3,400 in 1977. At 1977 prices this is equivalent to YRls 585 (US$130)
annually per person, which is well below the estimated 1976 per capita income
of US$250 for YAR and less than the US$150 minimum subsistence requirement
(para. 1.05). For approximately 2,250 landless families and some 1,100 small
tenants, the situation is worse than the foregoing. Their 1977 per capita
income was estimated at YRls 517 (US$115) and YRls 337 (US$75), respectively.
Under these conditions, life is bleak and its prospects unpromising, especially
for women and children. Children receive little or no schooling and there is
no access to medical facilities except in Zabid, which is out of reach of
most villages. There are few indications of change in the role of women.
They perform all household tasks and menial farm chores, including fetching
water over long distances, which can consume several hours each day.
C. Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.10      No cadastral surveys or records of land titles are available.  Gen-
erally, however, holdings in Wadi Rima are small. Sample data collected by
ODM shows that 45% of the holdings are less than 5 ha and 80% less than 10 ha.
Only two holdings in the Project area exceed 250 ha - one of which is a state
farm run by the Ministry of Agriculture and is exclusively share cropped.
The other is a private family holding operated mostly by tenant farmers.
2.11      By tradition the tenancy rights are secure and in most cases the
tenancy passes from father to son. The beneficiaries are only interested in
receiving their share of the produce rather than getting involved in manage-
merit problems. The sharecropping arrangements prevailing in Wadi Rima are
tabulated below:

Shares are apportioned after deducting the local development tax of 2.5% and
the Government tax (Zakat) of 10% in spate irrigated and 5% in well irrigated
area. Tenants provide farm labor and bullocks and the cash inputs such as
seeds, fertilizer and pesticide.
D. Infrastructure
Roads
2.12      Except for the one tarmac road connecting Hodeidah with  Taiz, which
bisects the area from north to south, no roads exist in the area. During the
dry season some earth tracks and canals are used by vehicular traffic for
haulage of goods to and from the villages but in the wet season access to
interior areas becomes very difficult and hazardous. Camels and donkeys are
generally used for hauling the farm produce to the local market places at
transport rates which are about twice as high as those of motor vehicles.
Water Supply
2.13      Domestic water is mostly obtained from communally owned open wells
though, where available, water is also taken from irrigation channels and wadi
flows. Water collection is an arduous process. A typical family of six spends
about five manhours a day queuing, drawing and transporting water for them-
selves and their livestock. The water consumed is often inadequate in quantity
and unhygienic in quality.
Local Institutions
2.14      TDA is responsible for developing agriculture in Tihama (para. 4.01).
Its activities are currently concentrated in the neighboring Wadi Zabid. The
farmers of Wadi Rima have indirectly gained from TDA's experimental programs



- 17 -
on variety trials and improved agronomic practices. The only other local
institutions working for the development of Wadi Rima and the adjacent areas
are Local Development Associations (LDA's), one for each subgovernorate, with
a limited program of building small schools, funding water supplies and con-
structing minor access tracks. There are presently two LDA's in the project
area. These LDA's receive 50% of the Zakat plus 2.5% Cooperation Tax collected
frcom the area for their developmental activities. These associations are in
thetir infancy and are handicapped by the absence of technical expertise on
their staff. They have so far constructed six primary schools in the project
area.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Design Features
Objectives
3.01      The project objectives are to:  (i) increase agricultural production
andl farm income by providing technical assistance and facilitating use of farm
inlputs and marketing of the farm produce; (ii) undertake short-term studies for
crop and cost sharing arrangements, rehabilitation of date and banana planta-
tions, farm mechanization, marketing and base line survey; (iii) improve the
health of rural poor by providing potable water supply to a population of about
44,000; (iv) evaluate the ground water and surface water potential oiE the proj-
ect area for its future optimal use; (v) investigate a low cost solution for
water diversions from Tihama wadis to the irrigation fields; (vi) provide a
headquarters for the Tihama Development Authority; and (vii) assist the
Government to meet the foreign exchange costs of the UNDP Phase II projects
for the Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Central
Agricultural Research Station at Taiz.
Description
3.02      The project provides for:
(i)  agricultural development of Wadi Rima which includes:
(a) agricultural services, including technical assistance;
(b) short and medium term agricultural credit;
(c) construction of about 106 km of gravel access roads;
(d) construction of water supply installations for 64
villages or groups of villages;
(e) hydrometeorological monitoring;
(f) construction of a gabion test structure;



- 18 -
(ii) construction of a headquarters for TDA at Hodeidah; and
(iii) funds for the combined second phases of the UNDP's Institu-
tional Support and the Central Agricultural Research Projects.
Detailed Features
Agricultural Services
3.03      Shortage of technical manpower and inadequate knowledge of the
productive effects of the agricultural inputs at the field level are major
constraints to the development of agriculture in YAR. To alleviate this con-
straint in the project area the agricultural services would provide: (i) ser-
vices of three expatriate experts in the fields of extension, plant protection
and animal health for internal training of a cadre of workers in these disci-
plines and setting up an effective extension, plant protection and animal
health service; (ii) 30 man-months of short term consultancy services for
studying problems relating to cost and crop sharing arrangements; banana and
data palm plantations' diseases; farm mechanization; the marketing of fruit
and vegetables and, base line survey of the existing social and economic con-
ditions; (iii) 100 man-months of practical overseas training to extension
agents and Yemeni counterparts; (iv) two demonstration farms in the project
area; (v) offices, stores and tubewell for demonstration farms and seven exten-
sion centers and eight residential houses for the staff, and (vi) operational
equipment for extension; plant protection and animal health services.
Agricultural Credit
3.04      Better tillage of land and the use of fertilizer, plant protection
chemicals and locally developed high yielding crop varieties would be the key
to the productivity improvements in the project area. The project, through
the Agricultural Credit Fund (ACF), would provide to the farmers: (i) short
term credits for purchase of base requirements of fertilizer, chemicals, seeds
and small farm implements for the first year of development and the incremental
requirements for subsequent years; and (ii) medium term credit for purchase of
farm machinery and equipment. ACF would also ensure availability of the re-
quired fertilizer and chemicals and other farm supplies by arranging their
import and selecting sale agents in the local markets.  TDA, through its exten-
sion service would provide information on their requirements and application
techniques. The Wadi Zabid unit of the ACF would be strengthened by an expa-
triate assistant field manager, two credit supervisors and five other staff
members for accounting and secretarial services. The project would also pro-
vide an office building and transport vehicles for the unit.
Access Roads
3.05      No roads exist in Wadi Rima, though several earth tracks criss-cross
the area. To provide access to the important population centers in the area
and facilitate the movement of agricultural inputs and produce into and out
of the area, the project would provide 106 km of gravel access roads connected
to the Hodeidah Taiz road which bisects the project (Map IBRD 13401). Descrip-
tion of the roads is in Annex 1.



- 19 -
Water Supply
3.06      The provision of water for domestic use coincides with the Govern-
ment's objective of raising the welfare and living standards of the rural
population. At present domestic water is obtained from communally owned wells
or from irrigation channels and Wadi flows where available. Water pollution
is widespread. Wells are open topped and liable to contamination. Waterborne
diseases known to be endemic in Tihama include amoebic dysentry, cholera and
hepatitis. The water collection system is time consuming. Under the project
a water supply unit is envisaged with responsibility for detailed planning and
implementation of improved water supplies. The design would be tailored to
the individual need of the villages but would be drawn from six model water
supply systems (Annex 1, page 2). In all it is proposed that 68 installations
of one or other of these systems will serve 64 village clusters (Map IBRD
13401) and provide potable water supply to about 44,000 people.
Hydrometeorological Monitoring
3.07      The hydrological investigations so far undertaken in Wadi Rima have
gone some way in determining the major characteristic of the aquifer but have
not provided a comprehensive understanding of the groundwater balance. The
limited number of pumping tests made have shown the aquifer characteristics
to be very variable and there is a need for further measurements of trans-
missivities. The expansion of the monitoring program commenced by ODM and now
maintained by TDA is also necessary to: (a) measure the changing water levels
in wells which lie north of the project area and are fed by groundwater
from Wadi Rima; and (b) assess the magnitude of seepage to sea and changes in
the seawater/freshwater interface, as affected by continued abstraction in
pump irrigated areas. To meet these requirements the project would provide
for: (i) the services of an expatriate groundwater hydrologist for super-
vising the monitoring program initiated by ODM and its proposed extension,
and evaluating the growing body of data relating to the hydrology of Tihama as
a whole, (ii) installing pump testing and subsequent regular monitoring of a
production borehole and two observation boreholes near the coast, and (iii)
installation of up to 10 observation boreholes at locations to be selected by
the project hydrologist for determining the quantum of seepage to the sea and
additional transmissivity and storage coefficient values where new iwells are
installed in the project area.
Gabion Test Structure
3.08      Construction of comparatively low cost gabion bed stabilizers has
been proposed by ODM for water diversions from wadis to the canals in Tihama.
The proposed gabion structures hydraulically differ from the traditional stone
masonry or concrete diversion weirs in two ways: (i) they do not have a
raised crest for heading up supplies and diverting them into the canal head
regulators which, in traditional designs have crests higher than the river
bed to prevent excessive silt induction into the canals; and (ii) t'hey do not
have any energy dissipation devices on the downstream side. The bed level
of the canals is proposed to be depressed below the average wadi bed levels



- 20 -
to induce the flows into the canal. The diversion capability, the hydraulic
performance and the structural stability of such designs is not proven and
hence, in spite of their apparent lower costs the designs need to be tested
prior to large scale use. ODM has proposed, and the Yemen Government has
endorsed the proposal that hydraulic model studies be made to test and prove
the diversion capability and hydraulic performance of the proposed designs
and, a prototype gabion bed stabilizer be constructed to test the structural
strength and behavior of the gabions for at least two full flood seasons
under actual flow conditions. The laboratory model studies would be con-
ducted by ODM and financed under the project together with the construction
of one gabion bed stabilizer. ODM would provide the design of the structure
and specifications of the gabions material, obtain quotations and arrange for
its shipment. It would also provide technical assistance and construction
supervision in the field. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the Government would furnish to IDA a report on the test results of model
studies to be conducted by ODM and ensure that the specifications, plans and
site of the prototype gabion structure be submitted to IDA for its comments
before construction is commenced.
TDA's Headquarter's Camp
3.09      Tihama Development Authority (TDA) was established by the Government
in 1973 by legislation to execute the IDA/KFAED financed Tihama Development
Project I which was the first IDA project in Yemen. According to its Charter,
TDA is also responsible for the implementation of all agricultural development
projects in the Tihama plain on behalf of the Government and their subsequent
operation and maintenance. Its present headquarters are at Wadi Zabid towards
the southern end of the plain, where accommodation is inadequate and medical
and educational facilities lacking. The Yemeni staff and the expatriates
employed in lieu of Yemeni staff have been provided only bachelor accommoda-
tion and have to live away from their families. TDA has, accordingly, been
finding it very difficult to recruit and retain qualified Yemeni staff for the
execution of Tihama Development Project I. On the completion of Tihama Devel-
opment Project I in December 1978, TDA's sphere of activities would increase
markedly. It would then be operating Tihama Development Project I, implement-
ing Tihama Development Project II and supervising the preparation work of Wadi
Mawr, Wadi Surdud and Wadi Siham projects. The movement of TDA's headquarters
from Wadi Zabid to Hodeidah is now necessary to centralize the staff in rela-
tion to the expanding and overall development of the Tihama plain. The exist-
ing accommodation in Wadi Zabid would be used by the Wadi Rima project's
field staff and the Wadi Zabid project's operational field staff. The head-
quarter's camp comprise about 35 houses, an office building, storage enclosures,
a warehouse, a car park and a vehicle repair shop including utilities such as
electricity, water supply, sewage and internal roads. The Government would
provide land for the construction of the camp. The transfer of the land
required for headquarters, to TDA free of all encumberances would be a con-
dition of effectiveness. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that
the plans and specifications of the buildings and utilities to be constructed
in the camp would be submitted to IDA for review before procurement.

Continuation of UNDP Projects
3.10      The second phase of the UNDP Projects of Institutional Support to
the Ministry of Agriculture and CARS would essentialy continue the objectives
of the original UNDP ProJects (Rara. 1.30).  Under the Second Phase of the
Institutional Support greater emphasis would, however, be placed on coor-
dination of current and future project activities together with the monitoring
arLd evaluation of on-going projects, and forestry would also be covered. The
expert team would be increased from seven to ten.  The  Secon  Pha         __ h
applied agricultural research project will build on the institution, training
and basic'r' icuitura.i woirk"''e's't"abl'ished under=the 'original UNDP project.  It
will r   TVrNecoordinating as well as directing the applied agricultural re-
search work on secondary research stations in various ecological zones, namely
South and North Tihama, Central and Northern Uplands, from the Central Research
Station        1oier pn   '''Taiz, established under the o-'g'Ina'l UNDP
projec-t,  It will assist to disseminate applied research results to:farmers
by demonstration and liaison and through extension services of bilateral and
multilateral projects.  It will continue the training of extension agents
until such time as the education project under development becomes opera-
tional. It will also assist and advise the Agricultural Research Cotncil of
the Ministry of Agriculture being set up under the First Five Year Plan. The
expert team would comprise the project director and 13 experts in agronomy,
extension, agricultural economics, soils, plant pathology, entomology, horti-
culture and animal husbandry, together with 15 junior experts.
3.11      The Government has proposed that the financing of the foreign ex-
change costs of YRls 53.53 million (US$11.89 million) of the Second __
the two UNDP projects be met jointly by UND  and the Government under a cost-
aiar_ing arrangement.  The Government has requested IDA's assistance to meet          '
its foreign currency financial obligations. The local currency costs; of
YRls 55.16 million (US$12.26 million) would be met from the Governmernt's
own resources as under the current phase of the projects. The Government has
also indicated to the UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen thatethe Second
Phases of the two projects be amalgamated and the World Bank be a:sWed7-to
L 'WcEhe         ga epo2 h                                        Bank Ii as,
informeXd-U DP that it would be prepared to' consider being designated as
executing agency for such a project.  Draft documents for the Second Phases
have been received from Yemen and are the basis for the cost estimates (para.
3.14).
Engineering Status
3.12      The engineering requirements of the project involve the alignments
and designs of the access roads and the water supply systems and the designs
of the buildings to be constructed under the Project. The alignments of the
proposed roads follow the established tracks and their embankments and culverts
would be constructed to the same standards as the Wadi Zabid roads, for which
the type designs exist. The residential buildings would follow the type
designs of Wadi Zabid buildings, and the extension centers the type designs of
the Southern Uplands Project. The water supply systems would be designed by



- 22 -
the engineering unit of the project. The plans and specifications of the
gabion test structure would be supplied by ODM after model testing the diver-
sion capability of their proposed gabion bed stabilizer. The estimates for
civil works have been based on feasibility level--designs.
implementation Schedule
3.13      The Project would be implemented in about five years in accordance
with the schedule in Chart WB 18541. Project activities would commence by
September 1978 and all the civil works and the procurement of equipment com-
pleted by June 1981, while the agricultural services and credit activities
in Wadi Rima project and the Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agri-
culture and CARS activities would continue till June, 1983. Except for the
UNDP's components for which the Bank would be the executing agency, TDA would
be responsible for implementing the project.
B. Costs and Financing Arrangements
Cost Estimates
3.14      The estimated cost of the project including contingencies, based on
end 1977 prices, is YRls 177.9 million (US$39.5 million) excluding YRls 55.16
million (US$12.26 million) being the local costs of the second phase of the UNDP
projects (paras 3.11 and 3.15). Its foreign exchange component is estimated
to be YRls 116.0 million (US$25.8 million) or 65% of the project costs. Out
of this US$1i.--million,are for-financing the secondphase of UNDP's pro
of  Instfitutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture andthe CARS.  The
costs of imported equipment and material reflect current international market
prices. The costs of the access roads and the buildings construction are in
accord with the current civil works contract costs in the Tihama. The works
of water supply installations, hydromet monitoring and gabions test structure
have been costed as force account works.  Physical contingencies have been
taken as 10% on equipment and all civil works. This allowance is considered
to be adequate as the type designs for the civil works are the same as for
Tihama Development Project I and the topographic conditions are uniform.
Price contingencies allow for annual increases of 7.5% in the period 1978-1979
and 7% thereafter in the costs of equipment, foreign exchange component of
civil works and administration costs; also they allow for annual increases of
43% (3% per month compounded) in the local cost component of the civil works.
The higher rate of contingencies in the local cost of civil works is due to
high rate of inflation on the cost of labor and local commodities in Yemen.
Total contingencies (physical and price) on Wadi Rima and TDA's headquarters
-omponent-&-sre_abQut 41% of the base cost.  Physical and price contingencies
hk ebeen_included in the UNDP project costs.> Import duties, taxes and other
levies are not incldde'd-i-n-the~--project costs as they are not charged on equip-
ment imported by TDA for public projects. Consultants' services have been
costed at US$44,000 per annum plus free housing, utilities and transportation.
Project costs are summarized in the table below, while detailed costs of
project management, agricultural services, water supply installations, and
equipment are given in Annex 2.

Financing
3.15      An IDA Credit of US$10.5 million on standard terms would finance
about 40% of the project's foreign costs or 27% of the project's total costs.
European Economic Community Special Fund (EEC) has committed US$1.22 and UNDP
US$1.5 million (11% of project's foreign costs) for part financing of the CARS
and Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture Phase II Projects. A
parallel loan of US$12.55 million expected from an external source would
finance the remaining 49% of the foreign costs. The Government of YAR would
finance all the local costs including US$12.26 million equivalent for the
local costs of the second phase of UNDP projects (para. 3.11) which is not
included in the financing plan summarized below:

A condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit would be the signing by the
Government of a loan agreement, with the other external source of financing.
C. Procurement and Disbursement

project, the civil works for the agricultural services, the hydromet monitor-
ing and the gabions test structure (US$1.97 million) 1/ are small in size and

bidding. They would thus be constructed by TDA either through force account
or through Government's local procurement procedures which are acceptable.
TDA, assisted by the expatriate staff provided under the project, would have
sufficient administrative and technical capability for executing these works.
The construction of the TDA's headquarters camp at Hodeidah (US$5.11 million)
and procurement of all IDA financed equipment (US$1.04 million) would be
done through international competitive bidding in accordance with "Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans and Credits" except for some minor
items costing less than US$50,000 each required for immediate use whose
aggregate value would not exceed US$200,000, which would be procured through
the Government's local procurement procedures. The contract for TDA's head-
quarters is expected to be won by any of the expatriate firms working in
Yemen. Qualified domestic Civil Works Contractors would be accorded a
7 1/2% preference when comparing bids with those of foreign contractors.
The expatriate project staff would be recruited internationally and during
negotiations assurances were obtained that their qualifications and terms of
employment would be acceptable to IDA. All procurement of IDA-financed goods
wouild be performed by TDA. Procurement for UNDP projects would follow UNDP's
procurement rules. For remaining items financed by the other external source,
procurement will be in accordance with its own rules.
IDA Disbursement
3.17      The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against IDA financed
components of the project over five years as follows:
Civil Works                       46% of the total cost of TDA's Headquarters
US$3.05 million                   and 30% of the total cost of other civil
works.
Equipment and Supplies            100% of foreign expenditure of the di-rectly
US$1.04 million                   imported goods and 80% of local expenditures
for imported goods purchased locally.
Salary Cost and Training          100% of foreign expenditure on foreign experts- 
US$2.14 million                 -.and training.
Contribution to UNDP Projects   36%>f. foreign exchange expenditure payable
US$4.27 million                   every six months in advance.
3.18      Disbursement requests would be supported by full documentation
except for force account, which would be disbursed against statement of
expenditures duly certified by TDA's internal auditors, the supporting docu-
ments of which would be retained by the executing agency and be available
fox review by supervision missions. TDA's audit and accounts organization,
which is assisted by an expatriate financial advisor, has sufficient insti-
tutional capability to undertake procurement using certificate of expenditure
prccedure. Estimated schedule of disbursement is in Table 3.3 and schedule of
annual expenditures in Table 3.4.

Co-financier's Disbursement
3.19      The US$12.55 million from other external source may be disbursed
as follows:
Civil Works                       46% of the total cost of access roads and 30%
US$3.04 million                   of the total cost of other civil works.
Equipment and Supplies            100% of CIF value directly imported goods and
US$2.25 million                   80% of the cost of imported goods procured
from local market.

US$2.18 million
ACF Experts                       100% of foreign expenditure of expatriate
US$0.18 million                   experts.
Contribution for UNDP Projects  41% of foreign exchange expenditure payable
US$4.90 million                   every six months in advance.

D. Accounting
Accounts and Audit
3.20      TDA and ACF would maintain separate accounts of the project which
would be subject to regular internal audits, and also annual audits carried
ou[t by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. During negotiations, assurances
we're obtained that: (a) separate accounts would be maintained for project
funds by the executing agencies which would have regular internal audit and
would, in addition, be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA; and (b) a copy of such annual audit reports would be sent to IDA within
four months of the close of each fiscal year.
Environmental Impact
3.21      The project will have no adverse effects on the physical environment.
On the other hand, the provision of improved water supply will reduce the
present health hazards from the existing inadequate and unwholesome water
supply system. The road construction program would allow isolated villages
easier access to markets and medical facilities. Increased production of
vegetables and protein would help improve the diet and health of the human
environment. Although plant protection chemicals would be used, no adverse
effects are expected. The extension agents would be trained by the project
experts on the safe handling and use of plant protection chemicals.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization and Staffing
4.01      The Tihama Development Authority (TDA) would implement the Project.
I'DA was created by the Government of Yemen Arab Republic as a semi-autonomous
body through the enactment of Law No. 2 of 1973 to operate as a developmental
agency for the Tihama region with all necessary powers for projects; imple-
mentation. TDA has a board of directors whose chairman and members are
appointed by the Government. The chairman of the board is also the general
manager of TDA. He is assisted by a management advisor and a financial
expert. Posts of three directors have been provided in the Authority to head
the engineering, agricultural and administrative departments. The engineering,
agricultural and the administrative staff required for implementing the Wadi
'Rima Project would be attached to the respective directorates (Chart W.B.
18542). Because of paucity of trained personnel in YAR it would not be possi-
'ble in the immediate future to fill the senior posts of the Wadi Rima imple-
mentation unit with experienced Yemeni personnel. Consequently, positions
would be filled, in the first instance, by expatriate experts provided under
the project, who, in addition to implementing the project would train their
counterparts and junior Yemeni staff in their respective fields. These latter



- 30 -
would, on completion of development, assume responsibility in their respec-
tive fields for operation and maintenance of the project. An assurance was
obtained during negotiations that selection of senior personnel needed to
implement the project would be completed by December 31, 1978.
Engineering Services
4.02      The expatriate engineering staff for the Wadi Rima unit would in-
clude a senior civil engineer, a senior hydrologist, a design engineer, two
field engineers and a pump installation foreman. The senior civil engineer
and the senior hydrologist would both be university graduates with at least
12 years of experience in their respective fields. The other engineers,
who would also be university graduates, would have a minimum of 8 years of
experience in their respective fields. The rest of the engineering staff
would include two junior engineers, a junior hydrologist and a team of 12
inspectors, draftsmen, surveyors, pipe fitters and meteorological recorders.
The senior engineer would be in charge of the construction unit and work
in close association with the director of TDA's engineering department.
B. Agricultural Services
4.03      The expatriate staff for the agricultural services unit of Wadi
Rima would include an extension expert, a plant protection expert and a
veterinarian. Present training facilities at Zabid would be used for train-
ing of extension agents. Two groups of about 30 candidates each with at
least four years of schooling, selected from the project area, would be
enrolled during the first and the second year of project implementation for
extension training. Criteria for selecting trainees, training program and
curricula would be coordinated with the ongoing training programs at the
CARS for Southern Upland Project area. A total of 22 extension agents and
18 technicians, all selected from the trainee graduates, would be employed
in the project area for the extension work and to work in demonstration and
research farms in association with the project's expert and the experts from
CARS. Training and transport equipment has been provided for the extension
service under the Project.
Extension Centers and Area Covered
4.04      To provide adequate extension coverage, seven extension centers
will be established in the project area at Basat, Al Madan, Ad Dimnah,
Al Ghawadir, Al Husayniyah, and Al Mahatt, and three extension agents
assigned to each. Each extension center will include a fertilizer and
pesticide store, office, and living quarters for the senior extension agent
responsible for the center. These centers would provide a focal point
for disseminating extension activities. Each extension center would super-
vise about 1,700 ha with about 570 ha/extension agent. They would train the
farmers in field preparation, water application, fertilizers and pesticides
use and disseminate results obtained in demonstration and research fields,
and help farmers prepare farm plans to apply for credit from ACF.



- 31 -
Demonstration Farms and Extension Facilities
4.05      For field demonstrations of crop production under spate and well
irrigation practices two demonstration farms would be established. Al-
Jarubah farm (about 15 ha) would demonstrate cultural practices, research
results and extension recommendations for spate irrigated, and Al-Husayniyah
farm (20 ha) for well irrigated crops especially fruits and vegetables. The
project would provide office space, farm sheds, farm equipment (including a
tubewell), and operational staff for the demonstration farms. Extension
equipment and visual aids including a cinema van, would also be provided
for disseminating extension information.
Applied Research
4.06      Under the second Phase of the Central Agricultural Research Station
in Taiz, CARS would be responsible for the direction of applied research in
Tihama. CARS's experts will plan, implement, and supervise research experi-
ments in Wadi Rima using facilities at Al-Jarubah and Husayniyah demionstra-
tion farms. Five local or expatriate counterparts 1/ will be housed at the
Zabid camp to help CARS's experts in executing research programs in coarse
grains, cotton, oil crops, forages and horticultural crops. The total number
of counterparts will be eight (five for applied research, two for extension
and one for veterinary activities).
VEterinary Services
4.07      The main objectives of introducing veterinary services in Wadi
Rima are: (a) to diagnose the incidence of rinderpest, parasites, and other
in,fectious diseases which are prevalent in the area; (b) organize vaccination
campaigns for livestock, train extension agents in helping farmers control
disease and parasites; (c) advise farmers on the importance and methods of
improved animal nutrition; (d) train a counterpart to assume responsibility
for veterinary services before the end of the project. A veterinary center
at: Husayniyah (75 m2) will be established to serve the project area. Funds
for veterinary equipment, including a mobile clinic and supplies, have been
included in the project. Veterinary activities will be initiated, planned
and implemented by a senior veterinary expert and an experienced cotuter-
part. In the absence of animal health activities in neighboring wadis,
including Wadi Zabid, the veterinary center at Al-Husayniyah is expected to
serve a wider area than Wadi Rima. Veterinary programs and activities would
be coordinated with other related Government projects and bilateral programs.
Short-Term Consultants
4.08      A total of 30 man-months of short-term consultants would be required
to study and make recommendations in connection with the following problems:
1/   An expatriate counterpart is a qualified expatriate employed by the
Government in lieu of qualified nationals until such time as suitable
nationals become available.



- 32 -
(a) Sharecropping arrangements. At the request of Government,
eight man-months of consultant time is provided to recom-
mend alternative criteria and guidelines for cost and
cropsharing between land owners and tenant farmers in the
Tihama. The new guidelines and criteria would provide
incentives for tenants to use yield increasing inputs,
thus increasing the incomes of both land owners and tenants.
This would require an agricultural economist with adequate
background in land tenure systems of the region, and/or
a lawyer with extensive practical experience in this
subject;
(b) Banana production. A fruit spotting disease is causing
losses in banana production. One or more consultants
(agronomy, plant pathology, entomology) are provided
for a total of six man-months to study the problem
and design experiments to be carried out by CARS, and
prescribe appropriate treatments;
(c) Date palm production. About 1,000 ha of date palm planta-
tions adjacent to the coast near Al-Mujalis are deteriorating
mainly due to the rising water table and salinity. Four man-
months by a date expert experienced in soil drainage or in
association with a soil drainage expert are provided to
examine the problem and outline recommendations for rehabili-
tating date production.
(d) Farm mechanization. Growing labor scarcity is inducing
farmers to mechanize their operations with equipment which
is frequently inappropriate in type and size. In order to
preclude the uncoordinated purchase of oversized and uneco-
nomic tractors and farm equipment a consultant would be
contracted for a total of three months. The British team
for mechanization in Taiz is undertaking work in this field
and its cooperation would be enlisted by the consultant in
outlining appropriate agricultural mechanization for Wadi
Rima;
(e) Fruits and vegetable marketing. Well irrigated areas of
Wadi Rima are producing horticultural crops, especially
during the winter and spring. Lack of experience with
efficient handling, grading, packing, and general market
coordination in Wadi Rima requires technical assistance
in these aspects. A six-month study to coordinate supply
from Wadi Rima and demand in urban areas is provided;
(f) Study of base-line data. In order to study the base-line
data of Wadi Rima's agriculture and social conditions,
and recommending appropriate monitoring and evaluation
techniques for the project, a three-month consultancy
service of a rural sociologist is provided.



- 33 -
Training and Fellowships
4.093     Funds for 100 man-months of short-term overseas training for the
extension agents and the counterparts in project related disciplines have
been provided. Training would be of a practical nature, to supplement formal
and field instruction provided in Taiz and Wadi Rima, respectively. The
trainees would be assigned for short periods to countries where appropriate
facilities exist to observe actual demonstrations and extension techniques
for crops and conditions similar to those of Wadi Rima. The choice of
training programs and selection of candidates would be made in a manner
satisfactory to IDA. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
TDA would present to IDA a detailed training program, including qualifica-
tions of the candidates, by December 31, 1979.
Agricultural Credit
Credit Requirements
4.10      Total project credit requirements, excluding contingencies, are
estimated at about YRls 9.9 million -- around YRls 7.5 million for short-term
and YRls 2.4 million for medium-term credit. Estimates for short-tern credit
needs are based on expected demand for the first year plus annual incremental
cost of inputs to the fifth year. Medium-term estimates are based on farm
models. To enable ACF to begin operations in Wadi Rima on schedule with suf-
ficient liquidity, the government, not later than December 31, 1978, would
advance directly, or from the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB), YRls 2 million
to establish a revolving fund to finance the credit needs of the first year.
An assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
Organization and Management
4.11      The Agricultural Credit Fund, which now is the credit channel for
all four IDA agricultural projects in YAR (para. 1.29), would be responsible
for the credit aspects of the Project. Specifically, the ACF office in Zabid
would be directly involved. This office is now responsible for Tihama I
credit activities. Except for some initial delays in starting the credit
operations in Wadi Zabid, its performance in loan processing and in time
recovery of over 95 percent of the loans has been very satisfactory. In view
of its expected increased operations, the present staff of a field manager,
two credit supervisors, and clerical staff would be augmented by an expatriate
assistant field manager, two other credit supervisors, and additional support
staff as may be necessary (para. 3.04). Present office space and equipment
in Wadi Zabid are limited and, therefore, under the Project, funds would be
provided for an office building cum residence for the field manager (around
140 m2), transportation facilities, and office equipment.
Lending Policies and Procedures
4.12      Short-term credit would finance additional inputs such as seeds,
fertilizers, pesticides, as well as small, relatively inexpensive farm



- 34 -
equipment such as small sprayers, and parts for pumps and motors for existing
wells. Medium-term loans would be for tractors (limited between 40 to 65 hp)
and tractor implements, seed drills, and four combines. Short-term loans
would be charged interest of not less than 9% per annum while those for
medium-term would be not less than 8%. Maturity terms would be on the basis
of cash flow projections (based on individual farm budgets); accordingly, it
is expected that short-term loans would be for up to 12 months, while invest-
ment loans would be for up to seven years including one-year grace period.
With the current rate of inflation in YAR, the ACF interest rates are obviously
negative. Prevailing interest rates, however, apply to previous projects and
are applied nationally by both ACB and ACF. Moreover, the Government has
repeatedly indicated that it would not raise interest rates, as the inflation
is due largely to the inflow of remittances from Yemeni workers. Consequently,
although higher interest rates would be justified under normal circumstances,
the increase would have to apply nationally and be part of a comprehensive and
coordinated review of monetary policy. For the purpose of this project, the
small amount of agricultural credit involved and its allocation between short
and medium term loans, suggest that prevailing rates, though negative, will not
have wide repercussions. In the financing plan proposed, the foreign exchange
component of agricultural credit would be provided by the co-financier.
4.13      Lending procedures would follow current ACF procedures.  These
have been revised and improved through the years, and IDA have found them
progressive and highly satisfactory. For instance, short-term production
loans are given on the basis of assistance provided to farmers by extension
agents in preparing loan applications, and the certification by extension
workers as to the adequacy of the borrower's plans for the planting season
relative to updated estimates of costs of production and prices. As a result,
such loans take just one or two days to approve. Loans for inputs of no
more than YRls 350 (about US$78) are processed even faster. Upon certifica-
tion by extension agents as to the type and quantity of inputs required,
distribution agents (village merchants), contracted by ACF, simply provide
the farmer with his supplies. In the case of medium- and long-term loans,
ACF procedures are decentralized. Sub-project evaluation and loan approval
and disbursement have been given to various levels of field authority down
to managers of ACF sub-branches, resulting in overall efficiency and effec-
tiveness. In the matter of collateral, loans to tenant farmers are given
directly without the intercession of landlords, while loans to YRls 10,000
(about US$2,200) can be given on the strength of two signatures. Likewise,
the improvements being financed are considered as collateral, thus increasing
loan availability.
Procurement and Distribution of Inputs
4.14      Farm inputs would be procured by ACF and provided to farmers through
village agents at ACF-determined prices. Village agents would be contracted
for this purpose, as in the Southern Upland project. As custodians of the
inputs they would be responsible for their proper storage and would be account-
able for all supplies. In addition they would collect for sales (short-term



- 35 -
loans) made under the arrangement described in para. 4.13. For these respon-
sibilities, distribution agents would be paid an agreed margin of t'he price
of input sold; this arrangement has proven to be effective in SURDU, which
now uses it. ACF closely monitors these arrangements by twice-mont'hly cash
collections and inventory control. Regarding tractors and other long-term
equipment, these are available in YAR. The availability of spare parts and
t'he adequacy of facilities for equipment maintenance would be considered in
selecting particular makes. An assurance was obtained during negotiations
that ACF would arrange procurement and distribution through village merchants
or agents of the farm inputs required for the project.
C. Operation and Maintenance
4.15      The continued supply of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals
would be an important maintenance aspect of the project. Their requirements
would be determined from year to year and, in general, approximate the quan-
tities consumed in the last year of project implementation. An assurance
was obtained during negotiation that after the implementation of the project,
the Government would ensure annual procurement and distribution of fertilizers
and plant protection chemicals in an amount equivalent to at least those
levels at which such inputs were applied in the last year of project imple-
mentation.
Access Roads
4.16      The access roads, after their construction and, until they are
transferred to the Highway Department for their regular maintenance would
be maintained by TDA. Equipment for the maintenance of these roads is pro-
vided under the project. An assurance was obtained during negotiations
that TDA would adequately maintain these project roads until such time as
they are transferred to the Highway Department. Their maintenance cost has
been taken into account in the economic analysis of the project (Annex 3,
Table 6).
Village Water Supply
4.17      At present there is no suitably staffed local authority in Tihama
other than TDA, who could take over the operation and maintenance of the
Project water supply installations immediately after their completion. TDA
would, therefore, operate and maintain the installed water supply systems
until the operators are fully trained by TDA and employed by the Local Devel-
opment Associations (LDA's) to take over the work. The communities, excepting
those provided with hand pumps only, (hand pumps will be operated by the
beneficiaries) benefiting from the village water supply element of the project
would pay the full costs of operation and maintenance which would not be less
than YRls 17 per capita per year. The Local Development Associations would
deposit the said operation and maintenance costs with TDA in semi-annual
advances and recover from beneficiaries as service charge with the local



- 36 -
development tax. Agreements would be made by TDA with the concerned LDA's in
this respect before undertaking the construction and copies supplied to IDA.
An assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.18      During and following project implementation, TDA would maintain
records of all inputs furnished to farmers, their production costs, prices
received, and collect yield and other relevant data. TDA would also be
required to prepare periodic reports in a format satisfactory to Government
and IDA. The progress reports would be submitted to the Government and
copied to IDA quarterly during project implementation and annually thereafter
for the next five years. In addition TDA would prepare a completion report
and submit this report to IDA within six months of the closing date of the
project.  Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
4.19      In accordance with its charter TDA would also maintain a continuous
record of the hydrometeorological stations and the groundwater table in the
area to regulate withdrawals from wells and restrict or prohibit additional
installation of wells should the water table record indicate a continuous
mining of the aquifer. The water table data would be made available to IDA
annually for a period extending not less than five years after completion of
project. An assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
A. Present Land Use and Crop Distribution
5.01      The project covers a gross area of 64,000 ha out of which 24,000 ha
is regularly or periodically cultivated. The cultivated land comprises three
main categories: (i) spate irrigated (8,000 ha); (ii) pump irrigated (4,000
ha) and; (iii) dryland farming (12,000 ha). The farm and crop distribution
in Wadi Rima are exhibited in Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2. About 45% of the
farms are smaller than 5 ha and about 80% smaller than 10 ha. Coarse grains
(sorghum, maize and millet), cotton and sesame are the predominant crops in
the irrigated areas, with average annual coarse grain cultivation being about
15,800 ha, cotton about 2,000 ha and sesame about 1,000 ha. Other crops
grown in irrigated areas include bananas, vegetables and tobacco. About 6,200
ha of coarse grain is cultivated in the rainfed area outside of the spate
cultivation zone. About 1,000 ha of date plantations are located in the
western area of the project.



- 37 -
B. Development Constraints
5.02      The major constraints to agricultural development in Tihama are:
(a) shortage of skilled manpower and effective agricultural
institutions;
(b) primitive agricultural technology and infrastructure;
(c) non availability of modern farm inputs, especially
fertilizers and the plant protection chemicals to
combat pests like termites and army worm;
(d) limited irrigation water and lack of water conservation
practices.
5.03      Present cost sharing arrangements between tenants and landlords,
whereby the production costs are mostly borne by the tenants, are not condu-
cive to the use of production increasing inputs. An equitable system of cost
sharing is necessary to encourage tenants to increase their use. Services
of an expert in land tenure would be secured for a period of about eight
months under the project to study the problem in the Tihama and recommend
appropriate action. In the meantime the Government has approved that the
land owners and the tenants would share cost of additional inputs in the same
ratio as existing crop sharing. An assurance was obtained during negotiations
that the above study would be undertaken and completed by September 30, 1979,
the report submitted to IDA and agreed recommendations would be implemented by
the Government either by law or Fatwah (religious edict).
5.04      Components of the proposed project are designed to overcome the
above mentioned constraints as related to Wadi Rima. Expatriates would be
employed to help in institution building and extension activities.  Training
programs would be geared to build a qualified cadre of extension workers.
Rural roads and physical facilities, including extension centers, would
improve communication and dissemination of modern farming techniques. Farm
inputs, sprayers, tractors, small farm equipment, seeders and combines sup-
plied through the agricultural credit program would have an impact in increas-
ing yield levels and alleviating labor shortages. The proposed farm mechan-
ization study would assist in determining the most suitable agricultural
machinery for Tihama conditions. Mechanization of land preparation, cultiva-
tion and harvest operations of coarse grains would be highly desirab:Le in view
of growing scarcity and high cost of seasonally hired labor. These crops
represent about 60% of the cropped land in irrigated areas. Other crops (e.g.
cotton, sesame, tobacco, vegetables and fruits) offer limited possibilities
for mechanization, except for land preparation and plant protection. Conse-
quently, these would remain labor intensive.

C. Present and Future Area and Yields
5.05      It is assumed that total cropped area and crop distribution in spate
irrigated areas would not change unless improved spate irrigation techniques
following rehabilitation of the system in a subsequent project are introduced.
The total cropped area under well irrigation also would not change unless the
groundwater monitoring studies determine that the aquifer recharge exceeds
the current water extraction of 45 Mm3 as presently assessed by ODM studies.
However, the cropping pattern in the well irrigated area, with project condi-
tions, has been adjusted to maximize the benefits from the project inputs.
The following table indicates the projected areas under various crops after
project implementation.

5.06      Results of applied research, especially for high cash value horti-
cultural crops and tobacco, will have an impact on altering crop distribution
and yield levels. The proposed marketing study for fruits and vegetables will
help in coordinating their supply and demand and affect crop distribution.
Cotton production in Tihama has been decreasing steadily due to increased
cost of production and relatively static farm gate prices.  The trend would be
reversed by increasing its yield levels through introduction of proven varieties
and encouraging inputs use.
5.07      In Tihama, there are two main cropping seasons; in the spring
(February to May) and the fall (August to December). High temperatures,
dust storms and high relative humidity prevail in June-August and limit crop
production to ratoon and fodder crops of sorghum. Cultivars of the sorghum



- 39 -
Sayf "Gherba red" and "Gherba white" are usually planted in the spring season,
while the predominant cultivar "Quayra" is planted in the fall season.  These
native cultivars have been developed under particular environmental conditions
and usually do not perform well under different climates. They have been
selected for their grain and fodder value. On the other hand, variety trials
at Wadi Zabid have shown that the Sudanese cultivar "Kadim El Hamam"' could be
planted in both seasons with much higher yield levels than local varieties.
Response of local cultivars to use of fertilizers is low while "Kadam El Hamam"
responds well. Yield levels of other crops in Wadi Rima are also low due to
the absence of modern farm inputs in the area, especially fertilizers and
pesticides. Termites presently seriously reduce plant density; research
results in Wadi Zabid have shown that yields in general could be increased by
about 65% if termites are controlled. Yield levels in well irrigated areas
are generally higher than in spate areas because of a more assured and adequate
supply of water. The following table shows present and future yield levels for
the main crops at full development through the introduction of extension, farm
inputs, credit, research and extension results of Wadi Zabid, and adequate
infrastructure.

VI. MARKETS, PRICES, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AND COST RECOVERY
A. Projected Volume of Production
6.01      It is expected that the additional volume of production generated
by the project will be obtained mainly from higher yields. Except for shifts
in the cropping pattern of the 4,000 ha of well irrigated land, where the pro-
duction of red (sayf) sorghum on 1,600 ha will be substituted with vegetables,
fruits and maize, the total area planted will remain the same as at present.
Until studies for modernizing the irrigation system in the spate area are
completed, no changes in the composition of crop production in the spate area
are planned. As explained in the previous chapter the project does not depend
on increases in production in rainfed areas, although minor gains might be
obtained in years of good rainfall. At this juncture it is not expected that
livestock production will increase, even though additional fodder will be pro-
duced as a by-product of sorghum, maize and millet.

Further details of projected incremental area and volume of production over
10 years are in Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2.



- 41 -
B. Marketing and Prices
6.02      No major marketing problems are expected as long as the present high
effective demand for the above commodities continues and provided the access
roads are constructed. Marketing is in fact expected to be eased by the
replacement of animal transportation with motor vehicles as roads are built.
Inefficiencies in market organization and structure exist for all commodities
and are expected to persist for some time to come. These inefficiencies are
reflected in the relatively high price margins between producers and consumers.
6.03      Present coarse grain production is barely sufficient for the sub-
sistence of the area's population of 44,000 persons. Current annual per
capita consumption in the area is slightly more than 500 kg, which leaves
very little marketable surplus. On the basis of a projected population growth
of 1.5%, a grain deficit would occur without the project, at present per capita
consumption levels, in approximately eight years. The marketable surplus of
coarse grain will, therefore, find a ready market. The additional production
of fodder from sorghum, maize, and millet will either be fed to local live-
st:ock or marketed in the traditional 5 kg bundles at local weekly markets,
thereby relieving the acute shortage of animal feed.
6.04      All of the seed cotton is purchased by the Cotton General Company
((CGC) for ginning either in Zabid or Hodeidah for eventual export. Some
cotton is also ginned by the Yemen Textile Corp. in Sana'a. Demand for
sesame seed by small local crushing mills greatly exceeds local supply,
wlich explains the increase in price of nearly YRIs 900/ton during the last
two years. Competition for locally produced sesame is expected to become
keener, as domestic consumption of edible oils and oilcake is increasing by
al least 3.5% annually.  At least two modern manufacturers, requiring large
volumes of sesame for oil plants in Taiz are importing sesame seed clue to
domestic scarcity and high prices.
6.05      The crops grown exclusively in well irrigated areas enjoy, as a
whole, the prospects of sustained demand and will continue to command high
prices. The tobacco grown in the Tihama is air dried and marketed for domes-
tic consumption in water pipes. Its price increased from YRIs 3.2/kg in 1975
to YRIs 8/kg in 1977. Few areas in YAR are as well suited for the production
arnd marketing of perishable fruits and vegetables as the well irrigated areas
of the Tihama. Watermelons, tomatoes, onions, papayas and bananas are scarce
in urban centers such as Hodeidah, Taiz and Sana'a. Only bananas are imported,
mostly from Ecuador, with great difficulty. Once access roads are connected
to the tarmac road that links the Tihama with the major cities, Wadi Rima
is expected to become a major supplier of these commodities. An earlier
plan to produce tomatoes for processing into paste and canning was abandoned
due to high production costs of tomatoes and the high price paid by the fresh
market.
6.06      Under the free market prevailing in YAR, prices received by farmers
and paid by consumers are uniformly much higher for all commodities, except
cotton, than those of similar internationally traded products. This is due to



- 42 -
a combination of scarce domestic supply and inefficiencies in market organi-
zation and structtre. Consequently, relative prices are expected to remain
at their 1977 level for purposes of financial analysis. For economic analysis,
prices of coarse grains, cotton, sesame and bananas were adjusted to conform
with international prices, and include freight, landing charges and handling
at port of entry. The financial price of cotton understates its economic
value, due to inefficiencies in production and processing. On the other hand,
financial prices of bananas and sesame greatly exceed their economic prices,
due largely to high production costs and unusually large marketing margins.

C. Taxes and Cost Recovery
6.07      The project is expected to generate a considerable increase in reve-
nues through the Zakat and cooperation taxes. Zakat--originally a religious
tithe--is presently set at 10% of the gross value of crops produced in spate
irrigated areas and 5% where irrigation is by well. Special rates apply to
livestock, which are treated as property rather than income. The cooperation
tax, which amounts to 2.5% of crop production, is levied to finance community
development projects, mainly social infrastructure. Taxes thus collected
are shared equally between the central government and Local Development
Associations (LDA's), and the 2.5% cooperation tax is assigned to the LDA's.



- 43 -
The latter allocate their share of revenue as follows: Education, 39%;
health, 15%; water.supply and electricity, 25%; disaster relief, 5%; and the
remainder for local administration.
6.08      The amount of Zakat and cooperation taxes presently collectible in
the Wadi Rirma area is estimated at YRls 6.2 million or YRls 515/ha. Actual
revenue could be less due to collection inefficiencies. Upon reaching the
fifth year of the project, the additional Zakat and cooperation taxes would
amount to YRls 3 million, raising the total collectible amount to YRls 9.2
million or YRls 760/ha. During the first 15 years, the additional revenue,
discounted at 10%, represents approximately 32% of investment and operating
expenditures shown in Annex 3, Table 6. Under present revenue sharing arrange-
ments approximately YRls 5.0 million of the anticipated revenue would accrue
to the LDA's and about YRls 4.2 million to the central government. The LDAs'
share would presumably be allocated as stated above (para. 6.07). The central
government's share would be almost equivalent to the YRls 5 million estimated
for operation and maintenance after the fifth year (Annex 3, Table 6). If,
as expected, the ACF expands its operations to a self-sustaining level, anti-
cipated Zakat revenue of the central government would then be sufficient to
cover all estimated operation and maintenance costs.
D. Farm Incomes
6.09      Considerable increases in farm income can be achieved where irriga-
tion is possible. On the other hand, the high risk of planting in rainfed
areas where rainfall is very limited and unreliable deters farmers from
increasing costs by use of fertilizers, pesticides and improved seeds. Higher
income for some 3,700 of 5,200 farm families in the area would result from
project investment in extension, credit, roads, as well as the expanded use of
inputs and equipment. Increases in disposable income would be as folllows:

/2   Upon reaching years 5-7.  Income includes the value of family labor at
market prices and no allowance is made for subsistence consumption.
/3   Part of the higher income is derived from the rental of purchased tractor
and implements.
6.10      Increases in income, however, are predicated upon sustainable cash
flows to finance the higher costs of production. In the case of tenants
bound by prevailing sharecropping arrangements, it is evident from their
projected cash flows that achieving project objectives will require much
higher production costs from the outset, i.e. the first or second year of
the project. While short term credit can finance 80% of input costs, the
remaining 20% plus all labor and transportation costs must be paid out of
current or prior cash flows. Even if credit were not restricted, there
would be insufficient incentives for tenants to assume the full risk of
borrowing to meet added production costs. While it is possible for farmers
to finance 20% of the input costs from previous or current cash flows, the
present low level of income of small tenants and their limited borrowing



- 45 -
ability make it essential that landlords assume a part of costs of production
irn the same proportion of their share of the farm's output, according to the
principles recently agreed to by the Government. This improved cost sharing
arrangements between tenants and land owners would benefit both parties.
6.11       Under the present cost and crop-sharing system, as shown below
for representative farms, the owners' rent income would increase considerably.
For example, for a 5 ha spate irrigated farm the owner's share would rise from
RYls 6,290 to 8,890, with only the responsibility for paying the addiLtional
Zakat and cooperation tax while the tenant must bear additional costs of YRls
22,380 including 7,208 for his own labor. Under the new principles agreed by
the government pending a definitive study of cost and revenue sharing arrange-
ments, the amount of owner's share would still be substantially larger than
under the present system as shown below.

E. Project Entity Financial Projections
6.12       TDA will administer funds for all project components except agricul-
tural credit operations which will be handled by ACF. TDA, which has been
administering the Tihama Development Project I (TDP), is an organizition
within the Ministry of Agriculture. As such, it depends on budgetary alloca-
tions to meet current operation costs; it has had no problem in this respect.
Aside from periodic statements of allocations and expenditures, TDA does not
prepare the usual income statements inasmuch as it is not an income-generating
entity. Its disbursement procedures and accounting system are satisfactory.
It has provided IDA with periodic audited statements.



- 46 -
6.13      ACF is a quasi-autonomous institution originally created under
the TDP. It now handles the credit operations of the four (4) IDA-financed
agricultural projects (para. 1.28). Its board of directors and principal
officials are appointed by Government, while expatriates employed in advisory
capacities are appointed with IDA agreement. Funds have come from Government
and international borrowings (IDA, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development,
Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Development, etc.). Considering that ACF lending
activities started only in April 1975, its operations can be considered as
satisfactory. For the year ended June 30, 1977 (latest audited statements),
credit operations of the Southern Uplands and Tihama I (the two agricultural
credit projects in full operation) were as follows in YRls:
Southern
Uplands     Tihama I
Income                                 298,033      200,893
Expenses                               239,028      570,633
Net Income from Ordinary
Operation                             58,825    (369,740)
Government Grant                           -        369,740
Net Income                              58,825      _
6.14      Because of start-up difficulties with the TDP, agricultural credit
operations in Wadi Zabid were delayed. As a consequence net income had
not yet reached its anticipated level in 1976/77. It is expected, however,
that lending will increase sufficiently in 1977/78 and thereafter, upon
completion of project works, with positive effects on ACF income.
6.15      The cash flow projection for the Project's credit operations assumes
that proceeds of the loan supplied by the co-financier for agricultural credit
(US$2.18 million, including contingencies) would be repaid by ACF to Government
in 15 years, including 5 years of grace at 4% per annum; the Government's
contribution (representing estimated local costs) (US$1.0 million, including
contingencies) would be converted as ACF equity. On these assumptions, net
cash surpluses would be generated during the first seven years, declining
thereafter as the external obligation is repaid and until such time when new
capital is iniected.
VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Benefits and Rate of Return
7.01      A project of this nature generates social as well as economic
benefits. The former will reach most, if not all of the resident population



- 47 -
of 44,000 persons living in some 64 villages and village clusters as a result
of better water supply and future projects that the LDAs would undertake with
their increased share of tax revenue resulting from increasing production.
These benefits, however, are not readily quantifiable. Economic benefits
derived from the Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture and the
work of the CARS are also unquantifiable, due to their multiple nature, e.g.
t'he training of qualified manpower, the adoption of higher yielding varieties
and effective plant protection techniques, and higher administrative efficiency
in the organizations serving agriculture. Excluding contingencies, project
investments in Wadi Rima only amount to US$366 per person among 7,500 families,
and to US$750 per person among the 3,700 farm families that will benefit most
from these investments.
7.02      The readily quantifiable economic benefits consist mainly of an
increase in net value of agricultural production amounting to YRls 24 million
at market prices, or YRls 20.8 million at economic prices. Inasmuch as the
access roads are an integral part of the agricultural development of the
area, the stream of benefits resulting from constructing them was limited to
only the reduced transport cost of the incremental production from the fourth
year onward (Annex 3, Table 5). Transport is highly competitive in the Tihama
and YAR as a whole; therefore, it is expected that savings would be passed on
to farm producers. The stream of economic benefits, moreover, is a conserva-
tive estimate due to the exclusion of livestock, as well as the full range
of transport benefits. Although in the future livestock production can be
expected to increase due to improved animal health and nutrition, these
benefits were also excluded for lack of data. Net incremental benefits
from crop production and transport are given in Annex 3, table 5.
7.03      For the purpose of estimating the economic rate of return of the
project, economic prices based on projected international prices of tradeable
commodities were used whenever possible (para 6.06). No constraint on the
supply of capital needs to be assumed. Because of labor scarcity, all labor
was priced at the peak market rate prevailing in YAR. Estimated physical
contingencies were included in project cost, as well as outlays needed after
year 5 to ensure continuity of the project (i.e. agricultural services, road
maintenance, etc.). With these assumptions the project generates an economic
rate of return of 30%. If investments in village water supplies are included,
the rate of return declines to 23%.
7.04      The basic economic rate of return is sensitive only to a combination
of unfavorable factors, rather than to a single one. As shown below, the rate
cf return would not be severely affected unless delays, increases in costs
and decreases in benefits were to occur simultaneously.
(a)  Reduction of 10% in benefits                              26.7%
(b)  Increase of 15% in costs                                  24.3%
(c)  Increase of 10% in benefits                               35%



- 48 -
(d)  Delay of one year in generating benefits                   22%
(e)  15% higher costs, 1 year delay and 10%
lower benefits                                             15%
Further details on the economic rate of return are in Annex 3 table 6.
Employment Effects
7.05      Total employment created by the project in Wadi Rima would consist
of 500 man-years for construction of civil works, 150 new jobs in project
management and providing agricultural services, and an additional amount
of hired farm labor estimated at 1,100-1,500 man-years at full development.
Approximately 28% of family farm labor available is considered to be presently
underemployed, except at peak seasons. As a result of the project the esti-
mated 8,500 persons who provide family labor would be fully employed.
B. Project Risks
7.06      The risks inherent in this project arise from the possibility of
drought and the shortage of agricultural manpower, including farm labor at
peak periods. The risks from drought are minimized in several ways, although
there is little protection against crippling drought caused by failure of
the monsoon rains during several consecutive years. When the monsoon rains
are late or fail, which occurs about twice every ten years, farmers simply
postpone planting until the rains come, with the attendant loss in income
and the need to reschedule medium-term debts for some. A prolonged drought,
which can occur once every twenty years, would severely affect the project
by reducing the wadi flows and lowering the water table. Concerning the
latter, the project is financing a groundwater study to determine the toler-
able limit of groundwater extraction. The study of feasible irrigation from
the wadi, including the more efficient use of irrigation water, will be
financed by the Netherlands. The application of its results should contribute
to reducing risks from irregularities in the availability and use of surface
water. A more likely risk is a continued escalation in labor wages, with the
consequence that recruitment of staff at all levels and the availability of
farm labor could cause delays and raise costs. This problem has been anti-
cipated, however, as the Government intends to contract expatriates when
Yemeni staff are not available. Concerning the scarcity of farm labor and
rising farm wages, it is expected that this factor would be compensated by
population growth in the area and higher produce prices. In the event that
higher farm labor wages would reduce relative prices to producers, it is
expected that farmers would begin to mechanize certain operations which are
presently done by labor-intensive methods. A short term consultant to study
farm mechanization is included in the project.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached and assurances were
obtained on the principal issues referred to in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Subject
to the conditions of effectiveness described in paras. 3.09 and 3.15 the
project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$10.5 million on standard terms.
The borrower is the Yemen Arab Republic.

Access Roads
1.        The following gravel surfaced access roads would be constructed
in the project area to connect the main centers of population and facilitate
the introduction of improved farming techniques and the transportation of the
expected higher volume of agricultural products to nearby markets by motor
vehicles at lower unit prices than presently done by animal transportation.
The other purposes served would include cheaper and speedier public transporta-
tion, improved access to social services and transport of non-agricultural
freight.

2.        The roads would be 4.5 meters wide and would have gravel surfacing
similar to the roads constructed under Tihama Development Project I and
would follow the same design standards. The earthwork for road embankments
would be done by machinery and would be adequately compacted to provide a
stable subgrade. Passing places would be provided every 1/2 km and be inter-
visible.  Existing cross drains would be maintained by provision of culverts.
Village Water Supply
3.        The village water supply system will include 68 water installations
in Wadi Rima to serve 64 villages or cluster of villages in need of the
improved domestic water supplies, comprising a population of about 44,000.
The designs of the installations, for supplying 60 liters per capita per day,
