THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
APPRAISAL OF A
TOURISM PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project that would provide for the im-
provement and expansion of visitor facilities and infrastructure in the
historical sites of Petra and Jerash in Jordan, and for the preservation
and protection of the archaeological assets of those sites. The visitor
facilities would include upgrading and expansion of an existing 24-room
hotel at Petra, improvements to the visitor centers in Petra and Jerash,
and the construction of restaurants and related facilities. The infra-
structure would consist of water supply and sewerage systems, electricity,
lighting, telecommunications, solid waste disposal, access trails, land-
scaping and watershed protection. Technical assistance from experts, along
with tools and equipment, would be included in a program designed to
preserve and protect the existing monuments from erosion and other hazards,
and to provide for a modest amount of excavation work.
ii.       Situated in a region marked, since prehistoric times, by the
ebb and flow of various peoples, armies, and civilizations, Jordan has been
described as "history written in stone". The archaeological riches, com-
bined with Jordan's scenic beauty and the hospitality of its people, have
supported a rapid growth of the tourism sector. Prior to the 1967 war,
the focus of tourism development was, understandably, on the Holy Land
zone of the "West Bank". The immediate effect of the war was a decline
in tourist arrivals in the Middle East. Jordan, however, faced a far more
serious disruption resulting from the loss not only of her best known
assets but also of 80% of her accommodation capacity. Since 1967, atten-
tion has been shifted to the development of tourist attractions east of
the Jordan River. While recovery has been somewhat delayed, the expansion
of hotel facilities on the East Bank and the growth of demand since 1971
have combined to produce a dynamic increase in foreign visitor arrivals,
with total arrivals to Jordan expected to be 750,000 in 1975, surpassing
the 1966 peak by a substantial margin. In general, however, the develop-
ment of accommodation capacity of international standard on the East Bank
has tended to lag behind the growth of foreign visitor demand. As a
result, hotel occupancy rates are relatively high and a number of hotels
are now under construction or in the planning stage,
iii.      Since the 1967 war, foreign exchange receipts from tourism have
grown from JD 4.6 million in 1968 to JD 32.2 million in 1975. This repre-
sented over 18% of total 1975 exports of goods and services, ranking
behind workers' remittances from abroad (30%) and ahead of phosphate ex-
ports (10%).



iv.       The most important of Jordants tourist assets on the East Bank
are Petra and Jerash. Petra, an ancient Nabataean rock-hewn city located
250 km south of Amman, is undoubtedly one of the wonders of the ancient
world. Its magic stems not only from the grandeur of its antiquities
but also from the provocative mystery of its setting, deep in the heart
of the surrounding mountain; it is approached through a long, narrow chasm,
whose rock walls tower some two hundred feet overhead. Jerash, 50 km
north of Amman, contains the ruins of an ancient town and is an impressive
example of a well preserved Roman provincial city of the Eastern Empire.
v.        Both of these sites have been the subject of detailed planning
studies, and both have been recommended by UNESCO as Jordants prime histor-
ical and archaeological sites in a report prepared in 1974. These studies
and report, together with further work done by the Ministry of Tourism and
Antiquities and Bank Group missions, have served as a basis for appraisal.
The plans include an integrated investment program designed to meet three
major requirements of each site: (a) the need to preserve and protect the
antiquities themselves, which are currently endangered both by the natural
forces of erosion and by deterioration resulting from human activity;
(b) the need to provide physical facilities and amenities for growing
numbers of visitors without jeopardizing the archaeological value of the
sites; and (c) the need to improve the presentation and interpretive
services of each site in order to achieve higher levels of visitor satis-
faction.
vi.       The project is estimated to cost about uS$12.1 million, including
contingencies. The proposed credit of US$6.0 million would cover 92%/ of
the foreign exchange component of the project; the Government would provide
the balance of the funds required to finance the project, as well as any
cost overruns.
vii.      Major civil works and equipment contracts would be awarded after
international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Association's
guidelines. Some contracts, however, would be too small to attract foreign
bids, and it is proposed that they be awarded on the basis of locally
advertised bids. The total value of such contracts is estimated not to
exceed US$0.4 million equivalent. Because of the need for standardization,
the telecommunications switching equipment, costing US$0.2 million would
either be added to a current contract or negotiated separately with
suppliers of such equipment. In addition, the Government would carry out,
on force account, certain works, estimated to total about US$0.9 million
equivalent. In evaluating international bids for equipment contracts,
domestic manufacturers of equipment and furniture would be allowed a pref-
erential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the
prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower.
viii.     Responsibility for implementing the project would rest with the
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, with the exception of certain utility
components which would be the responsibility of specialized Government



- iii -
agencies. At the operational stage, the hotel and restaurant facilities
would be managed by an experienced hotel operating company on the basis
of a management contract with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
The infrastructure components would be turned over to the municipalities
or to specialized Government agencies for operation and maintenance.
ix.       The economic rate of return on the project is estimated at 20.1%;
it is not very sensitive to reductions in the projected number of visitors
to Jordan and the project sites that could result from increased tensions
in the region. When implemented, the project would employ about 560
persons directly in the hotel and other tourism facilities. Employment
generated in construction, transport, handicrafts and other services would
account for an estimated 600 additional jobs. Net foreign exchange
earnings are estimated at US$1.5 million in 1979 and about US$4.8 million
from 1988 on.
x.        The project is suitable for an IDA credit to the Government of
US$6.0 million equivalent.






THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
APPRAISAL OF A
TOURISM PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In June 1975, an IDA mission visited The Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan to discuss with the Government the development of the tourism
sector. At the Government's request, the mission subsequently assisted
in drafting terms of reference for a master plan for the sector. Finan-
cing arrangements for that plan have not yet been completed. In advance
of the availability of a master plan, however, several studies have iden-
tified two specific areas which are obviously of the highest priority in
terms of both their current importance and their future development poten-
tial: the historical sites at Petra and Jerash.
1.02      Both these sites have been the subject of detailed planning
studies carried out by the U.S. National Park Service in 1968, and both
have been recommended by UNESCO as Jordan's prime historical and archae-
ological sites in a report prepared in 1974. Project preparation missions
visited Jordan in September and October 1975 and, with the assistance of
a UNESCO consultant, formulated a project proposal based on the earlier
planning studies, updated and revised where necessary by the Ministry of
Tourism and Antiquities. The proposed project would provide for the
improvement and expansion of visitor facilities in each area and for the
preservation and protection of the historical assets themselves.
1.03      Because of the earlier planning effort, project preparation
work progressed rather quickly. A mission, consisting of Messrs. Menezes,
Bentjerodt, Calkins, Echeverria, Iizuka, and Burrows (UNESCO consultant),
collected much of the information needed for appraisal in December 1975.
A visit to Jordan by Messrs. Calkins and Echeverria in February 1976
completed the needed field work.
1.04      This would be the first IDA credit for tourism in Jordan.
II. THE TOURISM SECTOR
2.01      Jordan is situated in a region marked, since prehistoric times, by
the ebb and flow of various peoples, armies and civilizations. The tides of
history have left an impressive deposit of archaeological riches, from the
relics of ancient civilizations to the cultural heritage of several of today's



- 2 -
major religions. Jordan's scenic beauty and the well-known hospitality
of its people, heighten the country's potential for the continued growth
of foreign tourism. Although prior to the 1967 war the Holy Land zone
of the "West Bank" was the focal point of tourism development, attention
has since shifted to the development of attractions east of the Jordan
River. With the capital city of Amman (Biblical Rabbath-Ammon and later
Philadelphia) as the main staging area, tourist excursions lead south to
Petra and the Gulf of Aqaba, east to the ancient castles of the desert,
north to Jerash and Mount Nebo, and west to the Dead Sea, with many tour-
ists continuing on across the Jordan River into the Holy Land.
2.02      The immediate effect of the 1967 war was a 26% decline (Annex
III) in tourist arrivals in the Middle East; by 1974, however, most
countries of the region, with the exception of Jordan, had recovered
their 1966 tourist arrival levels. Jordan faced a far more serious dis-
ruption resulting from the loss not only of her best known attractions
but also of about 80% of her accommodation capacity. While recovery has
been somewhat delayed, the expansion of hotel facilities on the East Bank
and the growth of demand since 1971 have combined to produce a dynamic
increase in foreign visitor arrivals (an annual increase of 29.3% between
1971 and 1974), with total visitors to Jordan in 1975 expected to surpass
the 1966 peak by a substantial margin. The number of visitor arrivals
for 1975 is estimated to be 750,000 compared to 617,000 visiting Jordan
in 1966, including the "West Bank". (Past trends and projected future
arrival numbers are described in paras. 4.01-4.09.)
2.03      In general, the development of tourist facilities on the East
Bank has tended to lag behind the growth of foreign visitor demand, es-
pecially for hotel accommodation of international standard. As a result
of the recent shortage of hotel rooms, occupancy rates (and financial
returns) for hotels are relatively high. In response to this situation,
a number of hotels are either under construction or in the planning stage.
In addition, other tourist facilities such as shops, restaurants and
transportation facilities, are also being expanded. (The growth of supply
is described in paras. 4.10-4.13.)
2.04      Although the private sector carries primary responsibility for
developing tourism facilities, the Government's Ministry of Tourism and
Antiquities (MTA) plays an important role in overall planning and pro-
motion of tourism sector growth by: (a) development and implementation of
tourism policies; (b) preparation of five-year plans for the sector;
(c) identification, protection and improvement of historical and archaeo-
logical assets; (d) advertising and promotional activities abroad; (e) im-
plementation of some infrastructure works in specific tourist areas; and
(f) in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, development of training
programs and facilities for workers engaged in tourism services.
2.05      In order to encourage private sector interest in tourism devel-
opment, the Government offers a number of investment incentives, including



- 3 -
custom duty exemptions, tax holidays and the repatriation of foreign
capital. Hotel credit, on reasonable terms, is also available for in-
vestors in tourism facilities. On occasion, when private sector invest-
ments are not forthcoming, the Government may also invest directly in
accommodation and catering facilities through its own Hotels and Rest-
houses Corporation (HRC). The HRC was recently formed in order to cen-
tralize Government investments in hotels and restaurants, so that they
could be independently managed and operated. Further support from the
Government is derived from investments in the transportation sector,
particularly in terms of international air access and internal road con-
nections, which have facilitated the growth irn tourist arrivals.
2.06      The economic importance of tourism in Jordan is derived pri-
marily from the level of net foreign exchange earnings generated by the
sector. Average daily visitor expenditures have been estimated to be
US$45.00 for Americans, US$38.00 for Europeans and US$ 15.00 for other
visitors, excluding pilgrims. Since the 1967 war, gross foreign exchange
receipts from tourism have grown from JD 4.6 million in 1968 to JD 32.2
million in 1975. This represented over 18% of total 1975 exports of goods
and services, ranking behind workers' remittances from abroad (30%) and
ahead of phosphate exports (10%). Net foreign exchange earnings from tour-
ism, after deducting imported goods and services, are estimated to be about
65% of gross receipts.
2.07      At present, an estimated 5,000 people are employed in tourism
facilities, and perhaps another 4,000 jobs are indirectly attributable
to the tourist sector in agriculture, handicrafts, the construction
industry and other services.
2.08      Given the growing importance of tourism to the economy, tourism
has been accorded high priority in the Five-Year Plan for 1976-1980.
Investments in the sector are projected at about JD 24 million for the
Plan's period. The main objectives of the sector Plan are: (a) to in-
crease tourism foreign exchange earnings in real terms from JD 17.3 mil-
lion in 1974 to JD 43.0 million in 1980; (b) to stimulate domestic tour-
ism; (c) to preserve historical and cultural assets; and (d) to expand
training facilities. Although a target figure for visitor arrivals is
not stated in the Plan, the foreign exchange earnings' objective implies
that visitor arrivals are expected to increase from 750,000 in 1975 to
1.4 million by 1980.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background and Objectives
3.01      Petra and Jerash are, without doubt, the most important of
Jordan's tourism assets on the East Bank. In terms of cultural value,
Petra has the potential to compete with the pyramids of Egypt and the



Acropolis of Athens, for, as a manifestation of ancient human endeavors,
it is of like rank. Both Petra and Jerash have followed roughly similar
patterns of development, from very early origins through a period of
flourishing construction and commerce, to final declines, abandonment
and centuries of tranquil seclusion until their "rediscovery" by separate
explorers in the early 19th century. 1/ Beyond these similarities, how-
ever, each is a uniquely individual tourist attraction.
3.02      Petra, located 250 km south of Amman, was, from the fourth
century B.C. until its fall to Rome in 106 A.D., the capital city of the
Nabataeans, whose power during that period extended as far north as
Damascus. Deriving their wealth from control of the nearby caravan
routes, the Nabataeans transformed their mountain stronghold into a city
of houses, temples and tombs, all carved out of the mountain rock whose
multi-colored hues glow in the sunlight to produce one of nature's finest
displays of color and majesty. After its capture by Rome, the city was
remodeled along the lines of a typical Roman town, complete with a colum-
ned main street, a theater, baths and related structures which are still
in evidence today. The magic of Petra, however, stems not only from the
grandeur of its monuments, but also from the provocative mystery of its
setting, deep in the heart of the surrounding mountain; the city is ap-
proached through a long, narrow chasm known as the Siq, whose rock walls
tower two hundred feet overhead.
3.03      Jerash, located in a peaceful valley surrounded by the moun-
tains of Gilead, is about 50 km north of Amman on the road to Damascus.
It is an impressive example of a well preserved Roman provincial town
of the Eastern Empire. Dating from 6,000 B.C., Jerash experienced a long
period of flourishing trade, intensive construction and development be-
tween 63 B.C. and the third century A.D., when it was joined to the
Roman Province of Syria. The town plan, of classic Roman design and pro-
portion, is clearly in evidence today. The diversity and number of monu-
ments, including temples, theaters, baths, a columned main street, and
an elliptic forum surrounded by shops, all bear mute testimony to the
wealth and prestige of Jerash, at the peak of its glory. While the city
followed the fortunes of Rome into gradual decline, it enjoyed a period
of reconstruction during the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., which pro-
duced at least seven Byzantine churches. With the Moslem conquest of
the seventh century A.D., however, the city's demise was nearly complete;
it was finally abandoned after a series of earthquakes destroyed many of
the buildings.
3.04      While both of these sites have had a long and glorious past,
their accessibility to significant numbers of foreign visitors is a
fairly recent development. Until 1967, with the attention of most tour-
ists focused on the better known attractions of the West Bank, Government
1/   Annex II contains a description of the historical background of
each site.



- 5 -
activity at Petra and Jerash was confined primarily to relatively modest
programs of excavation and restoration of selected monuments, and even
these efforts were constrained by limited availability of budgetary re-
sources and trained personnel. The Department of Antiquities of the
MTA is responsible for the physical care and protection of the sites and
monuments, which have been damaged by increasing human contact, as well
as by forces of nature. The legislative framework to protect these sites
is contained in Law No. 26 of 1968, under which both Petra and Jerash
have been declared national treasures. This law has recently been re-
vised in order to strengthen certain provisions, including, for example,
tighter regulations governing the sale and disposition of historical
artifacts. Additional land use controls, however, are required in order
to protect the two sites. Detailed regulations governing the use of
Government-owned land at each site are expected to be drafted by the MTA,
under the authority of the (revised) Law No. 26. The Ministry of Munici-
palities and Rural Affairs (MMRA), in cooperation with the MTA, is ex-
pected to prepare zoning regulations and related development controls for
land surrounding the two sites which is privately owned. The Government
has agreed to adopt these regulations and development controls by
July 1, 1977. Although master plans for the development of both sites
were drawn up in 1968, the proposals have not yet been implemented. These
plans, prepared by the U.S. National Park Service, include an integrated
investment program designed to meet: (a) the need to preserve and protect
the antiquities, which are currently endangered both by the natural forces
of erosion and by deterioration resulting from human activity; (b) the
need to provide physical facilities and amenities for growing numbers of
visitors without jeopardizing the archaeological value of the sites; and
(c) the need to improve the presentation and interpretive services of each
site in order to achieve higher levels of visitor satisfaction.
B. Project Description
3.05      The project would consist of the following main elements, de-
scribed further below and listed in detail in Annex I:
(a)  tourist accommodation, related superstructure
facilities and supporting infrastructure works
near the entrance to Petra;
(b)  visitor facilities, infrastructure works and
archaeological preservation in Petra Basin;
also the resettlement of the Bedouins currently
living there; and
(c)  visitor facilities (including a Sound & Light
Program), infrastructure works and archaeo-
logical preservation at Jerash.

3.06      In Petra, a distinction is made between the "Entrance" to
the ancient city and the "Basin", where all the major monuments and
related structures are located. In accordance with the master plan,
the bulk of investments in Petra will take place at the "Entrance",
which is located near the town of Wadi Musa. The investments in the
"Basin" will be limited to the provision of some visitor facilities
and to preservation and consolidation works.
3.07      The accommodation facilities at the Petra Entrance would
consist of the upgrading and expansion of an existing 24-room hotel
to include an additional 76 new rooms, catering, shopping, reception,
administrative and camping facilities. The facilities would be de-
signed to provide services both for hotel guests and campers, and
for the large number of daily visitors. Provision would also be made
for improvements to the existing visitor center, for additional staff
quarters (12 units), and for a corral and cleaning area for the horses
used to transport visitors to the Basin.
3.08      Infrastructure works at the Petra Entrance would include
water supply and sewerage systems, solid waste disposal, electricity
and lighting, telecommunications, landscaping and watershed protection.
Water would be supplied through a connection to the expanded system
serving the nearby town of Wadi Musa, and would be chlorinated and
stored near the hotel complex. The sewerage system, involving treat-
ment by means of an extended aeration-type lagoon, would serve primar-
ily the visitor facilities and staff quarters. The water effluent,
after chlorination, would be used for landscape irrigation. Under the
project a dump truck and bulldozer would be provided for collecting
and disposing of solid waste in a sanitary landfill to be established
some two kilometers from the Petra Entrance.
3.09      The electricity component would consist of a diesel genera-
ting unit installed in the Wadi Musa municipal power station to meet
the additional energy demand created by the project, as well as a
transmission line from Wadi Musa to the Petra Entrance, underground
distribution lines and lighting. A new public telephone exchange, de-
signed to serve both the project and the town of Wadi Musa, would be
built to replace the existing obsolete system. An internal exchange
system for the hotel and a telex printer would also be provided. The
existing landscaping around the Petra Entrance would be extended and
improved in order to create an attractive environment for the new hotel
complex. Watershed protection would involve the construction of three
velocity check-dams between the visitor facilities at the Entrance and
the point at which the Siq begins,to slow the torrents of water in the
River Wadi which occur after rainstorms, and which have cost the lives
of tourists in the past.
3.10      The visitor facilities within the Petra Basin would include
a visitors contact and first aid station, restrooms, a refreshment bar
and a covered terrace for luncheon service. A small research facility



-7-
would also be provided for archaeological investigations. These buildings
would be grouped together and located in an area which would not obstruct
the visual impact of the Basin. The Government has agreed to remove the
existing camping amenities (Nazzal Camp) from the Basin not later than
December 31, 1979, thereby eliminating the visual pollution caused by these
facilities.
3.11      In support of these Basin facilities the project would include a
number of infrastructure improvements. The existing well would be improved
and water would be pumped through concealed pipes to a reservoir. Sewerage
would be treated in septic tanks, with the effluent disposed of in under-
ground absorption trenches downstream from the potable water source. Elec-
tricity would be supplied from the Wadi Musa power plant and would be trans-
mitted by underground cables through the Siq and within the Basin. Tele-
phone lines would also be extended from the Entrance to the Basin using
underground lines.
3M12      In order to control the erosion resulting from rapid runoff of
rain water within the Basin and through the Siq, the project would provide
for the construction of ten velocity check-dams within the Basin and nine
in the Siq. In addition, the floor surface of the Siq would be cleared
and stabilized, with a drainage channel constructed to ensure all-weather
access to and from the Basin. Trails would be developed from the Siq and
would lead into the Basin to the principal monuments. These trails, sur-
faced with crushed stone and lime binders, would be combined with route and
monument markers to provide self-guided interpretive circuits within the Basin.
3.13      Technical assistance from foreign experts, along with tools and
equipment, would be included in a program (Annex II) designed to preserve
and protect the existing monuments from erosion and other hazards, and to
provide for a modest amount of excavation work which would enhance the
tourist value of the site.
3.14      At present, about 96 Bedouin families live within the Petra Basin.
Since these people have endangered the archaeological value of the site by,
for example, walling up the entrances of tombs which they use for living
quarters and by unauthorized digging for artifacts which they sell to tourists,
the MTA has determined that they should be relocated to an area outside of the
Petra archaeological site.l/ A Government Committee established to deal with
the resettlement of the Bedouins has recently decided on a site on the out-
skirts of the town of Wadi Musa, a site acceptable to the families currently
living in the Petra Basin. The project would, therefore, include provision
for housing and other community facilities at the new site for the Bedouin
families. The site is large enough (300 ha) to allow for the construction of
houses, as well as for agricultural activities. In addition, the Government
has agreed to give the people to be relocated priority in the employment
created by the project, and special assistance in preparing themselves for
other occupations (para. 4.32).
1/   This action would be taken even if the project did not go ahead.

It was further agreed that there would be a prohibition of vehicular
traffic in the Basin, except for a limited number of balloon-tired ve-
hicles. This would increase the employment of the local Bedouins who use
their horses to trar±port via_              -aou the Petra Basin.
3.15      In Jerash, the visitor facilities to be provided under the
project would include a restaurant with both indoor and outdoor dining,
improved interpretive material and equipment for the visitor center, a
small site museum located in vaults under the Temple of Artemis, and
parking facilities. In addition, a Sound & Light Program would be devel-
oped in several languages, together with outdoor seating capacity for
about 500 visitors, as well as administrative offices, workshops, and
storage areas.
3.16      Water would be supplied through connections to the existing mu-
nicipal system at Jerash, while sewage would be treated in septic tanks
and the effluent disposed of in underground absorption trenches. Fencing
and gates would be installed to protect the archaeological features of
the site. Trails, surfaced with crushed stone and lime binders, would be
designed to provide access to the main elements of the city and, at the
same time, would serve as a means of controlling the movements of guests
so as to improve visitor capacity. Several alternative tour routes
through the city would be available, each self-guided by means of trail
markers and printed, multi-lingual pamphlets. The project would also
provide equipment, tools, and technical assistance for a program of archae-
ological work designed to preserve, protect and enhance the historical
assets of Jerash (Annex II).
3.17      Project administration costs, and the costs of on-the-job and
overseas training for staff of the Antiquities Department of the MTA
(54 man/months) are also included in the project.
C. Cost Estimates
3.18      The detailed cost estimates and the foreign exchange component
of the project elements are given in Annex I, and are summarized in Table
1, on page 9.
3.19      Baseline cost figures reflect December 1975 price levels.  An
allowance of 15% of the civil works and equipment costs has been made to
cover physical contingencies; this is a reasonable amount since most of
the cost estimates are based on semi-detailed design work and specified
equipment lists. Price contingencies take into account the projected
implementation schedule and likely increases in price levels of foreign
and local costs during the construction period resulting in an average
price increase of 15% per annum during 1976 and 1977, and 10% per annum
thereafter (Annex I, Table 7). Jordan has been experiencing major

increases in construction costs, due to an increase in the cost of labor
and materials. The costs of skilled labor, for example, increased by 10%
in the first two months of 1976. In addition, substantial delays are
being experienced at Jordan's only port at Aqaba. Total provision for
contingencies amounts to 51.5% of baseline costs or 34% of total project
costs, including physical contingencies.
3.20      Cost estimates for project buildings, based on space require-
ments and current unit building costs, are in line with costs of similar
works recently constructed in Jordan. Detailed lists of equipment and
furniture would be prepared during the final design stage and reviewed by
the Association prior to procurement. Cost estimates for equipment pro-
cured locally, include taxes, port, warehouse and handling charges, and
transportation to sites; these charges are equivalent to about 9% of the
c.i.f. prices.  Since tourism investments enjoy special fiscal privileges
under present regulations, no taxes or duties are included in the estimate
for imported equipment.
3.21      In order not to delay the implementation of the project, it is
proposed that part of final design and engineering expenditures incurred
after March 1, 1976, and not exceeding US$150,000 or 1.2% of total project
cost, be financed retroactively. For the project as a whole, consultants'
services are estimated to total 230 man/months over a four-year period at
a cost of about US$0.5 million, of which some 51 man/months would be
provided by foreign consultants.
D.    Execution and Operation
3.22      Responsibility for implementing the project would rest with the
MTA, with the exception of certain utility components noted below which
would be carried out by other Government agencies. In order to coordinate
efforts of other Government departments and agencies involved, a Project
Coordinating Committee would be established. The MTA and the NPC would
be permanently represented on the Committee, while the representatives of
other agencies would be members for such periods of time as their respec-
tive agencies are involved in project execution. To ensure proper super-
vision of design and construction work a Project Unit would be set up with-
in the MTA. The Director of the Project Unit would report directly to the
Minister.  The functions of the Project Unit would include:
(a) the employment and briefing and the coordination
of the work of specialists to be hired under the
technical assistance provisions of the project;
(b) the employment and briefing and the coordination
of the work of architectural and engineering con-
sultants who would be responsible for the design



- 11 -
and supervision of the facilities included in the
project; this would involve reviewing and approving
the consultants' designs and bidding documents;
(c) the preparation of master lists of equipment;
(d) the organization of bidding for civil works and
equipment, and subsequent evaluation of the bids;
(e) the preparation of designs for construction of minor
works under force account;
(f) the overall supervision of construction;
(g) the preparation of progress reports for the Association;
(h) the preparation of credit withdrawal applications;
(i) the day-to-day coordination of other Government
agencies that would be responsible for implementing
some parts of the project; and
(j) negotiations with firms that would operate the hotel
and restaurant facilities once they are constructed.
The Unit would include a Project Director, an engineer, an architect, an
accountant and a procurement officer, and would be assisted by
archaeological experts, specialists in park service management and a muse-
ologist. The Project Director and the experts would be appointed after
consultation with the Association. A separate salary scale would be used
if necessary in order to attract qualified personnel.l/ Employment of
experts and training of personnel would be done with the assistance of
UNESCO. The establishment of the Project Unit and the appointment of the
members of the Project Unit would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
3.23      At Petra, the MTA would develop the hotel complex and would then
employ an experienced hotel operating company to manage the facilities on the
basis of a management contract.2/ The company to be selected is expected to
be one which also operates at least one other hotel in Jordan, in order to
ensure both local experience and economies of scale in marketing. The new
public telephone exchange facility would be implemented by the Telecommuni-
cations Corporation, a Government agency, which would continue to operate
the system. The water supply component would be constructed by the MTA with
the assistance of the Government's Water Supply Corporation, which operates
the Wadi Musa municipal system. The additional diesel generating unit to be
installed in the Wadi Musa power plant would be obtained and operated by the
MMRA.
1/ This practice is not uncommon in Jordan.
2/ Under the contract, trained technicians will be required to operate and
maintain the sewerage treatment plant, pumping station, and the air-
conditioning and refrigeration units.



- 12 -
3.24      The remaining physical components at Petra Entrance and within
the Basin would be implemented and operated by the MTA,, with the exception
of the luncheon facilities in the Basin which would be run by the same
company which would operate th_.        c.pi2ex.  Resettlement of the Bedouin
families is being coordinated by a special Government Committee, consist-
ing of the Ministers of Tourism and Antiquities, Interior, and Municipal-
ities and Rural Affairs, and would be executed by the Project Unit with
the assistance of the Housing Corporation.
3.25      The investment program in Jerash would be implemented entirely
by the MTA, which would also operate all facilities with the exception of
the restaurant. The restaurant would be operated by the same company
which would manage the hotel in Petra.
3.26      The Government has agreed to cause the respective agencies to
execute the telecommunications and electric power components of the
project, and to provide adequate and timely telecommunications and elec-
tric power services to the hotel and other visitor facilities at Petra
and Jerash. In addition, the Government has agreed to cause the WSC to
complete the expansion of the municipal water supply system which would
serve both the town of Wadi Musa and the tourism facilities in Petra.
These facilities are being funded by other sources and present plans call
for the completion of the new well and the transmission line by August 1976
(Annex I).
3.27      Consultants would be engaged for design and supervision of con-
struction of the hotel, restaurant, and other amenities at the Petra
Entrance, the visitor facilities and the utility systems in the Basin,
and the restaurant, adminstrative offices, and the facilities for Sound &
Light performances at Jerash. The employment of these consultants,
acceptable to the Association, would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
The MTA, with the assistance of experts attached to the Project Unit
(para. 3.22), would be responsible for the design of park trails, the
development of trail markers and guide books, and the archaeological pro-
gram in each area, as well as for the site museum at Jerash. Design of
the houses and community facilities for the Bdul Bedouin families would be
the responsibility of the Housing Corporation.
3.28      In order to ensure proper coordination during the implementation
stage, the MTA would be responsible for preparing and submitting to the
Association a critical path chart for carrying out all parts of the project.
The Government has agreed to periodically review this chart and submit
the results of such reviews to the Association quarterly. The project
is expected to be implemented over a four-year period, with construction
of most of the facilities completed in the first three years.

E. Financing Plan and Lending Arrangements
3.29      The total estimated cost of the project is JD 4.0 million
(US$12.1 million equivalent). It is proposed that the IDA credit cover
about 92% of the foreign exchange component of JD 2.1 million (US$6.5 mil-
lion equivalent), or roughly 50% of total project costs including contin-
gencies. The balance would be provided by the Government, which would
also meet any cost overruns.
3.30      The consolidated financing plan for the project including contin-
gencies, but excluding interest during construction and working capital,
can be summarized as follows:
Table 2: Consolidated Financing Plan

Total                       12.145            6.000          6.145
3.31      The Government contribution and the proceeds of the IDA credit
required for the project components to be carried out by the MTA and
other agencies would be made available as budgetary contributions. This
undertaking will be set forth in a supplemental letter. Operating sur-
pluses which result from the collection of entry fees and other charges,
and the returns from the hotel and restaurant facilities would be turned
over to the Treasury.
F. Procurement and Disbursement
3.32      Major civil works and equipment contracts would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding, in accordance with the
Association's guidelines. Project items would be grouped to the extent
possibLe, in order to encourage such competitive bidding, but bidders
would also be able to bid on individual items. In evaluating interna-



14 -
tional bids for equipment and furniture, local manufacturers would be
allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing
imports or the prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower.
It is expected that some furniture contracts would be awarded to local
manufacturers and most equipment contracts to foreign suppliers. Some
civil works, and equipment and furniture contracts (e.g., site museum,
stables and camp grounds) would probably be too small to attract foreign
bids. It is proposed that these contracts, each not to exceed US$65,000
in value, would be awarded after local competitive bidding or be executed
through negotiated contracts. The total value of such contracts
would not exceed  US$400,000   equivalent.  Since the switching equipment
under the telecommunications component of the project should be compatible
with the rest of Jordan's network to permit interconnections, procurement
of this equipment, valued at US$200,000 would either be added to a current
contract or negotiated separately with suppliers of such equipment.
3.33      The MTA would carry out, on force account, certain works, such
as:
(a) the archaeological work in both areas, work
too specialized for civil work contractors;
and
(b) the development of trails, trail markers,
fencing and relatively minor landscaping, for
which it would not be appropriate to prepare
detailed designs for purposes of tender docu-
ments.
The total value of work to be carried out on force account would
not exceed US$900,000 equivalent.
3.34      The Project Unit in the MTA would be responsible for advertis-
ing requests for tenders, issuing tender documents, evaluating bids and
awarding contracts for all project components, with the exception of the
utility items to be implemented by other Government agencies, which would
be responsible for their respective components.
3.35      The proposed credit of US$6.0 million would be disbursed to
meet:
(a) 35% of total expenditures for civil works;
(b) 100% of the c.i.f. price of directly imported
equipment and furniture or 100% of the ex-
factory cost of locally manufactured equipment
and furniture procured under international
competitive bidding, or 40% of the total cost
of locally procured items; and



- 15 -
(c) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of professional
services, technical assistance, specialists and
overseas training for the MTA staff members.
The disbursement percentages under (a) and locally procured items under (b)
would be adjusted as necessary to ensure continued disbursements throughout
the construction period. The estimated schedule of disbursements of the
credit is shown in Annex I, Table 6.
IV. JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Demand
4.01      Tourism in Jordan was seriously hurt by the 1967 war and the dis-
turbances in the country in the following years. Visitor arrivals to Jordan
declined sharply from the 1966 peak of 617,000 to a low of 257,000 in 1971.
With an easing of tensions in the area, and the development of facilities
on the East Bank, foreign visitor traffic increased gradually in 1972 and
1973 (to 292,000 and 308,000, respectively) and then very rapidly the fol-
lowing year to 555,000. The upward trend continued last year and arrivals
are estimated to have reached 750,000 in 1975. Table 3 shows the growth
in foreign visitor arrivals in the period from 1966-75.

4.02      In analyzing visitor traffic Xo Jordan, it should be noted that
most of the visitor arrivals from neighboring countries, both Arab and non-
Arab Middle East countries, are those whose basic purpose is a pilgrimage
to the religious shrines in Saudi Arabin !nd the West Bank and who are,
therefore, essentially transit visitors to Jordan. On the other hand, the
majority of visitor arrivals from Western countries are those who come to
Jordan either for business or vacation purposes and who stay at least one
night in the country. Hotel statistics show that 70% of visitors from
Western countries stay   overnight in lodging establishments, as compared
to   only 15% of visitors from neighboring countries.  Furthermore, while
religious traffic is highly concentrated in 10 days (varying with the
lunar year), non-religious traffic is spread fairly evenly throughout the
year.
4.03      The recent upward trend in visitor arrivals from Western coun-
tries is more significant for tourism in Jordan than arrivals from
neighboring countries. Unlike the latter, Westerners are not normally in
transit but stay in lodging establishments in Jordan for an average of two
to three nights. Moreover, expenditures for Western visitors are estimated
to be greater than for non-Western visitors; the average daily expenditure
in 1975 for Americans was US$45.00, for Europeans US$38,00 and for others
US$15.00. The most important factors in the recent rapid increase in
arrivals from Western countries were:
(a) the significant hotel development: the opening
of 300 new hotel rooms in 1974 and another 200
rooms in 1975, bringing the total of classified
rooms in Jordan to 1,200;
(b) the opening of access by bridge across the
Jordan River to Jerusalem in 1973, which
established Amman as an important entry point
for foreign tourists wishing to visit both
the East and West Banks; and
(c) the active efforts being made by both the public
and private sectors in promoting tourism to
Jordan.
4.04      In assessing the revival of foreign visitor traffic to Jordan,
it is important to distinguish between the two major visitor groups in
terms of purpose of visit, namely: (i) vacation and business, and
(ii) pilgrimages.The first group is made up of business travellers who
often visit tourist attractions during their stay, vacation travellers
coming individually or in groups to spend their holiday in Jordan, and
multiple-stop group tourists who visit other destinations in the region
besides Jordan. As to the second group (predominantly Moslems from the
Middle East and Asia), a certain number takes advantage of their pilgrimage
to visit one or more tourist attractions while passing through Jordan, al-
though the proportion is probably rather small.



- 17 -
4.05      Evaluation of the future market demand for Petra and Jerash
necessarily begins with an assessment of the proportion of total visitor
arrivals in Jordan who will visit tourist attractions during their stay in
the country. Available data suggest that about 22% of Arab visitors from
neighboring countries and about 15% of the other regional visitors (mainly
from Turkey) come to Jordan either on vacation or for business purposes,
rather than as pilgrims or for visiting relatives. Of visitors from West-
ern countries, over 80% of arrivals are either on holiday or business
trips and the remainder come to Jordan for purposes such as research or
studies. On the basis of these data, the proportion of foreign arrivals
who are likely to visit tourist attractions during their stay in the country
would amount to about 26% of total foreign arrivals to Jordan.
4.06      Most of the visitors from Western countries come by air.
This traffic has been increasing rapidly as is reflected in sta-
tistics of some airlines flying into the region. For example, the
number of passengers carried by Alia, the Royal Jordanian Airline,
increased by 50% between 1973-1974 and by 61% during the first ten-month
period of 1975 over the corresponding period in 1974, though part of this
latter growth may have been caused by the extraordinary conditions in Beirut.
Of the Western visitor traffic (i.e., business travellers, single-destination
holiday makers to Jordan, and multiple-stop group tourists), the segment
which has perhaps the greatest market potential is multiple-stop group tour-
ism, because Jordan's tourism assets complement rather than compete with those
in neighboring destinations. However, Jordan has not been able to develop
this market sufficiently because of the severe scarcity of acceptable accom-
modation facilities. In particular, the existing hotels of international
standard have experienced high room occupancies. The tight hotel capacity
has caused substantial frustrated demand in the holiday market. This situ-
ation is gradually being rectified and present plans call for the construc-
tion (para. 4.12) of 2,400 hotel rooms to come into operation by 1980,
bringing the total of hotel rooms in Jordan to 3,600. The traffic impli-
cations of this total hotel capacity are substantial. By 1980, when all
the planned hotels would be in full operation, more than 420,000 tourists
could be accommodated in Jordan.l/
4.07      The number of visitors coming to Jordan for business or vacation
purposes has been projected to grow at an average annual rate of 15% be-
tween 1974-80, reaching a projected arrival number of 336,000 in 1980.
This growth rate is small compared to the average growth rate of 29% per
annum during the 1971-74 period, though this period reflects a rapid recu-
peration from the civil strife in 1970-71. A higher rate of growth than that
projected may well be achieved for several reasons: the potential impact
of the proposed investments in Petra and Jerash on Jordan's tourism; the
significant expansion in airline fleet and tour arrangements by Alia and
inclusion of Jordan in the routes of several major West European airlines
in 1976-77; the projected 25% annual increase in Jordan's hotel capacity
1/   Based on conservatively estimated average room occupancy of 65% with
a 1.5% double occupancy factor for an average length of stay of three
nights.

over the next few years (Table 5), and the active promotional efforts being
made by both private and public sectors. The Government has agreed to
periodically evaluate the country's promotional efforts to ensure that the
needs of the sector are met. This undertaking will be set forth in a sup-
plemental letter. Because of the higher absolute number of visitors and a
gradual elimination of repressed demand, it is assumed that the growth rate
would decline during the subsequent five-year period (1980-85) to 12% per
annum, reaching 590,000 arrivals in 1985. Overall, this would mean an aver-
age increase of about 13.5% over the next ten years (1976-85). The pro-
jected number of business and holiday visitors to Jordan is given in Table 4.

4.08      The development of tourist facilities and the enhancement of.-the
attractions at Petra and Jerash may be expected to attract increasing num-
bers of visitors from 1979 on, after the project is completed. Because of
its location and accessibility, which make it a convenient day trip from
Anman, Jerash will appeal to a wide segment of the business and vacation
travel arrivals. It is assumed that about 30% of the Arab visitors and 70%
of the non-Arab visitors projected in Table 4 will make an excursion to
Jerash during their stay in Jordan, or a total of 180,000 day visitors in
1980, rising to 337,000 by 1985.
4.09      Because of its greater distance from Amman, Petra is somewhat
less accessible to foreign business travellers who may stay only 2-3 days
in Jordan. It is, however, particularly well situated to appeal to the
vacation travel market since it can attract not only the multiple-stop
group tourists but also the holiday makers who come to Jordan for a week
or more at resorts on the Gulf of Aqaba, 100 km south of Petra. With the
development of accommodation, catering and related visitor facilities, and
with the likely growth of vacation travel to Jordan, Petra is expected to
attract an increasing proportion of projected visitor arrivals. In 1980,
about 29% of these arrivals are estimated to visit Petra, representing 10%
of Arab and 40% of non-Arab arrivals. This proportion is estimated to in-
crease to about 37% by 1985, with the number of visitors to Petra thus grow-
ing from 94,000 in 1980 to 218,000 in 1985, an average annual growth rate
of 18%.

B. Development of Tourist Facilities
4.10      The supply of accommodation facilities in Jordan has lagged sig-
nificantly behind the recent growth in foreign visitor traffic to the coun-
try and has acted as a constraint on the development of market demand.
There are currently 28 classified lodging establishments in Jordan with a
total capacity of 1,202 rooms, of which 69% are in the 3- to 5-star cate-
gories. Of this total, 23 hotels (1,025 rooms) are located in Amman, four
hotels (153 rooms) in Aqaba and one hotel in Petra (24 rooms). As a result
of the severe shortage of accommodation, occupancy rates are relatively
high (e.g., 78% occupancy for the Jordan Intercontinental in 1974 and 83%
during the first ten months of 1975, despite that hotel's expansion from
120 rooms in 1973 to 250 rooms in 1974).1/ About 85% of the lodging estab-
lishments or two-thirds of the total number of hotel rooms in Jordan is in
private hands, while the remainder is either wholly or partially Government
owned.
4.11      While operating costs have increased significantly in recent years,
they have remained reasonable in relation to gross revenues and hotels have
generally been able to maintain a satisfactory relationship between capital
costs and room rates. As a consequence, hotel investments have shown good
results in terms of both gross operating profits and return on equity. In
response to the shortage of accommodation facilities, and in view of satis-
factory returns, a number of hotel projects are either under construction
or in the planning stage: Amman has five new hotels under construction
involving 720 rooms, while Aqaba has one hotel involving 113 rooms. Table 5
shows the likely development of hotel capacity in Jordan during the 1976-80
period, on the basis of current and planned construction.

*  Presently available rooms
4.12      One of the main difficulties to be overcome in the expansion of hotel
accommodation in Jordan is the currently rather low standard of service,
resulting largely from a shortage of trained staff and experienced manage-
1/ High occupancy rates in 1975 are partly due to the present problems
confronting Beirut.

ment personnel and caused partly by Jordanians leaving the country to
work elsewhere. To combat this problem, the Government has already begun
several training programs with assistance from ILO, UNDP and IDA. A hotel
training center partly financecd by UKNDP has just begun operations, with
emphasis on basic and medium level staff. Higher level staff training
will be provided by the Hotel Manage7mant School to be opened in 1979, which
is financed, in part, by the Bank Group (Credit 534-JO). Instructors are
presently being trained abroad. On-the-job training, however, will con-
tinue to play an important role in developing staff, and foreign management
experts can make a valuable contribution to improving the overall level of
hotel services.
4.13       Transportation services within Jordan are generally rather good,
both in terms of road networks and the availability of buses and taxis.
It is reasonable to assume that local transport facilities will continue
to expand in response to an increase in visitors. Air access is also
relatively good, and Amman airport will soon be able to handle wide-bodied
aircraft such as the 747, following improvements currently under way.
Scheduled flights by KLN, Aeroflot, British Airways, Alia (Royal Jordanian
Airline) and several regional airlines, serve Amman with connections to
the major airports of Europe, the Middle East and several Asian countries.
There is no reason to expect that air access will in the near future pose
a constraint on the development of foreign visitor demand, but the question
needs to be periodically reviewed.
C.   Financial Aspects
4.14       The project's revenues would be derived from entry fees at both
sites, charges for the Sound & Light program at Jerash, and the net
income from the hotel and restaurant operations at Petra and Jerash. At
the same time, those utility components at Petra which are to be carried
out by other Government agencies (para. 3.23) would be expected to meet
standard public sector operating results.
4.15       Detailed financial projections for the hotel and restaurant
facilities at Petra, and for the restaurant facilities at Jerash (in 1975
prices), are described separately in Annex IV. In Petra., estimated
revenues from the hotel operations are based on a projected occupancy
rate of 55% in 1979, increasing to 75% by 1983, an assumed double occu-
pancy factor of 1.8, and an average daily expenditure for hotel guests
of US$29.75, distributed as follows: 43% for accommodation; 41% for food;
11% for beverages; and 5% for "other". The number of visitors staying
in the hotel represents 28% of total visitors to Petra in 1979 and 18% in
1983.
4.16       Operating costs for the hotel and restaurant operations have been



- 21 -
estimated on the basis of current experience in existing facilities, where
applicable, and on standard ratios for comparable facilities in Jordan
(Annex IV). Gross operating profit for the hotel and catering facilities
at Petra is estimated to be 22% of sales in 1979, rising to 31% of sales
from 1985 on. The restaurant facility at Jerash is estimated to achieve
a gross operating profit of about 7% of sales in 1979, increasing to 22%
of sales from 1985 on.
4.17      While the cost of managing the facilities in Petra and Jerash
will depend upon the outcome of negotiations between the MTA and potential
hotel operating companies, it is estimated that the management fee will
not exceed 25% of the gross operating profits as is usually the case.
Combined with the financial projections indicated above, this assumption
would result in a net income to the MTA sufficient to generate a financial
(DCF) rate of return on the hotel and restaurant facilities at Petra of
9.9%, and on the restaurant facilities at Jerash of 23.7%. The proposed
management contract for operating the hotel and restaurant facilities,
including the qualifications of the firm, and the terms and cost of their
services, would be submitted to the Association for approval. In addition,
the Government has agreed to require the MTA to review room tariffs and
menu prices established by the management firm for hotel and restaurant
operations in the light of market conditions, in order to ensure that the
operating revenues would cover operating expenses and adequate depreciation,
and generate maximum returns on the investment. The results of such a
review would be submitted to the Association.
4.18      Operating revenues and costs have also been projected separately
for the MTA's operation of the services at Petra and Jerash. The assumed
entrance fee at Petra is JD 1.00 (about US$3.03) and at Jerash JD 0.50
(about US$1.50). Admission fee to the Sound & Light performance at Jerash
is assumed to be JD 1.50 (about US$4.55). These charges appear reasonable
in view of both the touristic value of the attractions and the level of
fees charged by similar operations in other parts of the world. Projected
revenues from entry fees have been based on the estimated number of visitors
to each site; special groups of visitors who may enter the sites free or
at reduced rates (such as students, archaeological groups, etc.), have no-t
been taken into account. Revenues from the Sound & Light program at
Jerash have been estimated on the assumption of 200 performances a year,
with 50% of the seat capacity utilized in 1979, rising to 65% capacity
utilization by 1985. The Government has agreed to introduce the entry
fees and the Sound & Light program fee described above by the time the in-
vestment program is completed, and to review these fees with the Associa-
tion from time to time. Based on the results of such reviews, the fees
would be adjusted periodically in light of relevant changes in price leve'ls,
so as to maximize returns on investments within the sites.
4.19      The operating costs associated with these revenues are quite low,
especially since the trails and interpretive services are to be designed for
self-guided tours through each site. Administrative and maintenance costs,
including the collection of entrance fees, is estimated to amount to only



- 22 -
about 10% of sales. Operating costs, primarily payroll, for the Sound &
Light performance are much higher, and are estimated at 50% of gross
revenue. On the basis of these assumptions, the MTA is expected to achieve
a combined internal financial rate of return on the site service operations
of 18.6%.
4.20      The Government has agreed to require the MTA to establish a
system of commercial accounts, acceptable to the Association, for the
hotel and restaurant operations as well as the sites and Sound & Light
activities. The financial records would be maintained according to gen-
erally accepted accounting principles, and audited annually by independ-
ent auditors acceptable to the Association. Audited financial statements
would be submitted to the Association within four months after the end
of each fiscal year of operation.
D. Economic Justification
4.21      The economic impact of the proposed investments has been evalu-
ated in terms of estimated costs and benefits in Petra and Jerash. In-
cremental benefits and costs of activities not financed under the project,
but located within Petra and Jerash, such as souvenir shopping and local
transportation, have also been included in the evaluation. Possible off-
site costs and benefits induced by the project in other parts of Jordan,
however, have been excluded on grounds that they are difficult to quantify.
Nevertheless, these off-site effects are significant and relate to accom-
modation and other facilities in Amman and Aqaba, transportation to and from
Petra and Jerash, and also to operations of Alia, the Jordanian Airline.
These activities would benefit from: (i) an increase in the visitor average
length of stay and expenditures, because of the project, of visitors who
would come to Jordan even without the project; and (ii) higher growth rates
of tourism to the country as a whole, in view of the favorable impact on
Jordan's tourism offering resulting from the proposed investments in Petra
and Jerash. On the other hand, any "diversion effects" that may take place
because of the expansion of hotel capacity in Petra would be minor, given
the limited number of rooms to be added to total capacity. The restriction
of the "economic boundaries" of the project, therefore, yields a conserva-
tive estimate of the net benefits generated. Similarly, no attempt has been
made to estimate the value -- apart from the direct benefits from tourism
expenditures -- which should be assigned to preservation of the cultural
heritage of Jordan represented by investments in Petra and Jerash.
4.22      The gross benefits of the project in Petra and Jerash would then
be the expenditures of those visitors attracted to the archaeological sites
as a result of the project, plus the incremental expenditures of those
tourists who would have visited the sites anyway. Revenues have been esti-
mated on the basis of average expenditures per site visitor of JD 2.60
(US$7.88) in the case of Jerash and JD 5.70 (US$17.27) in the case of Petra,



- 23 -
where visitors would be using hotel accommodations. In Jerash, 66% of
visitor expenditures would be on food and beverages, 18% on entrance fees,
11% on the Sound & Light performance, and 5% on "other" items, such as
shopping. In Petra, 69% of visitor expenditures would be on accommodation,
food and beverages, 18% on entrance fees, and 13% on "other" items, includ-
ing transportation and shopping.
4.23      Since the Government has stated that it would not charge fees in
the absence of investments (such as the proposed project) that would sig-
nificantly improve services offered to tourists visiting the archaeological
sites, the entrance fees included in the evaluation are considered to be
incremental. Although included in the financial analysis, gross benefits
from entrance fees paid by Jordanians have been excluded, since they mainly
represent a transfer from resident tourists to the Government. These tour-
ists would be able to visit the sites (and derive similar benefits) free
of charge without the project. With the exception of the Sound & Light
program and archaeological site operations, gross operating profits of the
facilities to be provided have been estimated on the basis of actual expe-
rience with similar facilities in Jordan. Operating costs of the Sound &
Light program and site management have been estimated on the basis of
current experience with facilities in Europe and the Middle East. Hotel,
restaurants and Sound & Light activities are expected to generate about
70% of the project gross benefits and 50% of the net benefits; entrance
fees 20% of the gross benefits and 40% of the net benefits; and other ac-
tivities 10% of both gross and net benefits.
4.24      Total capital costs associated with the project (excluding re-
placement costs) amount to JD 0.69 million (US$2.09 million) in Jerash
and JD 2.23 million (US$6.76 million) in Petra. The costs of resettling
the Bedouins have been excluded because this program would have been imple-
mented anyway. Similarly, not all the costs and benefits associated with
the telecommunications component of the project in Petra have been taken
into account, since the system would also meet the local needs of the
town of Wadi Musa.
4.25      On the basis of the assumptions indicated above, and with an
estimated economic life of the project of 25 years, the economic rate of
return on the investments in Jerash would be 30.3% and in Petra 16.9%,
for a combined rate of return of 20.1%. The economic evaluation has been
elaborated for Petra and Jerash separately, on grounds that interactions
of costs and benefits are difficult to quantify and tend to counterbalance
each other. The sensitivity of the rate of return to changes in key
variables is shown below; possible increased tensions in the Middle East
which would affect the flow of tourists to the region, including Jordan,
are seen as the main source of risk affecting the project's economic via-
bility. Conscious of this fact, the MTA has scaled the project so as to
minimize the risks involved, and yet permit viable and efficient operations
of the facilities. A 20% decrease in visitor arrivals, for example, re-
duces the rate of return from 20.1% to 15.1% (it has not been found appro-
priate to shadow price labor or foreign exchange, but the effects of doing
so in the case of Bedouin wages in Petra are shown in the table).

4.26      The introduction of entrance fees could be looked at as an admin-
istrative measure unrelated to the proposed project rather than an action
triggered by it.  Nevertheless, since the Government is unwilling to charge
entrance fees without the provision of some additional facilities, an alter-
native project incorporating the minimum investments that would likely make
entrance fees acceptable to the Government was analyzed for each site.
The economic returns on the alternative project and the proposed project
were compared on the basis of their net present values, using discount rates
of 10, 12, and 14 percent and indicate that the proposed project has signif-
icantly higher benefits than the alternative project in both sites.
4.27      The proposed project is expected to increase net foreign exchange
receipts by about JD 0.50 million (US$1.51 million) in 1979, and by about
JD 1.59 million (us$4.82 million) per year from 1988 onwards, This compares
with the estimated foreign exchange component of the proposed project of
US$6.5 million, including price contingencies but excluding replacement
costs. Taking into account the profits of the Government-owned facilities
and tax receipts generated by the project, the net annual receipts to the
Government would rise from JD 0.34 million (US$1.03 million) in 1980 to
JD 0.77 million (US$2.33 million) in 1990. The internal rate of return to
the Government on its investment would be 19.2%. Direct employment in the
facilities to be built would amount to 560 jobs (350 in Petra and 210 in
Jerash). Indirect employment in agriculture, handicrafts, transportation
and other services is likely to account for 600 additional jobs.



- 25 -
4.28      The Government, as the owner and operator of most of the facili-
ties to be built under, or induced by, the project, is expected to capture
about 85% of the project's net benefits. About 5% of the net benefits
would go to the management company of the facilities and the rest would
accrue to low to medium income groups, e.g., horse and shop owners, and
souvenir sellers.
E. Environmental and Social Impact
4.29      The environmental impact of the project would be confined
to the archaeological sites at Petra and Jerash and, given the nature and
purpose of the proposed investments, would result in a substantial improve-
ment over the existing situation. The archaeological preservation program
at each site is specifically designed to inhibit, to the extent possible,
the deterioration of both natural and man-made monuments which, together,
represent an important element of Jordan's heritage. At the same time,
the planned development of infrastructure components such as water supply,
sewerage, and watershed protection would help to safeguard the environment
from physical pollution, while the removal of the Nazzal Camp at
Petra and the introduction of zoning controls and land use regulations at
Petra and Jerash will help to preserve the aesthetic character of the
two sites.
4.30      With regard to the social impact of the project, the primarnr
concern relates to the relocation of the 96 Bedouin families who currently
reside in the Petra Basin. As noted in para. 3.14, the justification for
their removal is based on the harmful effects of their activities on the
environmental and archaeological assets of the Basin. Nonetheless, it is
important to ensure that the process of relocation does not, on balance,
result in their being made worse off than they are now. Given their
currently low standard of living, and the fact that their resettlement is
a consequence of Governmental decisions, it would seem entirely appropriate
on social grounds that their standard of living should in fact be improved
as a result of their resettlement.
4.31      In order to ensure proper coordination of the Bedouin resettle-
ment at Petra, the Government has formed a special committee, consisting
of the Ministers of Tourism and Antiquities, Interior, and Municipalities
and Rural Affairs. Other Government agencies, such as the Ministries of
Education and Agriculture and the Housing Corporation, are involved as
needed in order to assist in planning and carrying out the resettlement.



- 26 -
The Housing Corporation has conducted a basic survey of the families in
order to determine their precise requirements for housing and is currently
preparing a site plan for housing, infrastructure and related facilities.
4.32      In the short term, the provision of modern housing would, by it-
self, represent an improvement in the living standards of the Bdul Bedouins
at Petra Basin. The site, which is acceptable to the Bedouins, is located
very near the town of Wadi Musa, so that the move is only a matter of a
few kilometers. In order to provide for a sustainable, long-term improve-
ment in their living standards, however, it will be necessary to ensure
that the people involved are able to adjust to new types of occupations,
which may be more difficult to achieve. The Government has indicated that
it would provide agricultural land, farm implements and related technical
assistance for those who wish to become farmers, and that the Bedouins who
are relocated would be given priority in the employment generated by the
project. The UNDP office in Jordan has offered the assistance of a socio-
logist to study possible types of employment which might be of interest
to the Bdul Bedouins.
4.33      The Government has agreed to prepare a detailed program and a
timetable for the resettlement of the Bdul Bedouins by December 31, 1976.
This program would subsequently be reviewed with the Association and an
understanding reached on the necessary steps to be taken to satisfactorily
implement the resettlement program. The Government has also agreed to
give priority to the training and employment of the Bdul Bedouins who are
to be relocated.
V.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances
were obtained from the Government on the following:
(a)  the Government would, not later than July 1, 1977
adopt regulations that will protect the environ-
ment of Petra and Jerash (para. 3.04); among
other things, these regulations would contain
development controls governing use of land in and
around the sites, will limit the use of motorized
vehicles in the Basin and allow only horses to
carry a majority of the visitors to and from the
Basin (para. 3.14);

be consulted on the design of the hotel and
related facilities (paras. 3.23 and 4.17);
(g) the Government would cause the Telecommuni-
cations Corporation to implement and operate
the new telephone exchange facility in
Petra by the time the hotel and other facil-

but not later than January 1, 1977; this
chart would be reviewed periodically and the
results of such reviews would be submitted
to the Association quarterly (para. 3.28);
(m)  the Government would provide funds for
carrying out the project, as needed
(para. 3.29);
(n) the Government contribution and the proceeds
of the IDA credit required for the project

met (paras. 4.07 and 4.13);
(p) the terms and conditions of the management
contract between the MTA and the hotel
operating company would be subject to ap-
proval by the Association (para. 4.17);
(q) the MTA would review room tariffs and
menu prices established by the management
firm for the hotel and restaurant opera-
tions in order to ensure that the opera-
ting revenues would cover operating ex-
penses and adequate depreciation, and gen-

erate maximum returns on the investment
in the facilities. The results of such
a review would be submitted to the Asso-
ciation (para. 4.17);
(r) on completion of the project, the MTA would
introduce and cause to be collected, entry
fees for visitors to the two sites and the
Sound & Light program initially at levels
agreed with the Association; would review
these fees from time to time with the Asso-
ciation; based on the results of such re-
views, would periodically adjust the level
of fees in the light of relevant changes in
price levels in Jordan, so as to maximize
returns on the investments within the sites,
excluding hotel and restaurant investments
(para. 4.18);
(s) the MTA would establish a system of com-
mercial accounts, acceptable to the Asso-
ciation, for the hotel and restaurant opera-
tions as well as the sites and Sound & Light
activities. The financial records should
be maintained according to generally accepted
accounting principles and audited annually
by independent auditors, acceptable to the
Association (para. 4.10);
(t) audited financial statements for the hotel
and restaurant operations, as well as for
the two sites and the Sound & Light program
would be submitted to the Association with-
in four months after the end of each fiscal
year (para. 4.20).
5.02      The following would be conditions for credit effectiveness:
(a) the establishment of the Project Unit and
appointment of the Project Director, an
engineer, an architect, an accountant,
and a procurement officer to the Unit
(para. 3.22);

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
TOURISM PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTICN AND COST ESTIMATES
I. Project Description
A. General
1.     The project would consist of the following main elements, des-
cribed further below:
(a)  tourist accommodation, related superstructure facilities
and supporting infrastructure works near the entrance to
Petra;
(b) visitor facilities, infrastructure works and archaeological
preservation in Petra Basin, and also the resettlement of
the Bedouins currently living there; and
(c) visitor facilities (including a Sound and Light program),
infrastructure works and archaeological preservation at
Jerash.
B. Petra Entrance
2.     The accommodation and visitor facilities at Petra entrance would
consist of the up-grading and expanding an existing 24-room hotel to
include 76 new rooms, catering and shopping facilities, reception and
administrative space. The facilities would be designed so as to provide
services both for the hotel guests and for the large number of daily
visitors.
3.     The new hotel facilities would be built north of the present
visitor center in close proximity to the existing rest house and guest
rooms.  Furthermore, expanded public areas (lobbies, reception, lounge,
restrooms) as well as restaurant space would be provided for the in-
creasing number of day visitors to Petra. Dining facilities would
have a seating capacity of 200. There would also be a spacious terrace
for mid-day food service, which would triple the present capacity. A
complete range of kitchen facilities for food service and cold storage
are included, adequate to serve 1,000 mid-day meals. Space has also
been provided to meet laundry, service, administration and front office
requirements.



ANNEX I
Page 2
4.     The hotel has been planned to have an 5oasiall atmosphere,
with a desert palm and fountain garden in the interior court. All
new rooms face inward, with the terrace and dlning room located at
one end. The active recreation areas for riding, tennia and swimming
are located to the north of the hotel complex. With the construction
of the new hotel facilities, the existing dining room located in an
ancient Nabatasan "tomb" will be converted into a Bedouin-style loune
mainly for evening sooial activities, using Bsdouin-sty2le carpets and
cushions.
5.    To accommodate young visitors and scholars on limited budgets,
modest camping facilities would be provided to the northwest of the
planned hotel camplex and would include an access trail, fixed eqmip-
ment for campfires, toilets, showers and a storage room. Trees and
shrubs would be planted to provide shade and a sense of privacy. The
area designated for camping can be expanded to accommodate 150 tents --
the maximum capacity of the site.
6.    Staff quarters for the key archaeological and administrative
staff (12 families) have been planned adjacent to the Petra entrance
facilities. This would allow the archaeologists now living in the
Basin in Nabataean tombs to move out, and provide an incentive to
qualified staff to relocate themselves from Amman. The quarters are
proposed in a cluster arrangement against the hillside. The dwellings
have been sited so that the cluster can be expanded to 24 dwellings.
They would visually form part of the village of  adi Musa.
7.     To improve services and safety relating to horse rental activities,
the existing stables would be removed and new stables built on the flat
across the village of Wadi Musa and opposite the visitor center. These
new facilities would include stables for 50 horses, a large corral,
storage space, water supply, electricity and toilets. A separate septic
tank and leeching fields will be used to treat sewage, including stable
wastes.
8.     The existing visitor center is the initial contact point for
visitor information and orientation to Petra and needs to be upgraded.
The project includes equipping the center with adequate interpret
material for museum exhibits, necessary audio-visual aids, and a three-
dimensional model of the Petra Basin. The design of the audio-visual
space would permit the free flow of visitors and encourage those that
wish to remain to do so. Interior finishes would be in an Arab motif.
9.    Provision of uninterrupted service of adequate quantities of
safe, potable water is of crucial importance to tourists. The main source
of water at present for both Petra and the town of Wadi Musa is a well
at Ein Msa, which has a mean flow of 23.69m3 and a minimum flow of
4.7m3 per hour, or 113m3 per day. The Water Supply Corporation of Jordan,



ANNEX I
Page 3
which is charged with the responsibility of supplying water for all
urban settlements, estimates the needs of the town alone to be in
excess of 250 cubic meters a day. It has accordingly designed and
funded a new water source near Bir El-Qa (well PP 64) which is
estimated would yield a minimum of loom3 per hour. Chemical tests
have shown the water to be of excellent quality, requiring only
chlorination. The WSC is planning to begin construction of a 9 kmi,
20 to 25 inch transmission line from the new well to Wadi Musa which
would provide the town and the surrounding area with 800m3 a day,
much more than is needed at present.
10.    Water needs for the existing and proposed tourism facilities at
Petra Entrance have been calculated to be 210m  a day. Water would
come from the new well due for completion in August 1976. The project
includes facilities that would connect Petra to the system serving the
town of Wadi Musa, as well as facilities for the treatment and storage
of water. These include a 15 cm galvanized steel transmission line
from the Wadi Musa reservoir, 5 km to the northeast, a sepwate 550m3
capacity reinforced concrete reservoir for the visitor facilities, a
hypochlorinator, control valves and fittings, and an access road to the
reservoir. The reservoir would have a storage capacity equivalent
to 2.6 days of water and is considered adequate by WSC.
11.    An adequate sewerage and solid waste disposal system is as
important as an adequate water-supply system, particularly in view of
the need to keep the environment clean. The sewerage system included
in the project will primarily serve the visitor facilities and staff
quarters, but would also economically serve a limited number of private
dwellings near the Petra Entrance. The proposed system would consist
of gravity sewers from the existing facilities and the new hotel complex
to a pumping station where by force main the sewage is pumped to a
treatment plant to be located to the northeast of the hotel and visitor
center. The plant has been designed as an aerobic extended aeration type
lagoon with an 8-day retention. From the standard inlet and screening
chambers, the sewage would be treated in two chambers with mechanical
aerators that can be operated in tandem when necessary. The effluent
flows into an outlet chamber and is chlorinated prior to being released
by gravity for irrigation purposes. The plant has been designed for an
efficiency of 90% BOD reduction. The sludge would be mineralized and
drawn off every 3 to 4 years.
12.    With regard to solid waste disposal, a sanitary landfill would
be established in the vicinity of Wadi Musa to serve the town as well
as the visitor facilities. During the peak season, it is estimated that
the hotel would generate 270 kg of solid waste per day. The village,
with a projected population of 7,000 by 1985, would generate another
5,250 kg, for a total of 5,520 kg or 5.5 tons per day. A 3-ton dump
truck and a small bulldozer are all the equipment required plus a 20-



ANNEX I
Page I
dunum (2.02 has) tract of government owned land.  The solid waste from
visitor facilities within Petra Basin would be collected daily by a
"balloon-tired" vehicle and dumped at the sanitary landfill.
13.    The electric power supply at present is provided by the
Municipality of Wadi Musa with a theoretical installed capacity of
166 kva; two generators of 35 kva each and one generator of 96 kva.
However, the first two generators are presently out of service. In
order to meet the exdsting demand of the municipality, the Ministry
of Municipalities and Rural Affairs is planning to install a new diesel
generating unit of 90-100 kw capacity which is expected to be in
service by August 1977. W4iile existing and planned power generating
capacity will meet the demands of the town of Wadi Musa (186-196 kva),
it will not be sufficient to meet the power requirements of the pro-
posed facilities in Petra (80 kva). Accordingly, the project includes
the installation of an additional diesel unit of 100 kva at the Wadi
Musa power plant to supply the needs of Petra and Petra Basin and to
be operated by the .Enistry of Nmunicipalities and Rural Affairs. In
addition, a new transmission line of 1.,500 meters, laid underground,
and a voltage regulator to serve the visitor facilities have been
included in the proposed project. The existing power units at the
Petra Entrance would be used as stand-by generators.
14.    Tne project includes telecommunication facilities which would
serve both the project facilities and the town of Wadi Musa. The exist-
ing PBX (old magnets) telephone exchange in Wadi YMsa is obsolete and
cannot be expanded to meet the needs of the proposed hotel complex and
other facilities. A new public exchange PUBX with an inmitial capacity of
500 lines (expandable to 1,000 lines) of a cross-bar type is included
in the project to replace the existing manual exchange, as well as a
building (200m2) to house the exchange.   Petra would be connected to the
exchange, initially with 20 pairs of lines, partly laid underground. The
hotel itself would have a PABX internal exchange with 150 telephones, as
well as a telex printer. The ultra-hgih frequency (UHF) service between
1a'an and Wadi Musa has at present 8 channels which are adequate to meet
the needs of the project and the town through 1985.
15.    in order to provide for proper maintenance of facilities, mainte-
nance workshops would be built adjacent to the sewage treatment plant,
which would consist of an office, a workshop, four vehicle work bays,
mechanical and electrical equipment, bulk storage space, toilets and wash-
rooms, as well as outdoor storage facilities.  This faciliuy would meet
the needs of both the Petra Entrance and Basin, and would be landscaped
so that it would not be visible from the visitor area.  The existing
storage room, warehouses and equipment room would be removed when the
new facilities have been constructed.



ANNEX I
Page 5
16.    An essential item included in the project is watershed pro-
tection.  The Petra area is susceptible to flash floods which have in
the past destroyed valuable structures and cost the lives of tourists.
Hill terracing and construction of small check-dams have been under-
taken by the Ministry of Tourism and Intiquities and the Ministry of
Agriculture, but are not considered adequate. The proposed project
would provide for additional protection from the torrential flows that
race down the Wadis during the short rainy season. Three check dams
would be constructed between the visitor facilities and the entrance
to the Siq to reduce the velocity of the run-offs, provide a limited
amount of recharging of the aquifer, and serve as collection points
for silts to be cleared periodically. Structures have been designed
as masonry dams with preliminary designs and cost estimates prepared
by the MTA.
17.    The existing landscaping around the entrance would be extended
and improved under the project in order to create an attractive environ-
ment for the new hotel complex and other visitor facilities.
C. Petra Basin
18.    The number of visitors to the Petra Basin should be carefully
controlled in order to reduce the adverse impact this may have on the
environment of the area. A limit of 1,200 visitors per day will be
imposed, which would mean 300 persons per hour visiting any one monument
at a time during the peak period. The maximum number of horses that
could efficiently and safely move in and out of the Siq is calculated
to be about 300. Assuming two trips per day, a maximum of 600 visitors
could be transported on horse-back. Twelve to fifteen round trips of
a "balloon-tired" vehicle, included in the proposed project, could bring
in an additional 120 persons unable to ride or walk. Any additional
vehicular travel would become a nuisance and introduce an element of
risk for visitors.  Accordingly, the remaining tourists would have to
walk the 4 kms.
19.    To further minimize the impact of visitor activities, tourist
facilities in Petra Basin included in the project have been planned as
a single complex and are located on the west side of Wadi Deir facing
the main archaeological monuments of Qasr El Bint, the Colonnade and the
dramatic cliffs of Petra. Located in an area shaded from the afternoon
sun, the complex would consist of a visitor contact and first-aid
station along with restrooms. A refreshment bar and covered terrace for
mid-day lunch would be oriented to the view, with the food brought in
from the main kitchen of the hotel. Access would be provided across the
crest of the velocity check dam at Nazzal Camp. Office space for visiting
scholars and archaeologists would also be provided in the same complex.



ANNEX I
Page 6
20.    In support of these Basin facilities the project would include
a number of infrastructure improvements. The existing well at the
edge of the channel at %di Musa would be reconstructed and a new
pump installed to meet the water supply needs of the proposed
facilities. A new concealed pipeline to a reservoir on top of the
visitor facilities would be provided to serve the projected number
of visitors to the Basin. Water demand is estimated at 18m3 per day;
the reservoir would have a 4-day storage capacity of 72m3 of water.
21.    With the removal of Nazzal's Visitor Camp an environnental
hazard would be eliminated as currently its sewage is dumped into cess-
pools. Sewage from the visitor facilities to be constructed under the
project would be treated in a septic tank located 100 m from the water
source. The effluent would be carried another 50 m further downstream
where it would be disposed of in underground absorption trenches.
22.    Existing facilities in the Petra Basin are supplied with
electricity from an electric generator located in a Nabataean cave near
Nazzal's Camp.  The electric generator will be removed and power would
be directly supplied by the Wadi Musa power plant. The project also
provides for 4 km of cable laid underground from the Petra Entrance
through the Siq to the visitor facilities in the Basin. This line will
also permit economic connections to floodlight various monuments along
the trail, as well as to provide some dramatic lighting of the Siq
itself.
23.    Similarly, an underground telephone line would connect the Basin
to the new telephone exchange in Wadi Musa. Telephones would be provided
at strategic points along the access trail to facilitate management of
the site. The present overhead telephone line which obstructs the view
of monuments. would be removed.
24.    The project would also provide for watershed protection inside
the Basin. The ancient city of Petra lies in a basin in which three
drainage areas meet -- Wadi Musa and its two principal tributaries,
Wadi Mataha and Wadi Turkumanyah. The drainage of the upper Wadi Musa
is now diverted through an ancient tunnel into the Wadi Mataha which
rejoins the Wadi Musa in the heart of Petra at the ancient monument of
the Nymphaeum and Colonnade Street. The channelization works along
the Colonnade at the Nymphaeum and Colonnade Street especially the revet-
ments (intended to protect these monuments) have been seriously weakened.
Velocity check dams would be constructed under the project to change
the hydraulic gradient, and reduce the velocity which has badly scoured
the channel bed. The sands and silts would be retained to produce an
attractive sandy bottom at the check dams and to assist in recharging the
aquifer.  Two large check dams and eight lesser structures would be
built along the Wadi Musa for this purpose. Inside the Siq, nine dry-



ANNEX I
Page 7
stone check dams above the floor of the Siq would be provided at
strategic locati cs where debris of fill and boulders are deposited
annually on the trail. Constructed to a height of 1.5-2 m, a 15
to 20 minute retention of drainage waters could be achieved.
Vegetation would occur naturally on and around these check dams and
assist in stabilizing the Siq.
25.    The Siq access would also be improved and stabilized for foot
and horse traffic. The 900 m of surface floor would be cleaned of
rubbish and boulders and a drainage channel constructed to one side so
that an all weather trail can be maintained. Between the Siq and the
Cardo Maximus, 1,200 m of access way would be graded and stabilized
for all weather traffic, and a drainage channel built on the south
side.
26.    The project would also provide for interpretive trails to be
developed from the main access way to the principal monuments through-
out the Basin. Surfaced with crushed stone and lime binders, trails
would be designed as self-guided routes. Most of the trails would
feature alternative return routes for a maximum of exposure to the park
features.  Trail route markers, as well as "site" or monument markers
would be provided in both Arabic and Roman numbers. Descriptive
multi-lingual guide pamphlets would be available to all visitors to
facilitate comprehension of the monuments.
27.    The program for the protection and consolidation of the monuments
included in the project is described in detail in Annex II. Implementation
of the program would require the acquisition of tools and equipment.
28.   Ninety-six families of the Bdul Bedouin Tribe who live in the
Petra Basin would be resettled to preserve the cultural, historic and
tourist attraction of the area. The cost of resettlement which includes
housing on land suitable for farming is included in the project, along
with essential community facilities.
D. Jerash
29.    Visitor facilities to be provided in Jerash under the project would
include a restaurant, improved interpretive material and equipment for
the visitor center, a Sound and Light program, a small site museum, rest-
rooms and parking facilities. With the open character of the monuments
and the ease of pedestrian access through the site, the physical capacity
of the site is at least twice that of Petra and depending on the spacing
of the tours, could be increased to as many as 3,500 visitors per day.
30.    Designed as an integral element, restaurant and kitchen facilities
for indoor and outdoor dining would be provided to cater to 150 persons



AMNEX I
Page 8
indoors and 250 persons on an outside terrace. The restaurant would
be located outside of the archaeological area, and have one main
parking area. For special events, more parking would be provided to
the south near the Triumphal Arch. With the completion of the new
restaurant, the present rest house would be removed, as it is located
on top of an archaeologically valuable, but unexcavated section of
Jerash.
31.    The new visitor center, which will be the initial contact point
for information and orientation to Jerash, would be equipped with
adequate interpretive materials for museum exhibits, as well as
necessary equipment for a continuous presentation of an orientation
slide show. In addition, visitors would also view a three-dimensional
model of the site, where guides would provide detailed interpretation
and information prior to their visit to the site.
32.    Between the restaurant facilities and the Triumphal Arch,
administrative offices and maintenance areas would be provided with
workshops, storage space, toilets and washrooms.  The "Turkish"
building, and other buildings used at present for storage and other pur-
poses would be removed from the site once the new facilities have been
constructed, as they are built on archaeologically important but
unexcavated sites.
33.   Water connections to the visitor facilities and new administration
and maintenance areas would be provided. Sanitary drainage would be
treated in septic tanks and the effluent would be disposed of in under-
ground absorption trenches.
34.   A Sound and Light program included in the proposed project would
present a dramatic and historic view of Jerash, covering the prehistoric,
iron and bronze ages as well as the Hellenistic, Imperial Roman and
early Byzantine and Arab periods. An optimal viewing area to accommodate
500 visitors would be provided. The scenario would be taped in 4 or
5 languages, with programs coordinated to present two different languages
a night, during the peak season. Dinner would be served at the restaurant
prior to the presentation of the program.
35.    The project provides for the archaeological preservation of major
monuments at Jerash, including the South Theater, the Temple of Artenis,
the Temple of Zeus, the South Bridge, and the Christian
Churches. The program described in detail in Annex II would require tools
and equipment which are included in the project. To implement the pro-
gram, technical assistance and training would be provided under the
project.
36.    A site museum would be developed in the well preserved vaults
under the Temple of Artemis (the vaults were used during the Turkish
occupation as a prison). Fine carvings and artifacts in the vault would
be highlighted with the assistance of a museologist, once the vaults
have been restored and a safe and convenient access provided.



ANNEX I
Page 9
37.    To protect the historic and archaeological features, fencing
and gates would be provided at Jerash under the project.  Part of the
fencing involves rebuilding of masony walls.
38.    Interpretive trails would traverse the site and pedestrians
and the occasional service vehicle. Surfaced with crushed stone and
lime binders, the trails would be designed as self-guided routes and
provide access to the major monuments of the ancient city. The trails
would be designed for short as well as long tours and would feature
alternative return routes for the maximum exposure to archaeological
features.  Trail markers, as well as "site" or monument markers, would
be provided and descriptive multi-lingual guide pamphlets would be
available to all visitors.
39.    Landscaping under the project would be limited to the entrance
gates, terraces of the visitor center and restaurant, and their immediate
environs. Much of the excavated sites and monuments at Jerash are
innundated by weeds and shrub growth that are doing irreparable harm to
the monuments. A limited program of weed and shrub eradication and
control would be included in the project.

ANNEX II
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
TOURISM PROJECT
HISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
AND A
FOGRAM FOR PRESERVATION AND CONSOLIDATION
I. Historical and Archaeological Background
A. Introduction
1.     Jordan has been described as "history written in stone". There
is evidence within its borders of Palaeolithic, Neolithic, and
Chaleolithic occupation; the Assyrians, the Persians, the Greeks, the
Romans and the Arabs all in their time attacked and subjugated the area,
built their palaces, castles, theaters, houses and churches, traded
their merchandise and had a profound influence on the country we now
know as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Much of the history of this
part of the world is told in the Cld Testament.  Although at times
these writings are conflicting, the antiquities of Jordan bring the
Bible alive and this alone is of great tourist interest.
2.     Two of the most exciting monuments of these peoples from a tourist
point of view are Petra, a unique city hewn from rock by the Nabataeans
and Jerash, the large Roman City lying on the fringe of the desert and
rediscovered only in 1806.
B. Petra
3.     Julian Huxley has described it as "one of the starred exhibits
in the world museum of civilization". Its magic stems not only from the
grandeur of its antiquities but from the provocative mystery of its
setting in the heart of the red sandstone massif and its approach
through the narrow defile of the Siq penetrating deep into the mountain.
4.     The area is steeped in history.  Human settlements dating from
8,000 B.C. have been found at Beida nearby. At the time of the Edomite
Kingdom we get Biblical references to the City of Sela (as it was then
called) but it was the Nabataeans, who at the height of their power ruled
the country as far north as Damascus, who really developed Petra as
their capital.  Even to this day evidence can be seen of their civilization,
not only in their mausoleums and temples, but in their engineering works
of water supply, drainage, irrigation and land stabilization for which
they are justly renowned. The city was occupied from about the 5th
century B.C. and was in its heyday during the first centuries B.C. and A.D.

5.    '4th the coming of the Romans, the Nabatasans at first success-
fully defended their stronghold but as a nation paid dewly for their
resistance and finally in 106 A.D.., Petra with all its trritory becme
a Roman Province. The Emperor TraJaF built a road from Dciascus to the
Red Sea passing by Petra and from this advantageous trading position
it prospered until, in the 3rd century A.D., with changing economic
trade patterns, and the rise of Palmyra in the north, the lifeblood of
the town slowly drained away.
6.     Christianity came to Petra sometime in the kth and 5th centuries
A.D. Some of the early tombs and temples were converted into churches
and even to this day one part of the city is known as Haret, el Nasara
or the Christian Quarter.
7.    By the time of the Arab conquest in the 7th century little was
left, although the Crusaders built3 and for some time occupied, a
fort overlooking the City.  Then, unrtil the early part of the 19th
century it was lost to the Western World, to be 'rediscovered' by the
Anglo-Swiss traveler Buckhardt in 1812. It was not until. the early
1920's, however, that archaeologists first began serious investigations
of the site.
8.    Archaeologically, Petra is of great importance as it is one of
the few places where the gradual development of a civilization can be
studied through time.  The Nabataeans developed a style of architecture
of their own, founded on Greek and Assyrian lines, the characteristic
feature of which is the 'crowstep' motiff of the pinnacles. Rock faces
were cut and made smooth and great numbers of tombs (suggesting a cult
for the dead) were carved out of the mountains and on the very tops of
the crags, 'Eigh Places' were formed for sacrificial rites. Houses,
sometimes two or three story, were cut out of the rock with tiers of
'streets' and steps to give access. Coinage was introduced and a unique
and highly distinctive decorated pottery of astonishing thinness and
quality was developed.
9.    During Roman times tomb facades became larger and more imposing,
columns were introduced and some free-standing temples and other
buildings erected, but an individuality of style still remained; the
extreme softness of the sandstone prevented finely carved work,
characteristic of other Greek and Roman practice. Hence, sculptors
devised a more rugged style suitable to their material.
10.   The softness of the stone, particularly in the more vulnerable
lower strata, which are most subject to erosion by wind blown sand and
human activity, probably presents the single greatest problem for the
future survival of some of the monuents. Effective steps have to be
found to arrest this deterioration if the site is to be praserved for
posterity.

C. Jerash
11.    As an example of a well preserved Roman provincial city of
the Eastern Empire, Jerash has no equal. Its site goes back to
prehistory, but the city as we know it today was chiefly the product
of the first and second centuries A.D. The first documentary evidence
referring to Jerash came about a hundred years before Christ from
Josephus the Jewish historian. He described it as the place Theodorus,
the tyrant of Philadelphia (now Amman) brought his treasure for safe-
keeping (in the Temple of Zeus) when he was turned out of Gadara.
12.   Major town extensions and redevelopment took place sometime in
the middle of the first century A.D. in accordance with a predetermined
comprehensive plan, much of which can still be seen to this day. By
the second century A.D. Jerash was entering its golden age and when
the Emperor Trajan extended the frontiers, annexed the Nabataean
kingdom (A.D. 106) and built a series of roads, her trade prospered
and the town grew in importance and prosperity. By the third century
it had been promoted to the status of a colony.
13.    But then, as the power of Rome declined, so did the importance
of the town. It experienced a revival under Byzantine Christianity.
A large Christian community was known to exist and many churches were
built or converted from earlier temples in this period. The Moslem
conquest in about A.D. 635 completed the decline of the City until,
in the late 8th century, earthquakes destroyed many of its buildings.
14.    The fact that by and large, despite a brief occupatiOn by a
Crusader garrison in the early eleven hundreds, the ruins remained
untouched until the present era, makes Jerash of particular interest
to archaeologists. Much of the City has yet to be uncovered but what
can be seen, traces development through time and gives a clear picture
of a living towen of a past era.
II. Preservation and Consolidation Program
A. Introduction
15.    Development of the preservation and consolidation program is
based on the management principle that public use and physical develop-
ment be limited to those activities and facilities which are necessary
and appropriate to full visitor understanding and enjoyment of the sites
and monuments without detriment to the cultural and economic resources.
16.    The physical care and protection of the sites and monuments are
the responsibility of the Department of Antiquities, but with increasing
visitor use, care must be taken to ensure that human erosion is not added



ANNEX TT
Page 4
to the erosion occasioned by the forces of nature. 9The legislative
framework does exist and is contained in Law No. 26 of 1968. This law
lays the functions of the Dapartment of Antiquities aid provides for the
drawing up of the archaeological policy of the State. It sets up an
Archaeological Advisory Board which determines the draft annual budget
for the Department of Pmtiquities, and controls the granting of all
licenses to excavate and any other matter relating to antiquities. It
provides for the 'listingi' of all historic sites and monuments, the
purchase, leasing and other arrangements for preserving sites and monu-
ments from alternation or destruction or for the control of building on
or near such sites. Under the law, Petra and Jerash have been declared
national treasues and all needed land acquired by the Government.
17.    The Antiquities law has also been framed to cover all aspects
of archaeological activities: an important one being the stopping of
illicit digging which destroys not only the "finds" but also the
archaeological and historical value. It also provides legislation to
control dealing in antiquities.
18.   At the present time Law No. 26 of 1968 is being revised.  This
will incorporate the exLstirig code bringing it up to date and strength-
ening some of its provisions, particularly those dealing with the export
of objects. in addition, and as a condition of the credit, specific
regulations will be drafted under authority of the (revised) Law No. 26
for Petra and Jerash, wnich will further protect the environment of the
sites. These regulations would control construction of buildings and
other facilities surrounding the two sites on land which is privately
owned.
19.    The Jordanian Government is also a signator to the Final Act of
the Inter-Gover-mental Conference of the Protection of Cultural Property
in the event of Armed Cornflict (the Hague 1954).
20.    In drawing up a program, two important factors must be taken
into account. Firstly, nrach of both Petra and Jerash still remains to
be uncovered and there is a temptation to advocate a massive excavation
program -- an excavation program which could have immense tourist value.
But every excavation, if it is to be of lasting benefit, must be followed
by a consolidation and conservation program.  This has not always been the
case in the past in Jordan and there is such a large backlog of work
needed in both thsse sites that the temptation to excavate still further
and on a large scale has to be resisted.
21.    Secondly, in the past, consolidation has only too often been
directed towards restoration for architectural effect. Although this
approach can sometimes be justified in certain circumstances there can
be a real danger to the integrity of the true nature of the ruins. Any
attempt to go further than enlightened consolidation to preserve the
ruins as ruins shoulSd be strongly resisted.  Likewise, the use of new
and especially foreign ,aterials should be eschewed.



ANNEX II
Page 5
22.    The four-year program to be implemented under the project
takes into account the two factors mentioned above and represents
the minimum work to be done on items of highest priority. It also
takes into account the capacity of available staff and expertise
within the Department of Antiquities, augmented by specialist
advisors.
B. Petra
23.    The rock from which most of Petra is hewn is of variable soft-
ness and much of it is friable and poorly consolidated. When subject
to erosion by water, wind and sand, and human use the stone yields
readily. Although there is nothing which can be done to totally stop
this action, efforts must be directed towards slowing down this
destruction as much as possible. The United States National Park
Service in their Master Plan of 1968 recommended the use of "'Pencapsula'"
as a rock hardener. Recent information and research has shown that
this rock hardener and other brands of silicone or viscid petro-
chemical based liquids are not altogether satisfactory in practice
despite the claims of the manufacturers and in any case require renewal
at regular intervals.
24.    When dealing with natural rock, as opposed to buildings, the
prevention of capillary and other forms of water penetration poses many
problems. When wet stone dries, salts that had been dissolved are
brought to the surface and deposited thereon in the form of crystals.
These crystals either appear on the surface as efforescence or they
form within the surface pores.  If the latter happens, considerable
damage is likely.  Crystals, when they form, need room to expand and will
exert enormous pressure which breaks down the surface of the rock even
when "hardened". This weakened surface is then more prone to abrasion
from wind blown sand than it would otherwise be. This probably accounts
for the more rapid deterioration of the lower three to four meters of
rock which is evident at such monuments as El Dbir (the Monastery).
25.    To reduce the effects of wind blown sand to the minimum it is
recommended that where possible some 10 to 15 meters or more of the
forecourt in front of appropriate buildings be cleaned and consolidated
with the object of reducing the amount of sand wihich is otherwise picked
up by swirling winds. Initially the forecourts of both the Khazna (the
Treasury) and El Deir (the Monastery) will be so treated under the
project.
26.   H}nan erosion presents another problem.  Covering of worn steps
and slopes with concrete, as sometimes recommended, is no answer and
can, in the long run, cause a great deal of harm. On completion of the
project, visitors would be guided along selected paths and abraded
surfaces would either be protected mechanically by means of superstructures



ANNEX II
in appropriate cases, or newly cut surfaces. This lfind of protection,
even if more obtrusive from the visual point of view, is far more
respectful of the integrity of the criginal materials.
27.   Work at Petra under the project would include flood control
measures to safeguard the continuing existence of sites and monuments,
the consolidation of the floor of a narrow defile of the Siq, the consoli-
dation of areas in the forefront of certain monuments to reduce erosion
from wind blown sand and consolidation of the monuments and caves
themselves. These are described in detail below:
(a) Court Tomb
This "building" is one of the more dramatic of the rock
cut tombs or temples, with its impressive colonnaded forecourt.
Some consolidation work and restoration is at present being
implemented, but progress has been slow for lack of funds.
Under the project, work on the tomb will be accelerated so
that it could be completed as soon as reasonably possible.
(b) siq Area
A firmer trail through the Siq will be provided, suitable
for foot and horse traffic, and as a means to channel off
surface water, so it does not break up and wash away the surface.
The flood deposited fi.ll and boulders will be removed and
dry-stone check dams built in the Wadis which join the Siq. At
the same time, the covered and other remains of the old paved
road would be carefully exposed where possible, under the super-
vision of an archaeologist. The old water channels will be
cleaned out but no attempt will be made to restore them. This
work which is of high priority can be completed within one
season.
(c) Qasr El Bint
This is the most important freestanding building exposed
so far at Petra. It has suffered much damage in the past, but
is still termed one of "the most important surviving Hellenistic
buildings in the Near East" . Some existing masonry appears to
be in a perilous condition and consolidation is needed, requiring
extensive scaffolding and mechanic al equipment and above all
expert supervision. Before additional consolidaticn can take
place, however, fallen material both inside and immediately
outside the building will be excavated and cleared. One year
of work is allowed for this purpose under the project to run
consecutively with the consolidation program elsewhere in Petra.



ANNEX nI
Page 7
(d) The Roman Street
An excess of rainfall runoff carried by Wadi Musa and
Wadi Mataha forced the construction of a revetment to protect
the Roman structures in Petra. Owing to the lack of velocity
dams upstream, however, continuing floods have undermined
this revetment and urgent steps need to be taken if irreparable
damage is to be avoided. The project provides for this work
to be carried out under the supervision of archaeologists to
ensure that existing historic features are not damaged.
Excavation and repairs to the street itself and its immediate
features are also allowed for, covering a period of two years.
C. Jerash
28.    Work at Jerash under the project is described in detail below:
(a) South Theater
The Department of Antiquities is committed to a program
of restoration of the Theater to enable its use for public
performances and festivals. Financial provision has already
been made for the work from other sources, but this
commitment does not cover work needed on the approaches to
the Theater and in the immediate vicinity which are included
in the project.
(b) Temple of Artemis
This temple complex, is the most impressive and probably
the most important group of structures in Jerash. There have
been many occupation levels over the area of the temple
precinct and whole columns still remain buried. The most
urgent work of consolidation is to save the fine columns
that have been excavated and dominate the "Cardo". The basal
drums of several of these columns are so eroded as to
constitute a real danger of collapse. The fact that some of
the columns "move" in the breeze, although an amusing tourist
gimmick, is an indication of the stresses imposed on the already
wieakened drums. Works of wedging, grouting and impregnation
with epoxy resin will be initiated under the project and cover
a period of four years.
(c) South Bridge
This bridge is an important link in the circulation
pattern of the original town. Some work has already been done
on the bridge, but this must be continued and further consolidation
carried out soon if the bridge and the value of the earlier work
is not to be lost.  Under the project, the bridge's arch will be



ANNEX II
Page 8-
consolidated and the pavement of the bridge replaced so that
it could be used once again.
(d) Temple of Zeus
UNESCO is assisting the government in the preparation of
a computer program designed to help archaeologists restore
the temple.  The program, one of the first of its kind,
includes stone registration, storage and retrieval, matching
stone and missing stone printouts, together with a project
control program. Bat if the full potential of the computer-
ized program is to be used, it must be followed by a program
of restoration and/or consolidation, some of which is allowed
for in the project.
(e) Christian Churches
To safeguard the mosaic flooring of the churches, the
project pxovides for a protective covering in the form of a
simple roof, together with viewing "catwalks". Repair of some
of the mosaics themselves will also be carried out under
the project.
D. Subsequent Priorities
29.    Items listed above constitute the works of highest priority, but
there remains a long list of lesser priority sites and monuments on
which work has to be initiated at a later date. These include the
Nymphaeum, the Monumental Gate, the Bath area, the Triumphal Arch, the
domestic area, the South Tetrapylon, the Cardo (colonnade and channels),
the East and West Baths, the North Gate and the North Theater.
E. Weed and Shrub Control
30.    Much of the excavated sites and monuments at Jerash are innundated
by weed and shrub growth. This is not only unsightly to visitors, but
is also doing harm to the masonry. The slowly growing roots force them-
selves into cracks and joints which in the course of time not only cause
dampness and consequent stone decay but the limestone mortar is dissolved
by acid juices produced by the plants. Consequently, the stones are
forced apart.
31.    A continuing program of weed and shrub eradication and control
is necessary and will be initiated under the project. The work would be
commenced in the spring, using portable pressure sprayers. In the first
year two sprayings will be necessary but less will be required in sub-
sequent years when growth is under control.



ANNEX II
Page 9
32.    Shrub and weeds growing in the walls, after being spot
treated, would be allowed to die and then cut back as near the face
of the wall as possible. In due course it will be possible to rake
out these weeds and then the joint or crack can be filled up. Under no
circuumstances will roots be pulled out of the wall as this will only
cause the stone and joints to be broken away,, giving rise to water
penetration and making it difficult to repair.
F. Technical Assistance and Training
33.    The staff resources of the Department of Antiquities are
limited and their effectiveness would benefit from both specialist
and on-site training particularly at the technician level.
34.   With this in mind the Department of Antiquities estimated that
they would require about 40 man months of expertst services to advise
on the work program of protection and consolidation at both Petra and
Jerash. These experts will also be responsible for on-site training.
This would include the services of an archaeologist with special
knowledge of Petra and suitably qualified archaeologists/restorers
with experience of Nabataean and Hellenistic-Roman and Byzantine
architecture. The cost of these services as well as training of
Jordanians abroad is estimated to be about US$200,000.



ANNEX III
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
TOURISM FROJECT
THE TOURISM SECTCR
A. Tourism Assets
1.     Jordan is essentially an arid country, most of its terrain being
either sandy or barren mountains. Yet, despite the desert-like appearance
of the land, Jordan is rich in archaeological treasures, in tradition,
and in religious heritage. Since the beginning of human civilization,
this part of the world has been inhabited by Canaasnites, Egyptians,
Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, and many
others. They have all contributed to the rich accumwulatian of sites
and relics still to be seen in Jordan.
2.     Before the 1967 war tourism  development in Jordan was almost
exclusively around Jerusalem, where a significant number of Jordan's
relics and about 80% of her total hotel accommodations were concentrated.
The loss of Jerusalem highlighted dramatically the lack of emphasis given
before the war to the tourism assets on the East Bank, so that with
the loss of Jerusalem., Jordan also lost an important segment of its
tourism market., which is yet to be recaptured.  Nevertheless, Jordan re-
allocated its tourism investment resources to the East Bank during the
last few years and was so able to make important inroads (para. 10).
The main tourist attractions on the East Bank are Amman, Aqaba, Petra
and Jerash (the latter two have been described in Annex II).
3.     Amman, Jordan's capital, is a fast-growing city that surpassed
the 500,000 inhabitant mark not long ago.  Known as Rabbath-Ammon in
Biblical times, and as Philadelphia in its Roman period, hmman still has
the remains of a Roman citadel and a finely preserved 6,000-seat amphi-
theater. Amman is centrally located for the exploration of historical
and scenic attractions of the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea, Jericho and
Jerusalem. Amman is also beginning to attract a share of the newly
established convention market in the Arab world and with the re-
opening of the bridge over the River Jordan, has become the gateway for
tourists who want to visit the West Bank as well as other Arab countries.
4.     Aqaba is an almost year-round playground for water sports, with
superb fishing for everything from rock lobster to fifty-pound tuna. Aqaba
is also becoming famous as a center of skin diving, with water of exceptional
depth and clarity and, in the view of veteran divers, coral formations as
fine as any in the world. Adjoining Aqaba to the south are 17 km of sandy



ANNEX III
Page 2
beaches that are being considered for tourism development. fqaba is
the only place outside of Amman with hotel accommodations of inter-
national class, of which there are four hotels with 153 rooms, with a
new 113-room Holiday Inn Hotel nearing completion. Aqaba is also a busy
port, representing Jordan's only sea outlet. The present plans for the
industrial development of Aqaba is likely to affect the prospects for
developing tourism there.
5.     Not more than a 90-minute drive and a good one-day tour from both
Petra and Aqaba lies the valley of Wadi Rum, the scene of some of the
spectacular shots of the film "Lawrence of Arabia" .  Past shouldering
black and red crags, a river of pink sand flows to a mudflat valley
shimmering with mirages, where the two-towered fort of the desert Camel
Corps stands and where magnificent copper-veined cliffs flank the valley.
This is desert scenery at its best, and here the visitor can enjoy camel
rides and the traditional hospitality of Bedouins in their goatskin
tents.
6.     The Dead Sea can be reached from Amman in less than a one-hour
drive. Visitors are attracted to the Dead Sea because it is the lowest
spot on the face of the earth, and its waters are so buoyant that it is
impossible to sink in them. Still others have been coming for centuries
seeking the curative mineral waters of Zarqa Ma'in and Al Zara hot springs
close by. Overlooking the springs are the remains of HerodTs Palace
at Makavier.
7.     Ihe Desert Castles, built by the  umayyad caliphs in the eighth
century. are another visitor attraction of Jordan. Some of them are very
close to Amman, but they spread almost the length of the East
Bank. The better known are the impressive Qasr El-Kharana and Qasr Amra.
Few of the castles were built for defensive purposes, having been primarily
used by the caliphs for relaxation away from city life. Some are rich in
frescoes and mosaic floors showing the artistry and pleasures of
contemporary Arab life.
8.     There are also several Crusader Castles in Jordan, the best known
being the massive Kerak Castle. Its battlements look dowm a precipitous
descent to the Dead Sea, 3,000 feet below. To defend themselves against
the crusaders, the Arabs built in the 13th century a strategically
located castle, Qalat al Rabad, in Ajlum, minutes away from Jerash.
Sitting impressively on the top of a mountain overlooking the Jordan
Valley, it could exchange signals with both Jerusalem and Damascus.  In
addition, there are numerous remains of buildings of all the civilizations
that prevailed in Jordan at one time or another.
B. Tourist Arrivals - Trends and Characteristics
9.     Tourism to the Middle East as a whole was seriously hurt by the



ANNEX III
Page 3
1967 war. Visitor traffic to the area, based on statistics for Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, fell by 26% between 1966 and 1967,
compared to a growth of 12% per annum during the 1961-66 period (see
Table I).  In the following years, total visitor arrivals in the
region have increased gradually, surpassing the pre-1967 war levels.
10. While sharing the general loss of visitor traffic to the region
because of the 1967 war and instability in the area, Jordan has suffered
particularly from the loss of Jerusalem and the West Bank of Jordan
which contained 80% of its tourist facilities. Visitor arrivals to Jordan
declined sharply from the 1966 peak of 617,000 to a low of 257,000 in
1971. With an easing of tensions in the area, and the development of
facilities on the East Bank, foreign visitor traffic again began picking
up, increasing gradually between 1972 and 1973 (292,000 to 308,000) and
then very rapidly in the following year to 555,000. The upward trend
continued last year and is expected to reach 750,000 in 1975. Table I
shows the growth in foreign visitor arrivals in the period from 1966-75.

ANNEX III

11.    In analyzing visitor traffic to Jordan, it should be noted that
most of the visitor arrivals from neighboring countries, both Arab and
non-Arab Middle East countries, are those whose basic purpose was a
pilgrimage to the religious shrines in Saudi Arabia and the West Bank
and who were, therefore, essentially transit visitors to Jordan. On the
other hand, the majority of visitor arrivals from Western countries are
those who came to Jordan either for business or vacation purposes and who
stay at least one night in the country. Hotel statistics show that 70%
of visitors from Western countries stayed overnight in lodging establish-
ments, as compared with only 15% of visitors from neighboring countries.
Furthermore, while religious traffic is highly concentrated in 10 days
(varying with the lunar year), non-religious traffic is spread fairly
evexly throughout the year.
12.    The recent upward trend in visitor arrivals from Western countries
is more significant for tourism in Jordan than those arrivals from neigh-
boring countries. Unlike the latter, Westerners are not normally in
transit but stay in lodging establishments in Jordan for an average of 2-3
nights. Moreover, the average daily expenditures for the Western visitors
are greater than for the non-Western visitors, i.e., the average daily
expenditure in 1975 for Americans was US$45C00, for Europeans US$38.00 and
for others US$1500   The most important factors in the recent rapid in-
crease in arrivals from Western countries were:
(a)   the significant hotel development: the opening
of 300 new hotel rooms in 1974 and another 200
rooms in 1975, bringing the total of classified
rooms in Jordan to 1,200;
(b)   the opening of access by bridge across the
Jordan River to the Holy Land in 1973, which
established Amman as an important entry point
for foreign tourists wishing to visit both
the East and West Banks; and
(c)   the active efforts being made by both the public
and private sectors in promoting tourism to
Jordan.
130    In assessing the revival of foreign visitor traffic to Jordan,
it is important to distinguish between the two major visitor groups in
terms of purpose of visit, namely: (i) vacation and business, and
(ii) pilgrims. The fist group is made up of business trav-
ellers who often visit tourist attractions during their stay, vacation
travellers coming individually or in groups to spend their holiday in
Jordan, and multiple-stop group tourists who visit other destinations in
the region besides Jordan. As to the second group (predominantly Moslems
from the Middle East and Asia), a certain number take advantage of their



ANNEX III
Page 5
pilgrimage to visit one or more tourist attractions while passing through
Jordan, although the proportion is probably rather small.
C. Development of Tourist Facilities
14.    Although hotel accommodation has increased at a fast pace in recent
years, more than doubling since 1967, the development of tourist
facilities on the East Bank has tended to lag behind the growth of foreign
visitor demand, especially for hotel accommodation of international standard.
Ihere are now 28 classified lodging establishments on the East Bank, with
a total capacity of 1,202 rooms or 2,404 beds. Hotels in the three to
five star class have been commonly used by foreign tourists. These hotels
contain about 830 rooms, representing 69% of the total capacity of classified
lodging establishments. WEth the exception of the 250-room Intercontinental
Hotel in Amnan, most existing hotels are inadequate in terms of maintenance
and service and need urgently to improve their operational standards.
15.    Accommodation capacity is also rather concentrated.  Of the total
lodging establishments, 23 hotels (1,025 rooms) are located in Amman and
four hotels (153 rooms) are in Aqaba and one hotel in Petra (24 rooms).
This distribution reflects both the concentration of current visitor
demand and the rather moderate distances involved in traveling within
the country.
D. Hotel Profitability
16.    Four major factors have been taken into account in analyzing the
profitability of hotel operations, namely:  occupancy levels, room tariffs,
operating costs and capital expenditures. The acute shortage of adequate
accommodation, combined with the recent growth in foreign visitor
arrivals, has resulted in relatively high average room occupancy rates
in Jordan, particularly in Amman. The average occupancy rate for selected
hotels in Amman was about 70% for 1974, while the rates for two hotels in
Aqaba averaged about 55% in the same year, because of relatively
high seasonality in this resort area. The average occupancy of the Jordan
Intercontinental Hotel in Amman was about 78% for 1973 and 1974, and
increased to 83% during the first ten months of 1975, in spite of the
fact that the hotel more than doubled its capacity, from 120 rooms in
1973 to 250 rooms in 1974.
17.    Another factor to be considered for the profitability of hotels is
investment costs. The cost of hotel construction varies widely depending
on location, the type and size of hotel, and the availability of utilities
and other infrastructure at the site. In 1975, the average costs of hotels
in Jordan have been estimated at US$35,000 per room for a 5-star class hotel,



ANNEX III
Page 6
US$25,000 for a 4-star and US$20,000 or less for a 3-star class hotel.
These figures exclude the cost of land and related infrastructure but
take account of physical and price contingencies, as well as pro-
fessional service fees. These cost estimates appear reasonable relative
to the likely hotel operations. Based on the current experience of hotel
operations in Jordan and on an average investment cost of US$25,000
per room, it has been estimated that hotels would break even at
between 55% and 60% room occupancy.
18.    While operating costs have increased significantly in recent
years (20% between 1974-75) they have remained reasonable in relation to
gross revenues. Food costs average 35-38% of food sales, which appears
to be reasonable by international standards. Payroll costs, including
fringe benefits appear at present to be favorable, with monthly average
payroll costs of about JD 50-55 per employee (or US$151-167) and the
number of employees averaging 0.8-1.3 persons per room.  Utility costs
have risE substantially in 1975, with an average increase reported of
about 40% in the Amman area; however, utility charges have been kept
at a reasonable cost ratiom i.e., 6-9% of the total gross revenue at a
room occupancy rate of 70-75%. In summary, "5 and 4-star" class hotels
in Amman in 1975 appear to be experiencing profitable operations due
largely to relatively high room occupancies, average room rates of
US$20 - US$28 for a single room and US$25 - US$33 for a double room,
and gross operating profits of between 25-30% on gross sales at a room
occupancy of 70-75%.
19.    In response to this situation, a number of hotels are either under
construction or in the planning stage. There are five new hotels under
construction at present, four in Amman and one in Aqaba. When completed
in the next two years, these hotels would add 720 rooms to the capacity
in Amman and 113 rooms to the existing accommodation in Aqaba. In
addition, there appear to be a number of investors, both foreign and
domestic, that have been showing an interest in building new hotels in
the country. Based on data available the following table shows the
likely development of hotel capacity in Jordan during the 1976-80
period.

E. Training
20.    The main difficulty to be overcome in the expansion of hotel
accommodation in Jordan is the currently rather low standards of
service, resulting largely from a shortage of trained staff and
experienced management personnel. (This is understandable in view
of the fact that Jordan's East Bank did not have a tourism tradition
before the 1967 war.) Accordingly, the Government is determined to
make an important effort in formal and informal training. It has
already begun to undertake training programs with the help of ILO,
UNDP and IDA. The Bank Croup has included a Hotel Management School
in a recently approved education project (Credit 534-J0). With
UNDP and ILO assistance, the Government has begun to provide on-the-
job courses for hotel employees, mainly at the basic and medium level.
Moreover, a Hotel Training Center financed by UNDP is to begin
operation in early 1976. The training center has been provided with
kitchen laboratories in addition to classrooms and should be adequate
for training of basic and medium level personnel. The emphasis is
put on the basic level (roughly 80% of the program), and the
courses offered cover front office., restaurant, bar and cafeteria, house-
keeping, and kitchen skills. Students at the basic level, mostly high
school graduates (although minimum entry requirements are lower), will
graduate after two to three months of accelerated courses at the
training center and one month of practice in commercial establishments.
The intermediate level will consist of three to four months of courses
at the center plus practice at commercial establishments.
21.    The Hotel Management School located in Aman and financed in part
by the Bank Group is scheduled to begin operation in 1979, and will
train persons for managerial positions, including those of Food and
Beverage Manager, Front Office Manager and Executive Housekeeper.  The
course consists of two years of study in the school and one year of work
in a practice hotel built for the purpose.
22.    In order to train instructors for these courses, the Jordanian
Government has been sending students abroad to attend a specially tailored
course at the Hotel Management School in Beirut. Furthermore, over 10
university graduates have been granted two-year scholarships under bi-
lateral agreements with several European governments. On completion of
their courses, these graduates would be employed by the Management School.
23.    Important as these Government efforts in the training field are,
hotel managers still have the main burden of training employees to provide
adequate service to lodgers. WLth the exception of some experienced hotel
chains, hotel management in Jordan is ill-prepared to do this job
properly.  As a result, lack of trained manpower will remain a limiting
factor in tourism expansion and in the improvement of tourist services
for several years to come.  The Government should, therefore, continue
stepping up its efforts in this field, particularly in view of the fact
that a number of persons trained in Jordan leave the country to work else-
where (Gulf States) for better salaries.



ANNEX III
Page 8
F. Other Facilities and Services
24.   Aside from training, further support for tourism development is
derived from overnment investments in the transportation sector,
particularly in terms of internal road communications and inter-
national air access, which have facilitated the growth in tourist arrivals.
Jordan's network of paved roads cover most of the country's tourism
assets. It has two airports, one in Amman and the other in Aqaba. A
new international airport is under construction in Amman and is expected
to enter into operation in 1976, thus substantially improving the
services to visitors.
25.    Alia, the Royal Jordanian Airline and national carrier, has
frequent scheduled flights to most main Western European and several
Middle Eastern and Asian destinations.  KLM, Aeroflot, British Airways
and some I,iddle Eastern airlines, also serve Amman. With the completion
of the new airport, other Western airlines are expected to commence service.
Alia has nine Boeing 707, 720, and 727 aircrafts and is receiving her
first two Boeing 747 jumbo jets in 1976, when she is set to begin service
to South America. Jordan has been unable, however, to get authorization
for direct scheduled flights to the U.S., although charter services have
been operating for some time. The Jordanian authorities allow foreign
carriers to organize charter flights to Jordan, but there is no "open
skies" policy at present. In spite of this, there is no reason to
expect that air access to Jordan at present, both from the point of view
of airports and air policies, could prevent the tourism market potential
of the country from materializing.
26.   With respect to internal surface transportation, Jordan has in
addition to an adequate network of paved roads, a large fleet of taxis
and buses -- 6,950 and 530 registered at the end of 1974, respectively --
which can cope adequately with the present transport needs of visitors.
A tourist transport company, JETT (Jordanian Express Tourist Transport
Co.) in which the Government has a minority equity participation, has 20
luxury 45-seat buses to cater for tourists exclusively. Given the
policies of the Jordanian Government, one could expect that taxi and bus
fleets will expand both in response to increased general economic activity
and number of visitors, without encountering major financial or foreign
exchange difficulties. In particular, JETT is in a sound financial
position to expand quickly.
G.     Economic Importance of Tourism
27.    The economic importance of tourism in Jordan is derived primarily
from the level of net foreign exchange earnings generated by the sector.
Before the 1967 war, tourism represented more than a quarter of Jordan's
total goods and services. Immediately after the war, tourism related
foreign exchange revenues fell below JD 5 million a year, representing some



ANNEX III
Page 9
10% of total exports. Since the war, gross foreign exchange receipts
have grown to JD 32.2 million in 1975, representing over 1 % of total
exports (Tables 5 and 6). Tourism ranks behind workers' remittances
from abroad (30%) and ahead of phosphate exports (10%). Net foreign
exchange earnings, after deducting imported goods and services, are
estimated to be about 65% of gross receipts.
28.    Employment generated by the sector has not recovered as rapidly
as foreign exchange receipts, but the projected expansion of hotel rooms
and related facilities over the next several years will add a significant
number of new jobs. At present there are an estimated 5,000 people
employed directly in the sector, excluding ground transportation services,
and perhaps another 4,000 people employed indirectly in meeting demand
generated by foreign visitors. This figure is comparatively small and is
a reflection of the still low level of services in shops and entertain-
ment activities throughout the country. It is estimated that some 1,200
people work in hotels, or an average of just over o6 employees per
room (the ratio is higher for better class hotels), also a reflection of
the small percentage of international class hotels on the one hand, and
the poor level of services in hotels on the other.
H. Institutional Aspects
29.    Although the primary responsibility for developing tourism facilities
rests with the private sector, the Government plays an important role in
the overall planning and promotion of tourism sector growth. Within the
Government, responsibility for the sector lies with the Ministry of
Tourism and Antiquities (MTA) whose main tasks include:  (a) the develop-
ment and implementation of tourism policies; (b) the preparation of 5-year
plans for the sector; (c) the identification, protection and improvement
of Jordan's historical and archaeological assets; (d) advertising and
promotional activities abroad; (e) implementation of some infrastructure
works in specific tourist areas; and (f) in conjunctian with the Ministry
of Education, the development of training programs and facilities for
workers engaged in tourism services.
30.   To carry out some of these functions, the Ministry has two depart-
ments (the Department of Tourism and the Department of Antiquities) with
a total staff of around 350 permanent employees, and a Tourism Board chaired
by the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities and with representatives from
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry for Information, Industrial
Development Bank, the Travel Pgents Association, and the Director General
of Tourism and of Antiquities. The Department of Tourism employs just
over 150 persons, including 41 university graduates and a tourist police
force. The Department of Antiquities has some 200 persons on its payroll,
including 45 university graduates, 29 of whom are archaeologists.  In
addition, the Department of Antiquities employs on a temporary and
seasonal basis an average of 450 manual workers annually. The Department



ANNEX III
Page 10
of Tourism's budget was JD 288,000 in 1974 and JD 355,000 in 1975. The
Department of Antiquities budget for 1974 was JD 200,000 and JD 281,000
in 1975.  The Ministry has one tourism representative attached to the
Jordanian embassy in Saudi Arabia, and beginning in 1976 is planning to
add several more to diplomatic missions in Western Europe and the U.S.
31.    Under the umbrella of the Department of Tourism, several regional
tourism commissions have been organized with representation from local
governments, local business, tourism workers, and the community at large.
These commissions are responsible for supervising the tourism activities
and advising the Department of Tourism on matters relating to tourism in
general within their areas of jurisdiction.  There is also a permanent
commission at the national level, responsible for the development of
domestic tourism.
32.    The staff resources of the YLnistry are limited and their effective-
ness would benefit from specialist training. At certain levels, the
Ministry could be further strengthened by the selection and appointment
of experienced staff.
33.    In addition to the role played by the Ministry of Tourism and
Antiquities, the Government is also supporting the sector by investing
in hotels, either directly or through the Government-owned airline,
Alia, and the Hotel and Resthouses Corporation (HRZ). The Corporation
manages its establishments, most of which are small resthouses and
restaurants located in areas where private investments are not yet forth-
coming.
34.    In addition to attempting to open new areas, and investing in
facilities, the Government offers the private sector a number of investment
incentives under the Investment Encouragement Law No. 197 covering
tourism industry, housing and land reclamation projects, including the
following:
(a)  exemption of custom duties and other custom levies on
machinery, equipment, and spare parts;
(b)  exemption of profits from income tax for six years in
the case of projects located in Amman and for nine years
in other regions;
(c)  exemption of property tax on the land and buildings
covered by the project for five years in the case of
projects located in hmman and for seven years in other regions;
(d)  free transfer of profits; and
(e)  free transfer of capital after two years from date of
commencement of operations.



ANNEX III
Page 11
35.    Investors in the tourism sector also benefit from the avail-
ability of finance on attractive terms. Interest rates, both on
Government and private bank loans, range between 8% and 10% for
investment projects, and loans are being extended up to 12 years,
including two years of grace for hotel construction, and up to six
years for transport equipment. Moreover, the Government sometimes
extends guarantees on loans granted by private banks. Loans usually
cover 65Q of the projects' cost in the case of hotels.  The most
active institution in financing tourism projects is the Industrial
Development Bank (IDB). Tourism loans approved by IDB during the
last ten years have fluctuated very widely in relation to the few
but sizable hotel projects that have been implemented as the following
table shows:
Table III
Loans to Tourism Projects Approved
by IDB, 1965-74 (in JD)

36.   Besides IDB, some commercial banks have also been active in tourism
but their terms are slightly less attractive.  The following table shows
the outstanding loans of the tourism sector at the end of each year:
Table IV

978,000   886,000  924,000  1,379,000  1,527,000  1,993,000
37.    As both tables indicate, thwe was a renewed interest in tourism
investment in 1972 which began to materialize in 1973 and has continued since.
I.     The Five-Year Plan, 1976-80
38.    Given the growing importance of tourism to the economy, tourism
has been accorded high priority in the Five-Year Plan for 1976-80. Invest-
ments in the sector are projected at about JD 2h.0 million for the period.
The plan's main objectives in tourism are:
(a) to stimulate foreign and domestic tourism so as to
increase the number of incoming tourists and to lengthen
their stay in Jordan by creating the appropriate incentives;



ANNEX III
Page 12
(b) to stimulate domestic tourism in order to limit
the travel of Jordanians abroad;
(c) to preserve the historical, cultural, and aesthetic
environment through the implementation of national
park schemes; and
(d) to provide the necessary manpower for tourist services,
and to improve the level of its performance;
39.    To achieve these goals, the Government is planning to:
(a) amend tourism legislation to facilitate freer movement
of visitors in and out of Jordan;
(b) increase promotion and marketing activities by coordi-
nating the action of all public and private agencies
working in the tourism field;
(c) coordinate with Syria and Lebanon, the signatory states
together with Jordan of a 1974 Tourist Region Agreement,
in undertaking market studies, advertising campaigns,
and development of circuit tours to increase the
tourist activity in the entire area;
(d) encourage private sector investment in tourism;
(e) strengthen the role of the M'inistry of Tourism
Antiquities, supply it with skilled personnel; and
(f) train personnel to serve in tourist establishments.
40.   Besides the Petra and Jerash projects which are accorded highest
priority, the Five-Year Plan undertakes to implement several other
projects, the main ones covering the following:
(a) provision of facilities at Zarqa Malin and Al Zara
mineral hot springs, at a cost of some JD 1 million;
(b) upgrading the Resthouse Corporation hotels and
restaurants, at a cost of JD 0.7 million;
(c) construction of the National Museum in Amman, at a cost
of JD 1.3 million;
(d) general restoration and preservation of ruins, at a cost
of JD 096 million; and
(e) the encouragement of the private sector investments in
hotel projects, restaurants, entertainment places and
other tourist services during the plan period, are projected
at JD 12.5 million, mostly in hotel accommodation.

J. Future Visitor Arrivals to Jordan
41h     Evaluation of the future market demand for Petra and Jerash
necessarily begins with an assessment of the proportion of total visitor
arrivals in Jordan who will visit tourist attractions during their stay
in the country. Available data suggest that about 22% of Arab visitors
from neighboring countries and about 15% of the other regional visitors
(mainly from Turkey) come to Jordan either on vacation or for business
purposes, rather than as pilgrims or for visiting relatives. Of visitors
from lWestern countries, over 80% of arrivals are either on holiday or
business trips and the remainder come to Jordan for other purposes, such
as research or studies. On the basis of these data, the proportion of
foreign arrivals who are likely to visit tourist attractions would amount
to about 26% of total foreign arrivals to Jordan. The following table
summarizes the results of assessments on arrivals to Jordan in 1974 and
1975.

ANNEX III
Page 14
42.       Most of the visitors from Western countries come by air.  This
traffic has been increasing rapidly as is reflected in statistics of some
airlines flying into the region. For example, the number of passengers
carried by Alia, the Royal Jordanian Airline, increased by 50% between
1973-74 and by 61% during the first ten months of 1975 over the corresponding
period in 1974., though part of this latter growth may have been affected by
the extraordinary conditions in Beirut. Of the Western visitor traffic (i.e.,
business travellers, single-destination holiday makers to Jordan, and multiple-
stop group tourists), the segment which has perhaps the greatest market
potential is multiple-stop group tourism, because Jordan's tourism assets
complement rather than compete with those in neighboring destinations. Haw-
ever, Jordan has not developed this market sufficiently because of the
severe scarcity of acceptable accommodation facilities. In particular, the
existing hotels of acceptable international standard have experienced high
room occupancies and have had heavy bookings for their rooms. The tight
hotel capacity has caused substantial frustrated demand in the holiday
market. This situation, however, is gradually being rectified and present
plans call for the construction (see para. 4.12) of 2,400 hotel rooms to
come into operation by 1980, bringing the total of hotel rooms in Jordan
to 3,600 by 1980. The traffic implications of this total hotel capacity
are substantial. By 1980, when all the planned hotels would be in full
operation, the number of tourists who could be accommodated in Jordan
would be more than 420,000 1/
430       The number of visitors coming to Jordan for business or vacation
purposes has been projected to grow at an average annual rate of 15% between
1974-80, reaching a projected arrival number of 336,000 in 1980. This growth
rate is small compared to the average growth rate of 29% per annum during
the 1971-74 period, though this period reflects a rapid recuperation from
the civil strife in 1970-71  2/   A much higher rate of growth than that pro-
jected may well be achieved for many reasons: the potential impact of the
proposed investments in Petra and Jerash on Jordan's tourism, the signifi-
cant expansion in fleet and tours arrangements by Alia, and inclusion of
Jordan in the routes of several major West European airlines in 1976-77,
the projected 25% per annum increase in Jordan's hotel capacity over the
next few years (Table 5 of the main report), and the active promotional
efforts being made by both private and public sectors0 The Government, will
however, have to periodically evaluate the country's promotional
efforts to ensure that the needs of the sector are met. Because of the
higher absolute number of visitors and a gradual elimination of repressed
demand, it is assumed that the growth rate would decline during the sub-
sequent five-year period of 1980-85 to 12% per annum, reaching 590,000
arrivals in 1985 and to 6% per annum thereafter. Overall, this would mean
an average increase of about 13.5% over the next ten years (1976-85).
The projected number of business and holiday visitors to Jordan is given
in the table below.
1/ Average room occupancy is conservatively estimated at 65% with a 15%
double occupancy factor for an average length of stay of three nights0
2/ The projected number of European and North American visitors --who would
represent the great majority of visitors to Jerash and Petra-- would sur-
pass the pre-1967 war peak only in 1979-1980.

K. Future Visitor Traffic to Jerash and Petra
44.       The development of tourist facilities and the enhancement of the
attractions at Petra and Jerash may be expected to attract increasing numbers
of visitors from 1979 on, following completion of project implementation.
Because of its location and accessibility, which make it a convenient day
trip from Amman, Jerash will appeal to a wide segment of the business and
vacation travel arrivals. It is assumed that about 30% of the Arab visitors
and 70% of the non-Arab visitors projected in Table 4 (main report) will
make an excursion to Jerash during their stay in Jordan, or a total of
180,000 day visitors in 1980 (an equivalent of 32% of total foreign arri-
vals to Jordan in 1974), rising to 337,000 by 1985.
450       Because of its greater distance from Amman, Petra is somewhat
less accessible to foreign business travellers who may stay only 2-3 days
in Jordan. It is, however, particularly well situated to appeal to the
vacation travel market since it can attract not only the multiple stop
group tourists but also the holiday makers who come to Jordan for a week
or more at resorts on the Gulf of Aquaba, 100 km south of Petra.  With the
development of accommodation, catering and related visitor facilities, and
with the likely growth of vacation travel to Jordan, Petra is expected to



ANNEX III
Page 16
attract an increasing proportion of projected visitor arrivals. In 1980,
about 29% of these arrivals are estimated to visit Petra, representing 1C%
of Arab and 40% of non-Arab arrivals. This proportion is estimated to
increase to about 37% by 1985, with the number of visitors to Petra thus
growing from 94,000 in 1980 to 218,000 in 1985, an average annual growth
rate of 18%o

to Jerash and Petra over the next ten-year period:

47.   Peace in the region is important for the materialization of Jordan's
tourist market potential. Jordan is particularly vulnerable, given its
present reliance on the access to Jerusalem and the West Bank for attracting
some of the Western visitors. In this respect, the predominant place
occupied by Petra and Jerash in the Five-Year-Plan has the added justifi-
cation of partially freeing Jordan's tourism potential of the vicissitudes
affecting the West Bank.

ANNEX IV
THE HASHEMITE KINGDCM OF JORDAN
TOURISM PROJECT
FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Financial Objectives
1.     The basic financial objective which the project is expected to
meet is the recovery of the investment cost plus a reasonable rate of
return. The main agency responsible for meeting this objective
would be the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MTA) which would
manage the two sites, including the Sound and Light program at
Jerash, and operate the hotel and restaurant facilities. At the
same time, those utility components at Petra which are to be carried
out by other government agencies would be expected to meet standard
public sector operating results.  The main source of revenue to be
received by MTA would be the entrance fees charged to visitors at
Petra and Jerash and the admission fees charged for the Sound and
Light performances at Jerash. MTA would also derive its income from
the expenditure of hotel guests and day visitors on accommodation and
catering services at Petra and Jerash. The utility agencies would
charge the hotel, restaurants and NTA with standard tariffs for the
use of their services. In addition to these direct revenue sources,
the Government would receive increased tax revenues resulting from
expenditures of park visitors on other goods and services during their
stay in Jordan.
B. Financial Forecasts
2      mThe financial forecasts for the hotel and restaurant facilities
have been made separately for each of the two types of operations at
Petra and Jerash. Operating projections for the hotel and restaurants
along with pro forma statements of income and expenses are presented
in Tables 1 and 2. These projections indicate that MTA would be able to
achieve a rate of return of about 10.6% on its gross fixed assets in
the expanded hotel and restaurant facilities at Petra and 25.1% on the
assets in the restaurant facility at Jerash by 1982 the fourth year of
operations. By this time, MIA is expected to be abie to generate sufficient
internal funds from its operations to meet its financial obligatianss,
if any, for this part of the project and to retain adequate reserve
funds. The financial (DCF) rate of return on investments is estimated
to be 9.9% for Petra and 23.7% for Jerash, after deduction of manage-
ment fees.
3.     These projections are based on the assumptions discussed below
and listed in Tables 1 and 2.

4.     For operations at Petra, revenues are based on an average hotel
occupancy rate of 55% in 1979, increasing to 75% in 1983, and an assumed
double room occupancy factor of 1.8%. A fairly even distribution of
visitors throughout the year, with the exception of February, can be
expected. By 1983, when the hotel would reach the level of normal
operations, the expected room occupancies by season would be 90% for
the spring, 85% for the autumn, 75% for the summer, and 50% for the
winter months. This averages out to 75% occupancy for the year. These
targets are reasonably attainable in view of the potential market for
the area and the limited number of rooms to be provided under the pro-
ject. Similarly, given the limited capacity of the hotel at Petra and
the distances involved in Jordan, restaurant services represent an
important source of revenue to MTA. These services would be provided
by a restaurant at the Petra Entrance attached to the hotel with a
total capacity of 350 seats and another facility in the Petra Basin
with a total capacity of 120 seats. Based on the projected traffic
it is estimated that the restaurant at Petra Ehtrance could serve an
average of 99-134 breakfasts, 151-362 lunches, and 107-178 dinners
daily. In addition, the restaurant in the Petra Basin expects to serve
an average of 85-197 mid-day meals daily.
5.     Daily expenditures of tourists staying at the hotel in Petra
(in 1975 prices) are projected to be as follows:
Table A
Average Sxpenditures of Hotel Guests
Rooms          4,000       12.12         43
Food           3,800       11.51         41
Breakfast   (0,500)      (1.51)         5
Lunch        (1,500)     (4.55)        16
Dinner       (1,800)     (5.45)        20
Beverages      l,OOO        3-03         11
Other          0,500        1.51          5
TOTAL    9,300       28.18       100
6.     Operating costs for the hotel and restaurant operations have been
estimated on the basis of current experience in existing facilities,
where applicable, and on standard ratios for comparable facilities in
Jordan. Cost of sales are based on ratios to departmental sales. The
cost ratios are assumed to be 38% for food costs, 22% for beverage costs,
and 50% for other costs (gift shop, telephone, laandry, etc.). Payroll
and related expenses are calculated from staffing tables for the hotel
and from average wages and related expenses currently paid in Jordan,
adjusted to reflect differences in the scope of facilities and types of
markets.  The payroll cost, including fringe benefits, has been projected
to average JD 50 or about US$151 equivalent per month per employee. The



ANNEX IV
Page 3
number of employees averaging 1.5 persons per room.  Other departmental
costs wimch include expenses for guest supplies, replacement of linen,
china and glassware, etc., are assumed will be 8% on room sales and
15% on food and beverage sales. These expenses include estimated
expenditures for administration, promotion, utilities, and repair
and maintenance. (Table 1.)
7.     Because of its location, less than one hour's drive from Amman
and on the highway to Damascus, the restaurant at Jerash could expect
to receive a substantial nmaber of guests:  some would come to visit the
archaeological site but there would be others who would visit the
restaurant only.  For the restaurant operations at Jerash, it is projected
that the restaurant would serve an average of 386-668 meals during the
day time and 118-181 dinners daily. These sales are based on the
projected foreign visitors to the area plus an estimated number of
Jordanian visitors (Table 2).
8.     The Jerash restaurant plans to have a more varied menu than the
one in Petra aid prices, shown in Table B below, are projected to be
s1ightly lover.

Evening               800       2.42
9.     Costs of sales are based on ratios to respective sales.  The cost
ratios are estimated at 36% for food cost and 20% for beverage costs.
Payroll cost, including fringe benefits, has been projected at a monthly
average rate of JD 55 or about US$167 equivalent per employee. A total
of 90 persons would be employed. Other operating costs are also based
on ratios to total sales.  These include advertising and promotion,
utilities, administration and general expenses as well as repair and
maintenance costs.
10.    While the cost of managing the facilities in Petra and Jerash will
depend upon the outcome of negotiations between MTA and potential hotel
operating companies, it has been assumed that the management fee will
not exceed 25% of gross operating profits, as is usually the case.
This is adequate to cover both a basic fee as well as an incentive
payment to the management company.

11.    Operating results have been projected separately for MA's
operation of the two sites it2 lthe So,nd sad 1i. ght performance
at Jerash. Revenues would come from entrance fees charged to tourists,
who would visit the archaeological sites at Petra and Jerash.  These
results are shown in Table 3 and -i.dicate that 1RA would be able to
achieve a rate of return on its gross fi2ed assets of about 12% in
1980, after paying for the necessary infrastrecture and utility facilities
to be provided under the project and the cost of resettling the Bdul
Bedouin families.
12.    Entrance fees to be charged are assumed to be JD 1.0 (about
US$3.03 equivalent) for Petra and JD 0.50 (about US$1e50 eouivalent) for
Jerash. In addition, admission fees charged for the Sound and Light
performances at Jerash have been assumed at an average of JD 1.50
(about US$4.55 equivalent) per persone These charges wuld appear
reasonable in view of both the touristic value of the attractions and
the level of fees charged for similar operations in other parts of the
world.
13.    Projectedrevenues from entry fees have been based on the estimated
number of visitors to each site. Special groups of visitors to the
sites who might be paying nothing or a reduced fee (e.g., students,
archaeological groups, etc.) have not been taken into account. Revenues
from the Sound and Light performances at Jerash hlave been calculated on
the assumption that 200 performances will take place annually, with 50%
of the 500 seat capacity utilized in 1.979., rising to 65% capacity
utilization by 1985.
14    The nature of Petra and Jerash site operations is different
from hotel and restaurant operations in that the operating costs are
relatively low, resulting in relatively high gross operating profits.
Based on the operating results experie.nced siy smilar operations in
Europe and the Middle East, gross operating profits for the archaeological
sites at Petra and Jerash have been estimated at 90% of the gross revenues
derived from entrance fees.  Operating costs for the sound and Light
performances at Jerash are expected to be much higher; about 50% of gross
revenues.
15.   Excluding price contingencies, but including the costs of Bedouin
resettlement and the cost of all utility itemss the overall internal
financial rate of return on total project investments would be 16%.

C. Financial Covenants
16.       During negotiations, assurances should be sought that the
Government would introduce the entry fees and the Sound & Light program
fee described above by the time the investment program is completed,
and that these fees would be discussed with the Association prior to
being introduced and adjusted periodically in line with general price
level movements, to permit the recovery of investments within the sites
and to earn a reasonable return. Approval by the Association of the
proposed management contract for operating the hotel and restaurant
facilities, including the qualifications of the firm, and the terms
and cost of their services, would be a condition of the credit. In
addition, the MTA would establish, with the assistance of consultants
acceptable to the Association, a system of commercial accounts for the
hotel and restaurant operations, as well as the sites and Sound &
Light activities. The financial records should be maintained according
to generally accepted accounting principles, and audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association. Assurances will
also be sought that the audited financial statements would be submitted
to the Association within four months after the end of each fiscal year
of operation*

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
TOURISM PROJECT
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Introduction
1.     For purposes of economic evaluation, the project's components
can be divided as follows:
(a)   a hotel in Petra, restaurants in Petra and Jerash,
and Sound & Light facilities in Jerash to be operated
as commercial entities;
(b)   non-revenue earning tourist facilities and restora-
tion and archaeological work inside the archaeolo-
gical areas, to be financed by the imposition of
entrance fees;
(c)   utilities to service the facilities included in the
two previous categories;
(d)   training and technical assistance for the implemen-
tation of the project in both sites; and
(e)   resettlement of the Bdul tribe (Bedouin) in Petra.
B. Project Boundaries
2.    W1hether the above components of the project are implemented or
not, people will continue to visit Jerash and Petra as they have done in
the past. Accordingly, the economic impact of the project has been
evaluated in terms of the investment costs incurred and the net benefits
enjoyed in the respective sites and their immediate proximity in relation
to the "without project" case. Hence, gross benefits generated by the
project have been estimated as incremental expenditures of tourists.
The increment would be achieved through the expected increase in the
number of visitors due to the enhancement of the sites and the facilities
provided (Table I) and the higher per capita expenditures of visitors to
Petra and Jerash as a result of the introduction of entrance fees, higher



ANNEX V
Page 2
tariffs on new and/or improved accommodations and catering services, the
charge for Sound & Light performances in Jerash, and improved local trans-
portation services in Petra. The costs and revenues assumptions, based
on the financial analysis of the commercial units (Annex IV), are
described in more detail in paras. 12 to 21 below.
3.     Commercial activities not financed under the project, but located
within Petra and Jerash, such as souvenir shopping and local transporta-
tion on which incremental tourists induced by the project would spend
money, have been included in the evaluation. Similar "external" off-site
benefits and costs in other parts of Jordan have not been included.
4..    Possible off-site costs and benefits induced by the project in
other parts of Jordan -- especially those related to transportation to and
from Petra and Jerash and accommodation in Amman and Aqaba -- have, how-
ever, been analyzed in order to identify any major bias from considering
"on site" costs and benefits. The effect of the project on transportation
activities between Petra and Amman and Aqaba, and between Jerash and
Amman would be beneficial to Jordan since these activities are profitable.
The project's effect on accommodation in Amman and Aqaba, on the other
hand, has some minor negative as well as strongly positive facets. In the
very short run, the expansion of hotel capacity in Petra may divert some
demand from other parts of Jordan, but this would be temporary and minor,
given the limited accommodation expansion (76 rooms as compared with some
1,500 rooms in Amman and Aqaba). In the longer run, of the 70,000 visitors
the project is expected to attract by the seventh year of operation over
and above the "without" case (some 150,000), less than 30,000 would lodge
in the expanded hotel facilities, and the remainder will be accommodated
in hotels in Amman and Aqaba. Hence, the project will induce an increase
in the number and length of stay of visitors to Jordan over and above time
spent "on-site", and hotels elsewhere would therefore enjoy higher occu-
pancy rates and profitability.
5.     Likewise, the catering facilities to be expanded in Jerash are not
expected to have a significant net demand diversion effect on similar
activities else-where. The training and technical assistance component of
the project would also affect positively other activities of the Ministry
of Tourism and Antiquities outside the project areas and tourism in
general.
6.     The effect of these "externalities" on net benefits of the project
are therefore expected to be quite positive. Hence, the restriction of
the "economic boundaries" of the project to the Petra and Jerash archaeo-
logical sites, their accommodation and catering facilities, and local
transportation and other commercial activities that take place inside or
adjacent to the sites is felt to yield a very conservative estimate of net
benefits.



ANNEX V
Page 3
7.     Although a consolidated internal rate of return for the project is
calculated, most of the economic evaluation has been elaborated for Petra
and Jerash separately, on grounds that interactions of costs and revenues
are difficult to quantify and in any event counterbalance each other. 1/
8.     Similarly, no estimation is made of the value -- apart from the
direct benefits from tourist expenditures --- which should be assigned to
preservation of the cultural heritage of Jordan represented by Jerash and
Petra. Archaeological ruins are a non-renewable resource with low rates
of deterioration, much of which occurs by natural catastrophes such as
earthquakes or major floods. Although erosion by nature and by greater
numbers of visitors will accelerate deterioration of the ruins in jerash
and Petra, they will, barring catastrophes, probably stand for several
more centuries with proper protection. The project's archaeological
component was conceived to provide enough protection to arrest deterio-
ration, through preservation and consolidation work, plus some excavation
that will have touristic as well as archaeological value.
C. Costs and Benefits without the Project
9.     The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has among its duties the
maintenance of the national monuments, for which a small budget is
provided. The present work program is insufficient, however, to prevent
some deterioration. Nevertheless, it is conservatively assumed that, from
a touristic point of view, the deterioration would not diminish the
attractiveness of the sites sufficiently to affect the market negatively
in the medium term. On the other hand, it is evident that work along the
lines contemplated for this project would have to be undertaken in Petra
and Jerash at some point within the economic life of the project. In princi-
ple, therefore, several project costs should be included in the "without"
case, but delayed some years into the future. Moreover, since it is
likely that the costs (in constant prices) of achieving some given standard
of preservation will rise as the attractions deteriorate, these future
costs should be somewhat higher than those assumed with the project. That
no such costs are included in the "without" case imparts a conservative
bias to the estimate of net benefits.
10.    Non-resident visitors to Petra and to Jerash have been projected
to grow in the "without" case at the same rate as is projected for
1/ The project would finance some minor archaeological restoration
equipment that would be used in both sites. There are also
market interactions -- attraction reinforcement and diversion of
demand -- which are assumed here just to offset each other.

visitors to Jordan as a whole (at 15.5% per year from 1975 to 1985 -
Annex III), whereas with the project they would grow at 15% in Jerash and
at 18% in Petra. Resident visitors are projected to grow at 8% per year
between 1975 and 1985. Total visitors are assumed to grow at 6% per year
after 1985 until the areas' saturation point is reached (para. 12).
11.   The tourist expenditures on shopping, local transportation, and other
related activities "without" the project have been assumed to be JD 1.00
day per visitor in Jerash and JD 2.00 in Petra.   The present accom-
modation and catering facilities in Petra and Jerash are inadequate to
serve the present demand and to permit profitable operations. The records
of the Resthouses Corporation, which operates them, show that the financial
results have been erratic, frequently ending in operational losses. For
purposes of projecting, however, it has been conservatively assumed for
the "without" case that the 24-room hotel in Petra would have yearly gross
operating profits of JD 14,000 and the restaurant in Jerash, JD 8,000.
D. Revenue Assumptions
12.   With the project, then, the number of foreign visitors would grow
in the case of Jerash at 15% per year between 1975 and 1985, and in the
case of Petra at 18% (in consideration of the broader investment program
and added attractions there; Annex I). The number of local visitors, on
the other hand, is expected to be unaffected by the project, on the
assumption that the introduction of entrance fees will offset the effect
of enhanced facilities. After 1985, visitors are assumed to increase
with the project by the same amount as without, the number of incremental
visitors reached by 1985 (40,000 for Jerash and 70,000 for Petra) remain-
ing constant up to the point when the two sites reach saturation. If no
further investments are undertaken, the saturation point in Jerash would
be reached by year 2000 and by 1992 in Petra. This assumes that not more
than 3,500 visitors per day can be handled in Jerash and 1,200 in Petra
(Annex I, para. 18), which gives a total number of visitors per year, when
taking into account seasonality, of some 960,000 and 330,000 visitors,
respectively. Since these capacities are considered to be unaffected by
the project, the saturation point would be reached earlier with the project,
and the marginal number of visitors in relation to the "without" case would
progressively decline afterwards. In addition to increased arrivals, the
hotel in Petra will make it possible for more foreign tourists to stay
longer in Petra and visit the site more than once. This is estimated to
represent the equivalent of another 11,000 site visits per year by 1985.
The number of foreign and Jordanian visitors to both areas (based on the
market projections up to 1985 presented in Annex III and the above assump-
tions) are given below:

13.    For purposes of economic evaluation, all revenues have been esti-
mated in 1975 prices.  Park entrance fees are estimated at JD 0.50 for
Jerash and JD 1.00 for Petra.l/ Entrance fees collected from Jordanian
visitors are excluded from the benefit stream since they mainly represent
a transfer from resident tourists to the Government.2/
14.    Entrance fees to Sound & Light performances in Jerash are estimated
at JD 1.50 per person and are all, including those paid by Jordanians,
incremental. The number of visitors to these performances is assumed to
grow from 50,000 in the first year of operation up to 65,000 in the seventh
(Annex III). Revenues of the hotel and restaurant in Petra and the
restaurant in Jerash are derived from the projected financial accounts
(Annex IV), which in turn, are based on actual experience of similar facil-
ities elsewhere0 Revenues from hotel, restaurants, and Sound & Light
performances represent 70% of the project's total revenues from the tenth
year of operations on (and eve  more during the first years).  Since these
facilities have been scaled 3fto cater for the existing unsatisfied demand
and the growth in the market for the next few years only (they would be
fully utilized -- seasonality considered -- by 1985), the bulk of the
project's revenues would in the latter years be quite independent of the
marginal increase in tourist arrivals over the "without" project case.
15.   The substantial growth in number and, in the case of Petra, length
of stay of visitors expected as a result of the project will also increase
other foreign tourist expenditures -- e.g., local transportation (mainly
horse rides inside the archaeological areas), guides' services, and
souvenir shopping -- which are estimated to total JD 1.00 in Jerash and
JD 2.50 in Petra per person per day. Although there would be an expected
increase of JD 0.50 in Petra, where horse stables and transportation equip-
ment are being provided (no such increase is expected in Jerash), these
1/ MTA may charge differential rates according to domestic and
foreign, or season of the year, in which case these estimates
could be considered as weighted averages.
2/ This procedure ignores: (a) the increased benefit to residents
from being able to visit enhanced sites; (b) the favorable
distributional effect of transferring receipts fron (relatively
well-off) Jordanian tourists to the Government; (c) the unfavorable
distributional effect of the shift of consumer surplus to these
relatively well-off Jordanians who would visit the improved parks
from less well-off Jordanians who would not visit the parks because
of the entrance fees.
3/ Future expansions are likely to take place but they have not
been considered in the economic evaluation.

figures are still very low by international standards and are based on the
unsophisticated services presently offered to tourists. It is a conserva-
tive estimate, therefore, because it does not take into account the level
of services that can evolve in the future. The estimated expenditure
breakdown on these items is presented below:
Table II

Local Transportation             10%      50%
Souvenir Shopping                 7C%     40s
Guides and Other                  2C%     10%
Total                         100%    100%
16.    Tourist activities pay few taxes in Jordan.  Not only are most
tourism-related enterprises covered by the Investment Promotion Law
(Annex III), but tourists pay sales taxes only in shops. In the case of
Jerash and Petra, where almost all facilities would be owned and operated
by the Government, tax revenues have been estimated to play an insignifi-
cant role (sales tax is estimated at 5% of souvenir sales).
E. Investment Cost Assumptions
17.    For purposes of calculating economic rates of return on the develop-
ment of each archaeological site, the investment costs have been derived
from the estimates of construction costs (or purchase price) for most
project components, with the exception of the telecommunications component
of the project and the costs of the Bedouin resettlement program. The
portion of the costs of the telecommunications component excluded in the
economic evaluation (60%) corresponds roughly to the incremental cost of
having chosen a larger telephone exchange in Vadi Musa than strictly needed
by the project in order to service the town's present and future needs.
The new automatic exchange would cut operational costs, such as skilled
operators' wages and repair and maintenance costs, of running Wadi Musa's
obsolete telephone installation. The new exchange would provide more and
better services, expected to be fully paid by the community. This portion
is therefore judged to be justified on its own merits. With regard to the
resettlement of Bedouins, the Jordanian Government has already set up a
high-level commission to study the resettlement program and has stated that
it would be implemented with or without the project. Hence, these costs
are excluded altogether. The estimated investment cost of other than hotel,
restaurant, and park-related tourist activities induced by the incremental
visitor expenditures (JD 40O,000 in Jerash and JD 100,000 in Petra) has been



ANNEX V
Page 8
added to the project-financed components in order to build the relevant
investment cost stream within the project's boundaries.
18.    For project-financed components, price contingencies have been
excluded (physical continrenci2se have been left in).  Replacement costs
for Petra have been estimated at JD 10,000 per year for the second and
third years of operation and JD 20,000 thereafter, and at JD 20,000 per
year for Jerash. These estimates are based on replacement reserves
typical for accommodation and catering facilities (2% of sales), plus
JD 5,000 per year for other project components. In view of the tax
exemptions granted to tourist investments (para. 15), no import tariffs
have been deducted from the investment costs.
F. Operating Cost Assumptions
19.   The operating costs of the Jerash and Petra archaeological sites
have been projected taking into account the cost of site maintenance
already incurred by M4TA and the impact the collection of entrance fees
and the increased number of visitors will have on them. It was estimated
that the incremental cost would be covered by 10% of the entrance fees
paid by visitors in both areas. The Sound Pe Light performances in Jerash
would have estimated operating costs amounting to 50% of the fees
collected (Annex IV).
20.    The hotel and restaurant operating costs are also based on the
financial projections presented in detail in Annex IV, which, in turn,
take into account the cost structure of similar facilities in Jordan and
both sites' pecularities. The operating cost Drojections of the accom-
modations and catering facilities in Petra range from 82% of sales during
the first year of operation dowr to 69% from the seventh year onward.
The operating cost projections of the restaurant in Jerash range from 93%
of sales during the first year to 78% from the seventh year onward. The oper-
ating costs of the management company was estimated at 20% of management fees.
21.      The operating costs of the non-project financed commercial activi-
ties have been estimated at 65% of sales, based on their present level of
operation and on knowledge of similar activities in other countries.
Although operating costs of horse rides would appear to be mulch lower than
those of other activities, it has been conservatively assured that they
also represent 65% of sales.
G.  Internal Economic Rate of Return

21            20        570         990            20        730       1,290
22            20        580       1,010            20        730       1,290
23            20        58u       1,030            20        730       1,290

23.   Based on these streams (the base case), the internal economic rate
of return is 30.3% in Jerash and 16.9% in Petra, with a horizon of 25 years
(2 years of construction and 23 years of operation) and no residual value
being considered. The total Droject rate of return is 20.1%, Net revenues
by year 10, represent JD 0.30 million in Jerash and JD 0.55 million in
Petra. These fall in the case of Petra in later years as the effect of
saturation is felt.

24.       Labor at all levels of training seems to be scarce in Jordan so
that shadow wages should not be applied generally. The project will, how-
ever, provide employment in Petra to Bedouins who are currently under-
employed but who would not seek employment outside their settlements in
and around Petra. The wages of these Bedouins are estimated to represent
roughly 10% of total operating costs in Petra. With shadow wages equal
to 75% of their market wages, the internal economic rate of return in
Petra would be 18.7% and 21.4% for the total project.
H. Sensitivity Analysis
25.       The sensitivity of the project's rate of return to changes in
costs, gross operating profits, prices, visitor arrivals, and commence-
ment of operations, is presented below:

ANNEX V
Page 11
26.       As can be observed from Table IV, the project is not very sensitive
to changes in total visitor arrivals to Jordan (and to the sites). The effect
of a reduction in visitor arrivals would be particularly weak in Petra, where
the 100-room hotel would be fully utilized (seasonality considered) with
significantly less visitor arrivals than those shown in the best estimate
market projections.  1/   Overall, the project has been conservatively scaled
in relation to the best estimate market projections (see para. 14 of this
Annex) in view of the uncertainties stemming from the instability in the
Middle East which has resulted in wide fluctuations of visitor arrivals to
the region in the past.
27.       The project's rates of return are also moderately sensitive to
changes in gross operating profits. It is especially important that the
accommodation and catering facilities -- which, as indicated before, re-
present the bulk of total revenues -- be properly managed to realize the
projected profits (see financial covenants in Annex IV). Pursuant to this
end, the Government is planning to enter into a management contract with an
experienced company to run these facilities and the project includes a
housing component in Petra to mitigate the problem imposed by the relative
remoteness of the area on higher level staff recruitment. In addition, the
project provides technical assistance for the efficient operation of other
facilities.
28.       The project's rates of return are slightly more sensitive to
changes in prices. These, however, are unlikely to fall much below the
projected level, given Jordan's rather strong price competitive position
in the Middle East and that rather conservative price assumptions have been
used in the best estimate case.
I. Balance of Payments Effect
29.       The estimated foreign exchange component  of the project's costs
and revenues are shown below:

1/ The projected gradual build-up of the hotel occupancy rates corresponds to
the time needed to establish Petra as a destination possessing international-
class accommodation rather than to the projected build-up of visitor arrivals.

30,       The project's net foreign exchange earnings (defined here as
recurrent revenues minus recurrent costs) based on the percentages of
Table V above, are shown below:
Table VI
Project's Net Foreign Exchange Earnings
(in JD million)
Jerash Petra Total
First Year of Operation              0.19    0.31   0.50
Fifth Year of Operation              O.41l    0.84   1.25
Tenth Year of Operation Onward       0.53    1.06   1.59
In comparison to these net earnings, the foreign exchange component of the
investment costs relevant for the economic evaluation, but excluding re-
placement costs, is estimated at JD 1.47 million, or JD 0.35 million in
Jerash and JD 1.12 million in Petra. The project's net foreign exchange
receipts would reach JD 1.59 million (US$h.8 million) per year by the
tenth year of operation, when gross foreign exchange receipts would reach
JD 2.0 million (US$6.1 million). Gross foreign exchange revenues from
tourism in Jordan were JD 32.2 million (US$98 million) in 1975.
J. Employment EVfect
31.       The project is expected to create some 350 permanent jobs in
Petra and 210 in Jerash after seven years of operation, more than half of
those in the hotel and restaurants, but also including park operations,
shops, guides, and local transportation.  The indirect employment effect
of the project can be estimated very roughly at some 300 to 500 in Petra
and 150 to 300 in Jerash, mainly in land transportation, handicrafts,
and agriculture. Total direct tourism employment in Jordan is estimated
at 5,000 in 1975.
K. Government Finances Effect
32.       The Government is expected to gain good returns on its investment
in Jerash and Petra. It would profit substantially from the park, accom-
modation and catering facilities it would own. In addition to the sales



ANIJEX V
Page 13
and profits generated by these facilities, the Goverrnment would collect
small sales taxes from tourist shops (estimated at 5% of sales). Revenues
from income taxes induced by the project, with the exception of management
company (estimated at 20% of fees), have not been estimated. The main
sources of Government net revrenues are the hotel and restaurants. Almost
as important are the sites themselves, especially after taking fully into
account the entrance fees paid by Jordanians which were not accounted for
in the economic evaluation (para. 13). The full teleconmmunications compo-
nent cost was included here, but cost and revenues related to non-project
financed commercial activities are excluded.
33.    Teo elements dese-re special consideration in calculating the
Governmentis discounted cash flow internal rate of return. These relate to
the effect of the Bank Group credit and the Bedouin resettlement program
on the C-overnmentts cash flow.  To analyze the direct effect of the project
on Government finances, both elements have been included (Case 1) and the
expenditures and revenues calculated on the above asssumptions are presented
below:

34.   Considering, on the other hand, that the Bedouin resettlement
program would be implemented "without" the project at Government expense
and that the Bank Group's credit is not tied to the project so that another
Government project could have been financed by the Bank Group in the "with-
out"? project case, these two elements have been excluded from the Govern-
ment's cash flow table (Case 2) presented below:

L. Distribution of the Project's Net Benefits
35.    The Government, as the owner and operator of most of the facilities
to be set up by the project, would be expected to capture the bulk (almost 5%)
of the project's net benefits. The rest, with the exception of the management
company, is expected to be captured by low to medium income groups. The mana-
gement company would capture only some 5% of the total net benefits. The bene-
fits accruing to other private-entrepreneurs in Petia and Jerash, although not
substantial in absolute terms, are expected to be high as compared to the
small investment cost associated with them (the internal rate of return
of non-project financed commercial activities would be more than 50%)*.
Most of these entrepreneurs would be local people selling souvenirs and
handicrafts, and Bedouins renting their horses; although not the poorest
segment of their communities they are, however, probably part of Jordan's
low income group. In addition to these benefits, Bedouins working in the
project's facilities should earn higher wages than in any alternative
occupation they would be prepared to accept. The additional consumption
this margin would make possible would be a benefit enjoyed by some of the
poorest groups in Jordanian society. The effect of the project would,
therefore, be in the direction of equalizing income distribution.
M. Alternative Project
36.    The Government is expected to introduce park entrance fees in Jerash
and Petra to help recover the costs of the proposed project. Entrance fees
could, however, be charged with small investments being required to allow
their collection0 The introduction of entrance fees, therefore, could be
looked at as an administrative measure unrelated to the proposed project
rather than an action triggered by it. Nevertheless, since the Government
is unwilling to charge entrance fees without the provision of some additional
facilities, an alternative project incorporating the minimum investments
that would likely make entrance fees acceptable to the Government was ana-
lyzed for each site. The alternative project consists of all the components
incorporated in the proposed project with the exception of accommodation and
catering facilities and the utilities to serve them, the Sound & Light
installations, and most of the excavation equipment and archaeological works0
No additional visitors (and no additional expenditures on other commercial
activities) over the "without" case are assumed for the alternative.
37.    Since these are viewed as mutually exclusive, the economic returroon the
alternative project and the proposed project are compared on the basis
of their net present values. These are presented below, using discount
rates of 10, 12, and 14 percent0

Net Present Value

Discount Rate         Discount Rate

Jerash             0.27   0.22   0.18       1.55  1,19  0.91
Petra              Oo48   0033   0.19       1,54  0.98  0.)47
Total Project    0.75   0-55   0.37       3.09  2.17  1.38
The proposed project has a significantly higher net present value than
the alternative project in both areas for discount rates in the 10-14%
range.
35.    Another way of interpreting these results is to conclude that the
proposed project's investments over and above those necessary to charge
entrance fees yield internal rates of return higher than 14% in both sites
(15.8% in Petra and 20.6% in Jerash).1/
