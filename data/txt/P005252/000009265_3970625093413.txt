PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
TOURISM PROJECT (CREDIT 639-JO)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) presents the results of the
review of the Jordan Tourism Project (Credit 639-JO) which was approved
by the Board on June 8, 1976 and for which the last disbursement was made
on August 7, 1983.
The PCR was prepared by the EMENA Urban Projects Division on the
basis of a review of IDA files, reports prepared by the Borrower and its
Consultant, findings of an IDA mission comprising Messrs. I. T. Christie
and F. Mitchell to Jordan in October, 1983, and a mission to Washington
by the Project Director and Accountant in November/December 1983.  The
work of the IDA mission was facilitated and made into a pleasant
experience by the assistance accorded by H. E. Ma'an Abu Nuwar, the
Minister of. Tourism and Antiquities, personnel of the Antiquities and
Tourism Departments of the Ministry, and, above all, by the time and
efforts of Mr. Yousef Alami, Director of the Project Unit and his staff.
The principal author of this report was Mr. F. Mitchell; Ms. S. Advani
handled the typing.
In  accordance  with  the  revised   procedures  for  Project
Performance Audit Reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but not audited by OED staff. The draft PCR
was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

JORDAN TOURISM PROJECT
(Credit No. 639-JO)
RIGHLIGHTS
The objective of the Jordan Tourism Project was to increase the
attractiveness to tourists of two major Jordanian antiquities sites,
through construction of tourism facilities (a hotel, two restaurants),
and improvement in visitor management (including interpretive services,
charging entry fees), as well as to conserve those sites through a
variety of monument conservation and restoration works, and resettlement
of persons residing in the Petra Basin monuments.  The project cost at
appraisal was JD 4 million, of which JD 2 million (US$6 million) were
financed from the IDA Credit.
The main features of the project were:
(a)  as the first IDA operation related largely to assisting a
country  to  increase  earnings  from  antiquities-related
tourism, the project was highly innovative.  Nevertheless,
it was processed rapidly (12 months from identification to
Board -presentation) because designs were prepared during
project execution (paras. 1.02 and 3.16);
(b)  the project largely succeeded in implementing the physical
works foreseen, and in increasing the attractiveness of the
sites to tourists. The project will enhance Jordan's
appeal as a tourist destination and increase its foreign
exchange earnings from that source (paras- 4.01 through 4.08);
Cc)  cost qver-runs  (of 55%  in  nominal  terms,  19%  in  real
terms), resulted from; (i) appraisal underestimates (due
partly to the unavailability of designs); and (ii) a
failure to review project viability once designs were
available (a reevaluation then, or when tenders were
received, might have stimulated a search for lower cost
designs or restructuring proposals) (para. 3.10);
(d)  action has yet to be taken to ensure efficient management
and upkeep of the project sites. The appraisal relied upon
technical  assistance  in  museology  and  national  parks
administration - skills outside IDA's normal experience -
to  develop  institutional  proposals.   Partly  because  of
difficulties  encountered  with  other  TA  on  software
components,   specially  on  monument  restoration  works,
however, the Government did not actively pursue appointment
of the TA for museology and park management (paras. 4.06
through 4.08);



v
(e)  EDA   project   supervision   emphasized   resolution   of
substantial  physical  implementation  difficulties;   less
attention was paid to institutional and economic viability
questions (para. 3.16);
(f) the re-estimated ERR is negative (compared with an SAR ERR
of 20.LZ) due to cost overruns, a failure of benefits to
match appraisal estimates, and delays in benefits due to
construction delays. Inclusion of some indirect benefits
(not considered in the SAR) yields a positive ERR of about
4%. The re-estimated economic benefits are lower than SAR
estimates because the Government plans to introduce entry
fees  to  the monuments of only  33%  to 50Z of  the  SAR
estimates in real terms, and has fixed hotel prices well
below levels the market could bear (para. 5.01);
(g)  action  by  the  Government  to  establish  institutional
arrangements for sound management of the sites, introduce
(and then rapidly increase) entry fees, and to allow
commercial facilities to charge higher prices would raise
the ERR to a more acceptable and economically attractive
level. The above measures should be introduced as a matter
of urgency, and the project should be re-evaluated in two
years when there has been time for those measures to have
an effect (paras. 7.01 and 7.02).



PRCJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN TOURISM PROJECT
(Credit 639-JO)
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
1.01     Tourism is Jordan's  fourth largest source of foreign exchange
after  workers  remittances,  grant  aid,  and  phosphate  exports.   Most
visitors are from other Arab and Middle Eastern countries, many of them
visiting Jordan on business or pilgrimage.  The country also contains
many artifacts of ancient civilizations which attract western visitors.
Prior to the 1967 War, the Holy Land sites on the West Bank were the
major attractions for western tourists, and over 80% of the country's
hotel capacity was located there. Visits to the West Bank continue to be
an important element in Jordanian  tourism.  The country has, however,
made prudent efforts to diversify its attractions by upgrading East Bank
facilities, notably hotel capacity in Amman and at Aqaba, and the
archaeological sites at Jerash and Petra.
1.02     The Tourism Project was designed to increase the tourist appeai
of the latter two sites, to conserve threatened monuments, and to ensure
an economic return from tourism. The project has largely succeeded in
meeting the first two objectives, alchough initial gains must be
consolidated through introduction of appropriate institutional measures
for operation and maintenance.  Economic returns are more doubtful due
primarily to more spreadout expenditure than appraisal estimates, higher
costs (55% overrun), lower prices of outputs than appraisal estimates,
and to some adverse market developments (the international recessi-on, and
the effect of the Middle East security situation on tourist flows). The
Government has  throughout shown  a high  degree of commitment to  the
project.  Financial constraints did not affect execution even though -he
Government  needed  to  increase  its  funding  from  JD  2.0  million  to
approximately JD 4.5 million. The IDA contribution was US$6 million, or
JD 1.9 million, and was fully disbursed on August 7, 1983.
1.03     The most serious cost problems mignt have been ameliorated had
the project been appraised on the basis of preliminary designs (instead,
appointment of design consultants was an effectiveness condition); this
was probably not a feasible option at the time, however (para 2.04).
Dealing with the difficulties of physical implementation diverted
attention from institutional and pricing questions.
1.04     The regional security situation permitting,  the world economic
recovery should improve tourism marketing prospects in the medium term.
To secure a positive rate of return on the project investment, however,
urgent actions are required to (a) create an organization to manage the
project sites, (b) introduce entry fees, and (c) increase prices of
commercial facilities to profitable levels. Some components, with a cost
of about JD 0.3 million, are still required to complete the project; they
include  the  additional  houses  for  the  Bedouin  at  Petra  and  social
facilities  for  them.   It  is  recommended  that  IDA  re-evaluate  the
economic,  financial and institutional elements of the project in about
two years, when there has been time for the above measures to have an
effect.

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND PREPARATION
2.01     Jordan's paucity of natural resources means that the country's
economic growth is heavily dependent upon development of export-oriented
light industry and services.  Tourism provides an important potential
which the Government has been concerned to realize from an early date.
For Western tourists, the main attractions are the religious sites on the
West Bank of the Jordan River. Following the 1967 War, access to those
sites continued, but on an intermittent basis reflecting the security
situation and  Israeli policies.   Hence,  the Government paid increased
attention to developing attractions on the East Bank, and especially
Petra and Jerash.
2.02     At the request of the Jordanian Government, the U.S. National
Parks  Service   (USNPS),   in  collaboration  with  the  Department  of
Antiquities (DA) of the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities
(1TA), prepared masterplans for Petra, Jerash, and Amman in 1968.  Petra
and Jerash are important not only in a Jordanian context, but in the
larger context of the world's cultural heritage. Petra was, from the 4th
century BC to 106AD, the capital of che Nabateans, following which it
became an important Roman provincial town and was remodeled on Roman
lines.  With its tombs, houses and temples carved into the multi-hued
sandstoqe cliffs which encircle and comprise the site, Petra epitomises
the "lost city" in beautiful, rugged and remote surroundings. Jerash was
an important centre from about 6000 BC Latil a major earthquake in 742
AD.  It remains one of the best-preserved Roman provincial cities.  The
modern city occupies part of the ancient city area.
Identification, Preparation, and Appraisal
2.03     Starting in 1972, several IDA tourism missions visited Jordan;
their emphasis was upon laying the groundwork for a comprehensive tourism
development  plan,  and  upon  developing  beach  tourism.   With  the
identification of cultural components in courism projects elsewhere,
however, and strong interest expressed by Unesco's Department of Cultural
Heritage in the potential of Petra and Jerash, the Association actively
pursued the Petra and Jerash proposals when they were brought to the
attention of a mission by the Government in June, 1975.
2.04     Although the government strongly supported the project, it was
unwilling to engage design consultants until there were firm assurances
of IDA support, and their appointment eventually became an effectiveness
condition (see also para 3.01).  Preparation therefore took the form of
updating the USNPS cost estimates, and of discussions between IDA and
the DA on project components and their costs. This procedure enabled the
project to be processed rapidly (12 months from identification until
Board presentation).  This procedure was feasible due to the fact that
the head of the Planning and Maintenance Division of the DA had been the
main counterpart on the USNPS studies, and so was intimately acquainted
with all aspects of the earlier proposals, with the sites themiselves, and
with local costs. (The same person was project director during the whole
implementation period, and he provided a critical element of continuity



-3-
and direction to the project.)  The DA pre-appraisal cost estimate of
JD 5.9 million was about the same as the final project cost of
JD  6.2 million.   It was,  however,  substantially  above  the appraised
project cost of JD 4.0 million; the reduction from JD 5.9 million to JD 4
million was largely in the firm of mistakenly lower estimated unit costs
with minimal reduction in project components.
2.05     A major recommendation of the USNPS had been to establish a
Jordanian National Parks Serrice to manage the sites.  The DA and the
Tourism Department (TD) of tie MTA each had partial responsibilities for
site management but there was no comprehensive responsibility.   Vi._al
functions such as site cleansing, visitor control, preparation of
interpretive materials, and monitoring of the conservation status of the
monuments, were not performed. The question of the future management of
the project sites, which would presuppose significant changes in the
responsibilities and authorities of the DA and TD, was not resolved
during project preparation and is still outstanding.
2.06     Of  more   immediate   concern  during   preparation  were   the
arrangements for project implementation.  It was agreed that a special
Project Unit (PU), reporting to a committee comprising the Minister of
Tourism, and the Directors of the DA and TD, would supervise the project,
assisted by design consultants, and experts in archaeology, museology,
and park management services.   Considerable attention focused prior to
Board presentation on the need for efficient operation of the commercial
facilities and the actions required to assure an economic return on the
project. To this end, it was agreed that the commercial facilities would
be managed with the assistance of companies engaged on terms acceptable
to the Association, that appropriate fees would be charged for entry to
Petra and Jerash, and that hotels and restaurants would charge prices "to
maximize the economic return on tue investment costs under the Project"
(Section 4.03 of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)).
Project Objectives
2.07     The project's objectives as stated in the SAR were to meet the
needs identified by the USNPS reports, i.e.
(a)  to preserve and protect the antiquities themselves, which
were threatened by the natural forces of erosion and the
deterioration resulting from human activity;
(b) to provide physical facilities and amenities for growing
numbers of visitors without jeopardizing the archaeological
value of the sites; and
(c) to improve tne presentation and interpretive services at
each site in order to achieve the highest possible level of
visitor satisfaction.



-4-
Project Description
2.08     The project comprised the following  components:
(a)  Petra Entrance;  renovation and expansion o_ the entrance
hotel; improvements to the visitor centre; development of
campgrounds;  construction of staff quarters  for MTA  and
hotel staff; construction of a snelter for the horses which
carry   visitors   into   Petra   Basin;   and   associated
infrastructures      (water,     sewerage,      power,     and
telecommunications).
(b)  Petra Basin:  construction of a -.ew comax.oe  restaurant,
visitor centre and antiquities department offices (and
removal of the existing Nazal Gueschouse from the Basin);
infrastructure including works to protect the monumentr
from heavy flooding; construction and improvements to
trails and to interpretive facilities (e.g. signposts,
issue of brochures for walking tours, etc); conservation
works and some restoration; and construction near the town
of Wadi Husa of houses for relocation of an estimated 96
Bedouin families occupying combs in the Petra Basin.
'c)  Jerash;   construction  of  a  new  restaurant  outside  the
archaeological area; guides, trails, imoroved interpretive
materials and equipmenc for the visitor centre; -a Sound and
Light  program;  upgrading and relocating  the  small  site
museum;   restrooms  and  visitor   facilities;   associated
landscaping and infrastructure; archaeological preservation
and  restoration  of  several  of  the  major  monuments;
construction   of  appropriate  offices   and   maintenance
buildings;  and  demolition  of  buildings  (including  the
"Turkish" building and the existing restaurant) and;
(d)  Administration,   Professional   Services,   and   Technical
Assistance and Training connected with the above components.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness
3.01     Proiect effectiveness was delayed seven months due to delays in
the appointment of the Project Unit staff and in the appointment of the
design consultants. The latter process in particular took more time than
expected due partly to MIA's unfamiliarity with IDA. Firms were invited
to prequalify only after credit negotiations were complete, when MTA was
convinced  that  IDA  would  indeed  support  the  project.   The  time
subsequently  taken  to  evaluate,  negotiate,  and  secure  government
clearances for the draft contract was also about 4 months longer than
anticipated at appraisal.



-5-
Project Content and Revisions
3.02     The implemented project corresponded closely to the appraised
project, with only a few significant exceptions;
(a)  a new hotel of 82 rooms was constructed at Petra Entrance,
in place of renovation of the existing 25 room hotel and
its expansion to' a total of 100 rooms as assumed at
appraisal.  The Government independently expanded the old
hotel to 35 rooms in 1976 and 1977 (bringing total rooms on
site to 117 by 1983).  This change occurred because the MTA
was uncertain about the Credit, it had a firm budget to
make the expansion in 1976, and the renovation contract was
awarded before the DCA was signed in August;
(b)  the surfaces of the Siq and the forecourts of El Deir and
the Treasury at Petra were not stabilized because no
satisfactory  and  economical  solution  could  be  found
(anachronistic materials were found to be unacceptable for
technical  and   aesthetic   reasons,  and   the   original
Niabatean/Roman type of stone paving was too expensive);
(c)  the maintenance facilities and the horse shelter at Petra
were not constructed in order to reallocate funds to the
main contract;
(d)  the   facilities   which   were   to  be   demolished   once
project-provided replacements had been constructed (the
Nazal Guesthouse at Petra, the old restaurant and the
Turkish house at Jerash) remain, and the DA is now
exploring new uses for them, since the current Director of
the DA does not share the USNPS and appraisal mission views
on aesthetics and on appropriate land uses for antiquities
sites; and
(e) less than planned technical assistance was engaged in the
museological, parks management, and archaeological fields
due to a variety of difficulties (paras. 3.13 and 3.14).
Implementation Schedules
3.03     The  project  was  completed  about  46  months  late.  1/  These
delays (more details on specific dates are provided in Annexes II and V)
resulted   from:    (a)  an   SAR  implementation   schedule  which  was
over-optimistic; (b) delays in start of construction due to inadequate
preparation of some components; and (c) a variety of construction
problems which resulted in delays beyond contract completion dates.
1/ Loan sign.ture was in 8/76, and actual completion was in 10/83,
compared  with  the  12/79  stated  in  the  DCA.   However,  the
implementation schedule of the SAR impLied ccmpletion in 12/80,
implying a "real" over-run of 34 months.



- 6 -
3.04     The most significant  delays  in  starting  construction  due  to
preparation inadequacies concerned the Sound and Light and the Bedouin
relocation components. The main consultants lacked experience of Sound
and Light shows; after an initial tender for equipment had been issued
and responded to, it became clear that it would be more efficient t- call
for renders for a package of equipment, script and recorded performance
from the handful of companies which had relevant experience. This was
then done, though the need for it could have been foreseen at appraisal.
3.05     The  failure  to  carry  out  thorough  consultations  with  the
concerned Bedouin families resulted in extensive delays and overruns on
the Bedouin relocation component. The first tenders for this componenc
had to be rejected when it was found that the Bedouin did not accept the
initial site. A more acceptable site was then identified which, being
more remote from the town of Wadi Musa, required heavy investments
in additional roads and social facilities (the latter are still not
constructed).  There were also delays in design of this component, some
resulting from IDA efforts to reduce costs of design proposals.  Delays
_n  the  component  also  resulted  in  increases  in  the  numbers  of
beneficiaries.   The definitive  administrative  census  and  consultation
with the Bedouin undertaken in October, 1983 to establish criteria for
allocating housing units determined that there were 111 eligible
families, that there were 128 wives in the 109 male-headed families, and
that two housing units would be allocated to families which had 2 or more
wives and 8 or more family members. This will require the construction
of an additional 20 units, at an estimated cost of JD 172,000.
3.06     The main causes of construction delays were:
(a) failure by the client, consultants, and contractors to
appreciate che difficulties of working in-Petra which was
remoce from labor and materials (acceptable aggregate had
to be trucked from Aqaba, there were great difficulties in
recruiting  adequate  staff  to  stay  there,  weak  site
representatives    and    poor    telecommunications    made
construction supervision difficult. All too frequently, it
proved necessary to demolish and reconstruct works which
were   found  to  be  of   unacceptable   standard   during
intermittent  field  missions  by  the  senior  consulting
engineer);
(b)  unexpected   technical   problems:    more  excavation   than
anticipated was needed for the Petra hotel; commencement of
the Jerash restaurant was delayed three months and then had
to be resited because the initial foundation excavation
uncovered ancient tombs (in an area which had been chosen
as antiquities-free);
(c) design features which went beyond local experience caused
time and cost over-runs; in the case of the Bedouin
relocation, craftsmen skilled in laying red brick (which
was chosen for aesthetic reasons) were difficult to obtain;
in the case of the Petra hotel and the two restaurants, the



-7-
designs required elaborate de.ails and fine tolerances
which  were -not consonant with  the  capacities  of  local
craftsmen and the local building industry (for example, it
is more efficient in Jordan to fit windows to the holes
left by masons, than to attempt to dimension window holes
accurately enough to install prefabricated building units.
In this project, however, imported prefabricated window
units were used);
(d) the hotel and restaurant designs made use of a large range
of imported items, for finishes particularly; it was
difficult even to obtain timely samples for approval by the
supervising engineer; the problems were compounded by the
contractor's tendency to place orders too late; and
(e)  the eruption of the Iraq-Iran war placed enormous pressures
on the capacity of Aqaba port and of road transport. This
was exacerbated for the project by the fact that the
(government-fixed) road haulage tariffs for short-haul
destinations such as Petra were less profitable for
truckers than for long-haul destinations such as Amman and
Baghdad.
3.07     By contrast with the works carried out by contractors, the force
account  works  proceeded  relatively  smoothly.   Early  difficulties  in
engaging adequate labor in Petra were. gradually overcome, although
retaining sufficiently qualified high-level supervision staff remained,
and remains, a problem (see also para 3.12).
Reporting
3.08     Quarterly  and  annual  reports  were  sent  on  an  intermittent
basis. These provided sound information on expenditures and expenditure
commitments. For information on project status, major reliance was placed
on IDA mission findings, and specific querLes.
Procurement
3.09     Apart from the delays and misunderstandings while the project
agency became accustomed to IDA procedures, there were no significant
procurement problems.
Costs
3.10     The project suffered severe cost over-runs.  The accounted-for
over-run is estimated at 55% of the appraisal estimate (Annex III
contains details of the costs).  The true over-run is somewhat higher:
completion of all components might occasion an additional JD 0.3 million
(7.5% of appraisal cost); more significantly, the measured costs exclude
contractors  losses.  The main sources of the over-runs were:
(a) underestimation of costs at the time of appraisal (see also
para. 2.04);



-8-
(b) delays in commencement of contracts and hence more years of
price inflation than assumed at appraisal;
Cc) high cost design standards in the case of the hotel and
restaurants (see also paras. 3.06 (e), 3.11 and 3.17).
Consultants' Performance
3.11     The  main  consultants  were  responsible  for  the  design  and
supervision of all major non-archaeological components with the exception
of the Bedouin housing which was designed and supervised by the Jordan
Housing Corporation (JUC). They performed throughout the project in a
fully professional fashion.  They were responsible for the design  of
very attractive and functional facilities at Petra and Jerash which
should enhance Jordan's image for tourism. Nevertheless, it is possible
that costs would have been lowered if the designs more fully reflected
the availability of local materials and skills, and if the consultants
had been more flexible during implementation (in making modifications to
original designs) as they became more acquainted with local realities.
3.12     The experience with  the experts  appointed  to supervise  the
archaeological field works was mixed.  In Jerash, the project had the
services of an energetic architect/engineer with fifty years of
experience in conservacion and restoration of similar sites. He not only
organized and executed more physical works than planned, but also
prepared several papers on ancient building techniques and the remarkable
persistence of religious cultural norms from pre-Christian through
Islamic times based upon study of the monuments on which he was working.
The first architect-restorer in Petra resigned after one year for health
reasons; his successor was unsatisfactory; thereafter supervision and
management of the works was provided on a part-time basis by other
experts -from Jordan and abroad. IC unfortunately proved impossible to
find a Jordanian with the necessary background and skills who was willing
to remain in Petra and to take responsibility for executing the works
there.
3.13     Given  the  early  and  continuing  interest  of  Unesco  in  the
project, and IDA's lack of antiquities expertise, it was decided that
Unesco should nominate restoration experts who would review plans and
progress of the archaeological works. The costs of these experts were
defrayed largely by Unesco, although the project paid some of their local
subsistence  expenses.   This  component  encountered  serious  problems;
expert missions tended to be for extremely brief periods with minimal
notice; field visits were only partly coordinated with local officials;
some reports were only received long after mission departure (3 months in
one case, 9 months in another); the experts' recommendations were
generally critical of what was being done, and constructive suggestions
were often uneconomic (e.g. use of epoxy resins for conservation of stone
work -at Petra) or excessively general (i.e. the landscaping proposals for
Jerash);   the  experts   evidently  felt   their   prime  audience   was
non-Jordar: an and on one occasion even cabled from the field an alarm to
the Secretary General of Unesco and the President of the Association
without  first discussing  their concerns  with  the  relevant Jordanian



-9-
officials.   They often advised doing less work rather than more (some
planned works were not carried out on their advice, however, e.g.
conservation  and  restoration  of  the  Roman  Bridge  at  Jerash).   One
continuing   controversy   related  to  the  use  of  Portland   cement  at
Jerash;the consultants maintained this was deleterious (as it undoubtedly
is in northern Europe with its high rainfall and hydroscopic stone); the
local experts maintained its use was acceptable with Jordan's low
rainfall  and  less  permeable  stone.   Satisfactory  resolution  of  such
issues requires the application of extensive technical knowledge, of
relevant local and foreign experience, and a large measure of mutual
understanding and respect by the parties concerned.  In retrospect, the
Government has suggested that it would have been better to have appointed
a single expert with a more local background who would have spent much
more time in the country, a view with which the mission concurs.
3.14     The failure of the consultancy by restoration experts reduced
expectations about whether positive results could be expected from the
appointment of the experts in museology and parks administration, issues
which also involve a delicate mix of expertise and judgement.
Con tractor Performance
3.15     Notwithstanding  the  difficulties  and  weaknesses  outlined  in
para. 3.06 above, it should be noted that the main contractor was
concerned to produce outstanding facilities, even although this may have
involved   it   in   substantial   losses   (the   contractor's   financial
reorganization was underway as of late 1983). The supplier of Sound and
Light Equipment replaced all-the speakers without additional charges when
it was found that the original equipment did not stand up to the rigours
of the first Jerash winter.
IDA Performance
3.16        With  benefit  of  hindsight,  the  project  design  would  have
benefitted from closer attention by Association staff to defining the
nature  of  the  hotel  and  restaurant  required  for  the  unique  Petra
situation, to preparing the design brief, and to reviewing designs in the
light  of  viability  considerations.   The  consultant  received  minimal
briefing on the type of hotel facility required.  Extensive discussions
among the Association, client, and consultant were necessary in the fall
of 1977 to reduce the consultants' initial proposals on building areas to
economic levels; unfortunately, there was never a similar review of the
appropriateness of structural  features and finishes.   This would have
been even more difficult to accomplish, not least because the judgements
required would have been more subjective. A re-analysis of financial and
economic viability at the design stage, or at the tender stage, might
also have demonstrated that costs were excessive and have stimulated
redesign effort.   Such an analysis was not carried out, however,  and
discussions of over-runs were in terms of available finances and
reallocations rather than project viability. Following IDA's decision to
discontinue tourism lending, less emphasis was given to institutional
questions, and the burden of supervision shifted more exclusively to
expediting physical implementation.

IV. PROJECT PERFORMANCE
Antiquities Sites
4.01     Jordan  tourism  is currently suffering  from  the  international
recession and the security situation in the Middle East, although growth
from 1975 to 1982 of Western visitors, who form the main target group for
this project, was satisfactory at around 14% p.a (Annex I).  No reliable
estimates are available of visitors to Petra and Jerash, either Jordanian
or non-Jordanian. There were perhaps 100,000 visitors to Petra in 1982;
in the case of Jerash, about 165,000 people purchased tickets to the
Jerash Festival in August, 1983 and there were perhaps 300,000 visitors
during the year. These compare with the following SAR estimates:
1981    1982    1983
Petra ('000 visitors)                               111     132      156
Jerash ('000 visitors)                              204     231      262
4.02     Whatever  the exact number of visitors,  the antiquities sites
have certainly become more attractive as a result of the restoration
works undertaken by the project, and the promotional activities by the
management of the Petra hotel, particularly.  Much still remains to be
done to improve the sites from the tourism point of view, including, most
importantly, marking trails, installing appropriate signs, issuing guides
and accurate maps, and installing models and interpretive materials in
the  visitor  reception  centres.   Institutional  arrangements  are  also
required for the efficient management of the sites, including promotion,
security, management of visitors and concessionaires, revenue collection,
plant maintenance, refuse collection, systematic monitoring- of the
physical status of the antiquities (including measuring wind erosion
damage) and programming and executing conservation and restoration
works. While MTA recognises this need, the role of a new department to
perform these functions, and the changes in functions of the existing
departments,  has not yet been  thoroughly addressed.   Action has been
deferred   pending   implementation  of  entry   fees,   at  which   point
expenditures on site management may become more acceptable in a time of
budgetary stringency.
4.03     A draft decree which would introduce fees to enter the sites (at
the same nominal rates as discussed at appraisal, which are equivalent to
about one half the real rates assumed at appraisal), has been under
discussion in the cabinet for some months. The discussions have revolved
around the conflicts between the need for revenues versus concerns that
charging fees to enter cultural monuments would exclude some citizens and
make foreigners feel unwelcome. This is a familiar public policy dilemma
in which economic and financial considerations do not always outweigh
cultural and political factors.



- 1.1 -
4.04     Although the Sound and Light show has been physically capable of
operation since May 1982, and has been exhibited on special occasions, it
has not yet started regular operations pending the engagement of
appropriate staff and authority to charge the entry fee (the draft decree
mentioned in para. 4.03 includes an entry fee to the Sound and Light at
two thirds the nominal rate and one third of the real rate assumed at
appraisal). The completion mission found that several lights and some
circuits were not working; regular maintenance will be important during
the upcoming winter months to avoid system deterioration.
Hotel and Restaurants
4.05     The Petra hotel and Basin restaurant  commenced operation  in
August 1983, under the management of Forum Hotels (FH), which was
selected in accordance with procedures agreed with the Association.  FH
are providing an outstanding standard of service and marketing effort,
and the reputation of the Petra facilities should become a significant
factor in upgrading Jordan's image as a tourist destination. The hotel
is, however,  incurring heavy losses.  Although  these will decrease as
occupancy rates build up, no operating profit is foreseeable unless there
is very substantial improvement in prices or operating costs or both.
The hotel is charging prices about 30% less in real terms than estimated
at appraisal; operating costs are around IO less (Annex VI, Table.3).
The hotel management believes it could charge higher prices with no
adverse marketing effects, but is constrained by the hotel's four-star
classification and the Government-controlled prices which were last
changed in 1979.  (Group tourists travelling as couples are changed US$20
per person per night half board; individual singles are charged US$35
half board.  In the view of IDA, significantly higher prices, say 50%
higher, could be charged with minimal reduction in clientele.) The
Minister of Tourism assured the project completion mission that hotel
prices would be reviewed before the end of the year. The Government is
also interested in exploring means to reduce hotel operating costs; while
this  should  be  investigated,  the  mission  was  not  sanguine  that
significant economies could be obtained without prejudicing the standard
of service, effectiveness of marketing, and upkeep of facilities.
4.06     The  Jerash  restaurant  is  under   the  management   of   the
Government-owned Hotels and Restaurants Corporation (HRC) which managed
the old Jerash resthouse. The HRC has introduced new staff, and so far
has been making operating profits (before interest, depreciation, or
replacements) of about JD 2,OOU per month, compared with annual losses of
JD 5,000 on the old resthouse. The Minister of Tourism and Antiquities
stated to the completion mission that he felt management of this facility
should be returned to FH as previously agreed. (HRC manages the facility
at present since FH were unwilling to open the restaurant during the
Jerash Festival in advance of completion of all physical works and
equipment installation.) All government-owned hotels and restaurants are
expected to be purchased by the Social Security Corporation (SSC) in
1984.  Since financial profitability is an important SSC objective (the
HRC placed more emphasis on providing a service), this may augur well for
profitability of the project facilities.

Bedouin Resettlement
4.07     Cost recovery of the new housing units would be inappropriate as
the Bedouins are being resettled. Families will gain tenure over housing
units  and will be responsible  for their maintenance.   They will  pay
normal  charges  for water  and  electricity.   Other  facilities  will  be
managed by appropriate ministries/departments when they are built
(school, health, centre, social centre, mosque).
Training
4.08     Four  officials  of  MTA  were  trained  in  various  aspects  of
monument conservation and restoration (26 man-months, compared with an
SAR estimate of 54 man-months). Three of these officials are working in
relevant units of MTA; the fourth intends to returh to MTA after
completing his PhD.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01     Since several project components have just started operations,
and others have yet to begin, and because of a lack of basic data, the
re-evaluation had to be based on estimates more than on actual
performance. It would be better if this re-evaluation were to be carried
out again at a later date, when the operations have started on a proper
financial basis, and when better data is available (PCR para 7.02). The
detailed assumptions used in the evaluation presented in this report are
set out in Annex VI.  The principal ones are:   the recorded investment
costs equal economic costs (i.e. contractors' losses are excluded); the
draft decree regarding entry fees will come into effect from January 1,
1984 and the Sound and Light show will commence in 1984; and incremental
visitors attracted to the site due to the project will be identical to
the SAR estimates.  These assumptions yield a base ERR of -0.6% which
compares with the SAR estimate of 20.1%. The main factors accounting for
the difference are:
(a) a more extended construction period of negative net benefit
flows (7 years versus 3 years in the SAR);
(b)  cost over-runs (19% over appraisal estimates in real terms);
(c) a serious shortfall in hotel prices (31M), entry fees (50Z)
and Sound and Light charges (66%) without compensating
declines in operating costs; and
(d) exclusion of incremental benefits from the renovation and
expansion of the old entrance hotel (which was incurring
losses at the time of appraisal, but has averaged operating
profits of  JD 40,000  in  the last  five years  sicce  its
renovation was complete on the basis of an investment cost
of  around  JD  250,000  carried  out  independently  of  the
project).



- 13 -
If hotel prices were 50% higher, and if entry fees were set at the (real)
levels estimated in the SAR, the ERR would be 8.4%.
5.02     With the exception of investment costs,  the actual values lie
outside the ranges in the SAR sensitivity tests.  The SAR sensitivity
analysis did not analyze  the effects on  the ERR of  combinations  of
adverse factors.
5.03     It should, however, be noted that the above analysis does not
consider "indirect" or off-site benefits, nor does it consider the full
consumer surplus which would accrue to visitors from the Sound and Light
facilities. Including benefits generated by transport of tourists to and
f:rom the sites (which were not counted during the appraisal), and
assuming (a) all hotel prices were raised by 50Z from January 1, 1984,
(b) entry fees to the sites and sound and light were set at the appraisal
levels (in real terms), (c) a higher estimate of benefits on the Jerash
restaurant, (d) 20% more incremental visitors than assumed at appraisal,
and (e) inclusion of consumer surplus from the Sound and Light show, the
ERR would rise to 12.8%.
5.04     As regards other indirect benefits,  although the construction
and operation of the project created employment opportunities in Petra,
many jobs had to be filled by immigrants from other parts of Jordan and
from abroad. Tourism-related employment in Petra (excluding the 200-300
persons connected with the horses which carry tourists to the Basin),
will have risen from around 35 in 1975 to 150 once the site management
staff is in place. The Petra hotel is making an effort to train people
from Wadi Musa and the Bedouin settlement in service tasks, with
considerable success.  In the case of Jerash, employment may rise from
about iO to about 40 persons once the organization for site management is
installed. In addition, there are jobs in both locations connected with
excavations and restoration works.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01     The basic  project  concept  was  sound.   The  project  may  not
achieve the full benefits expected of it, however, due to:
(a)  unrealistically low cost estimates,
(b)  the failure to reassess  the economic viability of  the main
components when more realistic cost estimates became available
during the design and tendering process, which might have
stimulated redesign efforts to lower costs, and
(c) lower fees for project outputs than expected at the time of
appraisal.

6.02     This project would have encountered fewer problem.  had it been
carried out in the context of an agreed tourism policy framework and had
it been more  thoroughly prepared.   Substantially more  preparation was
probably not a viable option because of MTA's unwillingness to engage
design consultants before receiving a commitment from IDA (paras 2.04 and
3.01).   The  decision  to  proceed  obviously  carried  some  risk.   In
retrospect, the SAR sensitivity analyses did not test a wide enough range
of outcomes, and specifically failed to examine adequate combinations of
adverse outcomes.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Although the opportunity to earn the initially foreseen rate of
return on this project has been lost, the Government can still elevate
its financial returns and enhance its economic  justification.   In the
Association's letter of November 15, 1983, the Government has been urged
to take the following three actions as soon as possible:
(a)  introduce entry fees to the sites and the Sound and Light show
(and then raise them over time to at least the levels proposed
by the SAR);
(b)  allow the project hotel and restaurants to charge prices which
will enable them to maximise the return on investments in those
facilities; and
(c)  create a department with  adequate  responsibility,  authority,
staff and budget to m=z3age the sites.
7.02     In view of the potential returns from the above actions and in
order to encourage follow up action by the Jordanian authorities, the
Association  proposes   to  re-evaluate   the  economic,   financial   and
institutional aspects of this project in about two years, by which time
the international tourism market may have picked up and the tourism
policy framework in Jordan may have improved.

ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS
1.     All benefits and costs were deflated to end 1975 using the GDP deflator.
2.     Investment Costs were  taken  from Annex  III.   Consultant  fees  and
administrative costs were distributed to the components identified in Table
6. Replacements were estimated from the third full year of operations at 2%
of investment cost, except in the case of the Sound and Light where annual
replacements were estimated at 6% due to the greater importance of equipment
in that component than others.
3.     No adjustments were  made  to  reflect  differences  between  financial
receipts and expenditures and economic benefits and costs.  The main bias
introduced by this procedure is exclusion of contractors' losses, which would
amount to several times the indirect tax content in civil works (of
approximately 5% of project cost).
4.     Tables 1 to 5 set out the estimates of receipts and operating costs and
compare them with those of the SAR. The base PCR estimates of incremental
visitors to Petra and Jerash are equal to those in the SAR. This assumption
may be optimistic.
5.     Table 6 sets out the investment costs, Table 7 the operating benefits
flows, and Table 8 shows the net benefit flows. NPVs (at discount rates of 0%
and 10%) and - IRRs are shown in Table 9 for the base case and various
sensitivity tests showing the effects of (i) more optimistic assumptions about
prices, (ii) the effects of incorporating some external benefits which were
not considered in the appraisal, (iii) alternative visitor forecasts, and
(iv) alternative estimates of benefits of the Jerash restaurant. The estimate
in the text that the ERR would rise by 0.4% if consumer surpluses by Jordanian
users of the Sound and Light are taken into account is based on the assumption
that one-half of Sound and Light receipts are from Jordanians, and that
consumers surplus equals the revenues from residents.

'Your Zxcelleucy:
SUBJECT: Jordan Tourism Project
I am writing to express my cbaoks For the assistance accorded myself and
.Ir. Mitchell in connection with this project by you and by members of your
staff. The mission is now preparing the Project Completioo Report, vwich will
provide our best assessment of tbe success of the project and lessoos to be
lesrned from it. We expect the report to be readv for review by the Jordaniao
authorities in early 1984.  Ia the meantime, we look forward to- receivion
ir. Alami in Washington in November to assist with drafting the report.
I would also like to take this opportunity to review with vou some of the
major missio -findincs and to confirm the points discussed duriac your meeting
vith Hr. -iitchell on October 26.
Mana%ement of the Sites
We share your concern that appropriate institutional and budtetarv
provision be made for the future operation and manazeueat of Petra and Jerash
fires.  In addition to cleaoinY and unkeep of these areas, collectine charges
from visitors, and contiouing restoration wor'ks, it is important that the
presentJtion of the sites to visitors (-including production of maps,
appropriate signposts, trails etc.) be improved. There also still needs to be
attencion given to cne stabilization of the surface of the Siq, and of the
forecourts or the Treasury and of '1 Deir Temple at Petra. We understand that
you are exploring means for accomplisbing chere objectives, poseiblv chrouch
extennion of the life of the Project Unit beyond the end of 19a3. We hove
that the Government edopts a tinely solution to this important problem.
Securing Economic Returns from the Project Investment
The project has, for a variety of reasons, cost more thoa anticipated at
appraisal in 1975, and operating iocome is tow expected to be substantially
under appraisal estimates.  The Petra and Jerash facilities are of a very high
standard, and qh',uld be iostrumental in dravin2- more tourists to Jordan. I am
sure tnat vou share our concern that the substantial investments made by the
Govervment in this project secure an ecooonic returot as bi2b as possible, even
if this is less than the returns anticinated at apprsisal. In our view the

zoiloving measures would hielp increase the economic return as well as reduce
tne neec for Government suosidies to tourism:
(a) incroductior. of entry fees at Petra and Jerash;
(b) raising subscantially tne prices charged in che Perra hotel and Jerash
lestaurant. We were glaa to learn that the Ministry intends to review
.these prices before the end of tne year, and look forward to receiving
information on the outcome of that review;
(c) razionalizing the management arrangements for the old resthouse at
Petra and placing the Jerash rescaurant under the management of the
company previousiy selectea oy che government and agreed by the Bank;
anu
(a) making additional investments in the Petra facilities (upgrading of
the existing resthouse, provision of indoors lounge/bar area at the
new hotel), to secure mximum returns on that investment.
Comuletion of Resettlement of Bedouin at Petra
Substantial additional investments will be required to complete the
resettiement of the Bedouin now occupying caves in the Petra Basin, inclucing
investments in social facilities (school, mosque, health center and community
center), and also in housing to accommodate a larger number of families than
initially planned for.  We hope that appropriate arrangements can be rade for
these matters in the coming year.
it may be appropriate to review once more the project's impact after there
has oeen an opportunity to deaL with the above listed issues. Vc believe that
a two year interval should-be appropriate, in order to benefit from more
operating experience with the project facilities and possibly an increase in
tourism. We hope to hear your further views on this at the time that the
completion report is forwarded to you.
In tae meantime, we would be gratetul to be kept informed of cle actions
taken in connection with the above issues, especially as re-ards entry fees,
hotel pricing management of the Jerash Restaurant and provision for
maintenance and operation of the sites.
