                  the Borrower shall have established to the
                  satisfaction of the Bank that any proposed
                  investment occasioning such change is financially

contractor or supplier has been notified that he will be awarded a
contract, the Borrower and CYR shall take all measures necessary to
facilitate such registration.
3.    Each contract for the supply of goods shall include provisions
whereby the Borrower shall undertake to take all measures necessary

perform its obligations under said contract.
Part B:     Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
      In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures

conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank
prior to the making of the first payment out of the Special Account
in respect of such contract.
      (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the
preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4

statements of expenditure. Such contracts shall be retained in
accordance with Section 5.01 (c) (ii) of this Agreement.

                            SCHEDULE 5
                          Special Account
1.    For the purposes of this Schedule:
      (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1),
(2), (3) and (4) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1
Page  16
to this Agreement;
      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
      (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equiva-
lent to $2,600,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
Schedule.
2.    Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of the
Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account may be made as follows:
      (a)   On the basis of a request or requests by the Borrower
for a deposit or deposits which add up to the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special
Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
replenishment of the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank
shall specify. On the basis of such requests, the Bank shall with-
draw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such
amounts as shall be required to replenish the Special Account with
amounts not exceeding the amount of payments made out of the Special
Account for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective
eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as
shall have been justified by the evidence supporting the request for
such deposit furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account for which the Borrower requests replenishment pursuant to
paragraph 3 (b) of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the
Bank, prior to or at the time of such request, such documents and
other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request, showing that
such payment was made for eligible expenditures.
5.    (a)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, no further deposit into the Special Account shall be made
by the Bank when either of the following situations first arises:
            (i)   the Bank shall have determined that all further
                  withdrawals should be made by the Borrower
                  directly from the Loan Account in accordance with
                  the provisions of Article V of the General
                  Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of
                  this Agreement; or
            (ii)  the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
                  allocated to the eligible Categories minus the
                  amount of any outstanding special commitment
                  entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
                  of the General Conditions with respect to the
                  Project, shall be equal to the equivalent of
                  twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      (b)   Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by
notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that
all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of
Page  17
the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account (i) was made for any expenditure
or in any amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule, or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank, deposit into the Special Account
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount
equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. No further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has made such
deposit or refund.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account.

staffing targets set forth in the Annex to this Schedule; and (ii)
a program for the closure of freight stations, satisfactory to the

2.    Locomotive Overhaul
      The Borrower shall carry out a program, satisfactory to the
Bank, to improve the system of maintenance and overhaul of the
Borrower's locomotives, designed to centralize such maintenance and
overhaul activities in selected depots and workshops so as to
minimize the need for maintenance and overhaul equipment, reduce the
inventories of spare parts required and improve the efficient
procurement of spare parts.
3.    Spare Parts Monitoring
      The Borrower shall, not later than November 30, 1991,
introduce a monitoring system, satisfactory to the Bank, designed to

of spare parts for traction and rolling stock in adequate
quantities.
