STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Loan and Pro-iect Summary
Borrowers:     The Railway Transport Organizations (RTOs) Belgrade,
Ljubljana, Novi Sad and Zagreb.
Guarantor:     Socialist Federal Re?ublic of Yugoslavia.
Amount:        A total of US$138 million equivalent as follows: BelVrade -
US$59.0 million, Ljubljana - US$31.9 million, Novi Sad -
US$14.6 million, and Zagreb - US$32.5 million.
Terms:         Fifteen years maturity including a five-year grace period at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Proiect Objectives:
The pro'posed project has as its principal objectives:
(a) supporting of a new momentum for reform within the
railways;
(b) reducing operating costs and increasing operating
efficiency by phasing out low volume freight stations,
and reducing the number of staff, and introducing or
enlarging an information system for train, wagon and
locomotive control;
(c) assisting the Yugoslav railways to compete wor-
effectively with other transport modes, particularly for
international traffic where they are losing markcet
share, by improving the condition of the main trunk link;
(d) increasing locomotive availability through provision of
adequate supply of spare parts; and
(e) improving the Yugoslav railways' financial position in
an environment of high inflation through timely tariff
increases, reduced operating costs and better investment
planning.
Project Description:
The project would comp ise the investment program (1989-91)
of four RTOs which operate about 85% of the main trunk

line. The investment nrogram include track renewal,
reconstruction of line sections, improvement of stations and
junctions, change of the electric system on a line section,
modernization of signalling and telecommunication equipment,
installation of an information system, provision of
traction and rolling stock, track maintenance equipment,
locomotive spare parts, and technical assistance. The
investsent plans are sound; in particular, each major
investment item has an economic return greater than 122, is
covered by a satisfactory financing plan, and is within the
implementation capability of the concerned RTO. The total
cost of the project with contingencies is estimated at
US$907 million with a foreign exchange component of US$434
million (48b). The Bank loans would cover the direct and
indirect foreign exchange components of selected high
priority investments - mainly materials and equipment, and
the cost of technical assistance and training. The loans
would be made to the four RTOs as follows: Belgrade -
US$59.0 million, Ljubljana - US$31.9 million, Novi Sad -
US$14.6 million, and Zagreb - US$32.5 million.
Benefits and Risks:
The ain project benefits derive from permitting Yugoslav
railways to increase their operational efficiency,
particularly on the main trunk line where capacity
constraints are developing. The track overhaul of sections
of the main trunk and other key lines will increase
operating speeds and reduce operating costs. The
construction of the Western Bypass and the modernization of
signalling in the main station in Zagreb will overcome a
serious capacity constraint in the Zagreb Junction. The
construction of the second phase of the Belgrade Junction
will similarly rationalize the flow of freight and passenger
trains at that junction, in addition to releasing a valuable
parcel of land for other urban uses. The purchase of spare
parts for locomotives will help increase locomotive
availability, reducing the need for future locomotive
pure.hases. The procurement of traction and modern rolling
stock will help make the railways more competitive, and
reduce the uneconomic diversion of bulk and other traffics
to road transport. In addition, the project is expected to
result in reductions in operating costs and institutional
improvements. Most of the project involves the renewal of
existing assets which have little environmental impact. The
construction of Belgrade Junction will release 11 hectares
of riverfront land for the construction of apartment
buildings, parks, and other urban uses which are
satisfactory. The conctruction of the Western Bypass in
Zagreb will reduce congestion and noise in the city center;



- iii-
While Government and railways management are committed
to reforming Yugoslav railways, implementation may prove
difficult. In particular, there are three project risks
which are significant. First, the Government/Committees
of Interest might delay railway tariff increases or fail
to provide counterpart funds or compensation in a period
of rapid inflation which would result in operating
losses and a shortage of local funds for investments.
Second, traffic demand might stagnate or decrease rather
than slowly increase as forecast if the Yugoslav economy
deteriorates due to lack of appropriate adjustment
policies. Third, operating costs may remain high if
railways do not implement their action plans
satisfactorily, in particular if they do not reduce
their staff by about 2% p.a. In spite of significant
risks, we feel it is reasonable to propose these loans
because of the Government's commitment to economic
reform as demonstrated by recent constitutional and
ordinary law changes, and Yugoslav railways preparation
of and commitment to a "Business Plan" which is a de
facto reform program for railways.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Economy
1.01     During the 1960s and 19708 Yugoslavia's economy grew rapidly, with
the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaging about 62 p.a. This
performance, however, was supported by large investments where insufficient
attention was paid to quality or cost. Moreover, the economy's ability to
adjust to external shocks was reduced by an excessively accommodating credit
policy and by rigidities and distortions, including low mobility of capital
and labour, negative real interest rates, an increasingly overvalued
exchange rate and highly protected domestic industries. In 4addition, the
growth of wages exceeded the growth of labour productivity i1i the late
1970s. Yugoslavia initially absorbed the second oil shock through
additional foreign borrowings. However, economic growth stagnated during
the 1980s, unemployment increased to double digits, inflation accelerated to
275% in 1988, and a debt crisis developed.
1.02     The Government is seeking to reduce and control inflation, regain
the high level of economic gro4th that it had achieved in the 1970s and
carve a place for itself on the economic map of Western Europe, with a view
to 1992 and beyond. In order to accomplish these objectives, the current
leadership believes that it is necespary to liberalize the economy and give
it a definite market-based orientation. The Government has already
implemented difficult stabilization measures as the first step under a
program of structural adjustment. The reform program will be extended under
constitutional changes on enterprise reform, foreign investments and social
planning which were approved in January 1989. The program is supported by
an IMF Standby Agreement which was approved in June 1988, and by a proposed
Second Structural Adjustment Loan (SALII) which is in an advanced state of
preparation. The proposed Seventh Railway Project would complement
structural adjustment at the macroeconomic level by supporting a railway
reform progr.um directed at significantly reducing operating costs and
attracting and retaining traffics for which railways have a comparative
advantage.
B. Transport System and Demand
1.03     Geography has been a major factor in shaping Yugoslavia's transport
system. The country is located at a strategic crossroad between
eastern and western Europe, bounded by seven other countries and the
Adriatic Sea. As a result, Yugoslavia's transport system provides access to
the sea for a number of central European countries, as well as connections
for international traffic between Western Europe, Greece and the Middle
East. The main routes of communication have followed the easy paths within
Yugoslavia, and have avoided the mountain barriers along the coast and in
the South. The main trunk railway route, as well as the Trans-Yugoslav
Highway, run northwest to southeast in the Sava and Danube valleys where



- 2 -
most of the centers of population and economic activity are located. A
second northeast-southwest corridor, which is important for international
traffic, links Austria and Hungary with Yugoslavia's ports and Italy, and is
served primarily by the railways. Yugoslavia's 600 km coastline is
separated from the interior by mountain ranges of considerable height. As a
consequence, the most important coastal cities and ports are sited in the
vicinities of passes through which rail lines and roads have been built at
considerable cost. Some of these rail links are operating at or near
capacity, and will be improved under the proposed project.
1.04     Yugoslavia's transport system is extensive and diversified,
comprising a railway, roads, river tranaport, ports and airports.  The
railway system is described in Chapter 2. The road network comprises about
130,000 km of roads, of which about 48,000 km are primary and regional
roads. Yugoslavia has concentrated un extending the paved road network in
recent years, increasing its length from 12,950 km in 1965 to about 67,000
km in 1989. In recent years, both new construction and rehabilitation have
suffered from budgetary constraints in common with all sectors. Road
maintenance, particularly pavement strengthening and simple betterment
works, is becoming a more important issue as the road network ages, and will
be addressed under ongoing and proposed Highway Sector Projects.
1.05     The road vehicle fleet has grown rapidly over the last twenty years
to about 3.3 million vehicles in 1987, excluding motorcycles .nd
agricultural tractors. The fleet includes about 260,000 trucks and 29,000
buses. About 40% of the trucking fleet are own-account vehicles, which are
mainly operated by large enterprises. An additional 19% belong to some 300
social sector transport enterprises, and 392 are small trucks belonging to
individual owner operators. Yugoslavia also has a small vehicle production
and assembly industry.
1.06     Yugoslavia has a fairly well developed network of about 2,200 bm of
inland waterways, which includes the river Danube between the Bulgarian and
Hungarian frontiers, the river Sava between Belgrade and Sisak, plus a
network of supporting canals.  River traffoi is seasonal due to low water
conditions and intermittent closures caused by ice. A fleet of about 300
tugs and 600 barges carry goods by inland waterway, but require replacement
or modernization to carry increased traffic.
1.07     Yugoslavia's most important ports are Rijeka and Koper in the
north, and Ploce in the center of the coastline. The future growth of Rijeka
is constrained by the surrounding city, and possibly by insufficient
capacity on the railway lines and roads linking the port. Some improvements
to these rail lines will be carried out under the project. Yugoslav
seaports handled 33.0 million tons of cargo in 1987, including 25.5 million
tons of export/import traffic. Ports handle about half of Yugoslavia's
total export/import traffic. Only about one percent of Yugoslavia's inland
traffic is containerized at present. It is likely that an increasing
proportion of import/export traffic will travel by block train or road
rather than through the ports as containerization increases, either to and
from destinations in western Europe or through northwestern European ports
for traffic to and from North America.

1.08     Inland transport totalled about 239.2 billion traffic units (ton
kilometers plus passenger kilometers) in 1987, as summarized
below and detailed in Table 1:

Total passenger traffic grew 11.11 p.a. from 1963 to 1980 due to rapid
economic growth and the expansion of the road network, and then slowed to
2.6% p.a. from 1980 to 1987 due primarily to a slowdown in economic activity.
Freight traffic similarly grew 6.9% p.a. from 1963 to 1980, slowing to 0.42
p.a. from 1980 to 1987. Road transport has replaced railways as the dominant
carrier in recent years. Rail transport accounted for 33% of freight and 7%
of passenger traffic in 1987, compared to 641 and 412 respectively in 1965.
River transport accounted for nine percent of freight traffic in 1978,
declining to about six percent in 1986 due to increasing road competition.
1.09     There are three types of trucking in Yugoslavia:  social sector
(self-managed) enterprises, own-account trucking, and private sector
operators. The social sector specializes in long distance and international
traffic, carrya,g about one-half of total freight traffic. Own-account and
private operators, until recently, handled mostly local transport, each
carrying about one-quarter of total freight traffic. Social sector trucks
are reported to average 46,000 vkm p.a. with 301 empty running, which is low
by international standards. Own-account and private trucks are reported to
average an even lower 29,000 vkm p.a. with 33% empty running, which is partly
explained by their specializing in local deliveries in small trucks.
Trucking operations are partly regulated, but the regulations are being
liberalized in stages. There are no route licensing or entry regulations,
and vehicle registration fees are not restrictive. Indicative tariffs are
now agreed among operators through the Chamber of Economy (COE), with
contract rate discounts of up to 202, and are usually followed. Until 1986,
the private sector was generally restricted by Republic or Province law to
one small truck per operator. Private operators may now form cooperatives



- 4 -
and hire additional drivers in some Republics or Provinces. In Slovenia, for
example, an estimated 85% of private operators now belong to cooperatives.
They are buying larger trucks, hauling larger loads over longer distances,
increasing load factors, and beginning to compete more seriously with social
sector firms. A recently passed constitutional change (Law on Enterprises)
is expected to further liberalize both private and social sector trucking,
including permitting private sector and own-account firms to carry
international traffic, and to allow owner-operators to hire additional
drivers. The trucking industry is an ideal candidate for eventual
privatization due to the lack of economies of scale in its cost structure.
Road transport issues are being further investigated through the preparation
of a Study on Improving the Efficiency of Transport Markets (para. 1.22).
C. Transport Organization and Policy
1.10     Yugoslavia's transport sector is significantly influenced by the
country's culture and form of social organization. Yugoslavia is a
federation characterized by ethnic, cultural and economic diversity. Each
of the eight Republics and Autonomous Provinces has its own capital city and
regional economy, which coupled with a policy of economic decentralization
tends to increase transport demand.   The Yugoslav economy, including the
transport sector, is organized as a self-management syst%;m. Under this
system, economic decision-making is achieved through a consensus of
managers, workers, and the social-political community, primarily through
intra- and inter-firm agreements on long-range cooperation (self-management
agreements, SMAs). These are enforced through a complex system of laws and
social checks and balances. An additional factor is that calital and labor
markets are not yet well developed in Yugoslavia. In the past, this has
resulted in a "soft budget constraint", where firms did not have sufficient
incentive to reduce costs, tended to maximize gross revenue per worker
rather than profits, and did not invest efficiently.   Partly as a result,
transport costs are high in Yugoslavia, with the country generating about
1.4 tkm/US$ of GNP, which is about three times the level of Western Europe,
although it is only about two-thirds the leve. of Hungary or Poland. High
transport costs appear to be due to the significant proportion of heavy
industry in Yugoslavia, the dispersion of economic activity on social
grounds, transit traffic, and the need to improve the efficiency of
transport enterprises.
1.11     As embodied in the 1986-90 Medium Term Development Plan (the Plan),
the Government's objectives for improving the transport sector include: (a)
promoting the more rapid development of rail, maritime, and river
transport;(b) competing more effectively in the international transport
system; (c) increasing foreign exchange earnings from transit traffic; (d)
adopting modern technology; and (e) optimizing the use of "social" resources
and energy. The Plan anticipates that these steps will increase the
efficiency of the transport system, reduce shipping costs, increase the
quality of transport service, promote the development of the tourist
industry, increase the competitiveness of Yugoslav goods in international
trade, increase transport safety, and provide transport capacity for
emergencies. The Bank generally supports these objectives, with the further
understanding that each transport mode should specialize in carrying the
traffic for which it is the least cost carrier, priority should be given to
maintaining existing infrastructure, and expenditure levels should reflect



- 5 -
Yugoslavia's present financial constraints. The attainment of these
objectives will largely depend on the government's ability and resolve to
undertake reforms to eliminate the inefficiencies in the productive and
transport sectors (paras. 1.02 and 1.10).
1.12     The overall need in transport, in common with other sectors, is to
gradually increase its market orientation and increase competition in order
to reduce costs. The main issues affecting transport can be grouped under
the headings: (a) improving operational and organizational efficiency; (b)
improving the utilization and selection of investments; (c) pricing
transport services under conditions of inflation; and (d) improving
integration with the European transport system.
1.13     Efficiency Issues - Tranisport costs could be reduced significantly
if transport operations could be made more efficient. There are two aspects
to the issue: first, the need to improve the operational efficiency of
transport enterprises, and the need to better coordinate transport
operations among the Republics and Provinces. At the enterprise level, the
principal need is to increase financial discipline through positive interest
rates, cost reduction, a cost based pricing policy, accounting improvements,
and the identification and closure of loss making operations. The issue
particularly affects revenue earning transport enterprises; road transport
is less affected because most automobiles are privately owned, and because
trucking is inherently more competitive and lacks economies (or
diseconomies) of scale. There are preliminary indications that transport
operators are beginning to respond to the revalued exchange rate, increased
interest rates and other stabilization measures which have recently been
implemented (para. 1.02). A major thrust of the proposed SAL II will be to
engender a further "supply response" from Yugoslav enterprises.
1.14     The Yugoslav economy has been increasingly decentralized since the
1960s, with most transport activities now organized at the Republics and
Provinces, local, or enterprise level. This reduces the efficiency of the
eight Yugoslav railways, where there is a need to coordinate operations at
all levels among the Republics and Pro inces; ports, where there is a
temptation for the Republics and Provinces to construct duplicate
facilities; and to a lesser extent roads, where there is a need to
streamline joint decision making processes. Decentralization also affects
investments, since decisions must be reached partly on the basis of
political compromise among the Republics and Provinces. In order to
facilitate the development of a unified transportation system and
planning,the organizations responsible for roads are associated in a Federal
Association of Republican and Provincial Roads (FARP), while those
responsible for railways are associated in the Community of Yugoslav
Railways (CYR, para. 2.05) their members, such as tariffs and joint planning
activities. Responsibility at the Federal level for transportation rests
with Federal Secretariat for Transport and Comwrnications (FSTC), which is
responsible, inter alia, for preparing Federal laws governing transportation.
1.15     Investments -  Total social sector investments in transport have
varied quite widely in the past due to the need to complete the basic
transport system in the 1960s and 1970s, and Yugoslavia's relatively easy
access to credit in the 1970s followed by a slowdown in economic activity
and and a debt crisis in the 1980s:

1.16     Transport authorities have found it more difficult to carry out
their core investment programs during the 1980s due to budgetary
constraints. Railway investments, for example, were reduced by about 40X
after 1980 compared to the level spent during the 1970s. These restrictions
come at a time when there was an increasing need to maintain and
rehabilitate existing infrastructure for all transport modes. The main
investment issue, however, is that enterprises are not encouraged to select
their investments wisely or use them efficiently due to Yugoslavia's "soft
budget constraint" (para. 1.10).
1.17     The Bank has assisted the Government to respond ti investment
issues in two ways. First, the previous three railway projects and two
highway projects have been prepared as subsector investment loans. These
projects each financed a time-slice ox the railway or road investment
plansof participating Republics and Provinces, with the objective of
assuring that investments were well selected, appropriately timed, covered
by realistic financing plans, and were within the absorptive capacity of the
responsible authorities. Second, the proposed project would support the
Government's economic reform program by assisting to finance a railway
investment program which is a reasonable balance between Lhe need tc,
rehabilitate and maintain existing infrastructure, to improve the main trunk
line in support of domestic industries and international traffic, and to
constrain public spending in a period of economic difficulty.
1.18     Pricing - Pricing transport services under conditions of high
inflation has proved increasingly difficuit in recent years. A general
commitment was included under SAL I (Ln. 2324-YU) and the Sixth Railway
Project (Ln. 2336-YU) providing for regular adjustments of railway tariffs
by at least 62 p.a. in real terms, and the Government has increased tariffs
in accordance with these commitments since 1984. However, the major
increases were made late in the year, contributing to the result that th*
operating deficit increased in recent years. A revised tariff covenant is
included under the proposed project to help address this problem (para 2.26).



1.19     Similarly, the lag in adjusting road user revenues from the fuel
tax seriously affected the level of investments and of road maintenarce and
pavement strengthening activity during whe 1980s. However, the Government
has recently increased fuel taxes and revised most of the allocation for
roads to an ad valorem basis, which will go some way to resolve the
problem. Additional measures would be implemented under a proposed Third
Highway Sector Project.
1.20     International Transport - The Yugoslav Government is considering
increasing trade with other European countries as part of its effort to
increase its market orientation. At the same time, the European Community
(EC) intends to unify its markets, including transport, by end-1992 in order
to increase the exchange of goods among its members and to compete
effectively with the large economies of North America and the Far East. An
additional factor is that Yugoslavia is a transit country for EC members,
with about three imes as many EC trucks using Yugoslav roads (measured in
ton-kilometers travelled) as Yugoslav truckers use EC roads. The EC
countries are in the process of debating and formulating their common
transport policy, and Yugoslavia needs to decide to what extent it should
adopt similar policies with a view to facilitating trade and increasing
their foreign exchange earnings from international transport. In
particular, Yugoslavia needs to decide whether to increase its axle load
limitation from 10 to 11.5 tons as the EC proposes; how to recover the cost
of road infrastructure used by foreign trucks; whether it is in Yugoslavia's
interest to seek an increase in bilateral and cross-trade trucking permits;
and whether Yugoslavia should adopt the same technical, financial, and
social regulations for international truck transport as the EC. As far as
increasing Yugoslavia's market orientation, transport is a good sector to
deregulate first because of the lack of economies of scale in trucking, and
because you can take advantage of other countries experience with transport
deregulation. International transport issues are fairly complex, and as a
first step the Bank is assisting the Government to address these questions
by preparing a study on Improving the Efficiency of Transport Markets (para.
1.09).
D. Previous Bank Projiects
1.21     The Bank has made 24 loans for transport totalling US$1,417.1
million equivalent since 1963 (Annex 2). These include seven loans for the
railway subsector, thirteen loans to the highway subsector, one loan for the
Port of Bar, and a multimodal loan for earthquake rehabilitation.
1.22     The principal accomplishments under past and ongoing railway
projects are: (a) until about 1984 , improvement of the finances of the
railways, principally through tariff increases and better selection of
investments; (b) supporting the establishment and strengthening of the
Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR); (c) the introduction of comprehensive
Action Plans as a means of contributing to the common understanding and
responsibility of the eight railway organizations; (d) sector investment
lending wherein the borrowers and the Bank agree on multi-year railway
investment plans and periodically review these plans; and (e) the
introduction of auditing procedures. The PCRs indicate that railway
projects in recent years, with the exception of the Kosovo Railway Project,
have generally been implemented with some delay, but without substantial
cost overruns or other major problems. The ERR for the Kosovo Railway
Project is likely to be lower than anticipated due to low traffic growth.



1.23     The main emphasis in highway lending has been on improvements to
key links in the primary road network. The Completion Reports for the
Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Highway Project indicated that the projects
substantially achieved their objectives. The Completion Report for the
Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects pointed out that these projects suffered
delays in implementation because of shortages of local funds due to the
severe recession which began at that time. The First and Second Highway
Sector Projects are based on a comprehensive sector lending approach to
seven RAPs, including a deeper involvement in the important area of road
maintenance.  Processing of both projects was delayed pending resolution of
the road funding issue, but is now proceeding satisfactorily.
II. THE RAILWAYS
A. General
2.01     The railways in Yugoslavia are organised along the basic pattern of
the economic system, with eight separate and independent Railway Transport
Organizations (RTOs), each serving a Republic or Province, each named after
its capital city, and together forming a railway network of 9,245 km. The
four RTOs participating in the proposed project are Ljubljana, Zagreb, Novi
Sad and Belgrade, serving respectively the Republics/Provinces of Slovenia,
Croatia, Vojvodina and Serbia.  They operate about 852 of the main trunk
line which runs through Yugoslavia from Jesenice on the Austrian border in
the Northwest through Belgrade to Gevgelija and Dimitrovgrad in the
Southeast. This line with short links to the main port, Rijeka, and to
Austria via Maribor forms the backbone of rail transport in Yugoslavia,
providing an international corridor between western Europe and Greece and
Middle East via Turkey, linking the Republics and Provinces, and carrying
about 802 of transit traffic or about half of the country's total rail
traffic (Map IBRD 20806).
B. Traffic
2.02     Rail traffic totalled 25.4 billion tkm of freight plus 11.5 billion
pkm of passenger traffic in 1988. Freight traffic grew 2.91 p.a. from 1975
to 1985, but then fell 3.91 p.a. from 1985 to 1988 primarily due to the
slowdown in industrial production caused by Yugoslavia's current economic
difficulties. Passenger traffic similarly grew 1.5S p.a. from 1975 to 1985,
and then fell 1.42 p.a. from 1985 to 1988. Recent traffic trends are shown
below, with additional details for the project RTOs given in
Table 3.

2.03      About 552 of Yugoslav railways freight traffic are bulk
commodities. The most important cargo is coal, which amounted to 14.6
million tons in 1988. Yugoslavia has large reserves of low grade brown coal
and lignite which are located in several different regions and are used
primarily to generate about 501 of Yugoslavia's power, as well as for
domestic heating. Coking coal is imported by six domestic steel refineries
which are all located inland. Yugoslav railways also transported about 4.4
million tons of iron ore and non-ferrous metals in 1988. Some iron ore is
mined domestically, and some imported through the ports of Ploce and Koper
by the steel industry. Yugoslavia is also the largest producer of
non-ferrous metals in Europe including lead, zinc, nickel, copper and
bauxite, most of which is exported. Other major freight traffics include
steel and other metal products (6.7 million tons in 1988), petroleum (5.7
million tons), wood (4.7 million tons), and fertilizers (4.3 million tons).
The average length of haul of freight traffic has been gradually increasing
to 304 km in 1988, as Yugoslav railways specialize more in long-distance
traffic. International traffic accounted for 34S of freight ton-kilometres

in 1988, and is now growing due to increased international trade. One of
the objectives of the project is to assist Yugoslav railways to compete more
effectively for international traffic.
2.04     Yugoslav railways carried 115.7 million passengers in 1988.  The
average length of haul was 99 km, representing a mixture of long-distance
traffic and commuter traffic. The future prospects for freight and
passenger traffic are assessed in Chapter 4.
C. Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR)
2.05     Three-quarters of rail freight traffic in Yugoslavia travels
between RTOs, so that operations are highly interdependent. In 1978 a
Federal law was enacted, establishing the CYR as a business association of
all eight RTOs whose principal objective is to ensure the development of
a unified railway system in Yugoslavia. CYR is responsible, inter alia, for
establishing uniform nationwide tariffs and timetables and joint investment
plans, joint utilization of facilities and ensuring safety on the railway
system. It is generally responsible for international aspects of railway
operations including setting terms and conditions for transportation of
imported goods and goodu in international transit and for handling revenues
from, and debts owed to, foreign railways in respect of transportation
activities. Operation, maintenance and development of each railway remains
with the RTOs. At the end of 1987, CYR has taken the initiative in
preparing a Business Policy of Yugoslav Railways which was adopted by CYR's
Assembly on December 23, 1987 (para. 3.31 and Annex 6). Well-qualified
professional staff represent the RTOs at federal and international levels.
2.06     For past Bank financed railway projects, CYR has played a very
useful planning and coordinating function. It was responsible for
coordinating procurement, loan administration and project reporting.
Recently CYR's role was enhanced through coordinating the RTOs' high
priority investments. Its role in the present project will be similar to
that assumed under previous projects. A state of the art seminar to improve
skills in economic and financial analysis will be financed under the
project, which is intended to strengthen CYR's planning and
coordinatingfunction. The project also includes a study of railway
marketing practices in other countries, leading to the possible
strengthening of the marketing department in CYR in order to further
transform a traditional railway system into a commercially oriented one.
D. Organization
2.07     Both RTO Belgrade, known as Radna Organizacija Zeleznicka
Tran 3rtna Organizacija Beograd (Belgrade Railway Transport Working
Orgc 1. &,'ion), and RTO Novi Sad, known as Zeleznicka Transportna
Organizacija Novi Sad (Novi Sad Railway Transport Organization), are Work
OrganizatiiAs (WO) whose members are Basic Organizations of Associated Labor
(BOALs). Each BOAL is responsible for a different railway activity (e.g.
transport, traffic, maintenance of traction and rolling stock, track
overhaul, catering, etc.). RTE Zagreb, known as Slozene Organizacija
Udruzenog Rada ZTP - Zeljeznicki Transport Zagreb (Zagreb Railway Transport
Composite Organization of Associated Labour ZTP) and RE Ljubljana, known as
SOZD Zeleznisko Gospodarstvo Ljubljana (SOZD Ljubljana Railway Economy) are



- 11 -
both Composite Organizations of Associated Labour (COAL) whose members are
WOs, most of which in turn are comprised of BOALs. These Woe are divided
into two types: those which are regionalized and responsible for basic
railway activities in a given region of the Republic, and those which
provide supporting services to the first group (e.g. engineering workshops,
health, research, education, etc.). Each of the RTOs may contract foreign
loans for purposes of carrying out the overall investment program agreed at
the COAL or WO level (as the case may be) for joint activities of the
organization's members.
2.08     The supreme decision-making body of each RTO is the Workers'
Council (WC) which is composed of representatives selected by the workers of
the constituent members of the RTO. Decisions of the WC are implemented by
a Managing Board comprised of members selected by the WC and headed by a
president, or, in the case of Belgrade, are implemented by a single General
Manager selected by the WC. The WC generally determines important matters
of policy and development. It approves the investment plan of the
organization as a whole.
E. Management and Staff
2.09     Management is ultimately responsible co the Workers' Councils,
wbich may meet once or twice a month or more frequently where necessary.
Maaagement and decision-making are complex processes with extensive
interactions between management and Workers' Councils. Management has
always been technically competent in traditional railway disciplines, but
has been weak in marketing. A more commercial approach needs to be
adopted. Technical assistance under this project will address this matter
(para. 3.15).
2.10     After several years of staff reductions, the four RTOs began
increasing staff from 1982 onwards, which created a major problem because
traffic fell substantially after 1984. As a reflection of growing
unemployment, labour legislation was introduced stipulating the obligation
to employ school leavers as trainees in numbers related to the existing work
force. Hoping for quick improvement of the economy and out of a sense of
obligation towards society at large, the RTOs kept hiring staff and retained
surplus manpower and disabled workers in spite of a decline in traffic
(Table 2.1). While the total staff in the four RTOs rose 5.5S from 86,548
in 1984 to 91,336 in 1988, productivity decreased by 15.5% from 361,000
traffic units per employee in 1984 to 305,000 traffic units per employee in
1988 (Tables 12 and 13). A major change of the RTOs' staffing policies as
well as the introduction of solid manpower planning based on work studies
are essential for the railway's recovery. Agreement was obtained during
Negotiations, that each RTO will carry out a staff reduction program
designed to achieve a reduction in its staff by 2% p.a. (RE Ljubljana: 1.51
p.a.) from 1989 through 1993 based on actual staff on December 31, 1988.
F. Railway Property
Network
2.11     At the end of 1988, the railway network in Yugoslavia comprised
9,245 route-km (see Map IBRD 20806), 1001 standard gauge, of which 933 km or
10.01 were double track and with 3,531 km or 38.21 of the network



- 12 -
electrified. This percentage of electrification is slightly below those of
major western European railways (Table 6). The network of the four RTOs is:
of which electrified:
km                km
RTO Belgrade                  1,894           927 or 491
RE Ljubljana                  1,228           518 or 422  '
RTO Novi Sad                  1,480            344 or 232
RTE Zagreb                    2,441           838 or 34% t'
7,043         2,627
1/ DC system, 3kV; the other RTOs operate on AC, 25kV
2I of which 107 km are also DC - 3kV
2.12     The track of the four RTOs is mainly (about 562) 49 kg/m rails,
partly with welded joints, laid on wooden sleepers and concrete sleepers,
generally fastened witn K-system or elastic clips. About 2,690 km of
secondary line have either 45 kg/m (161) or even 35 kg/m (211) rails.  The
ballast is of adequate quality stone and formation. About 491 of the four
RTO's network is suitable for axle loads of 18-20 tons per axle, about 231
are of 16 tons per axle and 288 km (about 41) permit only 12-14 tons per
axle. Despite considerable progress in improving track conditions on main
lines-the four RTOs rehabilitated about 815 km of track during
1983-86-speed restrictions are imposed on about 820 km of line sections
because of poor track conditions which reduce line capacity and
significantly increase the operation and maintenance costs.
2.13     In 1984, the Yugoslav railways adopted, in line with other
European railways, a 22.5 ton per axle standard for the main trunk lines
requiring a narrower spacing of sleepers and heavier rails - 60 kg/m. The
new standard will be applied with every track renewal. The railways expect
to have the whole main trunk line upgraded by 1995.
Sisnallinm and Telecommunications
2.14     Most of Yugoslav railways' main trunk lines, carrying over 601 of
the total gross ton kilometers, are electrified and have been equipped
with modern signalling and telecommunications. About 241 of the four RTO's
network is additionally equipped with automatic line block (ALB), and 91 is
9 erated with centralized traffic control (CTC). Many of the secondary
lines are still equipped with old and obsolete mechanical signalling
systems which are difficult to maintain and restrict operational
efficiency. Replacement by modern systems, however, is not of high
priority.
Traction and Rolling Stock
2.15     The main type of traction is electric, accounting for about 681 of
the four RTOs' locomotive hauled traffic (in gross ton-kms) with 304 DC and
129 AC mainline locomotives. The RTOs own also 675 diesel locomotives



- 13 -
including shunters, 95 electric and 129 diesel multiple units and 137 rail
buses (Table 8). All steam engines which are mainly used as shunters and
rail buses which are over 35 years old are planned to be withdrawn before
the end of 1990.
2.16     The four RTOs own 2,033 passenger coaches with total capacity of
124,300 seats (Table 8); 120 coaches are over 30 years old and reached the
end of their economic life. They should be scrapped as soon as possible.
2.17     One of the main operational problems of Yugoslav railways in the
last 6-8 years has been that procurement of new freight wagons has been
insufficient to keep up with the needs for replacemeut, modernization
(competitive conditions require the increased use of specialized wagones
and traffic growth. As a result, the RTOs have been forced to hire foreign
wagons to meet their operational needs and have been unable to carry all
offered traffic. The freight wagon fleet of the four RTOs at the beginning
of 1989 comprised 38,028 wagons. About 8S of this fleet was procured
before 1950. The withdrawal of about 800 wagons within the planning period
will allow the on-going modernization of the freight wagon fleet to
continue. Under the project, this shortage will be alleviated by: (i)
improving operational efficiency; (ii) installation of a computer-based
wagon control system, and (iii) procurement of 945 wagons (para. 3.11).
Workshop and Depots
2.18     The four RTOs inspect and maintain their traction stock in 5
workshops and 19 depots. They are unnecessarily numerous for historical
reasons. A consultant's study carried out under the Fifth Railway Project
recommended a concentration to fewer places in order to increase
efficiency. The concentration of locomotive major overhaul and parts
remanufacture in a single location for electric and diesel locomotives
respectively would result in a significant increase in locomotive
availability through a program of equipment exchange, and cost savings
brought about by reduction in spare parts inventory, common procurement
ofspare parts, and labour specialization. The consultants estimate that it
should be possible to save as many as 44 electric locomotives through a
system of industrial maintenance, assuming that spare parts are readily
available and the system is efficiently implemented. It should also be
possible to achieve similar savings in diesel locomotives through a similar
system. Although some of the RTOs have been reluctant to implement a
reorganization, in February 1988, all eight RTOs signed an Agreement on
Improvement of Yugoslav Railway Traction Stock, which provides for (a) the
division of work between depots and workshops, (b) methods and procedures
of upgrading depots and overhaul workshops for modern maintenance, (c)
regulations governing the relationship between the RTOs and the overhaul
workshops carrying out repairs for several RTOs, (d) a procedure for the
provision and utilization of major vehicle components to enable
industrialized maintenance by exchange of components, and (e) a procedure
for the provision and utilization of spare parts. The Agreement is a good
step in the right direction of reorganizing locomotive major overhaul
within three years. The Agreement provides also for the forming of a
coordinating board for its implementation consisting of a delegate from
each RT0 and CYR. The timely and effective functioning of this board is
crucial. Agreement was obtained at Negotiations that each RTO will carry



-14-
out a program, satisfactory to the Bank, to improve its system of
locomotive maintenance and overhaul. The program will be carried out in
line with the Agreement of February 1988.
G. Integrated Trans2ort
2.19     Yugoslavia is at an early stage in developing its integrated
transport system. The use of containers in waterborne commerce is growing
rapidly worldwide, and internal transport costs can be reduced if these
containers move to or from their final inland origins or destinations. On
the railways, around 4-5X of freight traffic is containerized on lines
serving the port of Rijeka, as well as on the main trunk line north of
Ljubljana where the Austrians have started a piggyback service. South of
Ljubljana on the main trunk line, and elsewhere, very little traffic is
unitized. About 4,000 meters of tunnels would have to be lowered between
Ljubljana and Zagreb to handle container wagons, but it is possible for
traffic to and from northern and northwestern Europe to avoid this
bottleneck without a substantial distance penalty by travelling via
Maribor; traffic to/from Italy, France and Spain would need to travel an
additional 100 km or so to transit via Maribor (see Map IBRD 20806).
2.20     The main constraint to expanding the use of containers and other
forms of integrated transport is the lack of experience of freight
forwarders, industry, and the railways in organizing the uniform
procedures, documentation, and rate schedules which are necessary for a
"door-to-door" transport service. In addition, there is a shortage of
containers in Yugoslavia, the railways and other modes lack container
handling equipment, and there are few inland freight terminals. The
Government is interested in promoting the development of integrated
transport, and passed the "Social Compact on the Development of Integrated
Transport" in 1984. The Yugoslav Chamber of Economy has also prepared
ambitious proposals for investing in a network of freight centers. The
Bank recommended carrying out feasibility studies for one or two freight
centers before undertaking investments, and these studies are currently
under preparation. The project would include about $22 million for
container handling equipment and related investments to assist the RTOs to
increase their container and piggyback traffic.
H. Uneconomic Lines and Services
2.21     Yugoslav railways provide for historical and social reasons a
number of services which are now uneconomic primarily due to changes in
traffic patterns. These include branch lines, stations, and passenger
trains with uneconomically low traffic volumes.   Once established, there
is social and political resistence to discontinuing these services.
Yugoslav railways have made efforts over the years to close lines and
stations and discontinue passenger trains. For example, the four RTO's
under the project closed 1,135 km of uneconomic lines between 1965 and
1985. They closed an additional 354 km to public service, but continue to
give these lines minimum maintenance. The RTOs use the operation of low
traffic lines as a bargaining device in their discussions with the
Republics/Provinces and COIs concerning compensation and capital
contributions. For example, RTO Novi Sad decided to rehabilitate two low
volume lines only after the users contributed to the cost of



- 15 -
rehabilitation. Forty-eight percent of Yugoslavia's railway lines now
carry only 192 of traffic, and the railways propose to close additional
lines which prove to be uneconom.ic in accordance with a methodology which
is acceptable. The project RTOs have also discontinued various passenger
services. For example, RE Ljubljana recently cancelled four passenger
trains when local autborities failed to agree to provide sufficient
compensation. However CYR, in its new Business Policy, recognizes that
more needs to be done (paras. 3.01 and 3.31). In particular, Yugoslav
railways have 970 stations which load or unload about 150 million tons of
freight each year. One-third of these stations handle less than one
wagonload per day which is uneconomic. CYR proposes that a phased program
be undertaken, in cooperation with local trucking enterprises, to close a
number of these stations. Closing uneconomic freight stations has the
potential to reduce operating costs to a significant degree. The project
RTOs agreed at Negotiations to close 168 freight services and stations
between 1989 and 1993.
I. Operations
2.22     The operating performance of the four RTOs deteriotated gradually
after 1984 and sharply in 1987 in all areas related to freight traffic,
while passenger traffic performances improved significantly up to 1986 but
showed mixed results in 1987, and again a deterioration in 1988 (Tables 4,
6 and 8). Despite performance and productivity ratios that are reasonable
compared to other railways (Table 7), decisive actions are needed to
improve the RTOs' efficiency. The major areas of concern are freight
operations and availability of traction and rolling stock. Freight traffic
is handled at far too many stations, as discussed (para. 2.21). Low
availability of electric and diesel locomotives has become a major problem
reducing the capacity and profitability of the Yugoslav railway system as a
whole. Availability of traction and rolling stock (except freight wagons)
declined since 1984 to unsatisfactory levels in 1987 but, improved slightly
in 1988 (Table 8). The main reasons for the decline were: (a) shortage of
foreign exchange for spare parts; (b) an inefficient system of stock
control; (c) an aging fleet; (d) a relatively high degree of utilization;
and (e) inefficient workshop organization. Spare parts financed under the
Sixth Railway Project are expected to improve the availability rates
temporarily. Although the Bank does not normally finance recurrent
expenditures such as spare parts, the supply of foreign spare parts has
become such a problem that Bank financing is recommended on the basis that
the RTOs have undertaken and appear able to secure sufficient foreign
exchange to contribute 50S of the funds needed for procurement (para.
3.12). At the same time, the RTOs have to reorganize their workshop and
maintenance organization (para. 2.18). In addition, the RTOs should
introduce a computer-based monitoring system for spare parts management to
improve the utilization of scarce funds and to assure that spare parts are
purchased in a timely manner. During Negotiations the RTOs each agreed to
introduce a system which is satisfactory to the Bank, by November 30, 1990.
2.23     RE Ljubljana has installed, and RTE Zagreb is in the process of
installing, a computer-based train, wagon, and locomotive control system,
which will substantially improve the utilization and productivity of
traction and rolling stock and of train staff, and will reduce the



-16 -
quantities of wagons and locomotives to be procured in medium term. RTOs
Belgrade and Novi Sad intend to install the system under the proposed
project. 1.' Provisions are made in their respective Investment Plans
(Tables 9a and 9c).
J. Tariffs and Compensatiou
2.24     Railway tariffs for freight and passenger traffic are adjusted
uniformly throughout Yugoslavia and are based on the type of traffic and
distance. Prior to 1988 tariff proposals were prepared by CYR and
submitted to the Federal Government (Institute for Prices) for review and
approval. In August 1988, the Government approved guidelines for
calculating tariff adjustments every quarter, based on "common elements"
(Annex 3). The scheme basically provided for rail tariffs to be increased
to the level of road tariffi in six quarterly adjustments and to be
maintained at that level thereafter. Compensation was to be paid to meet
any deficit between rail costs and the revenue generated by the new
tariffs. Tariff adjustments for the last two quarters of 1988 were made in
line with the guidelines but the Government suspended application of the
January 1, 1989 adjustment. Later a lower increase was approved. Revised
guidelines for tariff adjustments based on "common criteria" are now being
developed. During the past ten years passenger tariffs have not been
increased in line with inflation with the result that passenger tariffs
have fallen in real terms by about 50 during this period. During
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and the RTOs that
the passenger unit price level relative to the freight unit price level
would not decrease in future. The Government and the RTOs also indicated
that endeavors would be made to improve the ratio over time.
2.25     Rail tariff and compensation policies in Yugoslavia have changed
significantly since the 1970s. Operating deficits in the early 1970s were
small. From the mid-70s, rail costs rose rapidly partly as a result of
higher oil prices and inflation and partly as a result of wage/labour
policies that had objectives other than railway efficiency and viability.
In an attempt to constrain general inflation, the Federal authorities did
not permit rail tariffs to be increased in line with higher costs.
Compensation payments to cover deficits were made by the Communities of
Interest (COI) in each Republic/Province.
2.26     In 1983 under the Sixth Railway Project (Ln. 2336-YU), the
Yugoslav authorities undertook to implement measures designed to achieve
the gradual eliminaticn of compensation payments and replace them with
revenue from tariffs. Tariffs were to be increased each year in line with
the increase in the Producer Price Index (PPI) in Yugoslavia plus an
increase in real terms of 62. As a result, compensation fell from 2.5% of
total revenue in 1983 to 21% in 1986 (Annex 3). Acceleration of inflation
since 1986, however, reversed this trend and compensation payments to CYR
increased to 242 of revenue in 1987, representing about 282 of average
revenue of the four RTOs covered by this project. The compensation payment
to Ljubljana represented about 371 of total revenue in 1988 and 29S of
1/ RTO Belgrade's investments will also cover the remaining RTOs Pristina,
Sarajevo, Skopje and Titograd.



- 17 -
revenue for the four RTOs. In spite c. compensation payments, three of the
four RTOs participating in this project incurred substantial net deficits
that year. Under the Sixth Railway Project agreement was reached for E. 6S
per annum real tariff increase through 1990. With this tariff increase it
was anticipated that compensation would be eliminated, but in view of the
current economic difficulties, reduced traffic levels and slower than
anticipated growth in productivity, this target will not be achieved. The
Government is concerned that further real tariff increases after 1990 might
place the railways in a non-competitive position vis a vis other European
railways, which are heavily subsidized, and local road transport services.
This ie particularly a problem in Yugoslavia in view of the current state
of railway infrastructure and rolling stock. During the past four years,
tariffs were adjusted in line with inflation plus the 62 real increase.
Due to the high level of inflation, however, and the implementation of the
major adjustment in tariffs towards the end of the year, the RTOs' income
fell short of requirements. To address these problems and to ensure that
the RTOs improve their financial performance, agreement was reached during
negotiation that the RTOs will: (a) increase domestic tariffs each year
from October 1, 1989 onwards by the increase in the PPI plus 62 in real
terms at the beginning of 1990; and (b) implement the inflation increase by
adjusting tariffs four times per year on the first day of each quarter in
accordance with a formula satisfactory to the Bank; and (c) increase
tariffs on January 1, 1990, by a further 6S in real terms. On April 1,
1989, a tariff increase of 762 was implemented which brought tariffs in
line with the Sixth Railway Loan requirements plus estimated inflation to
that date.
K. Accounts and Audits
2.27     Railway accounts are kept separately by each RTO on a uniform
Government prescribed commercial basis. The accounts are kept to a
reasonable standard with extensive use of computers. As a result of the
Bank's requirements, cash flow analysis has come to play an important role
in the RTO's accounting processes. Fixed assets are subject to an annual
revaluation, based on replacement costs, using coefficients obtained from
priced indices of the Federal Institute of Statistics. Book values of
fixed assets are thus maintained at realistic levels and depreciation
charges play a proper role in generating funds to meet current replacement
costs of fixed assets.
2.28     A study to formulate a uniform costing system for the RTOs was
carried out by Yugoslav consultants and completed in 1979, but a consensus
by all RTOs on this complex and critical matter was not reached until
1982. A contract was signed in May 1982 between CYR and the consultants to
introduce and test the system at RTO Belgrade to be followed, if
satisfactory, by implementation at the other RTOs. The system has been
tested and the results analyzed. In summary, most RTOs feel that the
proposed system would add little to the results obtainable by using the
present three-digit account0ng code with a further five for origin and
destination of costs. The application of the proposed system would require
staff of higher ability and salary levels than the present accounting staff
and would not aid significantly in the management decision-making process.
The Bank believes it should not press for implementation of a system which
is not acceptsvle to the Borrower and whose value has not been
demonstrated.



- 18 -
2.29     The annual accounts of each RTO are audited by the Social
Accounting Service (SDK) in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. In recent years there has been delays of about four months in
the submission of audit reports due to a shortage of staff in the Special
Unit of SDK which undertakes the audits. SDK are holding discussions with
the appropriate Government departments tn resolve this shortage. In its
reports on the 1987 annual accounts of RTO's Novi Sad and Zagreb, SDK had
serious reservations and as a result did not certify the accounts. The
reservations cover inter alia failure of RTOs to confirm debit and credit
balances with debtors and creditors as required by Yugos.av law,
non-recognition of foreign exchange losses, incorrect revaluation of fixed
assets and inconsistent treatment of interest on loans. A substantial part
of these reservations cover recently issued accounting rules which in
effect have introduced a system of current cost accounting in Yugoslavia to
make the annual accounts more realistic during the current high inflation
(para. 5.01). As RTOs accounting staff did not fully comprehend the new
regulations, there were numerous cases on noncompliance. In addition, due
to the adverse effects of the new reguLations on the RTO's profits, there
was a natural tendency to misinterpret the rules. Because of the delays in
producing the accounts and audit reports for 1987, it was decided to issue
the audit reports with SDK's reservations without waiting for further
discussions between the parties to resolve the issues. Most of the
problems have since been resolved and the necessary adjustments have been
made in the 1988 accounts. Adjustments were also made in the appraisal
report's financial tables for 1987. SDK audit report for the 1988 accounts
will also cover the 1987 accounts in accordance with their usual practice.
Receipt of the SDK certified audit reports satisfactory to the Bank from
each of the four RTOs for 1988 will be a condition of effectiveness of that
loan. Prior to 1988, the auditors had reservations in their reports
covering the lack of certification of commonly generated revenue allocated
by CYR to RTOs. To resolve this problem, CYR agreed during appraisal to
have SDK audit its accounts annually to the extent necessary to satisfy SDK
as to the accuracy of revenue allocated to RTOs. This audit was undertaken
on the 1987 accounts and agreement for future audits was confirme"d during
negotiations.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Rationale
3.01     In an environment of the economy's declining performance, the
fundamental problem of the railways' decreasing competitiveness became
undeniably evident. The Yugoslav railways are the least economic cost
carrier for bulk commodities, low value goods travelling over long
distances, and much inter-city passenger traffic. There is thus a long
term role for the railways in Yugoslavia. The Federal and
Republican/Provincial Governments support this role in the 1986-90 Medium
Term Development Plan. After many years of inertia, the railways'
management appearvi to have realized that the recent stagnation of rail
freight traffic is not a temporary phenomenon. At the end of 1987, CYR has
taken the initiative in preparing and beginning to implement a reform
program which addresses most oi the railways' interrelated problems (para.
3.31). These reforms are incorporated in a Business Policy which is
summarized in Annex 6. The key features of the Business Policy are:



- 19 -
(a)    creation of freight routes with guaranteed time schedules;
(b)    forming of more direct freight trains;
(c)    increase of wagon load and shortening of turnaround time;
(d)    provision of 22.5 ton axle load on international routes;
(e)    increase in travel speeds for passenger and freight trains;
(f)    reduction of number of stations;
(g)    termination of public transportation on uneconomic lines or
receiving adequate compensation;
(h)    implementation of the agreement to reorganize locomotive
major overhaul; and
ti)    use of tariffs as a marketing tool.
3.02     The overall rationale for the project is to support this new
momentum for reform within the railways.
B. Obiectives
3.03     The Bank's participatios 5n financing the project is directed at:
{i) rationalizing the participating RTO's Investment Plans; (ii) moving
towards an appropriate pricing policy; and (iii) improving operational
efficiency, and more specifically: (a) assisting the Government's policy in
overcoming key conscraints on the main trunk line through Yugoslavia which
provides an international corridor; (b) fostering the integration of the
railway system; and (c) strengthening the four participating PTOs so as to
enable them to compete effectively in the transport market.
3.04     To achieve these broad objectives, the project seeks to:
(a)    rationalize the 1988-90 Investment Plans;
(b)    continue the railways  pricing policy initiated under SAL I
and the Sixth Railway Project aimed at improving financial
viability and independence;
(c)    reduce operating costs by closing low volume freight
stations;
(d)    increase labour productivity independently from traffic
fluctuation by reducing the number of staff;
(e)    provide an adequate supply of spare parts in order to
increase locomotive availability;
(f)    ease critical railway capacity constraints on the main
trunk line vital for the movement of key bulk commodities
and transit traffic for international trade; and
(g)    raise the level of operational performance, staff
productivity and quality of service by continuing corporate
planning, the use of Action and Operational Plans, and
introducing an Information System for Locomotive, Train and
Wagon Control.
C. Investment Plans
3.05     The RTOs prepared 5-year Investment Plans designed to achieve the
broad objectives outlined in para. 3.03, which consist only of high
priority items and which are all economically justified. The project has
been based on investments originally planned for 1988-90, but is extended
to 1991 to reflect a more realistic implementation period (para. 3.21) and



- 20 -
is now acceptable; in particular each major investmen. item has an economic
return greater than 12X, is covered by a satisfactory Financing Plan, and
is within the implementation capability of the concerned RTO. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that, each RTO will: (a) implement its
Project Investment Plan with due diligence and efficiency and in accordance
with appropriate economic, financial, engineering and railway practices;
(b) prepare and furnish to the Bank not later than November 15 of each year
from 1989 to 1991 updated Investment and F'nancing Plans, taking into
account traffic results and trends; (c) carry out during the following
year such Investment Plan as shall have been agreed between the Bank and
the RTO; (d) consult with the Bank before introducing any increase of 5% or
more of a given year's planned investments and ensure that no such increase
shall be made in its Investment Plan unless its economic and financial
justification shall have been demonstrated to the Bank's satisfaction.
This would mean that each major investment exceeding US$3 million
equivalent would have to have an internal economic rate of return of 12% or
more and a first year return of 101 or more, and an internal financial rate
of return of 10% or more, estimated in accordance with a methodology which
is satisfactory to the Bank, is covered by a satisfactory Financing Plan,
and is within the implementation capability of the concerned RTO.
D. Project Description
3.06     The major project components are:
Track Overhaul
3.07     Poor track conditions have significantly reduced the efficiency of
railway operations through reduced line capacity and major increases in
operation and maintenance costs (para. 2.12). About 19% of the total
project expenditure is for about 651 km of track overhaul. Bank financing
will cover the overhaul of various sections of the main trunk line
totalling 357 km. Worn-out track--mostly about 20 years old (in some cases
about 40 years old) and subject to severe speed restrictions--will be
renewed witlh 'ew UIC 60 rails on the main trunk line (para. 2.13), type 49
kg/meter raiLs on other main lines and used rails on the remainder to
increase the permissible axle load to 22.5 tons on the trunk line and 20
tons on the remainder with speeds to 120 km/h. The use of UIC 60 rails on
the main trunk line from Austria to Greece will allow higher speeds of up
to 160 km/h for passenger trains but its main benefit will be in reducing
high track maintenance cost, due mainly to heavy freight traffic. Without
the proposed track renewals, the poor track conditions would deteriorate
further and restrict the daily number of trains.
Line Sections and Stations
3.08     About 272 of project expenditures are provided for reconstruction
wo:ks. Major expenditures will be on renewal and extension of tracks and
points, construction of underpasses to platforms and equipping stations
with modern signalling and telecommunications systems and line sections
with automatic block systems. Bank participation will cover works on
(a) various line sections between Jesenice and Dobova, which also include
track doubling between Podnart and Lesce (10.5 km), Jesenice and Slovenski
Javornik (2.7 km) and Ljubljana and Vizmarje (3.9 km);  (b) the
construction of a 11.3 km new bypass line west of Zagreb for freight
trains; and (c) completion of the second of three stages of the main
Belgrade Junction.



- 21 -
Electrification
3.09     The change of the electric system on the section Srpske
Moravica-Rijeka - about a third of the line Zagreb-Rijeka - from 3kV DC to
25kV AC is the only major investment into electrification and it accounts
for about 4.71 of the total project cost.
Signalling and Telecommunications
3.10     New installations of signalling and telecommunications for
existing lines account for 51 of the project total. Obsolete mechanical
signalling systems will be replaced on about 200 km of lines by modern
equipment, including devices for automatic train stopping. The equipment
will increase safety and improve line capacity. Radio dispatcher systems
provide better and faster communication between signal boxes and line
locomotives as well as shunting locomotives in bigger stations and
marshalling yards. They provide for more flexibility in trait operations
and increase significantly efficiency of shunting. Bank participation will
cover modernization of signalling and telecommunication of the Zagreb main
station.
Traction and Rolling Stock
3.11     Traction and rolling stock needs are based on Operational Plans
which take irco account forecast traffic, the scrapping of old and obsolete
stock, and r,lso planned increases in operational efficiency through Action
Plans (par-. 3.31 and Annex 1). The planned acquisitions represent 16% of
the project cost total and include 5 electric motor trains, 945 freight
wagons, 96 passenger coaches, and rehabilitation of older locomotives,
wagons and coaches.
Locomotive Spare Parts
3.12     Low locomotive availability constitutes a critical bottleneck of
the RTOs' operations (para. 2.22). In order to alleviate the chronic
shortage of foreign spare parts just over 41 of the project cost are
proposed for the financing of locomotive spare parts. Important, however,
is that sufficient foreign exchange is being made available to the railways
by the Yugoslav authorities.
Track Maintenance Equipment
3.13     The RTOs need continuously to replace the short-lived track
maintenance equipment in order to maintain existing track overhaul
capabilities and capacities. Less than 32 of the project expenditure is
for tamping machines, gantry cranes for track laying, ballast regulators,
railcars and smaller equipment.
Information System
3.14     A computer-based train, wagon, and locomotive control system has
been installed in two RTOs (para. 2.23). It is of high priority that the
system cover the whole Yugoslav railways as soon as possible in order to
gain the benefit of country-wide information. About 92 of project



- 22 -
expenditure are provided for equipmuent, software and the upgrading of the
telecommunications, which will not only be for the RTOs Belgrade and Novi
Sad but also for the remaining RTOs Pristina, Sarajevo, Skopje and Titograd.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.15     The project would provide for about 70 man-months of foreign and
local consulting services designed to assist technically competent
management of the RTOs and CYR in further transforming a traditional
railway system into a commercially oriented, technically advanced, and
efficiently operated one. A list of studies which has been discussed at
appraisal is given in Annex 5. They address mainly: (i) studying railway
marketing in other countries; (ii) a study of methods to improve transit
traffic on Yugoslav railways; and (iii) a seminar on the preparation of
economic and financial documents. Outline of Terms of Reference prepared
by CYR were discussed at Negotiations and will be finalized shortly.
E. Cost Estimates
3.16     Project cost estimates were made in constant December 1988
Yugoslav Dinars because of the very high inflation in Yugoslavia and the
uncertainty by which degree the inflation will decrease during the project
period. The estimates are shown in Table 9 and summarized below:

traction and rolling stock, spare parts and miscellaneous.
2/   Price contingencies, representing only international inflation, have been
estimated at 32 p.a. in 1989-90 and 4b in 1991.
3.17      The Investment Plans have been prepared by the RTOs in consultation with
competent local consultants based on recent cost experien:te with similar works,
acquisition of traction and rolling stock, and on quantity estimates from
substantially completed detailed engineering and unit prices at December 1985.
They were updated to an estimated price level at December 1988. A 10% physical
contingency has been added to the cost estimates of all items except for traction
and rolling stock, spare parts, and miscellaneous. Price contingencies, have been -
estimated assuming annual price increases of 32 each year for 1989-90 and 4% for
1991. The estimates include import duties and local taxes of about 18% or
aboutUS$165 million. Consultancy services and assistance in training programs are
estimated at US$560,000.



- 24 -
3.18      The total project cost (including contingencies) is estimated to be
about US$907 million with a foreign exchange component of US$434 million (Table
3.1). The proposed Bank loans aggregating US$138.0 million will be allocated to
specific items in the project (Table 10) with a total cost of US$612 million and a
foraign exchange component of US$324 million. The loans would cover 321 of the
total foreign exchange cost of the project and 151 of the total project cost.
F. Lending Arrangements
3.19      The Bank would make four loans, one to each RTO.  Each loan, to be
guaranteed by the Federal Government, has a 15-year maturity including five years
of grace.   A Loan Agreement would be concluded with each RTO.  CYR woulu be a
party to each of these Agreements, as it will have certain project execution and
coordination responsibilities (para. 2.06). The amounts of the four loans are
summrized below:
US$ millions
RTO Belgrade                    59.0
RE Ljubljana                    31.9
RTO Novi Sad                    14.6
RTE Zagreb                      32.5
TOTAL                  138.0
G. Implementation
3.20     Each RTO will be responsible for executing its part of the project
with CYR acting as a coordinating agency for procurement, technical
assistance and staff training, the annual revitions of Investment,
Financing, Action and Operational Plans and for all communications and
reporting with the Bank.
3.21     An implementation schedule is shown in Chart 4.  This schedule was
discussed and confirmed during Negotiations. The project completion date
would be June 30, 1992 for each RTO. The estimated implementation time is
based on experience with the Fifth and the Sixth Railway Projects. The
loan closing date would be December 31, 1992 to permit disbursement of
remaining loan proceeds for eligible expenditures incurred under then
existing contracts.
H. Procurement
3.22     Materials and equipment totalling US$137.4 million, intended to be
financed by the Bank would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages and
procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines, on .he basis of a list of materials and equipment
proposed by the RTOs and and finalized at Negotiations (Table 10).
Financing of consultanw's services and training (para. 3.15) would be
provided under the project, with selection procedures for consultant
services following Bank Guidelines. The packages and the consultant's
services, all estimated over US$50,000, would be subject to the Bank's
prior review and approval. An estimated schedule of procurement is shown
in Chart 3.



- 25 -
3.23     In bid evaluation, Yugoslav manufacturers would be allowed a
preferential margin of 15% of the CIF cost of competing imports, or the
applicable customs duties, whichever is lower.
3.24     The table below provide3 a summary of the type of procurement
which would apply to goods and works and services included under the
project. Reserved procurement is recognized for traction and rolling
stock, estimated to cost US$145 million. The Bank is satisfied that this
will not significantly affect the satisfactory execution of the project in
terms of cost, quality, and completion time. The above amount of reserved
procurement has been taken into account in the determination of the size of
the proposed Bank loan.

I. Disbursements
3.25     Disbursements would be made for goods and technical assistance.
For imported goods, disbursements would be made on the basis of 1001 of
foreign expenditures, and with respect to bids won by local manufacturers
under ICB, disbursements would be made on the basis of 1002 of the
ex-factory costs. Disbursements for technical assistance and training
would be on the basis of 1001 of total expenditures. However, because each
technical assistance contract will be financed pro rata by all four RTOs,
the disbursement percentage for each will be as follows: Belgrade 42.78X,
Ljubljana 23.101, Novi Sad 10.552, Zagreb 23.571. Withdrawals would be
made against full documentation except for reimbursement requests which
would be submitted on the basis of Statements of Expenditure for contracts
relating to goods and services and for training expenditures valued at less
than US$200,000.
3.26     At Negotiations, discussions were held with the four participating
RTOs on establishing Special Accounts for each of the four Borrowers, but
no final decision has been made by them. It was agreed that each RTO would
have the possibility of opening such an account with an authorized
allocation representing four months' estimated needs.
3.27     The Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) will be responsible for
preparation and presentation to the Bank on behalf of each RTO of
disbursement requests and requests for replenishment of the Special
Accounts. This was confirmed during Negotiations.
3.28     A schedule of estimated disbursements has been developed from the
implementation schedule (Chart 4) and is shown in Table 11. It assumes
that the loan would be effective by October 31, 1989, the project be
completed by June 30, 1992, and the loan be closed on December 31, 1992
(para. 3.21). The estimated disbursement period of two years reflects the
selection of items to be financed by the Bank suitable for quick
disbursements. Retroactive financing of up to US$13.8 million in the
aggregate would be permitted for payments made after April 1, 1989, to
cover high priority works which are planned to commence at such time.
J. Environmental Impact
3.29     Most of the proposed investments included in the project involve
the replacement or modernization of existing assets which will not
materially affect the environment. The following beneficial environmental
effects are expected from other project investments:
(a)    Belgrade Junction - Second Stage - The project will release
about 11 hectares of urban riverfront land, presently used
as railway line, for other urban uses. The city plans to
use the land primarily for constructing apartment
buildings, office buildings, and parks which is considered
reasonable. The project is also expected to divert some
passenger traffic from road to rail, reducing traffic
congestion, air pollution and noise in Belgrade.
(b)    Zagreb - Western Bypass - The project would divert freight
traffic from the center of Zagreb to the new Western Bypass



- 27 -
line outside the city, reducing delays to road traffic and
pedestrians at level crossings in the city center, and also
reducing noise levels. Construction would require about
15.6 hectares of land outside of the city center, part of
which is agricultural land, and the demolition of seven low
value structures. The city of Zagreb is making this land
available for the project. The project includ s measures
to reduce noise on the new alignment. The environmental
benefit of removing freight traffic from the :ity center
far exceeds any adverse environmental impact from
construction of the new Western Bypass line.
K. Action Plans and Monitoring Taraets
3.30     Comprehensive Action Plans were established by CYR and each RTO
under the Fifth and Sixth Railway Projects. They are an important
instrument for reaching a common understanding by all concerned on
objectives and responsibilities, and on measures and time required for
their achievement. Their overall objectives are to reduce cost, improve
the quality of service and improve the market position. They address
organization, planning, investments, marketing, productivity, finance,
government support and staff training. As part of their Action Plans, the
RTOs have prepared Operational Plans to improve the utilization of their
traction and rolling stock and to serve as a basis for procurement, renewal
and scrapping of traction and rolling stock.
3.31     In recent years, the growing economic difficulties resulting in
loss of traffic, rising costs for the railways and growing deficits due to
very high inflation and lagging-behind of tariff increases, posed major
problems for the railways which were not sufficiently addressed in the
RTOs' Action Plans. Therefore, CYR has taken the initiative in preparing a
Business Policy of Yugoslav Railways which was adopted by CYR's Assembly on
December 23, 1987. This policy sets the framework for the RTOs for action
in a more specific way. The Managing Board of CYR will monitor its
implementation and submit a report to the Assembly of CYR at the end of
each fiscal year. The key features of the Business Policy are provided in
Annex 6. Remarkable is that the policy is directed at improving
operational efficiency, greater orientation to the market, and providing
better quality of services in a more decisive way than previous Action
Plans of the RTOs. As noted above (paras. 2.26, 3.05) a number of measures
are being taken to achieve the objectives of the Business Policy. In
addition to measures to keep tariffs in line with inflation (para. 2.26)
and to implement a sound investment plan (para. 3.05) the RTOs have
developed a Project Action Plan (Annex 1) which:
(a)   specifies urgent actions to be carried out by the RTOs in
order to reverse the deterioration of the railways'
competitiveness in the transport sector;
(b)    establishes a few but important and monitorable targets to
be achieved annually.
Agreement was reached at Negotiations: (a) on the content of the Project
Action Plan; (b) that the RTOs will implement the Project Action Plan and



- 28 -
will take all actions necessary to achieve these annual operational targets;
and (c) that during 1990-91, not later than May 31 of each year, CYR will
furnish to the Bank a detailed report about the implementation and progress of
actions and achievement of targets agreed in the Project Action Plan and any
proposed revision to the Action Plan, introduction of which will be subject to
Bank agreement.
3.32     The Operational Plans for Traction and Rolling Stock should be updated
every year taking into account actual traffic developments and achievements in
improving operational efficiency. The results should serve as a basis to
review and revise future procurement of traction and rolling stock. Agreement
was reached at Negotiations, that each RTO will revise its Operational Plan for
Traction and Rolling Stock each year during 1989-93, and furnish them to the
Bank not later than November 15 of that year. The revisions will be based on
9-month actuals and estimates for the fourth quarter.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic Forecasts
4.01     It is particularly difficult to forecast future railway traffic
because of uncertainty about the timing of Yugoslavia's economic recovery
and probable changes in the structure of the economy and trade. From 1963
to 1985, the growth of railway and other inland traffic were highly
correlated with the growth of GDP, with rail freight traffic growing Pt
about 1.6 times, and rail passenger traffic at about 1.1 times, the rate of
growth of GDP. "' From 1985 to 1988 the pattern changed. Rail freight
traffic fell 11.51 and rail passenger traffic 4.22, whereas GNP grew by
about 2.3% during the same period (Table 1.1).
4.02     Yugoslavia is a transport intensive country, generating about three
times the volume of both freight and passenger transport relative to GDP as
Western European countries (para. 1.10).  In the past, Yugoslavia followed
an inward oriented development strategy. This resulted in the excessive
expansion of intermediate input industries such as iron, steel, and
1/ For 1963-85 railway traffic:
Log Rail Freight Traffic (tkm) = 0.552 log GDP
(.004)
Log Rail Passenger Traffic (pkm) = 0.589 log GDP-0.08 log population
(.022)        (.012)   squared.
For 1963-85 total inland traffic:
Log Freight Traffic (tkm) = -1.654 + 1.1 log GDP + 0.2 log population
(2.2)  (0.08)         (0.4)
Log Passenger Traffic (pkm) - -1.665 + 1.6 log GDP + 0.8 log population
(3.5)   (0.12)         (0.7)

parentheses are standard deviations.

chemicals, as well as extractive industries such as coal and iron ore. For
example, 42% of Yugoslavia's GDP was generated by the industrial sector in
1986, which is 10-15% more than typical countries with market based
economies at a similar stage of development. High transport demand is also
due to the relatively low physical concentration of population and economic
activity which results from Yugoslavia's Republican structure, the policy of
locating heavy industry in the less developed regions, and the lack of
incentives for reducing transport costs inherent in the self-management
system. For example, only 4.8% of Yugoslavia's population is located in its
capital city, compared to an average of 12.7% for the 20 countries closest
to Yugoslavia in per capita income.
4.03     The Government is embarking on a reform program to increase the
market orientation of the economy, including specializing more in activities
for which Yugoslavia has a comparative advantage, and increasing
international trade. If this program is successful, it is likely that
transport demand will decline in the long run relative to GDP, until it is
more in line with other Western European countries. This decline will
affect railways more than other transport modes because extractive and heavy
industries are the railways' primary customers. However, the relative
decline in the demand for railway services would be partly offset by an
increase in the rate of growth of GDP and increased international traffic,
for which Yugoslav railways has a comparative advantage. Overall, railway
freight traffic is expected to grow at less than the rate of growth of GDP
during the period of restructuring.
4.04     The Government's reform program is expected to yield a GDP growth
of around 2% p.a. from 1988 to 1992 and 3.5. p.a. from 1992 to 1997 provided
it is successfully implemented and sufficient funds are made available for
required investments. In addition, of course, the timing and extent of
industrial restructuring is uncertain. As a combined result, freight
traffic in the four project RTOs is forecast to grow at an average 0.5% p.a.
during 1989-91 and 1.7% p.a. during 1992-96. Passenger traffic is forecast
to grow at rates averaging 0.51 p.a. during 1989-91 and 2.2% p.a. during
1992-96 (Table 3).
B. Economic Appraisal
(a) The Planning Process and Sector Perspective
4.05     The investment plans of the four project RTOs are the result of an
iterative process involving the definition of sector objectives at the
Federal and Republican/Provincial level, economic and financial analyses of
individual investment proposals, and discussions between the railway
agencies (RTOs and CYR), Republican/Provincial authorities, professional
institutes which have prepared the feasibility studies, and Bank staff. Due
to the successful institution building efforts in railway planning initiated
under previous Bank projects, the RTOs and CYR now prepare technical and
economic feasibility studies and operational plans for all investment
proposals, usually with the assistance of transport planning institutes.
These studies are a necessary prerequisite for including projects in the
Republican/Provincial and Federal Investment Plans.

4.06     The Government emphasizes the role of railways in the 1986-90
Medium Term Development Plan in order to increase the efficiency of the
transport system (para. 1.11). Yugoslav railways have a comparative
advantage for bulk commodities, long distance freight traffic, and for
medium distance passenger traffic. However, if railways do not invest
sufficient funds, the system will deteriorate further resulting in the
uneconomic diversion of these traffics to road transport. The Government
intends to invest around 5.5% of its funds in railways during 1986-90,
compared to 2.42 in 1981-84, 3.2% in 1976-80, and 4.3% in 1971-76 (Table
2). Railway investments were underfunded during the past with the average
age of railway assets increasing from 22 years in 1967 to 27 years in 1987,
contributing to a decline in railways' efficiency.
4.07     There have been numerous innovations in railways in recent years
such as more fuel efficient locomotives, improved signalling systems,
integrated transport, specialized wagons, computer information systems,
marketing systems, etc. which also require that funds be invested in order
to reduce future operating costs and attract traffic for which railways have
a comparative advantage. Yugoslav railways will also need to provide
additional capacity to accommodate future traffic growth. This is
particularly true on the main trunk line, where several critical sections
are presently operating at capacity.
4.08     Finally, the marginal economic rates of return for railway
investments are similar to those for road investments. In particular, the
economic rates of return for evaluated investments under the project range
from 131 to 252, with the lowest returns being for track overhaul (13-191)
(see below). The economic rates of return for the Second Highway Sector
Project, which also finances a time slice of the 1986-90 Medium Term
Development Plan of four Republics/Provinces, range from 151 to 611. The
lowest returns are for construction of sections of the Trans-Yugoslav
Highway (151). Thls implies that the relative economic priority of the rail
and road investment programs are similar. The investment plan of the four
RTOs under the project is therefore considered to be reasonable.
(b) Proiect Assessment
4.09     The main project benefits derive from permitting Yugoslav railways
to perform its role in the transport market and to increase its operational
efficiency. The track overhaul of sections of the main trunk and other key
lines will increase operating speeds and reduce operating costs. The
construction of the Western Bypass and the modernization of signalling in
the main station in Zagreb will overcome a serious capacity constraint in
the Zagreb Junction. The construction of the second phase of the Belgrade
Junction will similarly rationalize the flow of freight and passenger trains
at that junction, in addition to releasing a valuable parcel of land for
other urban uses. The purchase of spare parts for locomotives will help
increase locomotive availability, reducing the need for future locomotive
purchases. The procurement of traction and modern rolling stock will help
make the railways more competitive, and reduce the uneconomic diversion of
bulk and other traffics to road transport. The acquisition of computer
systems is expected to reduce operating costs, as has already occurred in
other railway systems.

4.10     Of total project expenditures, about 6% is for ongoing investments
started under previous Bank projects for which the economic viability has
been previously established. A further 842 is supported by new feasibility
studies, which have been reviewed it. detail by Bank staff.  The remaining
10% include minor workshop improvements, technical studies and designs, and
numerous small investments which were not practical to evaluate separately.
These investments were reviewed by Bank staff from a technical point of view
and are considered reasonable.
4.1'     The major investment items subject to detailed appraisal, together
with their estimated economic rates of return, are listed in Table 14. The
rates of return calculated by the RTOs and their Institutes were adjusted to
reflect the traffic forecasts discussed above, a shadow exchange rate of
1.25 times the official exchange rate at end-1985 price levels, and other
factors which are described in the project file. The rates of return for
the evaluated items range from 132 to 251. Assuming that the economic
return for other investment items is at least 121, the economic return for
the project is estimated to be at least 171. The economic return for Bank
financed items is estimated to be 181. The first year return for all
evaluated items is expected to be greater than 101.
(c) Sensitivity Analysis
4.12     A sensitivity analysis of individual investments, involving an
increase in costs by 10% and a simultaneous decrease in benefits by 102,
indicates that their economic return would not fall below 10%. The traffic
forecasts are conservative and the risk that they will not be achieved is
considered to be relatively low. Considering the major categories of
projects in the Investment Plans, a large part is for procurement of
traction and rolling stock, for which the economic return is estimated on a
unit basis. The actual procurement of traction and rolling stock is
adjusted annually, so there is little risk that the economic return would be
lower should traffic growth fall below expectations. As project costs were
computed on the basis of the recent experience of the RTOs and as the
traffic projections used are conservative, it is not considered likely that
the estimated economic returns will fall outside the range indicated.
Moreover, in view of the rolling annual plan mechanism followed by the
Yugoslav railways, there is flexibility in adjusting projects on an ongoing
basis to changes in traffic levels or other conditions. Given the generally
high rate of return obtained for individual project items, and in view of
the considerable experience of Yugoslav railways in implementing similar
projects, the proposed investments are considered to be free from
significant economic risk.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Introduction
5.01     During the last six years inflation has accelerated in Yugoslavia,
rising from an annual rate of about 25% in 1982 to 2701 in 1988. To ensure
that the annual financial accounts more accurately reflect the enterprises'
real operating results and financial position, the Government has issued a



- 32 -
number of changes in the accounting regulations. These new regulations have
in effect replaced the historical accounting system of Yugoslavia with a
modified current cost accounting system. Fixed assets and inventories are
revalued regularly to reflect inflation in accordance with an index
published by the Government. Depreciation charges and material costs are
calculated in accordance with these revised values. Foreign loans are
automatically revalued in line with the devaluation of the Dinar.
Indexation of local loans did not commence until May 1988 and so the past
inflationary gains on these loans are not recognized in the accounts. In
addition, the gains or losses on net liquid assets are not recognised. The
effect of all these regulations is to set more stringent accounting
requirements for enterprises during a period of high inflation compared to
those normally required under historical accounting procedures.
5.02     The medium-term financial objective for the RTOs agreed under the
Sixth Railway Project in 1983 was the elimination of compensation payments
and the establishment of financial autonomy by 1990. This objective was to
be achieved through a combination of real tariff increases, improved
productivity and increased traffic.
B. Past Financial Performance
5.03     The actual Income Accounts, Cash Flow and Balance Sheets for RTOs
Belgrade, Ljubljana, Novi Sad, and Zagreb for the six years 1983 - 1988 are
shown in detail in Annex 4.  A summary of the Income Accounts is in Table
5.1.

The financial performance of the railways has been adversely affected by a
fall in traffic levels and the high level of inflation. Traffic units fell by
about 11% during the three years 1986-88. Tariffs were increased in line with
inflation plus the 61 per annum as required under the Sixth Railway Loan up to
April 1, 1988. These adjustments, however, have lagged behind in their
impact, as the increases were made about twice a year with the major part of
the increase coming late in the year. Partly as a result, the operating
ratios excluding compensation, which had fallen in 1984, increased in 1985
through 1988. The resulting shortfall in RTOs' revenue was made up in part
through increased compensation payments from the Republican/Provincial
Governments. Comparative operating ratios excluding compensation together
with the targets agreed under the Sixth Railway Project for RTOs Belgrade and
Novi Sad are shown below:

Total
The targets have not been met, except for the 1984 RTO Belgrade target, and
the ratios for all RTOs. except Novi Sad, have substantially deteriorated
between 1983 and 1988.
5.04     Revenue from tariffs per traffic unit in constant terms remained
static during the five years 1984-88. This compares to the 282 real increase
required under the Sixth Railway Project. To meet part of the shortfall in
revenue, average compensation payments increased by about 362 in constant
terms per traffic unit during the 1984-88 period. The compensation payments,
however, were unevenly distributed with RE Ljubljana receiving about 70% real
increase in 1988 compared to 1984 while Novi Sad received 202 less in real
terms. The overall result was a deficit of about Din 57.0 billion in 1988 or
4% of operating expenses. The deficit is in December 31, 1987 price levels.
5.05     Total operating expenses per traffic unit in constant terms increased
by about 201 during 1984-87. Expenditure increased in real terms under each
cost category with the exception of "Fuel and Power" which decreased by about
20% reflecting the world wide decrease in energy prices. "Salaries and Wages"
represent about 281 of working expenses which is very low for a European
railway. These labor charges together with depreciation charges increased
marginally in real terms. The major increases were for "Material and Other
Expens-e" which increased in real terms by about 20%. Charges associated with
the implementation of the new accounting procedures, such as charging material
from inventories at current cost, and writing-off of obsolete inventories



- 36 -
represent a substantial part of this cost increase, but real increases in
material and contract maintenance costs were also a factor. We are
encouraging the RTOs to review critically their contracts with third parties
to control these costs. Progress on this matter will be reviewed during
supervision. The level of interest in real terms remained constant except for
RTO Novi Sad where it increased fivefold, and partly reflected an increase in
borrowing.
5.06     Since 1984, rail traffic volume has been falling due to the
deterioration of the economy and very severe winters in 1984 and 1985. This
reduced traffic pattern coupled with a real increase in operating costs and a
less than projected increase in revenues in real terms has resulted in a
deterioration of the RTOs' financial position since 1983 instead of the
improvements projected under the Sixth Railway Project. To address this
problem agreement was reached with the RTOs at Negotiations to reduce staff
levels, increase productivity and equipment utilization over time (para.
3.31). In addition, agreement was reached during Negotiations that tariffs
will be adjusted quarterly to yield additional annual revenue from local
traffic in line with inflation and will further be increased by 6% in real
terms at the beginning of 1990 (para. 2.26).
C. Forecast Financial Performance
5.07     The forecast Income Accounts, Cash Flow and Balance Sheets for the
seven years 1989-95 are in Annex 4. A summary of the forecast Income Accounts
is shown in Table 5.3. With a major economic reform program presently
underway, it is difficult to predict the level of inflation within a
reasonable degree of accuracy during the next few years. The forecasts have
therefore been prepared in constant end December 1987 Dinars and converted to
US dollars at the December 31, 1987 exchange rate of Din 1,279 to the US
dollar. This is a satisfactory bases for projections under current conditions
in Yugoslavia (para. 5.13). A real positive interest rate of 5% per annum was
assumed for both local and foreign loans. Further details on the financial
assumptions are in Annex 4.

5.08     Due to inadequate tariff increases and delays in making these
adjustments during the first half of the year, the RTOs' poor financial
performance is projected to continue during 1989 with the average operating
ratio excluding compensation falling from 1442 in 1988 to 1311 in 1989. On
April 1, 1989, the average domestic tariff level was increased by 762 which
brings the tariff in line with the requirements under the Sixth Railway
Project including estimated inflation to March 31, 1989. To improve the
financial performance of the RTOs and to relieve the Communities of Interest
(COIs) of the burden of paying compensation as soon as possible, the
Government and the RTOs have indicated their intention to use their best
efforts to commence implementing the inflationary tariff adjustment outlined
in paragraph 2.26 on July 1, 1989. The financial projections are based on
implementing the revised tariff adjustment on this date.
5.09     With an adjustment in tariffs in line with inflation plus a 62 real
increase, a substantial improvement in the operating ratios excluding
compensation, is forecast for 1990 with the average operating ratio falling
from 1311 in 1989 to 1071 in 1990. The ratios range from a high of 1112 for
RTO Belgrade to a low of 1011 for RE Ljubljana. The major part of this
improvement is due to the indexation of tariffs during the year in line with
inflation. The operating ratios excluding compensation are projected to
gradually decrease over the next three years to an average ratio of 104% in
1992. The projected operating ratios are listed in Annex 4 bAd will be
monitored during supervision to evaluate progress in achieving financial
objectives. The operating ratios are forecast to continue falling after this,
reaching an average of about 981 in 1995 with a range of 1021 for RTO Belgrade
to 951 for RE Ljubljana. This improvement is due to an increase in
productivity combined with an increase in traffic. During Negotiations,
agreement was reached that the RTOs would maintain for each fiscal year after
1990 a ratio of total operating expenses to total operating revenue of not
higher than 981 for RE Ljubljana and 1101 for RTOs Belgrade, Novi Sad and
Zagreb. In calculating this ratio, specific subsidies based on agreements
with Republican/Provincial/City Governments to compensate RTOs for providing
social services (such as passenger discounts to students and pensioners),
subsidies for urban commuter services and for operation of low density lines
on behalf of local communities shall be treated as revenue. The Government
and RTOs have indicated they intend to make best efforts to reduce the level
of subsidies after 1990 through all appropriate measures including increased
productivity and service levels and increased adjustments in tariffs as
justified by competitive conditions.
5.10     With a high level of net internal cash generation (para. 5.12), no
major changes in the RTOs' debt equity ratios are forecast. The highest level
of 39:61 is forecast in 1993 for RTO Novi Sad but this is expected to drop
gradually to 36:64 by 1995. On the other hand, the debt equity ratio for RTO
Belgrade is projected to increase from 21:79 in 1989 rise to 25:75 in 1995.
The maximum levels reached by RE Ljubljana and RTE Zagreb are 30:70 and 26:74
respectively. All these debt equity ratios are satisfactory for railway
companies. The RTOs' debt service coverage levels are shown in Annex 4.
Except for RTO Belgrade, which has a projected debt service coverage of 1.6 in
1994, all the other RTOs' debt service coverage are in excess of 2.0 which is
very satisfactory. To ensure that the RTOs do not incur debt to an extent
where it might materially affect their ability to carry out their obligations



- 40 -
under the project, a maximum debt service ratio of 1.4 for borrowing other
than for project investment was agreed during Negotiations. In calculating
this ratio the real interest rate should be used instead of the usual nominal
interest rate. With the projected high debt service coverage and low debt
equity ratios, RTOs Ljubljana, Novi Sad and Zagreb would be able to borrow
additional funds to expand their investment program should traffic increase by
more than the conservative levels assumed in this report.
5.11     While the projected financial performance of RTO Belgrade is
satisfactory, it falls below the level of the other three RTOs in all areas.
A comparison of RTO Belgrade with RE Ljubljana shows differences in traffic
pattern, operating expenses and revenue. Passenger traffic units represent
about 35% of RTO Belgrade's traffic as compared to 281 for RE Ljubljana.
Passenger revenue, however, represents 13X of total revenue of RTO Belgrade
compared to 121 for RE Ljubljana. Working expenses in real terms per traffic
unit for RTO Belgrade are only about 70% of RE Ljubljana's expenses. While
these figures do not pinpoint the basic reason for the differences in
profitability, it is felt that RTO's Belgrade lower profitability is
associated with its higher proportion of passenger traffic particularly
suburban traffic.
D. Financing Plans 1989-91
5.12.    A summary of the Financing Plans for the four RTOs is shown in Table
5.4. The projected Operating Income before Depreciation of the four RTOs for
the three years 1989-91 is Din 1,123.1 billion (US$878 million). About 331 of
these funds is required to meet debt service payments. The Net Internal Cash
Generation of Din 686.3 billion represents 52% of the total financing
requirements and ranges from 46% in the case of RTO Belgrade to 571 for RTE
Zagreb. This level of net internal cash generation is satisfactory. Grants
from Republican/Provincial/City Governments provide Din 280.1 billion or 211
of requirements. Part of these grants are paid to the RTOs as a contribution
towards the cost of works requested by the donor. An example of this is the
Belgrade Junction which will make available to the City urban land for
housing.   The balance of the grants is provided as a contribution towards the
RTOs' infrastructure costs. The proposed IBRD Loan of US$138 million together
with US$7 million from the existing Bank Loan (Sixth Railway Project, Loan
2336-YU) will provide 141 (Din 185.9 billion) of the funds or about 361 of the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the project of US$401 million. Other
foreign currency loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB, US$80 million),
Eurofima (the European rolling stock financing cooperative, US$44 million ),
the Soviet Union and suppliers credits will provide US$136 million (Din 173.2
billion), equivalent to 131 of requirements or 34% of the foreign exehange
costs. The Govertnment and CYR, with Bank assistance, have completed
negotiations with EIB and Eurofima for their respective loans. The balance of
foreign exchange costs of US$120 million (301) must be met from local funds.
This amount is in line with the estimated indirect foreign exchange cost of
about US$128 million. The summary of the Financing Plans totalling Din
1,331.1 billion will cover the project costs of Din 1,071.3 billion (801), an
increase in working capital of Din 159.7 billion (121) and other investments
not included in the project of bin 100 billion (81) to be undertaken by RTE
Zagreb. This covers future investments mainly in track renewals and traction
and rolling stock which have not been fully identified at present. Financing
plans for each RTO have been drawn up with the COI and Republican or



- 41 -
Provincial Government and approved by appropriate authorities (RTOs and
Workers' Councils). Republican/Provincial Governments' funds have been
secured through 1990. Failure to mobilize the additional required
Republican/Provincial and City funds and EIB and Eurofima loans (which are not
immediately required) by an agreed schedule would give rise to Bank remedies.

5.13     The Financing Plans are based on 1987 constant Dinars which forms a
satisfactory basis for planning to ensure that the RTOs can secure adequate
funds to meet future investment i:- uirements under the present high
inflationary conditions. Provision has been made to ensure that current
revenues will increase in line (para. 2.26). Cash operating expenses should
increase in line with inflation and as Yugoslav law requires that fixed
assets be revalued annually, depreciation should also increase in line with
inflation. Interest and repayments on loans denominated in foreign currency
are assumed to vary automatically wit:h inflation. As domestic loans will be
indexed, the principal will increase automatically with inflation. The
indexation of local loans eliminates the cash flow problem associated with
very high nominal interest rates in conjunction with very high levels of
inflation which in the past have transformed long-term loan into short-term
loans.
E. Proiect Risks
5.14     While Government and railways management are committed to reforming
Yugoslav railways, implementation may prove difficult. In particular, there
are three project risks which are significant. First, the
Government/Communities of Interest might delay railway tariff increases or
fail to provide counterpart funds or compensation in a period of rapid



- 42 -
inflation, which would result in operating losses and a shortage of local
funds for investments. Second, traffic demand might stagnate or decrease
rather than slowly increase as forecast if the Yugoslav economy deteriorates
due to lack of appropriate adjustment policies. Third, operating costs may
remain high if railways do not implement their action plans satisfactorily,
in particular if they do not reduce their staff by about 22 p.a. In spite
of significant risks, we feel it is reasonable to propose these loans
because of the Government's commitment to economic reform as demonstrated by
the recent constitutional and ordinary law changes, and Yugoslav railways'
preparation of and commitment to a "Business Plan" which is a de facto
reform program for railways.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During Negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal matters:
(a)    the RTOs will reduce their staff by 2% p.a. (1.52 p.a. in
the case of Ljubljana) from 1989 through 1993 based on the
number of actual staff as of December 31, 1988 (para. 2.10);
(b)    the RTOs will close 168 freight services and stations (para.
2.21);
(c)    the RTOs will introduce a computer-based monitoring system
for spare parts management (para. 2.22);
(d)    passenger unit price level relative to freight unit price
level will not decrease (para. 2.24);
(e)    CYR and the RTOs will (i) increase tariffs each year from
October, 1989 by the increase in Producer Price Index;
(ii) implement this inflation increase by adjusting tariffs
four times per year on the first day of each quarter, and
(iii) further increase tariffs by 67 in real terms in 1990
(para. 2.26);
(f)    CYR will have its accounts audited annually by independent
auditors to the extent necessary to satisfy the auditors of
the accuracy of amounts commonly generated and allocated by
CYR to RTOs (para. 2.29);
(g)    the RTOs will implement their Investment Plans for the
project and will prepare and furnish to the Bank annually
from 1989 through 1991 updated Investment Plans and
Financing Plans which shall be carried 3ut as agreed between
the Bank and the RTOs. The RTOs will consult with the Bank,
before introducing any increase of 52 or more of a given
year's planned investments (paras. 3.05);
(h)    CYR will be responsible for processing disbursement requests
on behalf of each RTO under the proposed project
(para. 3.27);
(i)    the RTOs will implement the Project Action Plan and will
take all action necessary to achieve their annual
operational targets (para. 3.31);
(j)    the RTOs will revise their Operational Plans for Traction
and Rolling Stock each year from 1989 through 1991 (para.
3.32);



- 43 -
(k)    the RTOs will achieve an annual average operating ratio of
not greater than 982 for Ljubljana and 110% for Belgrade,
Novi Sad and Zagreb from 1991 onwards. In calculating this
ratio, specific subsidies based on agreements with
Republican/Provincial/City Governments to compensate RTOs
for providing social services (such as passenger discounts
to students and pensioners), subsidies for urban commuter
services and for the operation of low density lines on
behalf of local communities shall be treated as revenue
(para. 5.09); and
(1)    the RTOs will not incur debt except for the Project beyond a
debt service ratio of 1.4 without consulting the Bank
(para. 5.10).
6.02     Receipt of certified audit reports, satisfactory to the Bank, from
each of the four RTOs for 1988 would be a condition of effectiveness of that
RTO's loan agreement (para. 2.29).
6.03     Based on the above agreements, the project is suitable for four
Bank loans aggregating US$138 million for a period of 15 years including
five years of grace.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Transportation Proiects Previously Financed by the Bank
Previous Prolects
1.       The Bank has lent US$1,417.1 million to the transport sector to
date, including US$491.2 million for seven railway projects, US$818.4
million for thirteen highway projects, US$424 million for the Bar Port
Project, and US$65.1 million for earthquake rehabilitation assistance for
restoring damaged roads, railways and a port is Montenegro. In addition,
the Bank has loaned US$108 million for two pipeline projects.
Railways
2.       The First Railway Loan was made in 1963 (Loan 316-YU, US$35
million) to finance the conversion of the 195 km Sarajevo-Ploce line to
standard gauge, with electric traction and modern signalling and
teleconmunications. The project was substantially completed and put into
operation in 1970, with a delay of four years.
3.       The Second Railway Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in
1964 to help finance the modernization of 1,509 km of main lines traversing
Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border. It
includes electrification, signalling, telecommunications, and the
improvement of six key marshalling yards. This project ran into major
difficulties because after the 1965 political and economic reforms the
railways' internal funds fell substantially below expectations, and also
because of deficiencies in project planning and preparation which resulted
in an underestimate of quantities and of time needed for completion of such
an extensive project. With hindsight, this was too ambitious a project in
relation to the railways' resources. The Bank loan was fully disbursed in
1972. The project was refinanced from the fourth railway loan and was
completed in 1981 at a total cost of about US$410 million, over twice the
original cost estimate.
4.       The Third Railway Loan made in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million)
helped to finance construction of 370 km of the Belgrade-Bar line, with
electrification, signalling and telecommunications for the entire 475-km
line. This was a project of great technical complexity involving the
construction of over 300 tunnels and several major bridges. The civil
works were satisfactorily constructed by local contractors. Completion was
originally scheduled for 1973, but geotechnical and other construction
difficulties delayed the opening of the line till 1976, and the project was
completed in 1978. Technical problems and inflation aggravated by delays
raised the cost of the project into US$422 million.

5.       Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement
with the Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the
railways with the assistance of consultants. This prepared the ground for
the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU, US$93 million), agreed in 1974,
under which the Bank's loan was allocated to the completion of the 1964
Modernization Program and to "Related Investments" needed to maximize its
benefits, all to be completed by the end of 1976. However, in contrast
with earlier projects which consisted only of investments to which the Bank
loan had been allocated, the fourth project was defined as the totality of
the railways' investments in 1974-76, whose cost was estimated at US$1,138
million. The Bank loan thus amounted to about 121 of the cost of the
project. Agreement was reached on measures to help overcome the railways'
financial problems, principally through tariff increases. An important
feature of the project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans
which, given Yugoslavia's decentralized system, were designed to contribute
to a cobmon understanding of objectives and responsibility by all
concerned. Only about two-thirds of project investments were executed
under the project; however, they were reasonably balanced to maximize
system effects, and the remainder were included in the 1976-80 Investment
Plan. Execution of Bank-financed "Related Investments" was substantially
better (about three quarters). Except for the section from Skopje to
Gevgelia on the greek border, the electrification of the main line
traversing Yugoslavia was completed under the 1964 Modernization Program.
Works were completed satisfactorily and the loan was closed in 1981.
7.       The Fifth Railway Loan (Loan 1534-YU, US$100 million) was made in
1978. The project consists of a three-year (1978-80) portion of the eight
railways' investment plans. Its principal objective was to further improve
the efficiency and the competitive position of the railways though 1,285 km
of track overhaul or reconstruction, 93 km of route conversion from single
to double track, electrification of 314 km, equipping of 53 km with modern
signalling, installation of automatic block on 434 km, technical assistance
and staff training. Ninety percent of the project was completed on
schedule, and the economic return was re-estimated to be 181 against 152
estimated at appraisal. Tariff covenants were not fully complied with due
to unexpected inflation, but this situation improved under the Sixth
Railway Project. CYR was successfully strengthened under the project.
8.       The Kosovo Railways Project (Loan 1977-YU, US$34 million) was made
in 1981. The Project includes reconstrucion of the Kosovo Junction,
signalling and telecommunications improvements, procurement of rolling
stock, and training and technical assistance to improve management and
freight operations. The project is expected to be completed two years
behind schedule irt early 1987, due primarily to managerial inefficiencies
including procurement delays.  The economic return is expected to be lower
than estimated at appraisal, but still greater than 101, due to a shortfall
in traffic. US$2.9 million in project funds were cancelled due to
appreciation of the US dollar. The project was closed in December 1986.

9.       The Sixth Railway Project (Loan 2336-YU, US$110 million) was made
in 1983. The project consists of a four year time slice (1983-86) of four
RTOs investment plans, including the overhaul of 545 km of track,
sOgnalling and telecommuinications on about 320 km of line, electrification
of the Bosanski-Novi Knin line, spare parts for locomotives, and technical
assistance and training. Project effectiveness was delayed by one year due
to delays in increasing tariffs, but the project is now proceeding on
schedule and within the cost estimate. The RTOs have complied with the
tariff covenant since effectiveness, leading to a reduction on compensation
payments by the Republics/Provinces. The project is expected to be
completed in 1988.
Highway Proiects
10.      The First Hlighway Project (Loan 344-YU), US$35 million) in 1963
financed the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway
(422 km) and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road (174 km).  The Second Highway
Project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the
improvement of 367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via
Sarajevo and Tuzla with the Adriatic highway. Both projects were completed
within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Third
Highway Project (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million), financed in 1969, comprised
about 120 km of roads in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, and was completed
in August 1974 with a 20-month delay, primarily due to delays in completing
an access road. This project had an 82 cost overrun because of inflation
and foreign exchange adjustments. The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 678-YU,
US$40 million) was financed in 1970 for the construction of about 220 km of
roads in Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Vojvodina.
Because of expropriation prob.ems in the section of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
project was completed in December 1975 with an 18-month delay. There was a
122 cost overrun due to inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The
Fifth Highway Project (Loan 751-YU, US$35 million) became effective 8
months late in 1973 due to Government administrative delays. The project
comprised 153 km of roads in Kosovo, Macedonia and Slovenia, procurement of
US$1.7 million worth of engineering equipment, consultant's services and a
staff training component to improve highway planning and project
preparation. The engineering equipment has been delivered and the
consultant's services were completed satisfactorily. The staff training
component was delayed because of difficulties encountered in securing
training of candidates in the head office of foreign consultants and in
foreign institutes and because of language problems (insufficient
candidates proficient in English). Consequently, a restricted program was
adopted. Because of the delay in training, the project was completed by
the end of 1977, involving a delay of about 15 months. This project had an
8% cost overrun because of the combined effect of inflation and foreign
adjustments.
11.      The loan for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 990-YU,
US$30 million) was made in 1974. The project financed six road sections in
Bosnia-Herzegovina totalling 150 km, the training of transportation



- 50 -
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 6
economists and road engineers, and US$1.1 million worth of engineering and
laboratory equipment. The loan for the Seventh Highway Project
(Loan 1143-YU, US$40 million) was made in 1975. The project comprised
about 90 km of road construction in Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, and
US$0.1 million worth of technical assistance to improve preparation of
highway feasibility studies and to provide a related training program. The
project was completed by the end of 1979. The Eighth Highway Project
(Loan 1377-YU, US$56 million) was made in 1977. The project comprised
about 130 km of roads in Serbia, Bosnia-Rerzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo,
studies by consultants of road user charges and rail costs and technical
assistance for the preparation of a highway master plan for Kosovo. The
road works were completed and the loan closed in 1981. Both the Seventh
and Eighth Highway Projects focused on improving section of the
Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH), which was to become the primary objective of
later projects, while at the same time promoting regional development by
improving selected regional roads in lesser-developed areas. The Ninth
Highway Project (Loan 1535-YU, US$80 million) was made in 1978. The
project comprised construction of four highly congested sections of TYR in
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, totalling about 86 km, and the procurement of
equipment for maintenance and for monitoring loadings of vehicles using the
primary highway network, including TYR. All road works were completed by
January 1982 and the final delivery of highway maintenance equipment and
weighing scales was made in December 1982.
12.      The loan for the Tenth Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU,
US$148 million) was made in April 1979 and became effective in
August 1979. It comprised the first phase (a three-year tranche from
mid-1979 to mid-1982) of the 1979-85 highway sector programs of five
participating Republics and Provinces. Although progress was variable
among the borrowers, most construction contracts suffered delays of one to
two years due to a shortage of local funds. Construction was essentially
completed by mid-1984, but tae loan closing date was postponed to
June 30, 1985, to allow for completion of the training component and
procurement of equipment. The project also included an updating of the
Road User Charges Study, financed under the Eighth Highway Proje.t.
The loan for the Eleventh Highway project (Loan 1819-YU, US$125 million)
was made in April 1980 and became effective ln August 1980. It comprises
construction of six sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) with
controlled access facility in four Republics and Provinces, totalling about
164 km, and the procurement of highway maintenance and road monitoring
equipment, technical assistance, a highway safety program and the
preparation of a Toll Study. Although execution was delayed by up to two
years because of the shortage of local funds, most construction items were
completed by the revised loan closing date of June 30, 1985. The tenth and
Eleventh Highway Projects were both implemented during a period of economic
difficulty and budgetary reductions. Because of the severe shortage of
local funds, both the Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were included
under the Bank's Special Action Program in mid-1983. The investment plans



- 51 -
ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 6
were revised, and the projects were then implemented as planned, albeit
with a two year delay. Re-estimated economic returns for both projects
were satisfactory. Several institutional improvements were incorporated in
the project including the creation of FARP, the carrying out of a road user
charges study, and training.
13.      The Hiehway Sector Project (Loan 2715-YU, US$121.5 million) was
made in 1986. The project finances a time slice of the road
investment/maintenance program of four Republics with the emphasis on
removal of bottlenecks, rehabilitation, and completion of the basic
network. The project emphasizes investment planning, a systematic approach
to road maintenance operations, sound financial planning under conditions
of budgetary constraint, and strengthening of the new coordinating body for
roads (FARP). Project preparation was delayed due to slowness in reaching
agreement on the Republics to be included in the project and the
composition of investment plans, and delays in adjusting road user
charges. Following negotiations, project signature was delayed about six
months due to Government delays in providing bank guarantees to the
borrowers. Following substantial inereases in road user charges in 1986,
the project was signed in February 1987.
14.      The Second Hishway Sector Proiect (Loan 2878-YU, US$68 million)
was approved by the Board on October 13, 1987, but is not yet signed due to
the delays of one Republic in guaranteeing the loan. The project finances
a time slice of the investment/maintenance programme of the four
Republics/Provinces not covered under the First Highway Sector Project, so
that nationwide coverage is provided between the two projects. The project
also emphasizes investment planning, a systematic approach to road
maintenance operations, sound financial planning under conditions of
budgetary constraint, and strengthening the role of FARP.
Port of Bar Proiect
15.      The loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in 1974 to finance
port development and related railway facilities. All works have been
completed and the loan was closed in 1981 and US$1.6 million was cancelled
from the Bank loan. The PCR indicated that despite the delays in the
development of traffic following the 1979 earthquake, the project
represents a significant contribution to the economic development of
southern and eastern Yugoslavia. However, the port is somewhat
over-designed for present traffic levels and as a result the economic
returr is marginal.
Earthquake Rehabilitation (Transport Facilities)
16.      The Montenegro Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Roads
(Loan 1759-YU, US$21 million) was made in 1979. The project was
satisfactorily completed on schedule at the end of 1982. The Montenegro

ANNEX 2
Page 6 of 6
Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Ports (Loan 1768-YU, US$50
million) was made in 1979, and the final equipment deliveries were made in
1984. US$19.9 million were cancelled from the loan due to appreciation of
the US dollar. The NMbtenegro Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake
Damage, Railways (Loan 1769-YU, US$14 million) was also made in 1979. It
comprised repair and restoration of railway facilities damaged by the
earthquake and the expansion of railway yards at Bar and Titograd. Project
completion was delayed due to the fact that much more time than anticipated
has been necessary for design and geological works, while the need for work
under traffic has also hampered progress. The project was completed by the
end of 1984, and a remaining balance of US$0.04 million was cancelled.

YUGOSLAVIA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Tariffs and ComDensation
1.       Prior to 1988 railway tariffs were approved by the Federal
Governmment on the recommendation of the Federal Institute for Prices.
Decisions were made on the basis of macroeconomic and social judgments and
not solely on factual information about the costs of providing services.
The Federal Committee for Transport and Communications and the Community of
Yugoslav Railways (CYR) played an important advisory role in preparing the
Social Compacts or agreements which set railway prices. These administered
prices adjusted standard rail tariffs to serve a number of purposes,
e.g. (i) by lowering rates to aid certain regions, industries or classes of
travellers; (ii) converting actual kilometer distances into "commercial
kilometers" for charging purposes in order to give more average revenue per
ton-km or passenger-km to the smaller, less efficient RTOs and to reflect
their different cost and traffic conditions; (iii) reducing rates on
exports that have a high local labour, materials and technology content and
to encourage transit traffic (forms of export subsidy).
2.       The RTOs were compensated for revenues foregone as a result of
such pricing decisions and provided with funds to meet part of their
infrastructure maintenance and renewal costs by a self-determined levy on
the incomes of those who were members of the Community of Interest (COI).
The so-called compensation payments formed a contracted obligation and were
forecasted for three to five years ahead, subject to annual review in the
light of cost and traffic experience. The rate of levy adopted varied from
Republic to Republic. In Slovenia, for example, it was 3.62 of incomel'
on 'small' railway user enterprises and 1.5S on 'big' railway user
enterprises--this may not necessarily has been a subsidy because of
differences in the costs involved in providing service. In Croatia, by
contrast, there was a multitude of rates ranging from around 0.62 to 5.8%
on the industrial and other economic activites in the Republic, including
the RTO itself as well as other transport modes since they may also use
rail transport as part of their activities. In Serbia the Community of
Interest was abolished in 1986 and compensation payments are now made from
the Republican budget.
1/ The income statements of the RTOs and other enterprises in Yugoslavia
are constructed in ways that differ from those in non-Socialist
societies.



- 54 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
3.       The compensation payments were an effort to devise a formula that
will serve three purposes. First, to avoid protracted annual disputes
between the railways, users and Government authorities about the level of
subsidy to be paid-as happens in some countries-by having a simple,
agreed formula. Second, to facilitate financial planning by the railways
and COI members by giving railway management some degree of certainty about
future income and the members about future commitments. And, third, to
induce some sense of efficiency and service to the public in railway
mangement. In return for the compensation subsidy, the railways are
expected to meet agreed productivity and service level standards
(e.g. on-time running of trains or the numbers of wagons available daily)
and if these are not achieved or traffic is below expected, compensation is
reduced.
4.       In 1988, a review of the railway tariff adjustment method was
undertaken and recomuendations were made to adjust tariffs on the basis of
'common elements".  The three "common elements" used were (i) average CYR
expenditure increases based on uniform standards; (ii) relationship of
rail tariffs with world tariffs; and (iii).relationship of rail tariffs
with tariffs of other Yugoslav tiansport modes. The tariff level which
resulted from this study's recommendation would have involved an increase
in passenger tariffs of about 2402 and freight tariffs of 1501. As such a
high increase was not economically viable, it was decided to increase rail
tariff to the level of road tariffs over a period of 18-months. To
compensate the RTOs for the difference between the revenue generated by
this tariff and the revenue generated by the "common elements" tariff it
was decided to pay compensation. This compensation to be financed as
previously by the levy in the COI. To adjust rail tariffs to the level of
road tariff involved a real increase of 602 and 971 respectively in
passenger and freight tariffs over a period of eighteen months.
5.       The revised "common elements" tariff adjustment method was
approved by the Government in August 1988 and was used to calculate the
second and third quarters tariff adjustments for 1988. However, the
proposed tariff adju.ted for the January 1989 quarter was substantially
reduced by the Government. A new study group was established and is
developing a modified system based on "common criteria". The tariff
adjustment implemented on April 1, 1989 of 761 was in line with the Bank's
requirement under the Sixth Railway Project.
6.       Under the previous loan, it was agreed that tariffs should be
increased in real terms by 6% per annum with a view to eliminating
compensation. Due to the high level of inflation and the delays in
adjusting tariffs, the initial progress in reducing the percentages
compensation was lost and compensation increased again in 1987. Details of
the actual and projected compensation are shown in Table 1.

SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Details of Financial Evaluation
Main Ass_ptions
General
1.       Inflation in Yugoslavia has been accelerating during the past five
years reaching a level of 274S in 1988. With a reform program presently under
preparation it is difficult to predict the level of inflation to a reasonable
degree of accuracy during the next few years. To overcome this problem it was
decided to use the Dinar price level of December 31, 1987 as a constant in the
preparation of financial forecasts. Dinars are converted to US dollars based
on the exchangS"rate of Din 1,279 - US$1.00 ruling at close of business on
December 31, 1987. The Income Statement for 1988 was converted to December
31, 1987 price levels quarter by quarter using a separate inflation level for
each quarter.
Traffic Forecasts
2.       The freight and passenger forecasts discussed in Chapter IV and shown
in detail in Table 13 were used.
Tariffs
3.       The tariffs used in the forecasts were in accordance with the tariff
requirement outlined in paragraph 2.26. A reduction of 182 was made in the
1989 revenue to allow for delays in implementing the tariff increase that
year. The full inflationary tariff adjustment will be in force from 1990
onwards.
Compensation
4.       Compensation from Republican/Provincial Governments for loss of
revenue due to subsidized services was originally projected by the RTO. The
amounts estimated for 1989 were increased to cover the 18% fall in revenue due
to delays in implementing tariff increases that year. The original
compensation estimate for later years were adjusted as necessary to maintain
the RTO's cash at a reasonable level.

OperatingJt Eenses
5.       These expenses were forecast to be marginally reduced each year to
allow for the effects of the RTOs' programs to increase productivity. Fuel
and power costs were increased in line with the projected future growth in
traffic.
Depr6ciation
6.       The following weighted average depreciation rates, reflecting the
asset composition of the RTOs, were used:
Belgrade     3.81
Ljubljana    4.252
Novi Sad     4.02
Zagreb       4.41
In calculating the depreciation charge, a deduction of 32 per annum compounded
was made from gross fixed assets to allow for obsolete and retired asset. The
substantial increase in depreciation charges in 1989 for some RTOs resulted
from the application of increased group depreciation rates that year compared
with 1988.
Interest
7.       A real interest rate of 52 per annum was charged on local and foreign
loans.
