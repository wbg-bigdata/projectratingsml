1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Sector background and government strategy. At the time of Project preparation
in the late 1990s, Panama’s income inequality was among the highest in the world, and
the distribution of land holdings was one of the most skewed in the region. Panama’s
poverty rate was estimated at 37 percent of the population; 21.6 percent of the population
was extremely poor. 1 In 1999, the poor, who accounted for two-thirds of the rural
population, owned only one-third of the land. In addition, only one-third of all owned
agricultural land was fully titled, 84 percent of which was owned by non-poor. Land
administration services in both rural and urban areas were under-funded, bureaucratic,
and fragmented. In addition, registration, titling, cadastre, and information systems were
poorly integrated and outdated. This situation was made more difficult by the existence of
complicated land adjudication and titling procedures, as well as uneven and outdated land
taxation values.

2.     Initial discussions between the Government of Panama (GOP) and the Bank
regarding land administration issues began during the preparation of the Rural Poverty
and Natural Resources Project in 1996. Security of land tenure and efficient land
administration services were identified as important aspects of poverty alleviation and
sustainable use of natural resources and were placed by the GOP among the central
elements of its Poverty Reduction Strategy (Nuevo Enfoque Estratégico Frente a la
Pobreza, 1998).

3.      The country further recognized the need for a holistic approach to land
administration, one that would cover all types of lands and tenure regimes, including
protected areas and Indigenous People’s territories. At the time of Project preparation,
over half of the forests in Panama had disappeared and 25 percent of the land was
considered either degraded or in the process of rapid degradation. In addition, 88 percent
of Indigenous People, which according to the 1990 census totaled approximately 200,000,
were extremely poor, and one-half of indigenous children were malnourished.

4.      The National Land Administration Program (Programa Nacional de
Administración de Tierras, PRONAT), officially launched in 2001, was conceived as an
ambitious program to address long-term and far-reaching legal, institutional, and
technological reforms needed to regularize land tenure country-wide, resolve land
conflicts, facilitate access to land by the poor, reduce land transaction costs, and increase
the transparency of land administration services.

5.    PRONAT (the “Program?) was to be financed concurrently by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank. The World Bank and the IDB operations

                                             1
were conceived as two separate, but complementary, projects. 2 This World Bank-
financed Land Administration Project (the “Project?) was to create and establish the
framework for the national Program, strengthen the institutions, develop the
methodology, address critical policy and regulatory reforms, and implement a systematic
regularization process in selected Provinces. As such, it was to provide the framework
and the unified methods for IDB or other subsequent operations. In addition, the World
Bank-financed Project was to embrace support for the strengthening and consolidation of
the National System of Protected Areas (SINAP), though nation-wide identification,
delineation and demarcation of protected areas, as well as support for actions to improve
Indigenous Peoples’ access to land and other natural resources while promoting their
participation in the process of recognition of rights and demarcation of lands. The IDB
project was to focus on the Provinces where regularization activities were currently
underway, with a possibility to expand to new areas in the future.

6.       Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank was well positioned to assist the GOP
in addressing the land sector challenges, given its broad experience in land administration
reform programs worldwide. The Bank was also a pioneer in supporting projects with
area-based cadastre and registry components, as reflected in land-related projects in
Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala. As such, the Project, like similar projects
in other countries in the region, was one where technical inputs were necessary but not
sufficient to meet the stated objectives, given the complex political and socio-economic
conditions surrounding this issue in the country. From the Project’s inception, the Bank
was aware that this posed challenges for Project implementation, particularly as it related
to law-making and interactions with critical stakeholders. Despite these challenges, the
Bank considered that supporting the reforms proposed through PRONAT was a
worthwhile development endeavor. In particular, unlike other donors, the Bank was
willing to take on the risks involved in the consolidation of Indigenous Peoples
territories, and play a leadership role in pursuing support for the regularization of their
land rights.

7.     Country Partnership Strategy. The Project was consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed on November 19, 1998, which supported strategies
to reduce poverty and inequality in Panama and pointed out that sustainable development
was constrained by: (a) distortions in land markets; (b) the lack of property titles; (c) the
extreme concentration of land ownership; (d) an inappropriate property tax regime; (e)
non-sustainable use and degradation of natural resources; and (f) ethnic disparities. To

  The IDB engaged through two loans totaling almost US$60 million supporting: (i) the Land
Administration and Regularization Project (signed in March 2003); and later (ii) the Metropolitan Region
Cadastre and Land Administration Modernization Program (signed in October 2007). Although there was
some overlap between the IDB and Bank projects (for example, one of the main products of the Bank-
financed project—the SIICAR system—was considered as a counterpart contribution under the IDB
project), the IDB-financed project had different components and objectives (i.e., it focused more on
municipal development and land markets). Further, while not formally supporting PRONAT, the Danish
Development Cooperation (DANIDA) provided analytical and technical support to land regularization
efforts for Indigenous Peoples by supporting the Dobbo Yala Foundation, a nongovernmental indigenous
organization.

address these constraints, the CAS gave priority to the reform of land administration and
land tenure systems.

8.    The Project was appraised in November 2000, approved on January 16, 2001 and
became effective on July 19, 2001. It was implemented for nine years, closing on June 30,
2010.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The original Project Development Objectives were: (a) to promote equitable
access to land and improve land tenure security by providing land administration services
in selected rural, peri-urban, and urban areas; and (b) to enhance natural resources
conservation through the consolidation of SINAP and Indigenous Peoples Territories.

10.     Land administration covered a range of land regularization activities, including
legal rights recognition, titling, conflict resolution, legal cadastre and registry. The
consolidation of SINAP and indigenous territories included mapping, field demarcation,
buffer zone limits, determination of their legal status; and land management plans in
selected areas through local and participatory consultation processes.

11.       The original key performance indicators were:

         The National Geodetic Network established and updated nationwide;
         1,080,486 ha of land regularized;
         75,000 properties incorporated into the cadastre and regularized in rural areas;
         80,000 properties incorporated into the cadastre and regularized in urban areas
          (ejidos municipales);
         45,000 properties incorporated into the cadastre and regularized in urban areas
          (big cities);
         40,000 titles issued in rural areas;
         40,000 titles issues in urban areas;
         Demarcation of priority protected areas (approximately 600,000 hectares); and
         Demarcation of two established Comarcas3 (Ngöbe-Buglé and Kuna Yala) and of
          the indigenous territory of the Teribe-Naso.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

12.     Due to significant implementation delays, which led to the unsatisfactory rating
with respect to development objectives (described in Section 2.2 below), the Project was
restructured in 2006. The overall goals of the Project remained the same, but
simplification and better monitoring of indicators were needed. As part of the

 In Panama the term Comarca refers to an administrative division for an indigenous population created by
a specific law. There are five such regimes in the country: Kuna Yala (1938), Emberá-Wounan (1983),
Madungandi (1996), Ngöbe-Buglé (1997) and Wargandi (2000).


                                                   3
restructuring, the two PDO objectives were simplified into a single objective. The revised
PDO thus became: To modernize the land administration system, including priority
protected areas and indigenous territories.

13.     In the original design broad and un-quantified outcome indicators were mixed
with output indicators. The revised outcome indicators better measured the efficiency and
public benefit of a modernized land administration system in Panama. In the 2006
restructuring, the PDO indicators were thus revised as follows:

      Twenty-four hours and US$2 per transaction required for titling and registering a
       land parcel;
      Seventy percent of users of the Integrated Cadastre and Registry System
       (SIICAR) satisfied;
      Existing land occupation in five protected areas regularized; and
      Shared-administration plan implemented in the Ngöbe-Buglé area.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     The Project aimed to promote more equitable land access and property rights
regularization, with emphasis on rural areas, in particular for poor populations, peasant
farmers, rural tenants, Indigenous Peoples and women. However, it was expected that the
Project would also benefit urban and peri-urban dwellers (provincial capitals and ejidos
municipales) where poor households would be given a priority. Most of the population
targeted within the Project area was poor, and was expected to benefit from the increased
security of land tenure that directly and indirectly benefits small producers in the
agriculture sector, land owners in the peri-urban and urban areas, and Indigenous Peoples.
An estimated 200,000 rural and urban properties were covered by the Project area.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1 – Land Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework (US$17.20 million, or
23.7 percent of original total Project cost)

15.     This component aimed at providing the policy, legal and institutional framework,
as well as the capacity needed by the Project to deliver land administration services. The
Project envisaged actions on three specific sets of activities: (a) introducing a series of
land policy, legal/regulatory, and institutional reforms to simplify land titling, enable land
sales and rentals, consolidate protected areas and indigenous territories, and serve as a
basis for land valuation and taxation; (b) establishing inter-institutional co-management
mechanisms at the national and local level; and (c) building capacity in local level NGOs
and municipalities.




                                              4
Component 2 - Land Regularization Services (US$45.77 million, 63.3 percent of total
cost)

16.      This component aimed at activities required for the massive land regularization
process in Project areas. Three sets of activities were envisaged: (a) modernizing the
geodetic network and generating maps and satellite images to identify parcels in rural and
urban areas for regularization, and for demarcation of protected areas and indigenous
territories; (b) carrying out cadastral surveys to ground truth the satellite imagery, resolve
issues relating to property rights, and issue titles; and developing an integrated
information system (SIICAR) and updating it with cadastral survey data; and (c)
establishing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.

Component 3 - Consolidation of Protected Areas and Indigenous Territories (US$8.92
million, 12.3 percent of total cost)

17.     This component aimed at: (a) the consolidation of SINAP; (b) the establishment
and consolidation of protected areas within SINAP; and (c) the establishment and
consolidation of indigenous territories, including support for the preparation of the draft
law and charter required to establish and legally recognize the Naso Teribe Region, the
updating of the charters of selected Comarcas and the demarcation of selected Indigenous
Peoples’ territories. It also provided for technical and baseline studies, technical
assistance for conflict resolution in indigenous territories, public information and
promotion campaigns and strengthening of indigenous organizations and indigenous
authorities.

18.   The original total Project cost was US$72.36 million, with an IBRD loan amount
of US$47.9 million.

19.      Implementation arrangements. Although primary responsibility for Project
implementation fell under the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, as a national
program, the Project was implemented by multiple agencies: the National Directorate of
Agrarian Reform (DINRA), the Public Registry, the National Directorate of Cadastre and
Patrimonial Assets (DNCBP), the National Environmental Agency (ANAM), the
National Directorate of Indigenous Affairs (DNPI); the National Geographic Institute
(IGN), and the National Directorate of Local Governments (DNGL). Following Project
restructuring in 2006, the Ministry of Housing was included as co-executing agency.
Interagency coordination was promoted at the national level by two structures created
specifically for the Project: the Superior Council (SC) for Land Administration and the
Technical Operational Committee (TCO), respectively responsible for the policy and
technical regulatory frameworks needed for Project implementation. All these entities
were supported by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), under the Ministry of the
Economy and Finance, responsible for the day-to-day management of Project activities,
coordination, financial transactions, procurement, and operational reporting to the Bank.
At the same time, the PCU served as the main vehicle for coordinating Bank Project
activities with those of the IDB project, also part of PRONAT.




                                              5
1.6 Revised Components

20.     Following a comprehensive Mid-Term Review in 2004, the Government
requested a restructuring of the Project in 2006. The PDO was simplified into a single
objective, as noted above. The substantive aspects of the three original components were
maintained, but their scope and targets were revised to better reflect the PDO and were
consequently reduced by 20 to 30 percent. As noted in Section 1.3 above, outcome
indicators were revised to better measure the efficiency and public benefit of a
modernized land administration system in Panama. In addition, a new component to
provide for separate quality control and monitoring activities (Component 4: Project
Administration and Monitoring) was added. As a result of the reduced scope of the
operation, the total cost of the Project was also reduced by about 20 percent, for a new
total cost of US$58.57 million. Due to the new financing parameters approved by the
Bank’s Board for Panama on December 20, 2004, the Government’s counterpart
contribution was reduced. All expenditure categories were to be financed up to 100
percent by Loan proceeds, except for operating costs which would be at 90 percent. The
reduction of Project size affected solely the amount of Government counterpart funding,
while the total loan amount remained unchanged (US$47.9 million). These changes,
along with a three-year extension of the Project Closing Date, to December 31, 2009,
were made to facilitate the Government’s ability to achieve the Project’s objectives and
targets. In its comments to this ICR, the Government has noted that the 2006
restructuring failed to substantively change the Project’s implementation arrangements,
which ultimately led to only partial achievement of results (see Annex 7). As noted in the
section on lessons learned below, the Bank team agrees with this assessment.

21.    Therefore, after Project restructuring, output indicators by Component were
revised as follows:

Component 1 – Land Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework (US$13.56 million, 23.2
percent of total Project cost)

      Law proposal for a modernized land administration system presented to the
       Assembly;
      Regulations for simplifying regularization process and for massive land titling
       approved;
      Alternative conflict resolution mechanisms established in 3 provinces and 80
       percent of conflicts resolved;
      Specialized Land Tribunal established in 4 provinces; and
      1,000 staff of executing agencies trained in the use of SIICAR.

Component 2 – Land Regularization (US$28.99 million, 49.5 percent of total cost)

      Three Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations operating;
      Basic geodetic network (20 location points) available;
      Primary geodetic network (175 points) available;
      50 percent of national territory photographed;


                                            6
      50 percent of old registries in the project area updated;
      50,000 rural parcels surveyed and 12,000 titled issued;
      60,000 urban parcels surveyed and 15,000 titles issued; and
      SIICAR operating in 4 implementing agencies with no less than 10,000 parcels
       incorporated.

Component 3 – Consolidation of Protected Areas and Indigenous Territories (US$7.97
million, 13.6 percent of total cost)

      700 linear km of protected areas demarcated;
      Nine management plans completed;
      Three indigenous territories consolidated (Kuna Yala, Ngöbe-Buglé, and Naso
       Tjerdi) and 1 administrative norm elaborated;
      1,361 km of indigenous territories demarcated; and
      3 roundtables established (Kuna Yala, Ngöbe-Buglé, and Chimán).

Component 4 – Project Administration and Monitoring (US$8.05 million, 13.7 percent of
total cost)

      Annual Operating Plan and procurement plan drafted every year on November 30;
      Monitoring and Evaluation report issued every three months; and
      Annual auditing carried out.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

22.      Project restructuring in 2006 also involved a change in the financial administrator
and procurement agent and the addition of the Ministry of Housing (MIVI) as a co-
executing agency. Up to 2006, Government had been using the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) as a financial administrator and procurement agent for
the Project (identified as such in the Loan Agreement), financed entirely with counterpart
funds. Government dissatisfaction with this arrangement led to a revision in the Loan
Agreement which allowed Government to choose a different financial administrator
and/or procurement agent, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Between
2006 and 2008, there was no external financial administrator, but since March 2008, the
Government has employed the Centro del Agua del Trópico Húmedo para América
Latina y El Caribe (CATHALAC) as the financial administrator for the Project. Although
procurement thresholds remained the same after Project restructuring, at the
Government’s request, the 2004 Procurement Guidelines became applicable. Also, to
facilitate implementation, the Authorized Allocation of the Special Account was
increased to US$4.79 million (equivalent to 10 percent of total loan amount).

23.     As part of a Bank-wide initiative, a PAD review was carried out in early 2009
which identified some discrepancies between the Projects’s PAD and the provisions of
the Loan Agreement. This review led to a minor second project restructuring in April
2009, which only related to changes to activities in protected areas and the elimination of
activities related to land valuation which were going to be financed by an IDB project.


                                             7
24.    Finally, there were two reallocations of expenditure categories throughout the life
of the Project. The first was done as part of Project restructuring in 2006, and a second
minor reallocation was approved in May 2010. In December 2009, the Bank approved a
second extension of the Project Closing Date to June 30, 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25.     Soundness of background analysis. Project design built on technical studies and
a consultation process carried out during preparation comprising: (a) a comprehensive
environmental analysis of potential environmental impacts (positive or negative); (b) a
comprehensive social assessment addressing issues of social diversity, resources, and
conflict, including attention to Indigenous Peoples’ issues, and a public consultation
based on field surveys and workshops; and (c) a cost-benefit analysis. The design further
benefitted from preparatory work carried out under the Rural Poverty and Natural
Resources Project in 1996. These studies contributed to ratification of the choice of
sectors and areas to be covered by the Project.

26.      Assessment of Project design. Overall Project design was considered sound at the
time. It built on the existing experience and lessons learned from the Bank’s portfolio in
land administration and international best practices, in particular with regards to the need
to: (a) address land administration reform in a comprehensive manner, dealing with legal
and policy reforms, institutional innovations, area-based surveying and land
regularization, and conflict resolution: (b) integrate the cadastre and registry functions;
(c) address multiple types of land tenure issues, including individual land titling, natural
resources and protected areas management, recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ land
claims, and promotion of property rights of women; (d) promote the participation of local
and community stakeholders; and (e) work simultaneously in rural and urban areas.

27.      However, with the benefit of hindsight, the approach followed by the Project
resulted in an overly complex and ambitious design that suffered from several limitations,
many of which have been noted in other similar operations from the same time period.4
Four key areas are worth noting. First, Project design did not take into account
considerable institutional limitations, particularly the inability of multiple entities to work
together to achieve Project objectives, which often competed with individual
organizational aims and sector priorities. In its comments to this ICR, the Government
has highlighted this as the single most important flaw in project design (see Annex 7).
Second, the technical, operational and institutional requirements for regularizing and
titling individual land rights are quite different from those applicable to the demarcation
and regularization of protected areas, or the recognition of historical land claims of
Indigenous Peoples. Project design should have identified specific measures aimed at


4
 See, for example, “World Bank Support to Land Administration and Land Redistribution in Central
America,? and Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Performance Assessment of three Projects, June, 2010.


                                                 8
mitigating these potential conflicts. Third, although under Component 1 the Project
established conflict resolution mechanisms to address specific land disputes, they were
unable to address the broader political economy issues surrounding land policy, such as
those encountered in the demarcation of indigenous territories and protected areas. And
fourth, in the particular case of the demarcation of the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca,
background studies and consultations processes failed to identify the early controversies
related to the Annex Areas in Bocas del Toro province. Moreover, lack of a stand-alone
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) with adequate consultations hindered the
ability of implementing agencies to respond to emerging critical issues in a timely
fashion.

28.     Adequacy of the Government’s commitment during preparation. Project design
benefitted from high level commitment by the Government. Following negotiations for
the Rural Poverty and Natural Resources Project in 1997, the Government prioritized the
preparation of this Project (with support from a Japanese grant). The Government also
formed an inter-ministerial working group and a Panamanian delegation visited Australia
to study land administration services in that country.

29.      Assessment of risks. Project appraisal identified sixteen critical risks, most of
which were rated as modest. Some of these risks materialized during implementation,
including: (a) insufficient participatory processes to provide sufficient mechanisms and
incentives for both the Government and potential beneficiaries to participate effectively
in Project activities and in mediated dispute resolution; (b) insufficient political
commitment to promote policy, legal and institutional changes, and insufficient
willingness to facilitate true participatory processes; and (c) use of different approaches
to land regularization (under Components 2 and 3) that undermined expected Project
results.

30.    Some important risks that eventually materialized, however, were not identified
during Project preparation and appraisal, including:

      The risk that multiple implementing agencies would have persistent coordination
       problems that seriously delayed project implementation.

      The risk that emerging conflicting interests, such as pressures to develop the
       hydroelectric and tourism potential in Project areas, particularly in Bocas del Toro
       province, would threaten implementation of key Project activities related to the
       recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ land rights;

      The possibility that long delays in the development and rolling out of SIICAR,
       which in fact did occur, would threaten the overall sustainability of the
       investments made under regularization activities due to the inability to rapidly
       update land transactions in a reliable single system;

      The fact that enactment of certain laws not envisioned at the Project design stage
       might pose either legal ambiguities or differences of interpretation that would



                                            9
       prevent the demarcation of certain Indigenous Peoples’ territories (as was the case
       of the Ngöbe Annex Areas, and the Naso territory, respectively); and

      The possibility that despite frequent and highly participatory consultation
       processes and conflict resolution mechanisms for Indigenous Peoples, internal
       disputes would lead to paralysis of certain Project activities.

2.2 Implementation

31.     Overall, the Project implemented a significant number of the activities envisioned
at the design stage, but it took twice as long as planned, even taking into account the
scaled-down version resulting from the 2006 restructuring. During the first four years, the
Project suffered significant implementation delays, due mainly to limited disbursement of
funds (both from the Loan and counterpart financing), weak operational leadership and
ineffective inter-institutional coordination. The Project operated with an interim
Technical Coordinator for almost 18 months (from September 2004 until early January
2006). The Government never allocated all the resources that it had committed to the
Project. Initially, it was expected that the Project would disburse between US$8 and
US$10 million per year, while, in practice, it only disbursed between US$1 and US$3
million per year. This excessive delay is what led the Mid-Term Review of mid-2004 to
determine that the Project needed to be restructured. In June 2004, the Project started
being rated Unsatisfactory in terms of implementation. By mid-2005, it became clear that
the Project was not going to achieve its original PDO and output indicators by the
original Closing Date of September 30, 2006, and the Project was then restructured
(approved in January 2006, and effective six months later).

32.     As noted above, the restructuring did not alter substantively the PDO or
components, but rather focused on alleviating operational bottlenecks (i.e., reduced
counterpart funding requirements, more flexibility in appointing a financial administrator
and procurement agent, and a larger Authorized Allocation of the Special Account). In
addition, the restructuring strengthened the monitoring functions within the Project, with
a more robust Project logframe, clearer outcome and output indicators, and a separate
component with earmarked resources for these functions. Following restructuring, the
Project made substantial progress towards achievement of expected outcomes and
development impact, and Project ratings consistently improved. Improvements after 2006
were attributable to the change in funding arrangements, with the Government having
less counterpart funding requirements, as well as to improved, stable leadership. However,
even after restructuring, limited resource allocations by the Government and persistent
operational bottlenecks severely restricted achievement of Project objectives.

33.     The problems encountered during implementation can be summarized under three
broad categories: (a) institutional capacity limitations and weak coordination; (b)
operational conflicts between different project components attempting to regularize
different types of land tenure situations; and (c) difficulty in addressing complex issues
related to the regularization of Indigenous Peoples’ territories, including consultations
and legal issues.



                                            10
34.     Institutional limitations and weak coordination. As is fairly common in land
administration projects in the Latin America Region, multiple Project goals required
multiple agencies to implement activities that are typically mandated by law (i.e., titling
of rural lands was the responsibility of the DINRA, surveying required IGN involvement,
demarcation of Indigenous Peoples’ territories was the responsibility of a National
Boundaries Commission composed of multiple agency representatives, etc.). To address
this challenge, because there was no alternative at the time, the Project relied too heavily
on a “supra? structure, the Superior Council, which was supposed to enforce institutional
cooperation. In practice this proved to be a very difficult endeavor. The SC only met four
times in nine years. This limitation was compounded by the fact that the PCU was starved
of resources throughout most of the Project’s life (despite the fact that it was formally
under the Ministry of the Economy and Finance) and it did not have sufficient authority
or convening power to enforce inter-institutional cooperation. On the other hand, the
TCO functioned fairly well, meeting frequently (almost monthly) and with sufficient
quorum. TCO sessions were mainly used to discuss and approve technical issues and
regulatory reforms. Over time some of these institutional limitations were gradually
reduced, as a result of a more dynamic and autonomous PCU. However, in its comments
to this ICR, the Government has noted that deficient institutional arrangements (since
project design) and a weakly supervised PCU resulted in disproportionately high
administrative costs and inefficient project implementation. Going forward, it is unclear
how the Project’s implementation arrangements will adapt to the new institutional setting
established on October 8, 2010 by the creation of a National Authority for Land
Administration (ANATI), which integrates the DINRA, DNCBP, IGN, and PRONAT’s
PCU, into one autonomous entity.

35.     Competing Project component objectives and methods. A direct result of the
Project’s complex design was the inherent conflict that emerged between two different
components. On the one hand, activities under Component 2 attempted to regularize land
rights under the operational procedures applicable to private rural and urban parcels,
either with the direct involvement of private contractors or directly with PCU staff. On
the other hand, activities under Sub-component 3.2 aimed at demarcating and
regularizing lands for Indigenous Peoples using specific operational procedures
applicable only to these lands, including the need for highly participatory consultation
mechanisms. This proved to be a significant challenge for a couple of reasons. First,
Project teams (at the central and local levels) working under the two components did not
interact much with each other and thus were unaware of developments in the other
component. As a result, staff working on rural lands regularization (Component 2) did
not consider issues related to Indigenous Peoples lands regularization as carefully as was
intended under Component 3. Bank supervision missions (including the results of
technical and social audits) conducted in early 2010 determined that some of the titling
processes carried out in 2008 fell outside the provisions of the Project and consequently,
the Bank declared those activities as ineligible under the Loan Agreement. This also led
to the Bank’s request to suspend titling activities in Bocas del Toro. And second, the
supervision of private contractors responsible for regularization of private rural and urban
parcels proved to be difficult given the lack of adequate quality control manuals.




                                            11
36.     Difficulty in addressing Indigenous Peoples’ land issues. The Project faced
several challenges in order to address the historical land claims of Indigenous Peoples,
particularly in Bocas del Toro province. These challenges were the result of various
factors, some exogenous and others endogenous to the Project. Some of these difficulties
prompted two Requests for Inspection to the World Bank Inspection Panel by some
members of the Naso and Ngöbe indigenous communities (on March 11 and March 20,
2009, respectively), which led to a full investigation by the Panel.5 The most important
exogenous factors were: (a) the growing pressures on and competing interests from
growth and economic development (tourism, environmental protection, hydropower,
urban development) over lands in these regions. The territorial claims by Indigenous
Peoples were thus part of a broader climate of conflict created by the inherent trade-offs
among the alternative uses of land; (b) internal disputes within the Naso community that
left the community deeply divided—with two groups each claiming legitimate
representation—and consequent difficulties of engaging in dialogue with the two sides of
the controversy; and (c) approval of laws which either created legal ambiguities or led to
contradictory Government policy positions regarding Indigenous Peoples land rights.

37.     Factors endogenous to the Project included: (a) lack of a stand-alone IPDP which
could have better guided Project implementation in these areas; (b) weak consultations
(in the case of Annex Areas, or on the approval of Law 72 of 2008, which led to a
declaration of ineligible expenditures in April 2009); and (c) limited and erratic financial
support to activities under Sub-component 3.2. However, it should be noted that the
Project’s ability to respond to these challenges improved significantly in the last two
years of Project implementation, as a result of enhanced Bank supervision efforts and
increased Government commitment to address these issues. Further, the Bank took the
opportunity of the 6-month extension of the Project’s Closing Date (to June 30, 2010) to
impress upon the Government the need to address some unresolved issues, mostly related
to the Indigenous Peoples’ subcomponent (including improved consultations in Naso and
Ngöbe communities in Bocas del Toro).

38.     Problems with SIICAR’s design and development. The design and development
of the SIICAR system, the core of PRONAT, suffered from a number of shortcomings,
including: (a) weak institutional capacity, especially at the DNCBP in the Ministry of
Economy and Finance; (b) limited engagement on the part of the Public Registry; and (c)
unsatisfactory interaction between the contractor in charge of the development of the
system and the implementing entities. These shortcomings resulted in significant delays
in carrying out the procurement processes, including one major technological false start,
and delays in the elaboration of technical specifications.

                                                    12
39.     Accordingly, building on a previous IDB project, a provisional solution for the
integration and maintenance of the cadastral and recorded information was developed by
the PCU and DNCBP (so called little SIICAR, or “SIICARito?). This temporary system
consisted of a smaller database and software that would allow for the conservation and
maintenance of the information to be collected in the field as a result of the regularization
process until the final SIICAR was put in place. Currently, the SIICAR is not yet fully
operational and the SIICARito continues to be used as a provisional mechanism to
integrate cadastral and recorded information.

40.     Lack of adequate budget allocation. Throughout the Project’s life, the Ministry
of Economy and Finance allocated smaller budgets than those intended at Project design
or those committed to at the 2006 restructuring (after a dramatic reduction in counterpart
funding requirements), and the implementing units have often executed less than what
was expected. The Project ran out of operating funds shortly before the new
administration was inaugurated on July 1, 2009. The arrival of a new team and other
transition issues in mid-2009 led to further Project implementation delays. In response to
repeated Bank requests, including the possibility of suspension of loan disbursements, in
October 2009 the new Government finally allocated sufficient resources to the Project to
allow continuation of critical activities.

41.     Weak coordination between the Project and the IDB projects. Coordination at
the PCU and implementing agency level of Bank-financed and IDB-financed activities
proved to be very difficult due to several factors: (a) different budgetary allocations led to
different implementation timetables; (b) over-reliance on “consultants? for Project-
specific tasks which severely weakened the ability of line agencies to respond to project
demands effectively; (c) different fiduciary controls and operational modalities (e.g., the
IDB project considered implementation of the Bank-financed SIICAR as a national
“counterpart? contribution); and (d) different field offices and operational staff for each
project, which often resulted in confusion among beneficiaries who did not know that
there were in effect two different “PRONAT? projects operating simultaneously. This
was particularly problematic in Bocas del Toro province.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

42.     The Project did not have an effective Monitoring and Evaluation system during
the first few years of implementation. Institutional coordination was very poor, with
limited transfers of information between co-implementing agencies and the PCU.
Although financial reports on the use of Project resources were generated periodically,
the Project did not have a system for collecting, synthesizing and reporting Project results
and linking these results to inputs (uses of financial resources). In late 2003, a series of
recommendations was made to review the Project logframe and prepare periodic reports
detailing Project input, output and outcome indicators. Progress was slow, but by 2006,
when the restructuring was completed, the Project was generating standardized
monitoring reports on key Project indicators. End-of-Project performance indicators,
based on the 2006 revised logframe, are summarized in Annex 2.




                                             13
43.    Although reporting on performance indicators improved significantly after the
2006 restructuring, and the Government prepared a detailed report on PRONAT’s
achievements from 2001 to 2009, a comprehensive end-of-Project evaluation (including
an ex-post economic analysis) was not carried out, nor was a beneficiary assessment
prepared. Therefore, the results and assessments presented in this Implementation and
Completion Report (ICR) are based on the Government’s final report (summarized in
Annex 7) and Bank supervision findings.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.     Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). At Appraisal and during the early years of
implementation, the Project was not fully in compliance with 4.20 because it did not have
a stand-alone IPDP. However, a comprehensive social assessment, including attention to
Indigenous Peoples’ issues, was carried out during Project preparation and an Indigenous
Peoples’ strategy was prepared and was incorporated as an Annex to the PAD. The
strategy was a useful tool for the Project to support the Government’s efforts in the
drafting of the bill to create the Naso Comarca. However, it was not sufficient to guide
fulfillment of the standards required by Bank safeguard policies to conduct consultations,
nor to assess potential conflicts in Annex Areas of the Ngöbe Buglé Comarca. In the
particular case of the Ngöbe people, the consultations needed to be substantially
improved to meet the minimum requirement of Bank policies. With the incorporation of a
social specialist in the Bank’s team in 2007, Bank supervision improved considerably and
detailed recommendations were made to improve the quality of the Project’s
consultations. The Bank team also provided continuous technical support to the
Government in preparing an IPDP that could serve as model or guide for future initiatives
involving Indigenous Peoples in Panama. The final rating in this regard is Unsatisfactory.

45.     Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Natural Habitats (OP 4.04). The
Project was classified as Category B, and an Environmental Analysis was prepared along
with an Environmental Management Plan that was mainstreamed within Components 1
and 3. Environmental specialists conducted regular supervision missions and did not find
any large-scale, significant or irreversible environmental impacts related to the Project.
The demarcation of protected areas (281 linear km) and Indigenous Peoples’ territories
(1,361 linear km) as well as the preparation/updating of nine management plans is
expected to support biodiversity conservation within these areas. Finally, there was
compliance with the legal covenant in the Loan Agreement (Section 3.10) that prohibited
the regularization of private titles or claims in areas within or adjacent to protected areas
prior to their demarcation or in proposed protected areas prior to their official
establishment and assessment. Considering the above factors, compliance with OP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats) is rated Satisfactory.

46.     Financial Management. There were no serious problems with financial
management and, except for the change of financial administrator after Project
restructuring in 2006, no major modifications to the financial management arrangements
described in the PAD took place during Project implementation. Annual audited Project
financial statements were submitted in a timely manner and found no major issues.
Unaudited financial reports were also submitted in a timely manner in format and content


                                             14
satisfactory to the Bank. Overall, the financial management arrangements for the Project
were found satisfactory to moderately satisfactory throughout the life of the project. One
lesson would be for the Ministry of Economy and Finance to exercise tighter controls
with respect to payment approvals, as towards the end of the Project some payments were
made on closed contracts which did not have approved amendments (and thus were
declared by the Bank as ineligible for financing under the Loan). The 2009 external audit
failed to identify the existence of some contractors which continued to work even after
their terms had expired. In its comments to this ICR, the Government has noted that the
Bank should have had stricter supervision of financial transactions. However, approval of
budgets, contracts, and payments, which the Government points out ultimately resulted in
inefficient use of resources, are the Borrower’s responsibility. Regarding compliance
with Bank financial management and procurement policies, the Bank team exercised very
detailed reviews, particularly over the last two years of implementation. The Bank
refused to accept several payments for contracts that had expired and were ineligible for
financing under the Loan. Strictly from a financial management standpoint, the final
rating on these matters was Moderately Satisfactory.
47.     Procurement. There were no major issues related to procurement throughout the
Project’s life. This aspect of the Project was rated satisfactory for most of the
implementation period. In the early years, until Project restructuring in 2006, the
Government hired UNDP (with counterpart funds) to administer Project funds and make
payments; this arrangement allowed the PCU to bypass national procurement laws and
translated into a more efficient and effective procurement process. The PCU maintained
streamlined procurement business processes, sound internal procurement controls, and
qualified personnel. The procurement post-review mission of 2002 identified weak
procurement capacity in the PCU and recommended improvements, which translated
eventually into improved performance in the following years. The procurement processes
implemented by the Project in 2007-2008 were also satisfactory, given the qualified
procurement team then in place. The procurement plan for this period featured large
packages for land titling services that were procured through International Competitive
Bidding and awarded to the lowest price bidder, which resulted in significant savings
compared to the PCU’s original estimates. As for smaller procurement, the Bank carried
out two procurement post-reviews during the period 2007-2008 and found that the Project
also was performing well overall in this regard. Three training sessions on Bank-financed
procurement were offered in Panama and these were attended by Project officials. In
2009 and 2010, as a result of the lack of national budget allocation for the Project due to
the change in Government administration, very few procurement processes, all of small
value and subject to post-review, were implemented. During this period, the procurement
team was changed and the head of the team left the PCU. The last procurement post-
review carried out in 2010 concluded that the Project did not perform well during this
period and unveiled substantial flaws on contract management processes, particularly in
internal controls, in spite of the fact that such flaws were not raised by the external
auditors. As noted above, these issues were highlighted during project supervision, but
were not properly identified by the auditors or addressed by the Borrower. The final
rating on procurement matters was Moderately Unsatisfactory.




                                            15
2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

48.     In late 2008 the GOP requested from the Bank an Additional Financing loan in
the amount of US$23 million to support the geographical extension of the Project’s
activities. The proposed operation was to help finance the costs associated with the scale
up of Project activities covering: (a) the Provinces of Panama and Colón for rural and
urban lands; (b) additional urban lands in the Province of Chiriquí; (c) additional
protected areas in the Provinces of Panama and Colón; and (d) lands of three Indigenous
Peoples’ groups (Emberá, Wounan and Kunas). The Bank decided to pause the
preparation of the Additional Financing operation in late 2008 because Project
implementation was less than satisfactory and it was unclear at the time what priorities
the new Government administration (to assume office on July 1, 2009) would have with
regard to future Bank assistance.

49.     While there has been a clear interest by the land sector agencies in a follow-up
operation, in the Panama Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), prepared in late 2009 and
early 2010 and approved on September 21, 2010, the Government of Panama did not
identify a new land administration operation as a priority. Nevertheless, the PRONAT
“Program? will continue. The majority of the staff previously financed by the Bank loan
has been absorbed by the IDB project, providing for the continuation in program
objectives. Moreover, the creation of ANATI in October 2010 holds significant promise
because this may lead to the consolidation of many institutional and operational
structures developed under the Project and provides a permanent structure to address land
tenure issues in Panama.

50.    Over the past few weeks, the Bank has made several specific recommendations to
the Government related to the Project’s most important achievements and pending
challenges. In particular, the Bank recommended that the Government (through ANATI
and other agencies) prioritize the following:

      Full implementation of SIICAR among all land administration entities;

      Systematic adoption of improved land regularization and quality control manuals
       based on the lessons learned from the Project;

      Completion of the land regularization (and particularly titling) efforts in Project
       areas ensuring full compliance with the appropriate legal, technical, social and
       environmental requirements;

      Validation and adoption of an updated Indigenous Peoples Participatory Plan
       (IPDP), to be used as a model for future Government initiatives related to
       Indigenous Peoples’ land rights; the Bank has offered continued technical
       assistance in this regard and will organize in Panama in the coming months a
       training workshop on best consultation practices; some specific recommendations
       the Bank has made on the IPDP document include: (a) emphasizing future actions
       for the development of Indigenous Peoples, (b) proposing possible actions for the
       protection of Indigenous Peoples territories, (c) addressing existing institutional


                                           16
        weaknesses to effectively implement an IPDP, (d) outlining possible actions for
        strengthening Indigenous Peoples’ community organizations, (e) including a more
        in-depth analysis of the legal procedures required in order to address the issues
        related to Ngöbe Annex Areas in Bocas del Toro, (f) including maps, (g)
        establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework, and (h) identifying lessons
        learned and ensuring the implementation of these lessons;

       Resolution of pending issues regarding the Naso territory and its eventual
        demarcation;

       Proactive engagement in seeking a resolution by the proper judicial or legislative
        instances to the legal ambiguities related to the impact of Law 18 of 20096 and
        Law 10 of 1997 (creating the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca) which is preventing the
        demarcation of certain Ngöbe Annex Areas;

       Demarcation of all remaining Ngöbe Annex Areas; and

       Finding a solution to the current dissatisfaction expressed by the community of
        Norteño with the boundaries of the Ngöbe Comarca to which they belong.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     The PDO was highly relevant for Panama at the time of appraisal. The GOP’s
ambitious program of legal, institutional and technological reforms to regularize land
tenure country-wide; resolve land conflicts; facilitate access to land by the poor; reduce
land transaction costs; and increase the transparency of land administration services was
well conceived and constituted an important element of the country’s overall
development strategy. Project objectives were also consistent with the Bank’s CAS at the
time (discussed on November 18, 1998). The Project, like similar projects in other
countries in the region, also reflected the Bank’s increased involvement in the land sector
in the late 1990s. Bank engagement in Panama in this sector was instrumental in moving
the agenda forward, particularly with regard to the recognition of land rights of
Indigenous Peoples.

52.    PRONAT’s overall objectives continue to be of high relevance today, perhaps
even more so than a decade ago, as Panama’s land resources have enormous development
potential and have attracted much international and national interest.

53.    In terms of implementation, the Project’s mixed record of accomplishments and
shortcomings also provides many relevant lessons for Panama, for other countries facing

 Law 18 of 2009 establishes new corregimientos (administrative jurisdictions) and lists all the existing
ones in the district of Changuinola, Bocas del Toro province.


                                                  17
similar challenges, as well as for the Bank’s engagement in the sector (see Section 6
below).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

54.     The Project partially achieved its PDO. Although the centerpiece (at least from a
technological standpoint) of a “modernized land administration system,? the Integrated
Cadastre and Registry System (SIICAR) was completed, it is not yet fully operational. As
a result, the outcome indicator related to the time required and cost for titling and
registering a land parcel cannot be precisely measured. An internal cost study carried out
at Project closing estimates the time and cost required to register a land parcel to be 24
hours and US$30, respectively. This would indicate that the target value of 24 hours per
transaction has been achieved, but not the target of US$2 per transaction (which
continues to be administratively determined). Similarly, the level of satisfaction of
SIICAR users, another outcome indicator, cannot be measured until the system is fully
rolled out to the relevant land administration institutions and is operational. The other two
PDO outcome indicators were also only partially met. Land occupations were regularized
in two protected areas (Portobelo and Cerro Hoya), out of a target of five; and the co-
management plan for the area overlapping the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca and the La Amistad
International Park has been prepared but not yet approved by ANAM.

55.     The Project achieved some important intermediate outcomes, which can be
considered as implicit and/or inferred outcomes rather than simply outputs, and which
play a key role in achievement of the overall PDO:

      The Project was instrumental in sponsoring Law 24 of 2006 (that allows mass
       land titling) and subsequent regulations, a key legal reform and contribution
       towards the modernization of the Panama land administration system. This reform
       had a significant impact on the achievement of specific outcomes and outputs
       from Component 2, surveying and titling of urban and rural land parcels;

      The rural target of 12,000 issued titles was met and surpassed (13,190 titles
       issued);

      The Project sponsored the elaboration of a draft law for the establishment of the
       Naso Comarca and its presentation to the Legislative Assembly (in 2004 and
       again in 2005). This achievement was directly linked to the delimitation of about
       70 percent of the Naso territory;

      The consolidation and demarcation of Indigenous Peoples’ territories was
       achieved to a large extent. In particular, 100 percent of the main area and the
       Annex Areas in Chiriquí and Veraguas of the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca (over 1,300
       km) was demarcated (only the Annex Areas in Bocas del Toro remain non-
       demarcated);




                                             18
      Sixteen roundtables (against a target of 3) and alternative conflict resolution
       mechanisms were established in the three provinces where the Project operated
       (Veraguas, Chiriquí and Bocas del Toro) and these resolved 490 land conflicts;

      The target of establishing four land tribunals was also met. This is also a key
       contribution towards the goal of establishing a modernized land administration
       system, through a more expedited resolution of land-related disputes;

      Another major achievement was the completion of six protected areas
       management plans, the approval of three new protected areas, as well as
       demarcation works in six protected areas; and

      Targets for modernizing the geodetic network were met, which resulted in
       mapping half of the country’s territory.

56.     The sustainability of some the above outcomes is a matter of concern, given that
SIICAR has not been fully rolled out yet and there is at present no system in place to
systematically and promptly record land transactions, so the risk that changes in land
tenure (sales, divisions, inheritances) will not be captured is considerable (see section 4.
Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome).

57.     A detailed discussion of all output indicators by component (and their individual
ratings) is presented in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency

58.     Given the lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the Project, it is not possible to
assess its overall efficiency. The Government’s Final Report does not provide sufficient
information to assess the Project’s cost effectiveness, or its economic or financial rates of
return. Moreover, the Project’s inability to reliably estimate current times and costs of
registering titles prevents comparisons with other similar projects in the region. Further,
using the PAD methodology for calculating ERR/cost-benefit ratio is not possible
because of lack of information. The alternative approach, that is one based on cost/time
for registering the titles, is also not possible given that the SIICAR system is not
operational yet. However, as noted in the Government’s comment to this ICR, the
program’s overall efficiency is questionable given the high administrative costs
associated with the Project Coordination Unit (see Annex 7).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

59.    The relevance of Project objectives was and remains very high. The full
achievement of one key PDO outcome (passage of Law 24 of 2006), the partial
achievement of another (design of SIICAR), and the partial achievement of several
intermediate outcomes are also somewhat high. However, there were many important
shortcomings. Project implementation was extremely slow—PRONAT lasted twice as


                                             19
long as originally intended, despite a 25 percent reduction in scope. Many Project
activities fell far short of their target (surveying and tilting of urban land parcels, non-
demarcation of the Ngöbe Annex Areas, etc.). There were also some significant
operational shortcomings (unreliable and erratic counterpart funding, weak inter-
institutional collaboration, non-compliance on certain safeguard and fiduciary matters),
and the Project had weak M&E mechanisms. The lack of a comprehensive evaluation
prevents an assessment of the Project’s overall efficiency. Consequently, the overall
outcome rating is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.    Poverty Impacts. The majority of Project beneficiaries have been poor urban and
rural dwellers in the provinces where the Project operated (Chiriquí, Veraguas and Bocas
del Toro). However, given that a full impact evaluation was not carried out, it is not
possible to assess quantitatively the extent to which Project activities benefit the poor and
how access to legal title to their land parcels may have increased their welfare.

61.     Gender Aspects. Given the lack of a comprehensive gender and poverty impact
analysis at the end of the Project, it is not possible to make overall conclusions on this
issue. However, a gender analysis was carried out as part of the Mid-Term Review in
June 2004. This review concluded that during Project implementation, gender issues were
incorporated into Project documents such as Terms of Reference for key operations,
Project manuals, and knowledge dissemination activities. In addition, Project staff in the
UTOs received training on this subject prior to beginning work with the Project.

62.      National Dialogue on Indigenous Peoples’ Land Rights. The Project played an
important role in facilitating dialogue and advancing the concerns of Indigenous Peoples
at official levels and within civil society. By preparing the Law for the Creation of the
Naso Comarca, the Project engaged the National Assembly and the Executive Branch in a
dialogue concerning the rights of Indigenous Peoples to own their ancestral land. In
addition, by working with all co-implementing agencies, the Project contributed to
building national capacity to address Indigenous Peoples’ land rights. The Project also
facilitated the dialogue between the two Naso factions regarding legal recognition of their
territory. In addition, PRONAT promoted encounters among different indigenous groups
through seminars and workshops organized to discuss common socio-economic issues
and actions. The Project was instrumental in establishing channels of communication
between Indigenous Peoples and government institutions which were somehow absent
before the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.     Capacity Building. Working with a wide range of co-implementing agencies, the
Project contributed to building institutional capacity to address technical and social issues
tied to land rights, such as recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ rights, incorporation of



                                             20
land tenure studies for the conservation of natural resources, and application of alternate
mechanisms for conflict resolution.

64.     Also, as noted above, the creation of ANATI in October 2010 holds significant
promise because this may lead to the consolidation of many institutional and operational
structures developed under the Project and provides a permanent structure to address land
tenure issues in Panama.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

65.      The Project intended to support the establishment and consolidation of indigenous
territories within the Project areas, as well as to support broader land policies and
accompanying legal reforms to address indigenous territories and Comarcas. Passage of
Law 72 of 2008 (for the titling of collective lands on indigenous territories) was
supported by several Indigenous Peoples groups. However, passage of this Law had the
unintended consequence of exacerbating the divisions among the Naso, as one faction
believes that this law undermines their territorial aspirations.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

66.     The sustainability of Project outcomes appears fragile. On the one hand, passage
of the Law on Massive Land Titling (Law 24 of 2006) has greatly facilitated the
Government’s ability to survey, title and regularize urban and rural lands. Creation of
ANATI in October 2010 is also an important post-Project achievement that will enhance
the Government’s capacity to “modernize? the land administration system. However,
there are three factors that threaten the sustainability of Project outcomes. First, SIICAR
has not been fully rolled out after nine years since the Project launched this initiative; this
raises the specter that the geographical and legal components of each land title
regularized by the Project may become dated over time. At present, only 30,000 parcels
have been incorporated into SIICAR (30 percent of target). Second, the pace of economic
development in certain regions of the country is such that ANATI, and other land
administration entities such as municipalities and land tribunals, may not be able to keep
pace with the inevitable challenges that competing uses of land create. Third, if the
existing legal ambiguities (in the case of the Ngöbe Annex Areas) and the lack of
Government clarity on how to address the Naso territorial claims are not solved, current
tensions are likely to grow and reverse some of the Project’s achievements (such as the
demarcation of 70 percent of the Naso territory).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

67.      Although the design of the Project was considered sound at the time, considering
that it built on the experiences and lessons available then, with the benefit of hindsight it
is clear that the Project suffered from significant design flaws. Bank internal reviews
should have flagged the extreme complexity of Project design. Similarly, the Bank failed
to properly identify likely risks and some potential conflicting situations (such as the
emerging issues in Ngöbe Annex Areas). The Bank’s overly optimistic appraisal of the
Project’s likely pace of implementation seems to have been driven more by the
Government commitment at the time than by more realistic institutional assessments. The
eventual slow pace of Project implementation and the numerous problems encountered
suggest that Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The quality of Bank supervision was uneven. The Bank’s weak engagement in
Panama during the Project’s early years was not conducive to intensive supervision. With
the change of Government administration in 2004, the intensity of supervision increased.
However, given the semi-paralyzed state of the Project (there was no permanent Project
Coordinator, funding was limited and erratic), supervision focused more on basic
operational matters and missed some broader emerging issues, such as the growing land
conflicts in Bocas del Toro province. The quality and intensity of Project supervision
increased significantly in late 2007 and early 2008. As Project implementation
accelerated, the Bank’s responsiveness to evolving events was adequate. In particular, the
permanent inclusion of a social scientist in all supervision missions proved instrumental
in addressing Indigenous Peoples’ issues. Similarly, increased attention during project
supervision to financial and procurement fiduciary matters in the last two years resulted
in the identification of several weaknesses related to incomplete audits, contract
management and internal controls. Considering that these increased supervision efforts in
the past two and half years to some extent compensated for the earlier lapses, the overall
quality of Bank supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.     Some aspects of the Bank’s performance are rated moderately satisfactory, while
others are rated moderately unsatisfactory. Given that the overall outcome rating for the

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

70.      The Project enjoyed strong political commitment during design, but this
significantly dropped during the first four to five years of Project implementation. Some
renewed commitment took place around the time of Project restructuring in 2006 and
with the arrival of a new Government administration in mid-2009. However, the limited
and erratic availability of funds for Project activities remained a permanent problem
throughout the Project’s life. Even after the restructuring of 2006 which drastically
reduced the requirements for counterpart funding, the amounts and timeliness of
disbursements to Project implementing agencies remained less than satisfactory. Further,
the final Project administration and M&E cost (close to US$15 million or about 25
percent of total project cost) was 230 percent over the revised estimate at the time of the
first restructuring, despite less than full achievement of the downgraded PDOs and targets.
This overrun also occurred while data gaps prevented a full evaluation, including
financial and economic analyses, comparisons to baseline measures and beneficiary
assessments.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

71.      Most implementing agencies performed rather poorly and this became reflected in
the extremely slow pace of Project implementation. Efforts by the PCU to bring about
institutional cooperation were often ineffective. The largely technical functions, such as
surveying and registration of clean titles, under the responsibility of IGN and the Public
Registry, respectively, were carried out without much problem. But those Project
activities that demanded important political and institutional commitments, such as titling
by the Directorate of Agrarian Reform or environmental endorsement by ANAM,
encountered multiple obstacles. Consequently, overall Borrower performance is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

72.    This Project provides important lessons for future engagement on land
administration issues in the Latin America Region and elsewhere.

      Donor-funded “projects? can be very effective in implementing reforms and
       introducing technological or operational innovations, but have severe
       limitations in initiating profound legal reforms. Land administration reforms
       take decades to implement, even after significant legal changes. The classic 5-
       year project is not well suited to be the main or only instrument to implement a
       20-year national reform. In this case, this Project lasted twice as long as
       envisioned; it achieved important results but left a significant unfinished agenda
       of further reforms (e.g., full integration of the registry and cadastre, passage of
       legislation to create a Naso Comarca), regularization and titling of lands, and
       demarcation of indigenous territories and protected areas.

      Strong political commitment for policy, legal, and institutional reforms in the
       land sector is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success. First, this
       commitment needs to be ongoing, which clearly did not materialize in this Project.
       Second, conflicting political objectives within the same Government
       administration can have a direct negative impact on project activities. Third, the
       ability of a “project? to overcome institutional turf-battles is often overestimated.
       Institutional capacity constraints and myopic perspectives on complex issues
       beyond their immediate mandates are hard to overcome, even with strong political
       support. As noted by the Government’s comments to this ICR, rigid institutional
       mandates prevented effective operational coordination which led to an over-
       reaching Project Coordination Unit and weak effective control by a central
       authority, such as the Ministry of the Economy and Finance.

      In this kind of project, with complex institutional arrangements, it is a
       challenge to rigorously maintain the line separating Project-specific activities
       and broader policy initiatives undertaken by Project staff. This limited the


                                            24
    Bank’s ability to monitor all the activities or actions which may have been
    associated with the Project or indirectly with the Bank.

   Single operations are inadequate tools to address land administration reform in
    a comprehensive manner. Sequencing of reforms, with initial efforts focusing on
    the technical reforms and related legal and institutional changes, has shown to be
    a more effective approach towards modernization and sustainability of land
    administration systems.

   Addressing the political and institutional aspects of land tenure issues,
    particularly as they relate to Indigenous Peoples, is complex. Operations for
    consolidation of indigenous lands should be embedded in – and ideally
    preceded by – a robust policy dialogue related to Indigenous Peoples’ land
    rights’ regularization. The Project attempted and to some extent succeeded in
    opening up such dialogue, but was an insufficient instrument to do so in a
    comprehensive way.

   As exemplified in this and other recent land administration projects in the region,
    the effective integration of the cadastre and registry functions and data into a
    common technical platform (even without requiring a single agency) is extremely
    difficult. This institutional rivalry tends to be very entrenched and there is very
    little external pressure to overcome it.

   Although land administration projects have the potential to yield considerable
    benefits to the poor, through more secure land tenure, this Project has not been
    able to show that these benefits necessarily translate into poverty reduction. This
    kind of project needs to be evaluated more in terms of its impact on public
    governance (and possibly decentralization) issues.

   Land administration projects, even under more simplified designs, require
    intensive and specialized supervision. This Project shows that the range of
    challenges that emerge during implementation is very broad indeed. For Bank
    supervision to be effective, land administration project teams must include land
    policy and technical experts, lawyers, social scientists, institutional specialists,
    environmental specialists, and possibly others.

   Beyond external pressures and conflicts, issues related to land use, tenure and
    decision making processes are frequently exacerbated by internal divisions. In
    addition to sustained participatory consultations with different indigenous groups,
    projects that attempt to address land claims of Indigenous Peoples need to
    monitor closely the potential for intra-group factional splits, particularly in the
    context of rapidly changing economic conditions, which may threaten
    achievement of project objectives. Because the Bank does not attempt to assign
    representativeness to any particular group, reaching agreement on issues among
    indigenous groups in the context of a Bank-financed operation can be a lengthy
    process.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower / implementing agencies

73.     The Borrower’s Final Report highlights several of the Project’s main
achievements, including: the Project’s effective recovery from an unsatisfactory rating in
2004 following a restructuring and renewed Government commitment in 2006; the
creation of an adequate legal and institutional framework for land administration through
the Project; the completion of 80 agreements and more than 120 TCO meetings
throughout the life of the Project; and the establishment of effective procurement,
financial management, and M&E systems. Regarding the Project’s results, the
Borrower’s Report highlighted the completion of the demarcation of the Ngöbe-Buglé
Comarca, the approval of 10 new laws related to land administration, the completion of
96 percent of the land regularization target, the demarcation of 1,361 km of indigenous
territory, and the completion of numerous mesas de diálogo (conflict resolution sessions)
between 2001 and 2005.

74.      The Report also highlights weaknesses that affected implementation, including
several legal bottlenecks resulting in a slower achievement of targets, a delay in activities
caused by the use of an ineffective financial management and procurement agent during
the first years of the project, the lack of Superior Council meetings throughout the life of
the project (4 meetings in 8 years), and the complexity of the decision-making process
resulting from the participation of multiple implementing agencies. In terms of
achievement of targets, the Report points out the Project’s failure to make the SIICAR
fully operational, the delay in the demarcation of the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca as a result of
delays in receiving the National Limits Commission’s reports, and the Project’s failure to
reduce the time required in order to obtain a title to less than 12 to 18 months. However,
as part of the Project’s sustainability plan, the ANATI was created in October 2010. This
new institution will be responsible for the regularization of all Panamanian territory, and
will administer the country’s geographic information system moving forward. In addition,
under new Inter-American Development Bank funding, ANATI will complete the
regularization process for approximately 23,000 records that were not able to be
completed with World Bank financing.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Land Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework (US$7.29 million
actual cost)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This component aims to provide the policy, legal and institutional framework required to
address Project objectives as well as the capacity needed by relevant entities and
organizations in order to deliver land administration services and implement Project
activities. In the original Project design, there were six sub-components:

(1) Land policy, legal and institutional reforms, through which a series of land policy and
accompanying legal reforms addressing simplification of land titling procedures, sales
and rental markets, protected areas and other conservation units, indigenous comarcas
and territories, and land valuation and taxations systems, would eliminate contradictory
incentive structures and overlapping jurisdictional responsibilities. Activities in this sub-
component included policy formulation through the Superior Council, development of
proposals, studies and participatory workshops for legal and regulatory reforms, and
support for the development of institutional reforms within the governmental entities
working in land administration in both rural and urban areas.

(2) Institutional Strengthening. This sub-component would provide support for activities
aimed at institutional strengthening (including focus on human resources, organizational
and technological needs) of national and local entities involved in land administration and
for the development of co-management mechanisms at the local level. Activities included
the establishment and maintenance of an Integrated System of Cadastre and Registry
Information (SIICAR), targeted human resources development, support for the
decentralization of national entities, and support for studies, modeling and analysis to
establish sound and equitable cost recovery mechanisms through land valuation schemes.

(3) Establishment of inter-institutional co-management mechanisms. This sub-component
would support the necessary activities to establish and operate co-management
mechanisms both at the central and local level, with civil society.

(4) Local capacity building. This sub-component would seek the engagement of local
stakeholders and municipalities together with their strengthening for better participation
in project activities.

(5) Monitoring and Evaluation. This sub-component would establish an information
management system to monitor the management and efficiency of Project execution, as
well as a second system geared towards evaluation the economic, social and
environmental impact of the Project.

(6) Project administration. Under this sub-component, the PCU, under the Superior
Council (SC), would constitute a co-management mechanism in order to facilitate project



                                             28
planning and implementation. PCU functions include financial management and
reporting, entering operating agreements with the implementing agencies, overall Project
coordination, establishment of the Operational Technical Units (UTOS), implementing
standard management information systems in relation to the quantitative indicators of the
Project, quality control in land regularization activities, support for the administrative,
technical and financial capacity of the implementing entities, and ensuring civil society
information and participation in Project activities.

Following the Project restructuring, developing an integrated information system
(SIICAR) became the main focus of Component 2, and Project Administration and M&E
activities, which were previously under Component 1, were divided into a separate
component. In addition, regarding component targets, in the original Project design,
broad and un-quantified outcome indicators were mixed with output indicators. The
revised outcome indicators for all three components better measure the efficiency and
public benefit of a modernized land administration system in Panama. In terms of
component outputs, the indicator related to the establishment of alternative conflict
resolution mechanisms was reclassified as an output indicator of Component 1.

Component 1 outputs were partially implemented by the Project. One of the main
achievements of this component was the support it gave to the approval of several
legislative and regulatory measures aimed at improving Panama’s land administration
system (even if most of the laws passed were not directly promoted by the Project).
Preparation and validation of these laws was completed through approximately 80



                                                   29
meetings of the Technical Operational Committee (TCO) during the life of the Project.
These laws contributed to strengthening regional land administration capacity.

Component 2. Land Regularization Services (US$27.39 million actual cost)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

This component provided the necessary support to execute the technical and legal field
work required to contribute to the massive land regularization process within Project
areas. The transparent and participatory manner in which land regularization services
would be provided was considered critical to achieving consensus on land issues. In
terms of technology development and adoption, this component incorporated lessons
learned in other countries and facilitates the transfer of knowledge and capacity to local
service providers. The following sub-components provided the structure for delivering
land regularization services throughout the Project area:

(1) Geodesy and mapping. This sub-component includes modernizing the national
geodetic network as well as providing base maps necessary to conduct cadastral field
surveys. Activities related with this component include the update and densification of
the national geodetic network, the establishment of two CORS stations for geodetic
control through the continuous GPS city data registry, and the production of base maps.
In protected areas and indigenous territories within PRONAT areas, the activities
included mapping with aerial photographs or satellite images.

(2) Cadastral field surveys and titling process. In order to gather technical and legal
parcel-based information to complement the mapping activities, cadastral field surveys
would be executed. Cadastral surveys would be systematically carried out in the urban
(pueblos rurales, ejidos municipales, grandes ciudades) and rural areas subject to
regularization. The main activities of this component included: declaration of “cadastral
area? and public door-to-door campaigns; field surveys, legal cadastre and demarcation;
digitalization of geographic information; technical and juridical analyses; public viewing
of survey results; certification, titling, and registration; and integration of data into
SIICAR.

(3) Conflict resolution mechanisms. The success of the regularization process would
depend in many cases on the ability to resolve minor and major conflicts, or
informational discrepancies in the field. To facilitate resolution of land-related conflicts,
the Project would support the following activities: using juridical, administrative, and
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms; establishing conflict resolution teams;
carrying out dissemination campaigns; and providing training on the alternative dispute
resolution mechanism.

Following the Project restructuring output indicators for Component 2 were revised based
on the new Project scope. Specifically, land regularization targets in rural areas were
reduced by 30 percent, while in urban areas they were reduced by 25 percent. Following
the restructuring, the land regularization component would benefit 50,000 rural parcels

titles), as opposed to 75,000 rural parcels (issuance of 50,000 titles) and about 80,000
urban parcels (issuance of 54,000 titles) in the original estimates.

As a result of Component 2 activities, 74 percent of the total 110,000 parcels (urban and
rural) were surveyed, and a total of 16,544 titles out of a target of 27,000 were issued (61
percent of total target). Regarding urban vs. rural titling targets, the rural target of 12,000
issued titles was met, while the target for 15,000 urban titles issued was far from being
met. This result in urban areas was mostly due to delays and long and complicated
procedures necessary for the demarcation of urban areas (particularly ejidos municipales).
The demarcation process in urban areas requires the participation of a number of
institutions, while the same process in rural areas only involved two institutions. With
respect to the development of SIICAR, the system was completed by the end of the
Project; however, it is not yet fully operational. In addition, there are still some minor
processes which remain in a manual format, and the Ministry of Housing (MIVI) is not
yet incorporated into the system.

Component 3. Consolidation of Protected Areas and Indigenous Territories
(US$5.65 million actual cost)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The objective of this component was to demarcate and consolidate protected areas and
allow the legal recognition and demarcation of indigenous lands, along with the


                                                    31
establishment of several new protected areas and pending indigenous territories. The
following were the three sub-components:

(1) Consolidation of SINAP. This sub-component would promote the development of
additional information, delineate and demarcate boundaries, ensure the appropriate use of
existing protected areas within the Project area, and carry out support for the
establishment and demarcation of several technical studies for new protected areas. For
the 25 already existing protected areas, the Project would obtain preliminary information,
execute technical studies such as management plans, socio-economic and tenure studies
and ecological assessments, complete boundary demarcation, develop management plans,
carry out the regularization of internal tenure within protected areas, pilot approaches to
co-management in protected areas, and contribute to operational strengthening of
protected areas. For the 5 proposed new protected areas, the Project would complete
technical studies (tenure, social, and ecological assessments), set up the appropriate legal
foundations and draft decrees to establish the new protected areas, complete demarcation
and regularization activities, and develop management plans.

(2) Establishment and consolidation of protected areas. In indigenous areas already
legally established, activities would address the specific needs of the areas and would
include legalization, demarcation, regularization, base-line socio-economic studies and
management plans. For those indigenous areas that had yet to be established, the
activities financed by this component would include the execution of socio-economic and
tenure studies that would form the basis for agreement of consolidation measures among
the indigenous groups, third parties, and the state. Activities under this sub-component
included: completing technical studies to provide the foundation for regularization, the
legalization of the Comarca or Naso Teribe Territory, and review of the Carta Organica
of the Kuna Yala and/or Ngöbe-Buglé, the demarcation of indigenous territories (Kuna-
Yala, Ngöbe-Buglé, and Teribe), technical assistance for conflict resolution in indigenous
territories, public information and promotion of campaigns, and strengthening of
indigenous organizations and indigenous authorities.

(3) Establishment and consolidation of indigenous territories. The indigenous land sub-
component would address issues of both established and unestablished indigenous
reserves within the Project area, including: carrying out technical and baseline studies,
preparation of draft law and charter required to establish the Naso Teribe region; carrying
out the physical demarcation and ADR mechanisms of selected Comarcas; carrying out
public information campaigns among Indigenous Peoples regarding the land demarcation
and regularization process; and strengthening of the institutional capacity of indigenous
organizations.

Following the restructuring, Component 3 indicators were clarified, namely stating that
nine management plans for the other protected areas were to be completed.

                                Yala, Ngöbe-Buglé, and Chimán)

The main achievement of this component was completion of the demarcation of the
Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca. The co-management plan between the Ngöbe-Buglé territory and
the La Amistad International Park (PILA) protected area was completed but has not yet
been approved by ANAM. Another important partial achievement was the preparation of
a bill to create the Naso Comarca and its submission (twice) to the National Assembly.
Unfortunately, the bill was not approved by the Assembly. The Assembly passed Law 72
of 2008 which establishes a framework for regularization of Indigenous territories
generally and this was widely supported by most Indigenous Peoples groups. Also, under
this component, some 16 roundtables were established for conflict resolution, particularly
between 2001 and 2005. Another important partial achievement was the establishment of
6 management plans, approval of 3 new protected areas (Chogoró Palo Blanco, Escudo
de Veraguas, and Isla Caña/Isla Iguana), and demarcation works in 6 protected areas
(Portobelo National Park, Cerro Hoya National Park, Volcán Baru National Park/La
Amistad Pacifico International Park, Cerro Gaital Monument, Cerro Guacamaya, and
Cerro Cerrezuela).

Component 4. Project Administration and Monitoring (US$14.89 million actual
cost)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The main activities of this component, which was separated from Component 1 during
the Project restructuring, were the following: (1) capacity building of land administration
entities, including strengthening them to provide land administration services on a
decentralized basis; (2) development of a M&E system; and (3) strengthening the
capacity of the PCU.

The main indicators for this component were: (1) Annual Operating Plan and
procurement plan drafted every year on November 30; (2) M&E report issued every three
months; (3) Annual Auditing carried out.


                                                   33
Although submissions of reports was fairly consistent after the 2006 Project restructuring,
the main factors affecting the rating of this component were Project management suffered
from significant short-comings due to weak leadership at times, lack of continuous and
predictable budgetary allocations, and some internal control weaknesses that led to poor
management of contracts and resources.

Summary of the Borrower’s Final Report

Project Context. In 1967, with support from the US-sponsored Alliance for Progress,
Panama made its first effort towards building a cadastral registry for land and water
resources known as CATAPAN (Catastro de Tierra y Aguas de Panama). This initiative
covered 52 percent of Panama, mostly areas on the Pacific coast and on the Panama
Canal and Colon. Later in 1996, the Inter-American Development Bank supported a
Program to promote the modernization of agricultural services (PROMOSA) through
which 7 pilot districts were regularized in the Province of Veraguas. These pilot efforts
resulted in issuing 11,845 property titles; however, 70 percent of land parcels in Panama
still remained untitled. In this context, the Government of Panama approved the Panama
Land Administration Project, funded by World Bank Loan 7045-PAN, through Executive
Decree 124 of September 12, 2001. This Project designed a coordination agency
(PRONAT), and integrated six implementing institutions led by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance (MEF). In addition, the Project also integrated an additional Inter-American
Development Bank Loan of B/27.3 million.

Implementation. In October 2004, the World Bank’s Mid-Term Evaluation graded the
Project as Unsatisfactory; however, a new administration in Panama which took office in
September 2004 requested a restructuring and extension of the Project closing date from
December 2006 to December 2009. During the restructuring, discussions were held in the
Superior Council as the maximum authority of the Project, through which a restructuring
of the Project objectives and targets was approved, as well as a reduction in the amount
of counterpart funding. The narrowing of Project scope included a reduction in the initial
targets particularly in the areas of regularization and titling (the target was reduced from
80,000 issued titles to 27,000 and from 255,000 to 110,000 regularized parcels). In
addition, the restructuring focused on improving the M&E system, and most importantly,
named the Integrated Cadastre and Registry System (SIICAR) as the most important goal
of the Project. By 2007, the Project had achieved a significant improvement resulting
from new technical tools such as the Annual Operational Plans (Planes Operativos
Anuales), the frequent Technical Operational Committee (TCO) meetings, improved
M&E reports, and increased World Bank supervision.

It is important to highlight that there were several legal bottlenecks faced by the Project
during implementation, which resulted in a slower achievement of targets. Among the
most important were: the concept of Shared Management of Indigenous Territories
(Administración Compartida), which contradicted the legal authority of ANAM to
administer indigenous territories (Law 41 of 1998); the legal discrepancies between the
MEF and the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) on Law 37 of 1962; the
disagreement on the procedures for titling coastal areas; the lack of clarity on the borders
of the Comarca Ngöbe-Buglé Annex Areas; and the failure of the National Assembly to
approve the Law for the creation of the Naso Comarca.




                                            40
Regarding safeguard compliance, both Component 3.1 (Protected Areas) and Component
3.2 (Indigenous Territories) were implemented with the direct participation of Project
beneficiaries, as well as in compliance with the principle of free, prior, and informed
consultations. At the time that the Naso and Ngöbe-Buglé requests for inspection were
submitted to the Inspection Panel, 80 percent of the Project’s main targets for
Components 3.1 and 3.2 had already been completed and PRONAT no longer had any
operations in the conflict areas pointed out by the requesters. Although Components 3.1
and 3.2 were carried out in compliance with the Project’s implementation plan, the
Government agreed to implement specific corrective actions during the 6-month
extension period from December 2009 to June 2010. Regarding the demarcation of
protected areas, the Project took into consideration populations already living in these
areas and promoted conflict resolution mechanisms and zoning in Cerra Hoya National
Park and Portobelo National Park. In protected areas bordering with indigenous territory,
the Project promoted the co-management administrative model which was initially
proposed by the consulting firm Consultores Ecologicos de Panama (CEPSA).

Achievements and Shortcomings. The Project’s main achievements were:

      The creation of an adequate legal and institutional framework;
      The promotion of conservation of protected areas and the consolidation of
       indigenous territories;
      Updating national cartographic information;
      Complementarities between the World Bank and the Inter-American
       Development Bank Projects;
      Greater citizen participation achieved through the Superior Council;
      80 agreements and more than 120 Technical Operational Committee (TCO)
       meetings held during the life of the Project;
      Effective land regularization through contracts with large multinational firms;
      The use of mesas de diálogo (conflict resolution sessions) as a mechanism for
       reaching consensus among indigenous and non-indigenous beneficiaries;
      Training indigenous leaders and organizations as a way to promote consensus
       (more than 200 training sessions throughout the life of the Project);
      The demarcation of the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca; and
      Effective procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation
       systems.

The Project’s main shortcomings and difficulties were:

      The use of an ineffective financial management and procurement agent during the
       first years of the Project, which resulted in the delay of up to one year of Project
       activities.
      The Superior Council, which only met 4 times in 8 years of implementation;
      A weak implementation strategy for the SIICAR, which led to the Project’s
       failure to achieve an operational system by the end of the Project;
      The participation of multiple implementing agencies, which made the decision-
       making process more complex, thus delaying the achievement of Project targets;


                                            41
      Failure to reduce the time required in order to obtain a title to less than 12 to 18
       months;
      Failure to incorporate the Ministry of Housing (integrated into the Project during
       the restructuring) into the SIICAR.
      The delay in receiving reports from the National Limits Commission, which
       resulted in further delays in the demarcation of the Ngöbe-Buglé Annex Areas.

Results. The main achievement of Component 1 (Land Policy, Legal and Institutional
Framework) was the creation of new policies, the approval of 10 new laws related to the
land administration process, and the completion of 80 TCO meetings, which contributed
to the improvement of the land administration legal framework in Panama. Component 2
(Land Regularization) covered a total of 500,000 Ha, and achieved 96 percent of its target
with 106,000 regularized parcels, and 15,971 issued titles. The target for rural areas
(12,000 issued titles), was exceeded (12,411 issued titles), while the target for urban areas
(15,000 issued titles), was not met (3,204 issued titles). This result in urban areas was
mostly due to delays and long and complicated procedures for the demarcation of urban
areas (particularly ejidos municipales). The demarcation process in urban areas requires
the participation of a number of institutions, while the same process in rural areas only
involved two institutions. With respect to the development of SIICAR, the system was
completed by the end of the Project; however, it is not yet fully operational. In addition,
there are still some minor processes which remain in a manual format, and the Ministry
of Housing (MIVI) is not yet incorporated into the system.

The main achievement of Component 3 (Consolidation of Protected Areas and
Indigenous Territory) was the number of Mesas de Dialogo (conflict resolution sessions)
carried out efficiently between 2001 and 2005. In addition, 1,361 km of indigenous
territory were demarcated, 100 percent of the target value. Another main achievement
was the submission of the draft law for the creation of the Naso Comarca to the National
Assembly. Unfortunately, the Assembly did not approve the law and instead approved
Law 72 of 2008 recognizing the Naso Corregimiento. The Project also failed to achieve
the demarcation of the 13 km of Kuna Yala territory, mostly due to Government and
Kuna Congress opposition. Concerning protected areas, the Project achieved the
establishment of 9 management plans, and the demarcation of 281 km out of the 700 km
target value. The co-management area between the Ngöbe-Buglé and the La Amistad
National Park (PILA) protected area was not established due to opposition from ANAM.
Within Component 4 (Project Administration and Monitoring), operational costs
exceeded the budgeted amount; however, this Component provided the necessary
monitoring of field activities and budget in order to achieve the Project objectives.

Achievements during the extension period (January to June 2010) and Sustainability
Plan. In order to complete pending technical and administrative activities, the World
Bank approved a 6 month extension period from December 2009 to June 2010. During
this period, the Project completed specific corrective actions, particularly related to
regularization processes carried out during the life of the Project. In addition, the Project
also updated and revised the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) through eight
rounds of consultations. The Project also completed consultations on 14 of the 15 Annex


                                             42
Areas as part of the process to complete the demarcation of the Ngöbe-Buglé Annex
Areas. Concerning the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca, the Project completed the 67 km pending
demarcation. The Project also achieved an agreement between the two Naso kings for the
demarcation of the Naso Comarca.

On September 21 2010, Law 219 was approved creating the National Authority for Land
Administration (Autoridad National de Tierra – ANATI), which will be part of the
Ministry of Housing and Territorial Development (MIVIOT) and will absorb the
responsibilities of the Tommy Guardia Geographic Institute, the National Directorate of
Agrarian Reform, and the National Directorate of Cadastre. This new institution will be
the main implementing agency for all titling and land administration processes, will
achieve the regularization of all Panamanian territory, and will administer the country’s
geographic information system moving forward. In addition, under new Inter-American
Development Bank financing, ANATI will complete the regularization process for
approximately 23,000 records that were not able to be completed with World Bank
financing. The World Bank Project officially closed with 16,544 issued titles and 14,792
updated cadastral records.

                   Ref: Response to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR),
Loan Agreement 7045-PAN

Dear Mr. Jaramillo:

This letter is in reference to the Implementation Completion Report for the Project under
Loan 7045-PAN signed by the World Bank and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of
the Government of Panama to finance the National Land Administration Program
(PRONAT).

We would like to submit our comments in relation to the rating given to the borrower in
the above mentioned report, which are submitted in the following order:

Project Design

It is important to highlight that the design framework established during the preparation
stage of this operation complicated the achievement of the project’s general and more
specific objectives during implementation. We think that this flaw is the result of
implementation arrangements which were not in accordance with the reality of
institutional service needs.

Evidence for this lies in the challenges faced during implementation with respect to the
definition of the Program’s implementing agencies, starting from adequate coordination
for decision making and including compliance with both internal and external controls
related to project implementation. We find an example of this in the mechanisms used for
operating the technical operation units whose structural and functional designs were not
compatible with the functions of implementing agencies (DINRA, Cadastre, MIVI,
ANAM, Tommy Guardia, etc.).


                                            46
With respect to the above mentioned points, the Bank should have adopted mechanisms
for reevaluating the proposed design. To this end, the National Government requested to
the Bank a restructuring of the program in 2006; however, this restructuring focused on
cosmetic rather than substantive issues.

Project Supervision

With respect to this topic, our main comment is regarding the lack of an adequate Bank
supervision strategy focused on preventive policies that would result in greater efficiency
and effectiveness, both in terms of the Project’s financial management as well as
adequate monitoring of the proposed activities.

An example of this is the application and compliance of the controls established in the
loan agreement and the various policy manuals of the Bank which borrowers are required
to abide by. The proper attention related to the objective recognition of the contracts and
its financial outlays in several instances, the Bank did not confront them with the essence
of its operational manuals which resulted in the Project Coordination Unit
disproportionately increasing its administrative expenditures to 230% of the expected
level, which goes against the principle of adequate performance (sic).

Best regards,


Dulcidio de la Guardia
Viceminister of Finance and
General Coordinator of PRONAT
