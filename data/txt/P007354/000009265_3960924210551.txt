PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HONDURAS
FIRST AND SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECTS
(Loans 1659-HO and 2075-HO)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The two loans under review in this report were the first two
industrial credit loans made to Honduras to support FONDEI's operations as
a second-tiet institution. The loans were in tne amounts of US$15.0
million and US$30.0 million respectively. FONDEI was established in 1978,
and started operations with the first loan. The Bank's principal objective
under these two loans was to help establish and strengthen an effective
system to provide term financing for financially sound and economically
efficient investment projects of mainly small- and medium-sized firms.
Secondary objectives Lo_ussed on the institutional development of other
Honduran institutions, namely Corporacion Hondurena de Desarrollo Forestal
(COHDEFoR) under the first loan, Corporacion Nacional de Inversiones
(CONADI) under the second loan, and Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI)
under both. Project implementation has been reasonably smooth and loan
fund utilization relatively timely (para. 3.01-3.06 ff.) in light of the
difficult economic circumstances that the country faces (para. 1.03).
2.        The loans have been considerably more successful with respect to
their primary than to their secondary objectives. FONDEI has developed
into a reasonably sound institution which has already contributed
significantly to industrial development in Honduras, and which finances a
substantial percentage of commercial banks' industrial portfolios (paras
5.02-5.04).  Stability in FONDEI's management and the fact that it is a
second-tier institution in the central bank have contributed importantly to
FONDEI's development. While FONDEI has experienced many of the growing
pains to be expected in a second-tier institution, it has made considerable
progress under the two loans. For example, it has resolved, for the most
part, initial weaknesses in the areas of subproject preparation, appraisal
and superviUion (paras. 4.05 and 4.09). Similarly, subproject processing
time has declined significantly over the life of the two loans (para.
4.08). The technical assistance component for FONDEI included under the
second loan helped FONDEI to overcome these and other weaknesses (para.
4.18).
3.        There are still many areas in which FONDEI requires further
strengthening, such as organizational structure and information system
management (paras. 4.04 and 4.10 respectively) and diversification of
financing sources (para. 4.12). Technical assistance under the second loan
(there was no technical assistance component under the first loan) provided
effective support for FONDEI's institutional development (para. 4.18).
Further assistance to FONDEI in these and other areas Is planned under the
ongoing third loan.



- vii -
4.        The participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) have also made
progress under the loans with respect to subproject preparation, appraisal
and supervision (para. 4.06 ff.), although this progress has been much
slower than anticipated. Some PFIs have assigned specific st%ff to such
work on a full-time basis and have provided the necessary training. This
area is a major focus of concern under the third loan approved in May 1986.
5.        The subprojects financed by FONDEI have generally had a positive
impact, with significant employment generation (paras. 3.16-3.19).
Investment cost per job, however, has been considerably higher than
anticipated at appraisal, reaching around US$14,000 and US$15,000
respectively under the first and second loans, based on a sample of
subprojects. It may be that these figures are overstated for some firms
which are not working at capacity and are therefore not fully staffed.
6.        While FONDEI has financed sound subprojects, some PFIs have
experienced problems with subloan recoveries under the First Project (para.
5.09). About 20% of the original loan amount is outstanding for over six
months. The main reason for the relatively poor loan recovery has been the
unrealistic maturities FONDEI had allowed during its initial years of
operation (para 3.10). However, a comprehensive review of all subloans was
carried out by FONDEI in late 1984, and an action plan including
rescheduling of subloan maturities and provision of fresh working capital
was initiated by FONDEI in conjunction with the commercial banks.
Recoveries have improved since then, and it is estimated that overall bad
debts under the project would result from 7 subprojects representing 6% of
the original loan amount. Under the Second Project, FONDEI has greatly
improved its evaluation practices, including the preparation of  cash flow
projections for each subproject. Moreover, FONDEI's improved subloan
repayment monitoring system permits it to follow more closely the problem
subprojects in its portfolio. As a result, the arrears under the Second
Project are minimal.
7.        Under the first loan, the Bank expected COHDEFOR to play an
important role as financial intermediary, channelling US$6.0 million to the
wood and wood products sector (para. 3.03), leading the Bank to pursue
significant institutional development objectives for COHDEFOR (para.
4.20). After a change in management, COHDEFOR apparently lost interest in
the loan, and, as a result, the Bank was unable to achieve these objectives
or to make a significant contribution to development of the forestry sector
in Honduras (para. 4.21 ff.).
8.        Under the second loan, the Bank was requested by the Government
to provide technical assistance to CONADI to help tnis important
institution resolve its severe financial problems (para. 4.22 ff.). The
Bank and the Government/CONADI agreed upon an action plan in late 1982,but
this plan was not completely implemented, following changes in CONADI's
management and staff (para. 4.23). Although this technical assistance was
only partially successful at the time, the framework established under the
action program is now proving useful in renewed efforts to resolve CONADI's
problems.



- viii -
9.        The Bank has also pursued, under both loans, the objective of
building and strengthening technical assistance services for small scale
industries (SSIs) through CBI (paras. 2.07 and 2.09). While CDI received
technical assistance from UNIDO during the implementation of the first
loan, no Bank technical assistance to, or direct involvement with, CDI was
planned. This is despite the fact that one of the stated objectives of the
Bank project was to strengthen CDI's support for SMI development (para.
2.05).   Under the second loan, however, the Bank cofinanced, with UNDP, a
UNIDO-executed technical assistance program for CDI. This program was
relatively successful, bearing in mind the constraints facing CDI
(para. 4.29 ff.).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HONDURAS
FIRST AND SECOND INDUSTRIAL CWTT PROJECTS
(Loans 1659-HO and 2075-HO)
I. INTRODUCTION
Bank Industrial Sector Lending Activity.
1.01      Bank lending to support the Honduran industrial sector to date
consists of three industrial credit projects, totalling US$82.0 million,
the first two of which are reviewed in this report.  The third operation is
in an early stage of implementation, having been approved by the Board on
May 29, 1986 (Loan 2703-HO). All three loans have been channelled through
the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI), which was established
in 1978 by the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). FONDEI is a second-tier
institution specializing in financing industrial and tourisml/
development.
1.02       The Bank has been associated with FONDEI since its inception,
with the first industrial credit project (Loan 1659-HO for US$15.0 million)
approved in February 1979, and a second such project (Loan 2075-HO for
US$30.0 million) approved in December 1981. This report covers the
implementation period from 1979 to 1986 and examines the impact of the two
loans with respect to: (a) the institutional development of FONDEI and, to
a lesser extent, the participating financial intermediaries (PFIs),
including those that were expected to play a special role during prc !t
implementation, and (b) the technical assistance component included U.ler
the second project.
Country Econcmic Xnviroo ent
1.03      Honduras is the poorest country in Central America, with a per
capita income of only US$730 in 1985. The economy grew rapidly during the
1970s, propelled by improvements in the terms of trade and the availability
of external financing. However, from 1980 to 1983 economic conditions
deteriorated because of a combination of a drop in coffee prices, the
drying-up of private bank lending, and the severe worsening of the
political climate in Central America. Employment creation fell behind the
/ Loan 1673-HO, a US$19.5 million tourism development loan approved in
FY79, included a US$16.0 million tourism credit component channelled
through FONDEI.



rate of growth of the labor force, and unemployment increased to an
estimated 25% in 1984. Wages behaved moderately throughout the 1980-85
period.
1.04       In November 1982, the Government of Honduras reached a standby
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the basis of its
stabilization and economic recovery program. The agreement was suspended
in 1983 when the fiscal targets were not met. In 1984 and 1985, the public
sector deficit averaged 10.8% of GDP. In 1984, 74% of this deficit was
financed from external sources. During the implementation of the two
projects, the Government continued to maintain an exchange rate which has
been fixed at L2.0:US$1 for nearly 60 years. In 1982, the Government
introduced exchange controls to stem the loss of reserves, and since then,
some foreign exchange transactions have taken place outside the Central
Bank's controls at a rate that rose to L2.8:US$1 in 1985. This rate is now
much closer to the official rate, owing to massive external financing being
received by Honduras. Initially, the investments under the Bank> loans were
also affected by the strict exchange control and import restrictions, but
later the Central Bank allowed automatic access to foreign exchange for
industrial investors using FONDEI lines of credit (para 3.06).
Manufacturing Sector.
1.05    Value added in the manufacturing sector accounts for only 15% of
GDP compared to 14% in 1975 which indicates that sectoral growth has, on
average, barely exceeded total growth. Manufacturing employs about 90,000
people, almost 8% of the economically active population. According to the
1975 industrial census (the most recent), the sector comprised 849 firms
with five or more employees. Of these 849 firms, 478 had up to 19
employees, and 290 had 20 to 99 employees, while only 81 had 100 or more.
These 849 firms accounted for about 37,000 jobs, with the remaining jobs in
the sector being attributable to artisans and firms employing fewer than
five persons. The limited domestic market has constrained the sector's
development. Export promotion efforts have not been strong enough to turn
it into a leading sector. In the 1980s, stagnation and crisis in the
sector brought a sudden end to the buoyancy of the 19709, largely due to
the foreign exchange shortage provoked by the drying up of foreign capital
inflows and aggravated by capital flight, and to the collapse the Central
American Common Market. As a result, manufacturing output declined sharply
in 1982 and 1983. Although it recovered in 1984, it fell again in 1985,
leaving sectoral output still 5% below its 1980 level. Accelerating
economic and sectoral growth and employment creation will need a major
private sector investment effort, requiring a favorable investment
climate.
II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL OBJECTIVES OF THE LOANS
Preparation of Loan 1659-HO.
2.01    An initial project brief based on desk work was prepared in May
1977; this was followed by an exploratory mission in June 1977, and an



- 3 -
identification mission in October 1977. At the time, a substantial number
of private investment projects in Honduras requiring external financing had
been identified by various institutions, such as the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) the Honduran Corporacion Nacional de Inversiones (CONADI
- see para. 2.03 below), and the Corporacion Hondurena de Desarrollo
Forestal (COHDEFCR), the national institution responsible for managing all
Honduran forest resources and financing related investments.
2.02     The proposed objectives of the Bank's lending strategy, as set out
in the project brief, were to: (i) emphasize participation of small- and
medium-scale industries (SMIs) both in lending and associated technical
assistance; (ii) strengthen the capability of existing public and private
institutions to service the industrial sector; (iii) minimize industrial
development's drain on public sector resources; and (iv) address Honduran
industrial sector policies in the context of an overall approach to the
growth of Central American economies.
2.03       The new government-owned institution, Corporation Nacional de
Inversiones (CONADI) had recently been set up (1974). It emphasized the
development of new, primarily large-scale public, private and mixed
Honduran-owned enterprises. In addition, in 1977, Banco Nacional de
Fomento (BANAFOM) wit'hidrew from small- and medium-scale industry financing
in order to focus on its agricultural lending activities, leaving SMIs
without an effective source of term credit or institutional assistance. In
the absence of an efficient structure for SMI credit operations, BCH
proposed to establish an industrial credit channel with adequate staff and
loanable resources. This facility would channel resources to the wood
subsector through COHDEFOR and to SMis through existing financial
intermediaries. After reviewing the feasibility of such a mechanism versus
alternatives such as expanding CONADI's lending functions to include all
SMIs, or CONADI operating an industrial credit rediscount facility, it was
agreed that the Central Bank's suggestion to establish a new "SME lending
window" be pursued.  This view was supported by the Ministries of Finance
and Economy.
2.04       The project was preappraised in February 1978 and appraised in
May 1978, with no critical new issues being identified. Project processing
continued smoothly through the Loan Committee and negotiations stages while
BCH took the necessary steps to establish FONDEI. At the same time,
COHDEFOR and CTI (Centro Tecnico Industrial, the predecessor of CDI, the
Centro de Desarrollo Industrial, responsible for providing technical
assistance to SMIs) took the measures required for their participation in
the project. The Bank loan of US$15.0 million to the Republic of Honduras
was approved by the Board of Directors on February 6, 1979 and the Loan
documents were signed on March 8, 1979.
Appraisal Objectives of Loan 1659-HO.
2.05      The first project was designed to support the Government's
industrial strategy and to assist the Government in meeting its principal
objectives for developing the industrial sector, which included promoting
and helping to sustain rapid and efficient growth of industrial output,
exports and employment. Specifically, the project was to assist the



- 4 -
government to achieve these objectives by: (a) establishing an effective
system to provide term financing for financially sound and economically
efficient investment projects of mainly small and medium-sized industrial
firms; (b) helping COHDEFOR to finance priority investments designed to
upgrade efficiency and increase output in the primary and secondary wood
industry sectors; (c) assisting industrialists to improve the quality and
thoroughness of their investment planning; (d) encouraging commercial banks
to increase term lending to SMI's, based on sound project appraisal
techniques; and (e) building an effective service of technical assistance
to the smaller industrtal enterprises through CDI.
2.06        The loan proceeds were to be onlent to BCH to enable FONDEI to
carry out the project, which consisted of a US$15.0 million credit with
various allocations for subprojects to be financed by COHDEFOR, sublending
to small firms, etc. There was no technical assistance component under the
loan. UNDP had agreed to finance two or three consultant years of external
technical assistance to help CDI build its small industry assistance
program. It was expected that the subprojects financed would have a
significant economic impact with, in particular, the generation of about
4,000 new jobs at an average investment cost per job of US$6,800 through
about 165 subprojects with a total cost of US$28.0 million equivalent. The
relatively low investment cost per job estimate was based on the
expectation that about 60% of sublending would go to the relatively highly
labor-intensive wood, construction materials and metal products
industries. The wood industry component of the project alone was expected
to account for almost 2,450 new jobs, at an average investment cost of
US$5,300 per job, due to an emphasis on financing labor-intensive medium-
and small-scale primary and secondary wood product projects; these projects
were largely to benefit families with relatively low income levels, living
in the small rural towns and villages of the Comayagua forest region.
Preparation of Loan 2075-HO.
2.07      During a Bank supervision mission for the first project in
October 1980, the Bank was requested to consider preparing a second
industrial credit project since it was expected that the first loan would
be fully committed by end-1981. A Bank mission accordingly visited
Honduras in January-February 1981 to undertake preparation/preappraisal of
the second project. Giveui COHDEFOR's inability to commit most of the
US$6.0 million allocated to it under the first project (para. 3.04), and
following discussions with COHDEFOR's management, it was decided that
CORDEFOR should participate as a financial intermediary in the second
project, with no specific allocation of loan resources made in advance.
CONADI also expressed interest in receiving a Bank loan, primarily for
agroindustry. However, CONADI was in a difficult financial situation for a
number of reasons, including an inadequate capital base and a significant
arrearage problem in its lending portfolio. It was therefore decided that
a more appropriate initial form of assistance to CONADI might be through a
technical assistance component in the second loan. The desirability of
including a technical assistance component to help (i) strengthen FONDEI's
operating systems, as well as (ii) the functioning of the PFIs, including
CDI, was also considered at that time. UNDP indicated that it would be
prepared to cofinance such technical assistance with the Bank.



2.08        The project was appraised in May 1981.  Major issues addressed
during appraisal, in addition to that already discussed, were FONDEI's
onlending interest rate and the interest rate to final beneficiaries, the
introduction of a guarantee mechanism to encourage lending by financial
intermediaries for small-scale enterprises (SSI's), and the need to reach
agreement with the Government on appropriate revision of its draft export
promotion law (agreement on this issue between the Government and the Bank
was required by the IMF in the context of its negotiations with Honduras
(para. 1.04)). Because of a significant increase in the rate of inflation,
it was felt that the interest rate to final beneficiaries needed to be
raised substantially above the 12% prevailing under the first project. The
possibility of financing tourism subprojects was also reviewed at FONDEI's
request, but finally rejected by tile Bank, partly because of substantial
amounts remaining to be committed under the Tourism Development Loan, as
well as due to the difficult Central American situation, which was likely
to discourage further significant development of the sector.
Appraisal Objectives of Loan 2075-HO.
2.09      The Bank loan of US$30.0 million was approved by the Board on
December 22, 1981, and the Loan documents were signed on May 19, 1982.
Overall project objectives remained the same under the second project as
under the first.  Specifically, the project was to assist in their
achievement by: (i) providing term lending through FONDEI for financially
and economically sound investment subprojects of small and medium-sized
enterprises; (ii) encouraging the building of an effective system within
Honduras to generate sound industrial investment projects; (iii) supporting
FONDEI's efforts to upgrade the project appraisal and supervision
capabilities of participating intermediaries and strengthening FONDEI's
operating system; and (iv) strengtitening technical assistance services to
the smaller industrial enterprises through CDI.
2.10        In addition to continuing the positive institutional development
activities initiated under the first project, the second project was to
help fill a gap in the financing of efficient industrial projects in
Honduras at a time when the financial system lacked long-term resources to
cover industrial investment needs. The project was expected to finance
some 200-225 investment subprojects involving total investment costs of
about US$47.4 million, focusing on a wide range of small and medium-sized
enterp:'ses. The economic rate of return of typical individual subprojects
was expected to exceed 25%, and the subprojects were expected to have a
substantial employment impact, generating about 4,200 new jobs at an
average total investment cost per job of about US$11,300 in 1981 prices.
Total output of the subprojects was estimated at about US$44.0 million a
year (an investment to annual capital output ratio of about 1:1), of which
about US$14.0 million would be for exports. Project impact was expected to
be dispersed geographically, with agroindustrial projects focused mainly
along the north coast and in the southwest of the country.
2.11        The extent to which the appraisal objectives of the first two
loans, including the specific institution-building objectives, were
achieved is described and reviewed in Chapters III to V.



III.  UTILIZATION OF LOUN POCEEDS
Resource Trafer
3.01       Rate of Utilization under Loan 1659-ItO.   The loan became
effective five months after Board approval, on July 5, 1979. The first
disbursement was made during the first quarter of 1980. The original
commitment and closing dates were December 31, 1981 and December 31, 1983,
respectively. The commitment date was subsequently extended to June 30,
1982 and then to June 30, 1983. The loan was closed as of June 19, 1985,
and the undisbursed balance of US$1.4 million was cancelled.
3.02      Loan commitments were initially slow because of FONDEI's
inexperience in working with the Bank and weak demand from the
participating financial intermediaries (PFIs), COHDEFCR in particular.
Subsequently, however, the pace of commitments picked up, as a result of
improl'ements in subloan processing. FONDEI initially had also some
difficulty committing the amounts allocated for small-scale industry but,
with the introduction of CDI as a financial intermediary (para. 3.04), it
redressed the situation. The transfer to FONDEI of the resources initially
assigned to COHDEFCR (para. 3.04), along with the slower than expected
commitment of resources to small-scale industry, caused the commitment date
to be extended to June 1983.
3.03      Loan Components tnder Loan 1659-HO.   The loan proceeds were
intended to assist FONDEI in financing investment projects of industrial
firms, with specific initial allocations as follows: (a) US$6.0 million
equivalent for investment projects to be financed by COHDEFOR; (b) no less
than US$2.5 million equivalent for sublending to small firms (those with
total assets, excluding land and buildings, of less than US$100,000
equivalent); (c) no participating intermediary other than COHDEFCR was to
commit more than US$2.5 million equivalent in Bank resources as sub-loans,
with sub-loans to small firms being excluded froiu this limit; and (d) no
participating intermediary was to grant a sub-loan exceeding US$750,000
equivalent for any one investment project or investment enterprise, except
that the corresponding limit for COHDEFCR was US$1.5 million equivalent.
An initial free limit of US$250,000 for autonomous subloan approval was
established for FONDEI.
3.04      A number of changes were made to these allocations during project
implementation. In late 1980 COHDEFCR's allocation was reduced to US$3.0
million equivalent, given the lack of demand from COHDEFOR, and the
favorable prospects for fairly rapid utilization of these resources by
FONDEI. At the same time, the restriction on other financial intermediaries
limiting the total participation of each to US$2.5 million of Bank
resources was raised to US$3.25 million of Bank funds. In addition, CDI
was included as a PFI under the project but, in line with its mandate to
help the smallest firms was only authorized to finance subloans of small
firms with total fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, of not more
than US$40,000 equivalent. Subsequently, COHDEFOR's allocation was further
reduced, first to US$231,262, which amount corresponded to the only
COHDEFOR sub-loan pending, and then to zero, when FONDEI did not approve
this subloan and COHDEFOR appeared to have no further pipeline.
(Subsequently, one COHDEFOR subproject was approved, with COHDEFOlR treated
as any other participating financial intermediary.)



-7-
3.05      hate of Utilization under Loan 2075-HO.   The loan became
effective on August 16, 1982, eight months after Board approval and almost
three months after the loan documents were signed, due to delays in
receiving the necessary legal evidence and opinions. The first
disbursement was made in the last quarter of 1982. Originally, the
commitment and closing dates were December 31, 1984 and June 30, 1986
respectively. The commitment date was extended first to December 31, 1985
and, more recently, to June 30, 1986; the closing date has been extended to
June 30, 1987.
3.06      Loan commitments were slower than anticipated because of the
uncertain political and economic situation in Central America; the slack
demand caused by the world recession, and the imposition of cumbersome
foreign exchange allocation procedures which restricted imports of
industrial goods. The pace of commitmer.ts improved considerably, however,
from 1984 on, as demand for loan funds increased following a relaxation in
FONDEI's operating regulations, and the simplification of the import
procedures under the project. More specifically, the Bank agreed to an
amendment in FONDEI's "Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations"
which increased from 40% to 50% the maximum share of permanent working
capital financing in the aggregate investment subloan amount that FONDEI
would cover.  Furthermore, firms having already received subloans could
apply for a complementary permanent working capital subloan, up to the 50%
limit.  Concerning foreign exchange, BCH agreed, at the suggestion of
FONDEI, in 1983, that imported goods and services financed by FONDEI be
exempted from the regular import procedures, reducing the time required to
receive an import permit to five days. FONDEI disbursements also
accelerated as it increasingly made use of the Bank's direct payment
procedure. The average processing time was halved by the establishment of
a special account in 1985 with an initial deposit of US$2.5 million.
3.07        Loan Components under Loan 2075-Ho.   The second project
consisted of two components, the first intended to assist in financing
specific investment projects of industrial enterprises in Honduras (US$28.7
million), and the second to finance technical assistance programs for
FONDEI, CDI, and CONADI (US$350,000, US$700,000 and US$250,000
respectively). Few changes were made to these allocations during project
implementation, except that the limit for the aggregate outstanding
sub-loans to a single firm was increased from US$1.25 million to US$2.0
million in 1984. The project also specified that no less than US$4.0
million should be used for sublending to small investment enterprises
(those with fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, but including the
fixed assets to be financed under the proposed investment project, of less
than US$150,000 equivalent). In addition, no participating intermediary
was to commit more than the equivalent of US$7.5 million in Bank resources,
with sub-loans to small firms being excluded from this limit. The free
limit for subloans was increased to US$400,000 equivalent.
Characteristics of Lendiog
3.08       Through the two industrial credit Loans FONDEI has financed to
date, 402 subprojects: 207 under the First Loan and 195 under the Second.
It had been estimated at appraisal that the First Loan would finance about



165 subprojects, and the Second some 200-225 subprojects. The
larger-than-expected number of subprojects financed under the First
Loan is largely explained by the almost total lack of participation of
COHDEFOR and CONADI as intermediaries (one subproject each), whereas they
had been expected jointly to account for about half the Loan amount through
financing relatively large subprojects. Total investment costs under the
First Loan had been estimated at US$28.0 million; they actually exceeded
US$31.8 million. Similarly, total investment costs under the Second Loan,
estimated at about US$47.4 million, have, in fact, exceeded US$64 million
(c.f. Annex 5). The increase in project costs was essentially due to the
higher than expected contribution by the subloan beneficiaries.
3.09       Subloan Size and Maturities.   Under the First project, the
average FONDEI loan amounted to US$88,000 which included Bank funds
(subloans) averaging US$65,700, compared with a subloan average af
US$91,000 estimated at appraisal. Under the Second project average FONDEI
loan and Bank subloan sizes have been considerably larger, at about
US$183,000 and US$147,000 respectively. Under the First project, nine
firms received subloans, representing almost US$3.8 million in Bank
resources, above the US$250,000 free limit; under the Second project, 18
subprojects, using about US$13.5 million in Bank funds, were above the new
free limit of US$400,000, with 32 subprojects above US$250,000. Under the
First project, FONDEI made subloans of up to US$40,000 equivalent to 98
firms, and subloans between US$40,000 and US$100,000 equivalent to a
further 57 firms. Under the Second project, these figures declined to 63
and 51 firms, respectively. 2/ While the increase in averave subloan size
may not be altogether desirable, it partly reflects the repayment problems
experienced under the First Loan, principally affecting smaller
subprojects, which led some PFIs to focus on lending to somewhat larger
firms under the Second Loan; it should also be mentioned that the targets
for lending to small-scale enterprises have been met under both Loans. A
further factor tending to increase the size of subloans under the Second
Loan was the suspension of CONADI's lending operations (paras. 4.26 ff.)
and the consequent referral of many larger scale firms to FONDEI for
financing.
3.10      Under the First Loan, 130 of the 207 subloans (63%) had
maturities not exceeding five years, of which 11 subloans (5%) had
maturities not exceeding three years. In addition, 46 subleans (22%) had
grace periods of between nil (seven subloans) and six months; a further 142
subprojects (69%) had one year's grace. These relatively short maturities
and, in particular, very short grace periods contributed significantly to
subloan repayment difficulties under the First Loan (para 5.09 below).
During the latter part of the commitment period of the First Loan, and
particularly under the Second Loan, FONDEI has paid greater attention to
2/ The figures given here for subloans above US$250,000 and for subloans
up to US$100,000 are not strictly comparable, since the former are
based on data indicating use of Bank resources only, while the latter
are based on use of FONDEI resources (including the Bank's funds).
Thus, the number of subloans using less than US$100,000 of Bank funds
is almost certainly somewhat greater than suggested here.



repayment capacity when a'ialyzing subprojects. This was reflected in the
subloan maturities under the Second Loan, with only 46 subloans (23%)
having maturities up to five years, while 87 (45%) had maturities of 5 to 7
years, and 62 (32%) hai maturities in excess of seven years. With respect
to grace periods, the bulk are still at one year (108 subloans, 55%), but
81 subloans (41%) carried grace periods of two years or more, as opposed to
only 17 subloans (8%) under the First Loan.
3.11      Subproiect Characteristics.   The Bank's participation in total
investment costs under the two Loans has been about 43%, as opposed to the
53% projected *nder the First Loan (Annex 5). Financial intermediaries
have financed 10% of investment costs, as required, and FONDEI has financed
almost 12%, somewhat lower than the 17% expected.  As a result, firms' own
financing has averaged 34%, considerably higher than the 20% average
expected. Firms may have self-financed such a high proportion of their
investment costs in order to minimize interest expenses and/or because of
the PFI's stringent policies. The high participation requirements may have
excluded several viable subprojects which could not afford the high
counterpart funding demands of PFI's.
3.12      Machinery and equipment financing accounted for 68% of total
subloan amounts under each of the two Loans; under the First Loan, the
remainder was almost evenly split between financing buildings and working
capital (16% each), while under the Second Loan the share of building
financing declined to 13% as working capital needs absorbed 19% of FONDEI
financing.3/ Of the 207 subloans under the First Loan, 65 (31%) went to
new firms, receiving 40% of FONDEI subloan amounts; under the Second Loan,
66 subloans (34%) went to new firms, representing 35% of subloan amounts.
This quite high proportion of subloans and financing suggests that FONDEI
has been fairly successful in helping to promote the development of new
industrial enterprises.
3.13      Sub-borrower Characteristics.   Under both loans, the subprojects
have been reasonably well distributed among subsectors, with the
distribution roughly corresponding to the various subsectors' share in
manufacturing value-added. Three subsectors in particular have accounted
for 65% of FONDEI's lending: the food and beverages subsector alone has
accounted for 26% of subloans by number and 32% by value, the metal
products subsector has taken 16% of subloans and 17% of their value, and
chemical products have absorbed 16% of FONDEI resources for 13% of subloans
by number. The textiles and apparel subsector has absorbed 17% of subloans
by number, but only 12% by value; non-metallic minerals account for 10% of
subloans, both by number and by value; paper and printing has received 8%
of the financing through 6% of the subloans, while wood and wood products,
and other manufacturing have received respectively 4% and 1% of FONDEI
funds through 9% and 3% of the subloans.
3, Again, these figures represent use of FONDEI financing, including Bank
resources. FONDEI's information system monitors the use of all funds
channelled through FONDEI, rather than only Bank funds.



- 10 -
3.14      While the average subloan size has been considerably larger under
the Second Loan than .der the First (para. 3.09), the distribution by
asset size of sub-borrowers has not changed substantially. Thus, while the
First Loan financed 35 firms with assets of up to US$40,000 equivalent,
allocating 2% of FONDEI financing to them, 54 such firms were financed
under the Second Loan, receiving 4% of FONDEI financing. Similarly, 63
firms with assets over US$250,000 equivalent were financed under the First
Loan, receiving 68% of FONDEI's financing, and 57 such firms were financed
under the Second Loan with 71% of total subloan values. Expressed
differently, 50% of subloans went to firms with less than US$100,000
equivalent in assets under the First Loan; such firms received 47% of the
subloans under the Second Loan.
3.15      The two projects have been moderately successful with respect to
achieving a reasonable geographic distribution of subprojects. almost half
the subprojects are located in and around San Pedro Su a, the major
industrial city, with a further 28% located in and around the capital,
Tegucigalpa. Thn remaining 23%, alowever, are quite broadly distributed
across the country, in 12 other departments (regions), and have received
13% of FONDEI financing under the two Loans to date. The Comayagua region,
in particular, received only nine subloans, fewer than had been hoped for
under the First Loan alone, since COHDEFOR did not participate in the
projects as had been expected.
Inpact of Subprojects
3.16      Employment Generation and Investment Cost per Job.   Based upon
the subproject appraisals, i.e. the ex-ante data, 3,720 jobs were created
under the First Loan, at an average investment cost per job of about
US$8,500 in current terms. These results compare reasonably favorably to
the Bank appraisal estimates of 4,000 jobs at an average cost of US$6,800
in 1978 prices, bearing in mind that the wood industry, which had been
expected to be a major source of low investment cost jobs under the Loan,
received little investment (para. 2.06). Under the Second Loan, again
based on the ex-ante data, for subloans approved up to year-end 1985, 3,711
jobs were to be created, at an average investment cost per job of about
US$17,300 in current terms. This figure compares less favorably to
appraisal expectations of some 4,200 new jobs at an average cost of about
US$11,300 in 1981 prices.
3.17      The tables shown in Annex 7(a) and (b) give estimated (ex-ante)
and actual (ex-post) data for a sample of subprojects under both Loans, and
the comparisons are quite revealing since the tables show considerable
differences between the estimated and the actual figures in all categories
considered. Under the First Loan, it was estimated that the 36 subprojects
sampled would, in aggregate, generate 652 jobs, whereas actual employment
generation has been 461 jobs. Under the Second Loan, however, the 35
subprojects sampled were expected to generate a total of 500 jobs, but have
actually generated 622 jobs. The sample suggests that the actual
employment impact of the Loans has been about as positive as had been
expected.
3.18      Investment cost per job, however, on the baais of the sample, #as
considerably higher than expected under the First Loan: the average



- 11 -
estimated for the 36 subprojects sampled was US$8,600 equivalent (almost
identical with the overall average ex-ante figure of US$8,500), while the
actual average for these subprojects was almost US$14,400, dUe to a
combination of investment cost overruns and lower than expected employment
generation. Under the Second Loan, the discrepancies are much smaller: for
the 35 subprojects sampled, average investment cost per job was estimated
at US$15,300 equivalent (somewhat lower than the overall ex-ante data).
with the actual results yielding an average of around US$14,800. In this
instance, investment cost overruns were slightly outweighed by higher-rhan-
anticipated employment generation.  While these investment-cost-per-job
figures appear rather high for a country such as Honduras and given the
type of subproject generally undertaken (fairly small-scale, using
*        equipment that is generally not highly specialized), it should be borne in
mind that many of the firms are working well below capacity, and that the
figures given here reflect actual usage and employment rather than
potential usage and employment.
3.19      Financial and Economic Viability of Sutprojects.   The estimates
of internal financial rates of return shown in Annex 7 are generally
considerably higher than the actual results. This may be attributed in
part to the higher than estimated investment costs: for the 36 subprojects
in the First Loan sample, actual investment costs totalled L13.3 million
(about US$6.6 million) as opposed to the L11.3 million (US$5.6 million
equivalent) estimated, while for the 35 subprojects sampled under the
Second Loan, actual investment cost totalled L18.5 million (UP$9.2 million
equivalent) as against the estimate of L15.3 million (about US$7.6
million). The remaining differeaces must be attributed to a combination of
two factors: a less favorable economic and business climate when
subprojects came on line than could reasonably have been expected at the
time of the investment decision and subproject preparation, and weaknesses
in subproject preparation. It should be noted that for 23 of the 36
subprojects sampled under the First Loan the ex-ante financial rate of
return was calculated subsequently, based on data available at appraisal.
Also, given the often extended life of industrial investments,
poorer-than-expected performance to date arising from external factors will
have been projected into the future for the "actual" calculation, which
might understate the actual benefits that will ultimately be achieved.
Despite these problems, only eight of the 36 subprojects sampled under the
First Loan, and five of the 35 sampled under the Second Loan, had actual
rates of return below 10%. Economic rates of return were calculated for a
sample of relatively larger projects financed under the Second Loan. The
ex-post results, show an average ERR of 18% for the sampled projects, which
was somewhat lower than that estimated at appraisal but within the
acceptable range specified under the SAR.
To clhnical Assistance
_.20      The technical assistance component provided under the Second Loan
was primarily oriented toward supporting and furthering the institutional
development of FONDEI, CDI and CONADI. Its impact on each institution is
discussed in the respective sections of Chapter IV.

IV.  INSTITUTIONAL DRVRLOPHINT AND TKQINICAL ASSISTANCE
FOIDKI Institutional Development
Management, Staffing and Organization
4.01      PONDEI was established in late 1978 as a trust fund.  It operates
as a largely autonomous department within BCH.  OONDEI is headed by an
Executive Director who is responsible for managing day-to-day operations
and who reports to an Executi-e Committpe, set up by BCH which oversees all
of FONDEI's activities. This Executive Committee is presided over by the
President of BCH, or his representative, and is composed of the Minister of
Economy or his representative, a representative of the commercial banks,
and FONDEI's Executive Director. The Committee's role is central to
FONDEI's successful operation, not only for administrative reasons (it
presents FONDEI's proposed budgets to BCH's Board, prepares staffing plans,
and the like), h,ut also because it is responsible for establishing FONDEI's
operating policies and approving its relatively larger subloans.
4.02      BCH, which has a well-deserved reputation for being technically
sound, has endeavored from the start to ensure that this should also hold
true for FONDEI. In this context, che Committee views protecting FONDEI
from inappropriate external influences to be of prime importance. FONDEI
has been successful in this regard, helped no doubt by its location within
BCH and the fact that, since it is a second-tier institution, FONDEI
subprojects must already have gained the approval of a commercial bank,
which will bear the credit risk.
4.03      Yanagement and Staffing.   FONDEI has had considerable stability
and continuity in its management, in particular, having had the same
Executive Director, Licernciado Arturo Corleto, since it commenced
operations in 1979. FO!4DEI is known for its professionalism, and for its
experienced cadre of analysts. In 1979, FONDEI commenced operations with a
professional staff of four, which expanded rapidly to 13 in 1981, and to
today's staff of over 35 professionals. They are generally dedicated,
competent and respected by the private sector. Under the two projects,
FONDEI contracted additional staff on a timely basis as operations
expanded, and was generally responsive to Bank concerns at various times
with respect to adequate staff training for FONDEI's staff as well their
number and areas of specialization.
4.04      Organizational Stracture.   FONDEI's organizational structure has
evolved ini paraliel to its growth in staff, from a simple structure with
three sections for Analysis, Engineering, and Administration, reporting to
the Executive Director, tc today's structure, in which two central
departments, one for Evaluation and Supervision and the other for Planning
and Finance, earh with appropriate divisions, a Technical Assistance unit,
and the San Pedro Sula regional office all report to the Executive Director
and his Deputy. This organizational structure has proved to be
satisfactory overall to date. A significant organizational development
under the Second Loan was the establishment of FONDEI's internal Credit
Ca.mnittee in late 1983. While retaining ultimate authority and



- 13 -
responsibility for subloan approvals, the Executive Committee has delegated
part of its subloan approval authority to this committee (para. 4.08),
which can meet much more frequently than the Executive Committee and thus
has speeded up subproJect approval quite significantly.
Systems and Procedures
4.05       Subproject Approval and Supervision.   The qualitv of FONDEI's
subproject approval and supervision work has improved consistently under
the two projects. In theory, the PFIs are responsible for preparing
subproject appraisals to be reviewed by FONDEI in order to determine
whether the subproject meets the eligibility criteria for financing as well
as whether the PFI's appraisal has been adequately perZormed. In practice
PFIs have developed their abilities more slowly than expected. Under the
First Loan, the PFIs focussed on merely evaluating the financial plan and
risks of subprojects and on securing adequate collateral, leaving FONDEI to
carry out the full appraisal of virtually all subprojects.
4.06      Under the Second Loan, FONDEI worked more closely with the PFIs
to promote their awareness of the importance of complete technical,
financial and economic appraisals of proposed subprojects. In addition,
FONDEI has held training seminars which have been attended by some 120 PFI
staff. The result has been a measurable improvement in the preparation of
subproject appraisals by the PFIs, although no PFI has to date been
considered sufficiently competent in subproject appraisal to be granted a
free limit, which would help to speed up processing time. Under the
Third Loan, it is proposed to grant those PFIs which establish competent
special project units a free limit to approve subprcjects which are subject
to only an ex-post FONDEI review.
4.07      Early weaknesses in FONDEI's subprojecZ appraisals included, in
particular, the lack of implementation timetables for propobed
subprojects. Such timetables are of great importance in estimating when
new investments will come "on-line", and are generally used in preparing
the subproject cash flow calculations utilized in repayment capacity
analysis. This weakness led, ultimately, to problems with portfolio
quality (affecting the PFIs -- see para. 5.09 ff.) because of insufficient
grace periods and subloan maturities. In addition, financial and economic
rates of return were not generally calculated until toward the end of the
implementation of the First Loan. Under the Second Loan, however,
financial rates of return were calculated for all subprojects and economic
rates of return for subloans exceeding US$250,000. Repayment capacity
analysis has improved considerably, as reflected in longer, more
appropriate grace periods and maturities.
4.08      Subproject processing time which under the first loan was an
issue of some concern to final subborrowers, PFIs, and the Bank, also
improved substantially under the Second Loan. While much of this
improvement is due to FONDEI having become more proficient, and thus
speedier, at subproject preparation and appraisal, part of this improvement
may be attributed to the establishment of the Credit Committee (para.
4.04). This Committee meets every week, if necessary, and may approve
loans up to L200,000 (US$100,000), subject to a routine (ex post) Executive



- 14 -
Committee approval. The Executive Committee, by contrast, meets every
six to eight weeks, often causing significant delays in subproject
approval. Since the Credit Committee has proved successful to date, it's
authorization limit was increased under the Third Loan to US$800,000
equivalent.
4.09      Subproject supervision by PFI's has generally consisted of
verification of proper use of loan funds during disbursement and,
subsequently, visits connected with interest and principal collection.
FONDEI is now working with the PFIs to improve gradually their supervision
procedures. FONDEI's own subproject supervision activities have improved
substantially, particularly under the Second Loan, Under the First Loan,
in fact, FONDEI commenced supervision activitire o.ni;, toward the end of
project implementation, when it set up a regulat supervision program.
FONDEI went almost to the other extreme, undertak'r.3 very intensive
subproject reviews.  With the expansion of operations, which has made the
latter approach impractical, FONDEI is now taking a more selective approach
to supervision.
4.10      Information Systms.   FONDEI's information systems have
developed in a generally satisfactory fashion, largely impelled by the
Bank's requirements for various types of information. FONDEI started
computerizing its information system under the Second Loan, with Bank
support under the technical assistance component (para 4.17).
Implementation of this component was delayed by about two years mainly
because of BCi's procurement procedures regarding selection of computer and
other office equipment. FONDEI is only now starting to have sufficient
data loaded into the system to permit useful analyses to be made, and some
further assistance has been included under the Third Loan to continue and
reinforce the computerization process. While limited reporting to FONDEI
from the PFIs has been more or less adequate in the past, there is now a
need to organize, standardize and expand the system in the f.ture. This
will gain particular importance with the planned increased Lransfer of
subproject preparation, appraisal and supervision responsibilities to the
PFIs.
4.11      Accounting System and Procedures.   FONDEI's accounting systems
and procedures are satisfactory, and its portfolio control and information
system is being strengthened through the technical assistance component of
the Second Loan. FONDEI's accounts have been audited by a firm of external
auditors, in line with Bank requirements. Reports have been submitted on a
timely basis, and the reports have been unqualified.
Resources
4.12      All of FONDEI's financing to date has come either from the Bank
or from its own resources (which consisted of an initial Government
capitalization of US$5.0 million and an increase in capitalization of
US$2.5 million provided by Government under the Second Loan). The Bank
financing up to now has come through the tourism development loan and the
two industrial credit loans; the recently approved third industrial credit
project will provide a conduit for further Bank financing. These two
sources of financing have so far proved adequate to enable FONDEI to become
a significant source of term financing for industrial development.



- 15 -
Nevertheless, given FONDEI's maturity as a eecond tier intermediary and the
desirability of strengthening its resource and capital base, a furrher
diversification beyond its two original sources would be highly desirable.
Interest Rates
4.13        Loan 1659-HO: All subloans financed by FONDEI so far have been
denominated in lempiras (a dollar-denominated subloan option is included
under the Third Loan) and, once a subloan has been made, the interest rate
charged remains fixed for the life of the subloan. Interest rates to final
borrowers have increased from 12% p.a. under the First Loan to the current
rate of 17% p.a.  Comparable a.ternative interest rates for medium- and
long-term loans to industry were at around 12-13%, and annual inflation
averaged under 7% from 1975 to 1978. Shortly thereafter, however,
inflation increased to 12% in 1979 and 18% in 1980, although it started to
decline in early 1981. FONDEI adjusted its rate to final borrowers with a
lag, raising it in 1981 to 16%. The increased margin was a windfall to
FONDEI, since the spread to PFIs was fixed at 3%, 4%, or 5% depending on
the size of the final subborrower, and BCH's fee for bearing the foreign
exchange risk was set at 0.5% for the life of the Loan.
4.14        Loan 2075-HO:  Under this loan the interest rate was further
raised to 17%, which was expected to be positive in real terms; in fact,
annual inflation dropped to an average of 9.2% from 1981 to 1983, with a
further decline to below 5% since 1984. During this period, the maximum
r ate that could be charged by commercial banks for comparable lending was
raised to 19%, although the banks have lent at rates below the maximum at
times when credit demand has been weak. With the decline in inflation and
sluggishness in demand, FONDEI considered decreasing its rate to final
borrowers to 16%. So far, this has proven to be impossible without
seriously affecting FONDEI's status as a financially viable institution,
given the interest rate structure under the project: the See-nd Loan
carries a fixed Bank interest rate of 11.6%, BCH receives a 1% per annum
fee for bearing the foreign exchange risk under the Loan, and the
participating financial intermediaries receive 3%, 4%, or 5% spread
according to the size of the sub-borrower.4/
4.15       FONDEI offers different spreads to the PFI's depending on the
size of the borrowers. A 3% spread is offered when the ultimate
beneficiary is a medium-sized or larger enterprise, while the spread
increases to 4% for small firms (for definitions see paragraphs 3.03 and
3.07), and to 5% for very small firms with fixed assets not exceeding
US$40,000 equivalent under the First Loan, and with fixed assets, excluding
land and buildings, of not more than US$50,000 equivalent inder the Second
Loan. These spreads appear to have been adequate to encourage
participation under the two Loans by most financial iatermediaries which
work with industry. Whether the spreads have been adequate to ensure
4/ Under the Third Loan, the Bank resources are transferred to FONDEI at
variable rates, which permit (currently) adequate margins to the PFIs,
a foreign exchange risk margin accumulated at the BCH and a 2.0% margin
to FONDEI for its operational costs.



- 16 -
appropriate levels of lending to the very small entrepreneurs is more
debatable. Even though under both Loans the minimum targets for lending to
small-scale firms (para. 3.09) were exceeded, perhaps more could have been
achieved through better commercial bank participation. CDI was the main
lending channel to SMI's.  The third FONDEI project recognizes what since
commercial banks are reluctant to lend to the very small businesses,
despite the higher spreads offered for such lending, FONDEI should
undertake a study which would recommend specific measures to increase
institutional lending to such SSI's.
Technical Assistance
A. FONDEI-BCH.
4.16      The First Loan contained no technical assistance component; this
is rather surprising, given that FONDEI was a new institution, and that the
L-an included as an objective the building of an effective technical
assistance service to small firms through CDI (para. 2.06). It should be
noted, however, that UNDP was committed to financing UNIDO technical
assistance to CDI.
4.17     The Second Loan, on the other hand, provided for quite a
substantial technical assistance pr3gram, with Bank financing being matched
by UNDP financing. In particular, the loan provided for FONDEI to hire
consultants to: (a) prepare material for the use of FONDEI, financial
intermediaries and private consultants in subproject preparation, appraisal
and supervision; (b) carry out a training program for FONDEI and financial
intermediaries' staff, through total immersion seminars during 1982-84, and
through visits to foreign DFCs, to complement the activities outlined in
(a) above; (c) upgrade FONDEI's financial planning, its information and
control system, loan administration, operating and disbursement procedures;
(d) analyze technical aspects and carry out market and subse-toral studies
as background material for subproject appraisal; and (e) strengthen and
broaden the services offered by BCH's industrial department through its
chemical analysis laboratory.
4.18      This technical assistance program for FONDEI was implemented
substantially as planned and with good success. The achievements of the
program are largely reflected in the comments on specific functional areas
of FONDEI elsewhere in this report. In this section it suffices to note
that the project helped FONDEI to mature into a competent second tier
institution, with a positive impact on improving the project evaluation and
supervision capacity of commercial banks through staff training. The
program had a lesser impact with respect to the objective of improving the
BCH's industrial technology laboratory. In the design of this activity, the
Bank/UNDP project document allocated eight manweeks for a diagnostic study
of the problem areas. The results of the study recommended a relocation of
the laboratory outside the BCR complex and an investment plan amounting to
US$600,000 in two phases. The BCH management was not keen to implement the
report findings and hence this investment component was not included in the
follow-up project. Besides, the functioning of the laboratory was not
considered critical to the success of FONDEI's credit program.

B. Other Institutions
pOIFO
4.19      As a forestry sector development institute OOHDEFOR was expected
to play an important role under the First Loan, as outlined in Chapter II
above.   Established in 1974, COHDEFOR was responsible, among other things,
for promoting and financing the growth of an efficient wood products
industry, and for helping improve the living standards of the impoverished
rural population. By December 31, 1977, COHDEFOR's outstanding portfolio
to the forestry sector amounted to L22.8 million. Its lending was mainly
focussed on financing invencories, other short-term needs, and exports,
although its activities included some term lending to finance fixed assets
as well as equity participation in certain industrial ventures. Its
planned investments over the period 1978-83 were estimated at about US$75
million and involved three main areas, two of which, the Comayagua forest
area development program and the expansion of the secondary wood industry
sectar, were to be supported by the Bank under the First Loan through the
US$6.0 million allocated to COHDEFOR.
4.20      Although COHDEFOR was considered to have a generally sound
organization, after having received substantial assistance from FAO and
CIDA, the Bank was pursuing a number of institutional development
objectives for COHDEFOR through the project. In particular, COHDEFOR was
to define its operating policy, establish a Forestry Industries Financing
Fund, and create a Wood Industry Project Unit that was to be adequately
staffed to assume responsibility for industrial project promotion,
evaluation and supervision in coordination with COHDEFOR's Production and
Forestry Departments. COHDEFOR was also to ensure that staff would receive
training as necessary to be able to carry out these tasks. COHDEFOR's
management changed, however, between project preparation and
implementation, and was extremely slow in establishing the Fund and the
Project Unit, and in approving an Operating Policy Statement.
Subsequently, COHDEFOR failed to commit the bulk of the loan funds
initially allocated to it (para 3.04). COHDEFOR's failure to live up to
the Bank's expectations was largely due to the fact that the new management
was scarcely interested in the Bank project, with one exception: in late
1979, COHDEFOR made a request that the Bank allow the Fund established in
COHDEFOR to finance enterprises with 100% COHDEFOR ownership. This request
suggests that the new management was primarily interested in developing
those areas of the sector which were wholly under COHDEFOR's control; the
Bank rejected the request as being contrary to the Government policy of
fostering private sector investments.
4.21      As a result, the First Loan provided much less support to the
forestry sector than anticipated and was also unable to contribute to
COHDEFOR's institutional development. Although CORDEFOR was included as a
financial intermediary under the Second Loan, it made no use of Loan
funds.  FONDEI has, however, financed the subsector to some extent through
other financial intermediaries, with 27 subprojects (including the one
CORDEFOR subproject) accounting for about US$1.6 million under the First
Loan (as opposed to US$6.0 million equivalent in Bank resources originally
allocated to COHDEFOR), and 11 subprojects absorbing less than US$0.7
million under the Second Loan (Annex 4).

CONAI
4.22      CONADI was established in 1974 by the Honduran Government in
order to help (a) provide long-term resources for industrial investment,
thus filling a gap in industrial equity and term financing; (b) develop a
capital market; and (c) expand public and mixed Honduran ownership of
larger scale enterprises. By December 31, 1977, CONADI's portfolio had
already reached L99 million (US$49.5 million equivalent), made up of L71
million in loans (L42 million in long-term mortgage loans for tourism
projects, and L28 million in loans to industrial enterprises) and L28
million in equity investments. CONADI was expected to be an important
intermediary under the First Loan, easily absorbing the maximum allowed of
US$2.5 million in Bank resources through a few relatively large
subprojects. In practice, CONADI made only one subloan under the Loan,
absorbing US$675,000 of Bank funds.
4.23      In late 1980, in the wake of senior management changes and a
consequent shift in focus, CONADI requested the Bank to consider making a
loan to it for agroindustry. When the Bank started to explore this
possibility, it soon became apparent that CONADI's financial situation was
precarious. By December 31, 1980, CONADI's total portfolio had grown to
US$212 million, a fourfold growth in just three years, of which 51%, 28%,
and 21% were for contingent liabilities (mainly guarantees), loans, and
equity investments, respectively. CONADI's debt and contingent
liabilities/equity ratio had grown to 16.4:1 CONADI was showing modest
profits in 1978-80, but this was largely because it made very few portfolio
provisions. About 13% of CONADI's loan portfolio was in arrears, affecting
about one-third of the total lendirg portfolio; these figures were also
underestimates, since CONADI frequently restructured loans in arrears.
CONADI anticipated a US$14 million cash deficit in 1981. The institution's
weak financial situation largely resulted from: (i) a mismatch of
short- and medium-term (mostly foreign) liabilities with long- and very
long-term assets, often of highly doubtful quality; (ii) attempts by CONADI
to match asset maturity to the relatively short-term liabilities by
establishing inappropriately short loan maturities, thus contributing to
the portfolio arrears problem; (iii) payment of guarantees, since a high
percentage of firms did not repay their loans secured by CONADI; and (iv)
CONADI's inadequate collection system.
4.24      In view of CONADI's importance a- the largest industrial
development institution in Honduras and the Government's concern to resolve
its financial problems and transform it into a sound and efficient
institution, the Bank agreed to include a specific technical assistance
component ("second stage") for CONADI under the Second Loan. The "first
stage" assistance to CONADI comprised a UNPP-financed, UNIDO-executed study
of CONADI's operational and financial problems. Bank co-financing with
UNDP of the follow-on technical assistance was made contingent on (a)
Government/Bank agreement on the action to be taken based on the first
stage study's recommendations; (b) satisfactory arrangements being made for
the execution of the second stage; and (c) CONADI making no new investment,
lending or guarantee operations until a decision was reached and agreed
with the Bank on what to do with the institution.



- 19 -
4.25      The US$0.25 million technical assistance component for CONADI was
to be matched by the same amount for UNDP-financed technical assistance.
These funds were to assist CONADI in implementing a plan of action that
would be agreed with the Bank and would be based on the recommendations of
a study of its financial situation carried out by UNDP-financed
consultants. This study had two main objectives: (a) to review at the
enterprise level appropriate actions concerning all CONADI subprojects;
and (b) to review CONADI as an institution to determine whether and how it
should be financially and operationally reorganized, as well as how its
.        financial crisis could be resolved.
4.26      By 1982, when the Second Loan was signed and became effective,
*        CONADI's financial situation was deteriorating rapidly, with a cash flow
deficit for the year anticipated at about US$77 million, based on an
expected cash inflow of only US$7.5 million. In October 1982, the Bank and
the Government/CONADI agreed upon an action plan for CONADI. The plan had
two basic objectives: (i) to recover, to the extent possible, CONADI's loan
and investment portfolio; and (ii) to set up a new institutional framework
for CONADI that would enable it to carry out its role as an industrial
development institution. The Bank and the IMF were to be kept informed as
to progress and revised plans to rehabilitate CONADI's financial status.
It was agreed that the Bank-financed technical assistance to CONADI should
focus on supporting the portfolio recovery effort. For this purpose, a
full-time high level coordinating consultant was to be hired to work with
CONADI, while various other consultants were to be hired on a short term
basis, as needed, to work with the various firms involved.
4.27      During 1983 CONADI -ade some progress under the technical
assistance component with respect to portfolio recovery and corresponding
a:tions to be carried out at enterprise level; but progress was inadequate
during 1984. In mid-1985, CONADI was preparing a new action program
regarding its portfolio management, which it hoped to discuss with the Bank
*        in order to seek financial assistance for revitalizing part of its
portfolio. CONADI later prepared a draft law to permit the sale of its
assets/shares/enterprises, for which it sought rapid congressional
approval. Such approval did not materialize until early 1986. The present
Government seems more determined to restructure CONADI along the lines of
the Action plan discussed with the Bank in the past. The assistance now
being provided to the Government by US AID with respect to CONADI and the
optimal disposal of its assets is consistent with the Bank's
recommendations.
Centre for Industrial Development (CDI)
4.28      CDI, as it exists today, came into existence in late 1978, having
been transformed by law into an autonomous institution to provide a
comprehensive range of extension and promotional services including
technical assistance to SSIs. In 1980, CDI qualified as a financial
intermediary under the First Loan, after extensive internal reorganization
and technical assistance from UNIDO; CDI was limited, however, to financing
very small SSIs (see para. 3.07). It financed 30 subprojects under the
First Loan, using US$462,000 equivalent in FONDEI resources, and 26
subprojects under the Second Loan, using US$541,000 equivalent in FONDEI
resources.



- 20 -
4.29      The focus of CDI's activities has varied over time, with emphasis
shifting back and forth between lending and technical assistance
activities, largely reflecting changes in CDI's management. In addition,
CDI's productivity has been quite low, as measured in terms of numbers of
artisans and SSIs assisted, number of subproject appraisals/approvals, and
man-months required. Accordingly, the objective of the technical
assistance component for CDI included in the Second Loan, was, apart from
helping to ensure sound lending, to increase CDI's efficiency by further
upgrading its institutional capabilities and its staff. This technical
assistance program was cofinanced with UNDP; UNIDO was the executing
agency.
4.30      In addition to che relative frequency of changes in management,
CDI's constraints include a stagnant budget in current terms for the last
four to five years, and a shortage of both human and material resources,
including means of transport to visit client enterprises. Given these
constraints, the technical assistance program to CDI appears to have been
relatively successful. In particular, subproject processing time, which
until 1984 averaged about six months between CDI and FONDEI, has been
reduced to an average of 45-50 days, with CDI taking about 30 days to
prepare, appraise and approve subprojects over L25,000 (US$12,500
equivalent) and 15-20 days for smaller ones. CDI has also been quite
successful using four mobile units, staffed with international volunteers,
to provide technical assistance services in the wood, leather, metal
mechanics, and food subsectors.
V.  OPERATIONL AND FINANCIAL PERFCRMW ACE
Operations
5.01      While the overall trend in FONDEI's lending operations under the
two Loans (Annex 5) has been one of growth, the operations have not been
very regular, mainly due to fluctuations in demand. The second tier
lending oparation has been quite successful if measured by the fact that
the majority of Honduran financial intermediaries have participated under
the two Bank Loans -- four out of 16 participating intermediaries accounted
for 70% of FONDEI lending under the First Loan, and four out of 15
accounting for 65% under the Second Loan. The two leading banks under both
loans were Banco de Occidente and BANCAHSA.
5.02      Participating Financial Intermediaries.   Bank staff visited a
number of Honduran financial institutions, sampling those active under one
or both of the Loans and those with only marginal participation to date, in
order to explore the reasons for their differing levels of use of FONDEI
funds.   Banco de Honduras  a subsidiary virtually wholly owned by
Citibank, has financed one subloan under each of the two Loans. It
explained that up until 1980-81, its lending operations in Honduras
consisted basically of channelling US dollar resources to generally
large-scale firms in Honduras. As the climate turned sour for foreign
lending, the bank became more aggressive in seeking domestic deposits, but
it also adopted a policy of making only short-term working capital loans to
relatively large scale industry.   Banco de las Fuerzas Armadas (BANFFAA)



- 21 -
was formerly a saving institution for the Honduran armed forces, and in its
new banking role appears still to be somewhat undecided concerning its
lending focus, but seems interested in expanding its lending to industry.
To date it financed one subproject with FONDEI resources.
5.03      Banco Sqgerin was one of the most active intermediaries under the
First Loan, accounting for 19% of FONDEI financing. Under the Second Loan,
however, Sogerin has financed only 13 subprojects, using 3% of total FONDEI
funds under that loan. Sogerin was one of the banks most affected by some
of the appraisal related shortcomings under the First Loan, with
significant arrearage problems. Management feels that the difficulties
were largely their own fault, since their appraisals were inadequate
(however, they were also approved by FONDEI). It noted that many of the
problem subprojects were viable but were granted insufficient maturities
and grace periods, and that most of the subprojects which ran into problems
involved new firms. Sogerin has been concentrating on portfolio recovery
under the First Loan, and has adopted a more conservative policy under the
Second Loan. Even so, the bank noted the significance of FONDEI as the
first source of term financing in the country, as well as the importance of
FONDEI-financed firms in its industrial and total portfolio: such firms
account for around 50% of Sogerin's industrial portfolio anld 7% directly
(12% indirectly, i.e. including other operations) of total portfolio.
5.04      Banco de Occidente, the fourth largest bank in Honduras, has a
strong development focus and FONDEI resources account for almost all of the
bank's industrial lending, which represents about 23% of the bank's
portfolio in Tegucigalpa. While Banco de Occidente has remained active
with FONDEI, it has generally financed larger firms under the Second Loan,
to avoid the greater portfolio risks which the bank experienced with the
smaller firms under the First Loan; the bank felt that FONDEI did not
provide adequate support when it had problems with a subborrower.
BANCAHSA has had a stable relationship with FONDEI using 13% of FONDEI
financing under the First Loan and 14% under the Second.  Moreover,
BANCAHSA's industrial portfolio represents about 40% of its total
portfolio, with FONDEI financing 20% of its industrial portfolio. BANCAHSA
was pleased with its operations with FONDEI, feeling that FONDEI had given
adequate support all along. The bank itself is quite selective with
respect to clients and conservative in granting long-term financing. The
bank's FONDEI-financed portfolio was generally very healthy, with only one
or two small subprojects showing arrears.
5.05       Guarantee Fund.   One relatively less successful aspect of
operations under the Second Loan was the attempted resuscitation of the
Credit Guarantee Fund which had been established by BCH in 1971 to
encourage lending to SSIs. Due to inefficiences in guarantee procedures
and the high cost of administration, the Fund had become inactive after
1979. Under the First Loan, the Bank had encouraged BCH to revise the
Guarantee Fund, and during preparation of the Second Loan BCH proposed
revisions to the Fund which, it was hoped, might foster increased lending
by financial intermediaries to SSIs.
5.06      The revised Fund was to provide guarantees (up to 75% of a
borrower's outstanding debt) for a one-time charge to the entrepreneur of
1% of the loan amount. Eligible enterprises would be those corresponding



-22 -
to FONDEI's very small enterprises (entitling PFIs to a 5% spread). BCH
set up a small unit within its industrial department to manage the Fund.
This unit was also to provide referral technical assistance services. In
practice, the remodelled Fund had virtually no success in increasing the
intermediaries' credit to small industries and artisans with insufficient
collateral; in 1982, no loans were guaranteed; in 1983, operations for a
total of US$273,000 equivalent were guaranteed; and in 1984, coverage of
US$59,000 equivalent was granted. The poor results were achieved despite
promotion campaigns by the Fund. Apparently, most financial institutions
either distrusted the Fund or simply did not know how it operated. In
1984, a Bank supervision mission pointed out a number of problems in the
way in which the Fund was operating, and made various suggestions to
improve the situation. No action was taken on any of the suggestions, and
the Bank did not raise the issue further since the targets for lending to
SSIs were being fully achieved without the use of the Guarantee Fund.
Financial Position and Results
5.07      FONDEI's financial position and results for 1979 to 1985 are
shown in Annexes 8-10. They are fully satisfactory. FONDEI has been
profitable in all except its first year of operation, with its net income
generally exceeding projections by a significant margin. Even allowing for
inflation, operating profits have increased steadily over the years. Net
income at year-end 1984 was US$798,000, representing a 6.9% return on
equity, with retained earnings reaching US$2.52 million and accounting for
22% of total equity. The corresponding figures for 1985 are: net income of
US$1.4 million, representing an 8.3% return on equity, with total retained
earnings reaching US$3.93 million, and 23% of total equity.   Similarly,
FONDEI's debt/equity ratio has at no time exceeded 2.7:1, despite
orojections that it might rise to 4.6:1 under the Second Loan. FONDEI's
sound financial position can be attributed to its appropriate interest rate
policy (boosted by the additional margin received by FONDEI on later
subloans under the First Loan - cf. para. 4.13); to the facL that it is a
second-tier institution protected from portfolio risk, and to its
reasonable administrative costs, which have generally been held within 2%
of average total assets. In addition, FONDEI has successfully followed a
policy of placing available liquid assets as short-term deposits with the
banking system.
5.08      After strong initial growth from  1979 to 1981, FONDEI's portfolio
remained fairly stable, at around US$20 million from 1982 to 1984, before
growing strongly in 1985 to about US$31 million. The brief period of
negligible portfolio growth can be attributed to the slow disbursement of
new subloans in 1983-84 combined with the short repayment periods granted
on many subloans under the First Loan. These loan repayments also resulted
in the rapid buildup of FONDEI's liquid assets, which grew from US$1.1
million in 1981 to almost US$25.0 millioi. in 1985. This phenomenon is not
expected to persist, however, since: (a) rONDEI is due to start principal
repayments on the First Loan and on the Tourism Development Loan in 1986;
(b) FONDEI has established a working capital loan facility and a second
level tourism loan facility to recirculate loan recoveries not needed for
current repayments; and (c) the local counterpart funds for the recently
approved Third Loan will be met out of FONDEI's own funds.



- 23 -
Portfolio Quality
5.09      Since participating commercial banks bear the full credit risk
for subloans and are required to repay FONDEI for principal and interest on
due dates, FONDEI has minimal arrear risks and does not make any accounting
provision for losses. However, as part of its supervision procedures,
FONDEI receives periodic reports on the status of arrears from the
participating financial intermediaries. Annex 11 summarizes the available
information5/ on arrears under the two loans, with the improvement from
the first to the second standing out quite clearly. Experience with
recovery of subloans financed under the first loan has been somewhat
uneven. In 1985 the cumulative subloans recovered represent about half of
the total amount originally disbursed by the intermediaries. Regarding the
other half, about 45% has been in arrears for over six months; this
represents about 20% of the original total amount of subloans. However, it
is estimated that the uncollectible subloans under the first loan (on
account of 7 failed projects) would be about 6% of the total loan
portfolio. As already noted in Chapter III, inadequate subloan maturities
and grace periods under the first project were major contributing factors
to the arrears problem. In addition, 12 firms accounted for nearly 60% of
arrears, which facilitated the preparation and implementation of detailed
recovery plans. In addition, as noted, FONDEI has been focussing
particularly on these issues in undertaking and reviewing subproject
preparation, and has also been working closely in this respect with those
financial intermediaries with high arrears under the Firs- Loan. The loan
arrear position for the Second Loan shows a marked improvement in that
arrears over six months amounted to well under 1% of principal outstanding
in both 1984 and 1985. This is partly due to the more realistic loan terms
offered by FONDEI under this Loan and partly because of the relatively
improved economic climate in which these projects were conceived and
implemented.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01      The two Loans have been quite successful with respect to the
Bank's objectives of establishing and consolidating an effective system to
provide term financing for financially sound and economically efficient
investment projects of mainly small and medium-sized industrial firms.
FONDEI has developed quite rapidly into a respected second-tier credit
institution, which seeks to be responsive to the changing needs of its
largely small- and medium-scale clientele. The FONDEI mechanism has thus
already made a significant contribution to development in Honduras, and
looks well set to increase that contribution over time.
6.02      Project implementation has been reasonably smooth and loan
utilization relatively timely, (para. 3.05) given the difficult economic
5/ Arrears information under the First Loan was not collected at all by
FONDEI before 1983; it is expected that more complete information will
be collected as a result of the computerization of the management
information system.



- 24 -
circumstances the country faces. The subprojects financed by FONDEI have
had a generally positive impact, with significant employment generation
(para 3.16). Investment cost per job, however, has been considerably
higher than anticipated at appraisal, reaching around US$14,000 and
US$15,000 respectively under the First and Second Loans, based on a sample
of subprojects (para. 3.18). However, the cost per job is in line with
that for SMIs in other countries of Latin America (Colombia: US$13,500;
Mexico: US$15,000).
6.03      FONDEI's success to date has been greatly assisted by having
considerable stability in its management, as well as the fact that it is a
second-tier institution within a sound central bank, which has helped to
protect it against political and other external influences
(para. 4.02 ff.). Nevertheless, project implementation revealed a number
of weaknesses in the operational mechanism. These were particularly
apparent under the First Loan, as might be expected, when FONDEI was a
brand new agency seeking to operate in a fashion previously unknown in thd
country. Particular areas of weakness included subproject preparation,
appraisal, and supervision (para. 4.05-4.09). The first priority in these
areas was to ensure that FONDEI itself was fully competent in these
matters, so that it could subsequently train, and monitor the work of the
PFIs; this was largely achieved under the Second Loan, supported by the
technical assistance program.
6.04      Overall, FONDEI appears to have been quite successful in gaining
acceptance by the commercial banking system which has benefitted itself
from FONDEI's technical input in its project work (para 4.17). In a few
cases there is evidence that a more aggressive promotional policy by FONDEI
might have been beneficial in attracting new projects. Those banks which
participated in the program only marginally, particularly under the First
Loan, could have played a more active role in the program. FONDEI's
importance as the first and principal source of long-term financing for
industry in Honduras is acknowledged by the banking system and evidenced by
the high percentage of FONDEI operations in the banks' industrial
portfolios (para 5.02).
6.05      The Bank has been much less successful under both Loans in
achieving its institutional objectives with respect to COHDEFOR, CONADI,
and CDI (para 4.19, 4.22, and 4.28). One feature common to the lack of
success with COHDEFOR and CONADI is the fact that the general manager of
each agency was politically appointed. This made the institution
vulnerable to changes in management, which entailed significant shifts in
policies, and objectives.  This fact makes the Bank's task much more
difficult, since institutional gains made under one administration are
often not carried over to the next. As a result, achievement of
institutional objectives of such agencies which are not the primary focus
of the project require additional investment of Bank staff time.
6.06      A major lesson from the experience of joint UNDP/Bank financing
program for the CONADI and CDI technical assistance activities is that
whenever the Bank agrees to accept an outside agency to act as an executing
agency for a specific component, the input, roles and responsibilities of
the Bank and the executing agency should be clearly defined to enable
appropriate contributions by each and also to avoid unnecessary



- 25 -
institutional friction. In addition, it is important to establish a
clearly defined coordinating and review mechanism to ensure concerted
support for the program. These lessons have been incorporated in the joint
UNDP/Bank technical assistance program for CDI and FONDEI under the ongoing
Third Industrial Credit Project.

Spanish (Honduras)
LA2TF    ENMcM
Translation of incoming telex
From: BANTRAL HO
Tegucigalpa, D.C.                           August 25, 1987
To  : Paul Knotter, Division LA(2)
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Thank you for sending us an advance copy of the Completion Report
for Projects 1659-HO and 2075-HO. While we regard this report as fairly
complete and accurate, we would like to suggest the following changes:
(A)       Page ix of the Spanish text (page viii of the English text],
para. 3. Delete "la gesti6n del [= management of the]" and replace it by
"el [= the]".* This change is suggested because FONDEI currently has a fairly
complete information system.
Para. 4. Add:** "Some PFIs have assigned staff to such work on a full-time
basis and have provided the necessary training."  This change is suggested
because some financial intermediaries have assigned staff full-time to FONDEI
matters.
Para. 6. Add: "While FONDEI has financed sound subprojects, the PFIs have
experienced some problems..."
*        (B)       Para. 1.04.  Add:  "In 1982, the Government introduced exchange
controls to stem the loss of reserves, and since then various sectors have
conducted a number of exchange transactions not controlled by BCH, in which
the rate reached as much as L 2.8:US$l in 1985. At the present moment, the
exchange rate is closer to the official rate, owing to the massive external
financing being received by Honduras." The preceding text was suggested by
the Economic Studies Department of the Central Bank of Honduras.
(C)       Para. 2.03.  Add:  "primarily large-scale public, private and mixed
Honduran-owned enterprises." This change is suggested because CONADI has also
financed private enterprises.
(D)       Para. 2.06.  Add:  "these projects were largely to benefit families
living in the small rural towns and villages in the relatively undeveloped
Comayagua forest region."
*    Translator's Note:  presumably what is intended in English would be to
replace "information system management" by "information systems".
** Translator's Note: here, and in the remainder of the text, "add"
actually means "replace the existing text by the following wording"

(E)       Pars. 3.05.  Add:  "the closing date was extended to June 30, 1987."
(F)       Para. 3.06.  Add:  "On the foreign exchange side, in late 1983 5CR
agreed, at FONDEI's suggestion, that imported goods and services financed by
FONDEI be exepted from the regular import procedures, reducing the time
required to receive an import permit to five days."
(G)       Para. 4.01.  Add:  "This Executive Committee is presided over by the
President of BCH, or his representative, and is comoosed of the Minister of
Economy or his representative, a representative ot the commercial banks, and
FONDEl's Executive Director."
(H)       Para. 4.06.  Add:  "to authorize those PFIs which establish
competent special project units a free limit* to approve subprojects which are
subject to only an ex-post FONDEI review." This change is suggested as the
PFIs are not authorized at present to approve loans of any type. Initially,
they will only be able to approve up to L 100,000 in FONDEI resources.
(I)       Para. 4.12.  Add:  "which consisted of an initial Government
capitalization of US$5.0 million and an increase in capitalization of US$2.5
million provided by Government under the Second Loan."
Regards,
Arturo Corleto Moreira
Executive Director of FONDEI
*    Translator's Note;  The Spanish translation of the PCR as sent to
Honduras did not accurately convey the meaning of the term "free
limit," suggesting that PFIs could approve all subloans, without any
upper limit.
