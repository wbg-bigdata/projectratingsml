            Development Policy Credit to the Republic of Honduras

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describes the results of the
Fiscal Emergency Recovery Development Policy Credit (DPC) to Honduras. The single
tranche loan of SDR 49.6 million (US$74.7 million equivalent) was approved by the World Bank
Board of Executive Directors on November 9, 2010 and disbursed upon loan effectiveness on
December 9, 2010. This operation, prepared under regular budget support procedures, was
intended to support the Government’s efforts to stabilize the economy and reestablish the
groundwork for growth. Specifically, the operation supported four areas that are central to the
Government’s reform program: (i) tax reform, including closing tax loopholes, widening the tax
base, and improving tax administration; (ii) civil service reform, focused on human resource
management in the education sector and a rationalization of the public wage bill; (iii) reform of
power sector tariffs to support the financial sustainability of the state-owned electricity company
(National Electricity Company-ENEE); and (iv) strengthening public financial management and
transparency by resolving outstanding public sector arrears and investigating the shortcomings of
the Integrated Financial Management System (SIAFI).

1.1 Country context at appraisal
Political Context
On June 28, 2009 Honduras experienced a governance crisis when the Supreme Court
ordered the removal of President Zelaya. Following these political developments, Honduras
was suspended from the Organization of American States (OAS) and much of the international
community put aid programs on hold. However, a number of donors continued implementation
of projects, particularly those focused on the poor. The Bank conducted an assessment of the
prevailing situation and temporarily halted the implementation of the existing portfolio during
the political crisis. In addition, no new lending was approved during this period.

In November 2009, Porfirio Lobo from the National Party was elected President and set a
series of actions aimed at easing political tensions. Some of the most important steps were
naming a government of national reconciliation which included some political rivals;
establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which became operational on May 4,
2010; working with Congress on important Constitutional reforms; restoring diplomatic relations
with partner countries; and prompting re-engagement with the international community and
development partners. In December 2009, the Bank resumed disbursements to Honduras, once it
was clear that the conditions of the Operational Policy were fulfilled. In June 2011, Honduras’
membership in the Organization of American States was restored, marking a milestone in the
country’s efforts to normalize international relations.

Economic Context
Honduras is a lower middle income country with deeply rooted growth and development
challenges. The country remains one of the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin America.
It is Central America’s second most populated country, with 7.5 million people, and the second
largest in size. About half of the population is rural, 80 percent of which live in hillside areas,

                                                1
practicing subsistence agriculture. Poverty is very high at around 60 percent of the population in
2010, but has been on a gradual declining trend since 2005. Human development challenges
persist, particularly with regards to educational attainment and gender gap. Honduras is also one
of the most at-risk countries to natural hazards, with the national infrastructure subject to
substantial damages from the 1998 Hurricane Mitch and subsequent storms. The security
situation is precarious as Honduras has the highest homicide rate in the world (UNODC, 2011).

The global crisis, the internal political crisis, and pre-existing structural problems
combined to present a significant fiscal challenge for the Government of Honduras. After
growing by 4.0 percent in 2008, real GDP contracted by 2.1 percent in 2009 due to lower exports
(which fell by 18.7 percent), lower international remittances (which declined from 19.4 to 16.8
percent of GDP), and lower foreign direct investment (which fell by 3.6 percent of GDP). These
developments adversely affected tax collection and as a result, as in many other countries, the
fiscal situation deteriorated dramatically. The situation was further exacerbated by weak
expenditure controls and a substantial increase in the public sector wage bill. The deficit of the
combined public sector rose to 4.6 percent of GDP (up from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2008), while
the deficit of the Central Government increased to 6.2 percent of GDP (up from 2.4 percent of
GDP). The widening of the deficit was financed largely by costly short term bonds, while the
position of the largest public sector enterprises and the pension funds worsened (See Table 1).

The Lobo administration took a series of corrective measures aimed at stabilizing the fiscal
situation. The Government’s strategy comprised tax reforms and spending cuts, including
measures to control public sector wages and especially teacher salaries. The international
community supported the country’s fiscal consolidation efforts through World Bank Fiscal
Emergency Recovery Development Policy Credit, the IMF SBA and SCF programs, and budget
support operations from the IDB, European Union, and the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration. As a result of the Government’s consolidation efforts, the combined
public sector deficit reached 2.9 percent of GDP in 2010, down from 4.6 percent in 2009 and
well below the target of 3.7 percent under the IMF program. A large part of the adjustment came
from a 0.9 percent of GDP decline in investment spending (relative to 2009), returning public
investment to the levels observed in 2006-07. However, there was also a 0.8 percent of GDP
reduction in central government recurrent expenditure, and the surplus in the rest of the public
sector improved by 0.3 percent of GDP.

The economic recovery in 2010 was accompanied by deterioration in the external balance
and an increase in inflation. The Honduran economy showed a moderate recovery in 2010.
GDP grew 2.8 percent, reversing the decline of 2.1 percent in 2009. Growth was supported by
expansion in exports (17.1 percent), public investment (5.6 percent), and increases in remittances
from the US. The current account deficit increased from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.2
percent in 2010, reflecting a jump in the merchandise trade deficit due to higher oil prices.
Inflation reached 6.5 percent in 2010, up from 3 percent in 2009. The increase in the current
account deficit was financed primarily by FDI and long term public sector borrowing.

1.2 Country context during Implementation
The Government continued to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal consolidation efforts
and reducing public sector vulnerabilities in 2011. In June 2011, Congress approved the

                                                2
Efficiency of Revenues and Expenditures Law, which eliminated some tax exemptions and
enforced new measures against tax evasion; and the Reforms of the Population Security Law,
which creates temporary taxes to finance security and social prevention. The Government was
also successful in further reducing the wage bill to 9.8 percent of GDP from 11 percent in 2010.
Although tax revenues increased from 14.8 to 15.1 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2011, they
fell short of the 16.1 percent DPC target. Nonetheless, the reduction in current expenditure was
sufficient to reduce the combined public sector deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011 (from 2.9
percent in 2010) and the central government deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP (from 4.8 percent of
GDP in 2010).

Growth picked up to 3.6 percent in 2011, an improvement from 2009-2010 but still low
compared with the average growth of 5.7 percent during 2005-2008. The improvement in
growth is explained by renewed investment spending and a growing demand for the country’s

                                                             3
exports. While commodity prices remained high, the value of agriculture exports such as coffee
and bananas increased. However, rising international prices of food and fuel created inflationary
pressures and widened the current account deficit. Inflation reached 5.6 percent and the current
account deficit increased somewhat from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6.4 percent in 2011. The
slight increase in the current account deficit was financed primarily by an increase in FDI that
rose from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2011.

Despite high vulnerability to external shocks, the growth and debt outlook for Honduras
remain positive and the exchange rate will continue to serve as the main anchor for
inflation expectations. Honduras is one of the most vulnerable countries in the region with
exports and remittances being the main channels of transmission of external shocks to the
Honduran economy. The fiscal space to counteract external shocks through expansionary fiscal
policy is very limited, and the authorities’ ability to use monetary policy stimulus is also
restricted by the narrow foreign exchange band. Although social protection systems—including
the recently launched conditional cash transfer program Bono 10,000—are in place, there is
limited scope for expansion due to fiscal constraints. Nonetheless, under a baseline scenario of
no further deterioration in the global economy, Honduras is expected to grow by 3.6 percent in
2012. The Central Bank will continue to absorb excess liquidity through the placement of its own
securities in order to meet the inflation targets. The latest debt sustainability analysis suggests
that Honduras’ public-debt-to-GDP is expected to increase from 26.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to
around 27.5 percent in 2011-12 and gradually decline afterwards.

1.3 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Program Development Objective was to assist the Government in bringing public
finances back to a sustainable path. In this regard, the DPC operation supported progress
towards the Interim Strategy Note objective of macroeconomic stability and growth.

The Key Outcome Indicators, expected to be achieved by September 2011, were as follows:
I.     Expanding the tax base and improving tax administration by:
        Increasing the Central Government tax revenues as a share of GDP to 16.1 percent in
          2011 from a baseline of 14.4 percent in 2009;
        Increasing the number of taxpayers using the electronic payment system by at least 10
          percent in 2010 from a baseline of 163,198 taxpayers in 2009;
II.    Improving public sector human resource management through:
        Decreasing the wage bill as a share of GDP by at least 0.5 percent of GDP from a
          baseline of 11.1 percent of GDP in 2009;
III.   Reforming the power sector tariffs to contribute to the financial sustainability of ENEE
       through :
        Increases in electricity tariffs to raise ENEE’s monthly revenues by US$6 million
           from a baseline of US$65 million as of April 2010;
        Restructuring of the direct electricity subsidy to generate savings for the Government
           of up to US$23 million yearly;
        Eliminating ENEE’s arrears with private sector power generators, which as of April
           2010 were L.1 billion.

                                                4
IV.    Strengthening public financial management and transparency by:
        Auditing and resolving about 0.3 percent of GDP worth of previously unaccounted
           and unpaid transactions.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    Reasons/Justification
Neither the program development objectives not the core indicators were formally revised.

1.5 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
The Government devised a strategy to bring public finances back under control after the
2009-2010 fiscal crisis. The administration was committed to tackle the fiscal challenges in
order to support the recovery and contribute to sustainable growth in the medium to long term.
To that end the Government secured the approval in Congress of the Fiscal Emergency Law and
the Law on the Strengthening of Revenues, Social Equity and Rationalization of Public Spending
which formed the core of its fiscal reform package. The strategy also included additional fiscal
measures, especially on the expenditure side. The Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC was a
regular budget support operation, prepared in a state of fiscal emergency, to aid Government
efforts in launching structural reforms to tackle the difficult fiscal situation and reestablish the
foundations for growth. In particular, the DPC supported key reforms and policy actions in four
areas of (i) tax reform, (ii) civil service reform, (iii) reform of power sector tariffs, and (iv)
public financial management and transparency.

Policy Area I: Tax Reform
This component supported the Government efforts to close tax loopholes, widen the tax
base, and improve tax administration. Tax collections increased steadily between 2002 and
2008, but fell in 2009 as a result of the economic and political crisis. In April 2010 Congress
approved Law 17/2010 on the Strengthening of Revenues, Social Equity and Rationalization of
Public Spending, which introduced a number of tax policy changes that were estimated to raise
revenues by 1 - 1.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis over three years. In addition, a new
electronic tax payment system was expected to increase the number of electronic filings and
reduce transaction costs for taxpayers and the Revenue Administration Agency (DEI).

Policy Area II: Civil Service Reform
This component of the operation was aimed at improving public sector human resource
management and rationalizing the wage bill, particularly in the education sector. While
current expenditures increased from 16.1 percent of GDP in 2006 to 19.0 percent of GDP in
2009, the wage bill rose from 8.3 percent of GDP to 11.2 percent of GDP in the same period.
The public sector wage bill consumed 75 percent of total tax collections and, although teachers
accounted for more than 60 percent of the total wage bill, education results lagged behind the
regional average. A mid-2010 survey had confirmed the existence of a large number of
redundant teacher positions throughout the country. In order to control the wage bill in the
education sector, the Government, through the Ministry of Finance (SEFIN), signed an inter-
institutional agreement with the Ministry of Planning (SEPLAN) and the Ministry of Education
(SEE) to make publicly available a list of teachers on the payroll and eliminate redundant teacher
positions.

                                                 5
Policy Area III: Reform of the Power Sector Tariffs
This component was aimed at reforming the power sector tariff structure to improve to the
financial sustainability of the state owned electricity company (ENEE). Honduras has
subsidized electricity for a long time. Direct and indirect subsidies include: (i) prices that do not
reflect the full cost of service, including the effect of a tax-exemption on fuels for generation; (ii)
a direct subsidy of the state to residential consumers; (iii) a value-added tax exemption for
electricity; and (iv) free electricity for irregular users. The total cost of subsidies in 2009 was
estimated at US$377 million (2.4 percent of GDP). These large subsidies, combined with
ENEE’s inability to raise tariffs due to political interference, have created a major challenge for
ENEE which provides 98 percent of electricity service in the country. Furthermore, due to
significant technical and non-technical losses, customer payment arrears (including public and
private sector clients) and low tariff collections, ENEE had accumulated significant arrears with
private sector fuel electricity generators. The implementation of reform in this area was expected
to improve ENEE’s monthly revenues by US$6 million, save Government $23 million per year
in subsidy costs, and eliminate ENEE’s arrears.

Policy Area IV: Strengthening Public Financial Management and Transparency
This component of the operation supported the Government’s efforts to resolve
outstanding public sector arrears and investigate shortcomings of the integrated financial
management system (SIAFI). Public sector financial management and transparency remain a
key weakness notwithstanding the fact that since 2004 the Government embarked on a Public
Financial Management (PFM) reform program to address them. Gaps in the coverage of the
SIAFI have been particularly problematic and have led to the accumulation of public sector
arrears. As of 2010 total public sector arrears were estimated at L. 12 billion (4.1 percent of
GDP), with the bulk representing intra-public sector arrears, delayed payments to civil servants
or contingent liabilities. For those claims that were documented, the Government devised an
adequate payment plan (through inclusion as expenditure in the 2010 budget, bond issuance, etc.).
However, approximately L. 3 billion in undocumented claims remained, which may or may not
have represented legitimate claims on public resources. Thus, the Government required an audit
in order to determine the legitimacy of these claims and resolve them.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance
Upon the completion of all prior actions, the Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC was
approved by the Board on November 9, 2010. The single tranche operation became effective
on December 9, 2010 and was disbursed on December 15, 2010. The quick disbursement

                                                  6
     fulfilled a critical role in helping to fill the 2010 financing gap of the Government, and the loan
     closed on November 15, 2011. The DPC was the single lending operation envisaged in the
     Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which was presented to the Board simultaneously with this DPC
     and was intended to specifically contribute to the ISN objective of macro stability and growth.

loopholes and      2010 which:
widen the tax       Eliminated, under the value-added tax (ISV) regime, the tax credit in favor of producers
base                  of tax-exempt goods which inputs are associated directly with the manufacture of the
                      same;
                    Eliminated ISV exemptions for: (i) freight and insurance charges, and (ii) residential
                      customers which electricity consumption exceeds 750 kWh per month; and
                    Introduced a flat 10 percent income tax rate on dividends and capital gains on: (i)
                      individuals who reside, or have a domicile, in the country, and (ii) individuals and legal
                      entities which do not reside, or do not have a domicile, in the Recipient’s territory.
 Improve tax       In order to help the Revenue Administration Agency (DEI) improve taxpayer compliance,           Completed
administration     the Government has:
                    Submitted to Congress the Law on Strengthening and Updating the Tax and Customs
                      System, which reforms the tax procedure code.

                   In order to reduce transaction costs, the Government, through the DEI, has :
                    Established a fully operational electronic tax payment system in five private banking
                      institutions for purposes of enabling taxpayers to make payments of their tax obligations
                      through the system.

     2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
     The implementation of the program was somewhat affected by the following factors:
            Impacts of the global financial crisis. The slower-than-expected recovery from the global
            crisis prevented tax revenues from reaching the DPC outcome indicator target of 16.1
            percent due to difficulties in central government finances (higher than expected use of
            income tax credits) and unresolved weaknesses in tax administration. Furthermore, higher-
            than-anticipated international prices of bunker fuel—which is used to generate 70 percent
            of electricity in the country—increased subsidy costs despite the reduction in the number of
            subsidy recipients.
           Impact of crime and violence. Crime and violence is one of the most important
            development challenges in Honduras, which has the highest homicide rate in the world
            (82.4 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants). To protect the citizens from the rise in crime and
            violence, the Government scaled up security and defense expenditure by 0.3 per cent of
            GDP.
   Nevertheless, program implementation has been satisfactory mainly due to the following:
           Consultation and consensus building: The Government gathered strong political support
            for its reform program. The Fiscal Emergency Law and the Law on the Strengthening of
            Revenues, Social Equity and Rationalization of Public Spending were approved by
            Congress in record time, providing a strong foundation for fiscal reforms. Although there
            has been some discontent, fed by a widespread perception of lack of transparency in public
            financial management, in general there was awareness that the global economic crisis,
            combined with the domestic political crisis of 2009, had exacerbated structural challenges
            in the country, increasing the need for reform.
           Collaboration with other donors: The DPC was prepared in coordination with a number
            of donors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Inter-American

                                                               8
     Development Bank (IDB), the European Union (EU), and the Central American Bank for
     Economic Integration (CABEI). In this regard, on October 1, 2010 the IMF Board
     approved blended 18-month arrangements under the Stand-by Credit Facility and the
     Stand-By Arrangement with a total access of 100 percent of quota (about US$202 million).
    Coordination with other World Bank operations: The stand-alone DPC complemented
     the Social Protection Project (US$40 million) approved in September 2010, which
     supported the Bono 10,000 CCT program launched by the Lobo administration to mitigate
     the impact of the economic crisis on the poor. The Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC helped
     to fill the financing gap created by the crisis and allowed the Government to continue
     implementing the CCT program that would provide a transfer of approximately US$45 per
     family to a large share of the extreme poor conditional on investments in human capital
     through regular use of health and/or education services.
    The design of the DPC was based on solid analytical work conducted by the Bank, the
     IDB and the IMF: Most notably, the overall design of the operation was based on
     analytical work such as: Fiscal Emergency Non-Lending Technical Assistance (WB 2010);
     Public Expenditure Tracking and Service Delivery Survey- Education and Health in
     Honduras (WB 2010); Honduras Public Expenditure Review (WB 2007); and Power Sector
     Efficiency Enhancement Project (WB 2010). The DPC also drew on analytical work
     carried out by the IDB and the Government on the main weaknesses, challenges, and future
     opportunities for tax policy and tax administration: Desafíos de la Política Tributaria en
     Honduras (IDB 2010) and Honduras: Hacia un Sistema Tributario Más Transparente y
     Diversificado (IDB 2005).
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
Design: Outcome indicators, baseline values, and targets were assigned to each of the four
policy areas defined under the DPC program. The design focused on outcome and output
indicators that were easy to calculate with existing information and that were expected to be
achieved by the closing date of the operation (September 2011). The M&E sought to align output
indicators to indicators and targets frequently monitored by the Government, such as tax
revenues to GDP, number of taxpayers using the electronic payment system and number of
households receiving the electricity subsidy. The M&E arrangements also placed clear
responsibilities for data collection within the Government. Thus, SEFIN and the National
Institute of Statistics (INE), together with the Central Bank of Honduras and the Ministries of
Education and Planning, had to collect the necessary data for the identified monitoring indicators.
The adequacy of the indicators is satisfactory and the existing data has been used for decision
making.
Implementation: The Ministry of Finance (SEFIN) is the agency responsible for the
implementation of the operation as well as for coordinating the actions among the concerned
agencies including the Central Bank of Honduras, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of
Planning. The SEFIN and the Bank had agreed to monitor the progress in the program supported
by the DPC and had joint responsibilities in the preparation of periodic reports. These reports
included specific milestones to assist in monitoring adequate and timely implementation of the
program. A mid-year review of progress towards achieving the DPC outcomes took place in
March 2011 in preparation of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with the Government.


                                                9
Overall, data collection was appropriate and indicators were reported most of the time on a
timely basis.
 Utilization: The Bank leveraged its M&E engagement with the Government of Honduras in the
design of new investment lending and a new series of programmatic development policy credits.
In the First Programmatic Reducing Vulnerabilities for Growth DPC (November 2011), outcome
indicators such as Indicator 1 (raise Tax to GDP), Indicator 2 (improve tax administration) and
Indicator 3 (bringing the public wage bill under control in key sectors, with a focus on education)
were used to monitor further progress in the key reform areas.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
The Government demonstrated its interest in continued financial and technical support
from the Bank in the context of a series of DPCs. The Bank continued providing assistance in
the policy areas supported under the Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC through the Programmatic
Reducing Vulnerabilities for Growth DPC series (first operation of US$ 86 million approved on
December 6, 2011). In parallel, the Bank prepared the Improving Public Sector Performance
Technical Assistance Loan to address, inter alia, human resource management issues (US$18
million, approved on December 6, 2011)

The First Programmatic Reducing Vulnerabilities for Growth DPC builds on the progress
achieved under the Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC. It reflects the Government’s priority of
achieving fiscally and economically sustainable growth and is designed to assist the Government
in strengthening fiscal management and in designing an integrated citizen security policy.
Specifically, the operation supports four areas that are central to the reform program: (i) tax
administration; (ii) civil service reform; (iii) pension reform, and (iv) citizen security reform. The
DPC series is envisaged in the new Country Partnership Strategy for FY2012-2014.

The DPC objectives are closely aligned with other Bank operations. The recently approved
Improving Public Sector Performance Technical Assistance Loan supports the Government in
strengthening public sector human resource management through: (i) upgrading the public
financial management system; (ii) upgrading the e-procurement platform; (iii) enhancing the
internal control systems over personnel expenditures; and (iv) building capacity of the Central
Administration.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The operation’s Program Development Objectives (PDOs) continue to be relevant. The
Government is committed to fiscal consolidation and reducing public sector vulnerabilities. In
June 2011, Congress approved the Efficiency of Revenues and Expenditures Law, which
eliminates some tax exemptions and enforces new measures against tax evasion. The fiscal
consolidation will come from reducing the wage bill, increasing tax revenues through tax
administration measures, and addressing contingent liabilities in the electricity sector. The
Government’s National Development Plan 2010-2022 consolidated the provision of social
services while recognizing the importance of a sustainable macroeconomic environment and a



                                                 10
modern, transparent, efficient and competitive state, two of the four pillars of the 2010-2014
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).1

While growth rebounded in 2010-11, the uncertainty due to the Euro zone crisis continues
to represent a threat. In the event of a new global crisis, the Honduran economy may
experience a contraction similar to the one in 2009 (-2.1 percent).2 However, the fiscal impact
may be less severe thanks to the structural reforms which helped create fiscal space by
improving public sector human resource management and rationalizing the wage bill.

Structural reforms in the electricity and education sectors continue to be at the forefront of
the national policy debate. The program initiated the policy dialogue on targeting electricity
subsidies and tariffs based on income surveys, contributing to the financial sustainability of the
Electricity Company. The policy actions and measures taken were also relevant for supporting
good governance and transparency in the use of public resources in the education sector. Finally,
the actions taken to resolve outstanding public sector arrears and investigate shortcomings of the
SIAFI helped to strengthen public financial management and transparency.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Overall, the program was successful in achieving the proposed objectives. The PDO was to
assist the Government in bringing public finances back to a sustainable path. Annex 1 of this
report details the status of the outcomes as of the closing of the operation, and also lays out the
actions the Government is implementing as part of its medium term reform program. The
outcomes and current status of policy areas under each objective are discussed below.

Objective 1: Closing tax loopholes and widening the tax base
Policy Area I (a): Increase Central Government tax revenue. Partially achieved. Central
Government tax revenue as share of GDP reached 15.1 percent in 2011, up from 14.4 and 14.8
percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively, but below the 16.1 percent target. The reasons
for this outturn include some delays in implementing the tax reform—which meant that the
impacts were observed over a period of less than 12 months—and the fact that economic growth
was slower than expected due to high international oil prices and slow recovery in the U.S.,
Honduras’s main trading partner and investor. However, it should be noted that reaching 15.1
percent tax/GDP ratio is no small achievement compared to other countries in the region:
Guatemala (11 percent), Panama (12.3 percent), Costa Rica (13.4 percent), and El Salvador (13.8
percent).

Objective 2 - Improve tax administration
Policy Area I (b): Increase the number of taxpayers using the electronic payment system.
Partially achieved. The number of taxpayers using the electronic payment system was expected


1
  An Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Honduras covered a 12-month period up to October 2011. The ISN was
completed successfully, setting the stage for moving to a full Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period
2012-2014 that responds to the Honduras Country Vision and National Plan, supported by the Lobo Administration.
2
  In the event of a new global contraction, maquila exports and remittances—two major sources of income and
foreign exchange—are likely to decline significantly.

                                                      11
to increase by 10 percent from 163,198 in 2009 to about 180,000 in 2010. Although the
information on the number of taxpayers is not available, the number of tax return statements
submitted through the electronic payment system rose to 177,363 in 2010. Additional progress
took place in 2011, with the number of returns increasing by 35 percent to 238,340. In the
medium term the Government is committed to further strengthening the tax administration
through a number of measures aimed at making customs and tax administration more effective.
This includes the adoption of legislation on transfer pricing and tax evasion, the creation of the
office of control of tax exemptions and the application of rules of origin in customs. In this
regard, the transfer pricing law has been approved and published in December 2011 and the
General Directorate of Control of Customs Franchises was created in the Ministry of Finance
(SEFIN) on March 2011. The Directorate is responsible for acknowledging and registering
matters related to tax exemptions in accordance with Conventions and International Treaties.

Objective 3 - Improving human resource management in the education sector and
rationalizing the public sector wage bill
Policy Area II: Reduction of the wage bill. Achieved. The wage bill of the central government
declined to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2011, nearly a full percentage point of GDP better than the
10.7 percent target and an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Government. The reasons
for better-than-expected performance included a teachers’ payroll audit which allowed the
Government to eliminate ghost workers and stop paying incorrect allowances, freezing of
teachers pay through October 2011, permanently delinking teachers’ salary adjustments from the
private sector minimum wage, and filling new teachers' demands with existing teachers once the
list of teachers had been made public. Furthermore, the Government has committed to using the
previous year’s inflation rate, as determined by the Central Bank, as the basis for pay negotiation
for all public servants.

Objective 4 - Reforming the Power Sector Structure to contribute to the financial
sustainability of the state-owned Electricity Company
Policy Area III (a): Increase electricity tariffs and revenues of the Electricity Company.
Achieved. A series of adjustments to ENEE electricity tariffs generated additional average
monthly revenue of US$6.2 million between April 2010 and December 2011, exceeding the
program target of US$6 million. Electricity tariffs were adjusted by 6 percent in June 2010 and
an additional 3 percent towards the end of the year. In 2011, the Government continued to apply
the automatic adjustment formula to achieve a cumulative tariff increase of 32 percent for the
entire year. These adjustments generated additional revenues of US$123.6 million by December
2011, which averages to a monthly increase of US$6.18 million. However, the sharp increase in
international prices of bunker fuel—which rose from to US$101.31 per barrel in December 2011
from US$74.99 in January 2011—prevented further gains in revenue.

Policy Area III (b): Increase the Government’s savings by restructuring direct subsidies.
Partially Achieved. Direct subsidy costs declined by US$16 million in 2011, short of the US$23
million target. In 2009, the direct subsidy costs were estimated at US$63 million, the baseline
value for this outcome indicator. In 2010, following the revision of the subsidy thresholds, the
total subsidy costs declined to US$45.2 million. However, due to a significant increase in bunker
fuel prices in 2011—and despite the reduction in the number of households receiving subsidies


                                                12
to 535,000 from 900,000 in 2009—the cost of subsidies rose to US$47.1 million, exceeding the
target by US$7 million.

Policy Area III (c): Elimination of ENEE’s arrears with private sector power generators.
Achieved. By end-2011, ENEE paid all the arrears to private sector generators—ELCOSA,
LUFUSSA, ENERSA-EMCE and RENOVABLES--using the resources provided by the
Ministry of Finance last September. Currently, ENEE does not register any delays in payments.

Objective 5 - Resolving outstanding public sector arrears and investigating the
shortcomings of the Financial Management System
Policy Area IV: Auditing and resolving unaccounted and unpaid transactions. Partially
Achieved. As of September 2011, results of a forensic audit of the disputed payment arrears have
been delivered to the Superior Court of Auditors, which will take the appropriate actions. The
resolution of the disputed payments based on this audit will allow unfounded claims to be
eliminated from the books. Moreover, as a first step in improving the effectiveness of the SIAFI,
the Government plans to link procurement, investment and human resources management
modules to the SIAFI to ensure broader coverage. With regard to procurement, every
Government institution is now required to prepare and publish its annual procurement plan
linked to its operating annual plan, to the budget, and the SIAFI.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating is Satisfactory. The DPC achieved the proposed Program Development
Objectives. The supported program helped bring public finances back on a sustainable path and
aided in the progress towards macroeconomic stability despite the unfavorable external
environment. The operation supported tax policy and administration reforms and a substantial
reduction in the public wage bill. It also help reduce inefficient and poorly targeted subsidies in
the electricity sector and supported the Government’s public financial management strategy,
allowing the repayment of significant public sector arrears. Overall, the Government was able to
fully achieve three of the seven outcome indicators and partially achieve the rest.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The DPC implementation was expected to have an overall positive impact on poverty and social
development, especially when taking into account the effects of the Bono 10,000 CCT program.
The tax and civil service reforms were estimated to have a progressive impact, affecting higher
income groups more than the poor. Similarly, the analysis in the DPC program document
demonstrated that electricity tariffs were highly regressive and their reduction would have a
positive distributional effect. The implications in poverty and social development are less clear
for the elimination of redundant teachers’ positions and from fulfilling the demand of new
teachers using those already registered on the payroll of the Ministry of Education, but this is
expected to lead to improved human resource management and important savings in the wage
bill. Finally, the program supported by the DPC has no identifiable impact on gender.


                                                13
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)
The DPC helped promoting institutional changes by supporting actions to strengthen tax
administration; to optimize the management of human resources in the Ministry of Education; to
contribute to the financial sustainability of ENEE; and, further strengthen the public financial
management and fiscal transparency.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Moderate
The operation identified that achievement of the development objectives of this operation would
be subject to four main sources of risk:
Political risks: The highly polarized society following the political crisis of 2009 continued to be
a political obstacle for the approval and implementation of the planned fiscal reform package,
which proved to be more difficult than anticipated and therefore jeopardized the needed increase
in revenues. In order to reduce this risk, the Government has been building consensus to
implement the needed reforms to bring the country’s finances back to a sustainable path. For
example, the Government garnered initial political support for its reform program. The Fiscal
Emergency Law and the Law on the Strengthening of Revenues, Social Equity and
Rationalization of Public Spending were approved by Congress in record time, providing a
strong foundation for the fiscal reforms. The Honduran public was made aware of the urgent
need for fiscal reform through news coverage and public debates among political figures.
Macroeconomic risks: On the economic front, the main risk comes from high external
vulnerabilities and the still fragile recovery from the global crisis. Although growth has
rebounded since the 2009 contraction, Honduras remains one of the most vulnerable countries in
the region to any potential global slowdown. Its strongest linkages are with the US, which
purchases 41 percent of Honduran exports and is the source of 89 percent of all remittances
coming into Honduras. Although vulnerabilities in the financial sector are likely to be limited
due to the sector’s relatively good health and its relatively low external exposure, export and
remittances vulnerabilities are high. In the event of a global slowdown, the scope to counteract
through fiscal or monetary policy would be very limited given the scarce fiscal space and the
narrow foreign exchange. To mitigate the risk, the Bank and the IMF are maintaining on-going
dialogue with the authorities on macroeconomic policy issues.
Institutional risk: On the institutional side, the main risk is related to a weak capacity of
Government institutions to implement the program. In order to reduce this risk, the Bank has
been working with other donors to support the Government’s fiscal consolidation efforts,
including through technical assistance.


                                                14
Environmental risks: On the environmental side, the main risk is the country's high exposure to
multiple natural disasters. Honduras has been hit by multiple hurricanes in recent years which
resulted in significant damage. The country's past experience has highlighted the value of
investing on early warning systems, institutional strengthening and mitigation efforts. Building
on the progress made to date in this area, the Bank is providing support to strengthen the
country's natural disaster mitigation systems.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory
The design of the DPC was appropriate, timely, and relevant for addressing the challenges faced
by the country given external and internal developments, including higher fuel and commodity
prices. The Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC was designed in close collaboration with the
Government to ensure the actions supported by the operation were fully consistent with the
country’s long term development goals included in the Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which was
designed to bridge the gap until a full Country Program Strategy (CPS) was prepared. The
consultation and consensus building activities during preparation were also essential to the
approval and sustainability of the operation, mitigating the political risks associated with the high
social polarization that followed the political crisis of 2009.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
    Rating: Satisfactory
Supervision was carried formally through two supervision missions that followed the Ministry of
Finance (SEFIN) and the Bank agreement during project preparation. These reviews are
summarized in two Implementation Status and Results (ISR) of January 2011 and April 2011,
and in more detail in the Aide-Memoire of April 6, 2011. The Program Performance was
considered satisfactory by the two ISR reports. In parallel, informal supervision took place when
team members visited the country in the context of the CPS preparation and new DPOs.
Supervision was also successful given the clear assignment of responsibilities whereby SEFIN
was responsible for the implementation of the operation as well as for coordinating the actions
among the concerned agencies, including the Central Bank of Honduras, the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry of Planning.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. The operation supported relevant development
objectives, and built consensus around critically important issues. The operation also assessed
several risks for the program sustainability and helped mitigate them. Finally the monitoring and
evaluation system in place allowed both the Government and the Bank to periodically track
progress toward the target outcomes. The SEFIN and the Bank have agreed to monitor the
progress in the program supported by the DPC and its evaluation also served for the preparation
of the new Country Partnership Strategy for the period FY2012-2014 that was finalized in
November 2011.

                                                 15
5.2   Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
Throughout the preparation and supervision process of the operation, the Ministry of Finance
(SEFIN) successfully coordinated with the different ministries (Education and Planning) and
other institutions involved in the operation including, the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), the
National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the national Electricity Company (ENEE). The
coordination was instrumental in shaping the actions of each institution and ensuring the timely
implementation of the prior actions under program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory
SEFIN was the principal executing agency, responsible for the overall coordination of the
operation as set out in the Letter of Development Policy. Similarly, SEFIN was in charge of
reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned entities, including the SEE,
SEPLAN, INE and ENEE. Although delays were encountered in the implementation of the
Government’s program supported by the DPC, the staff in SEFIN continued monitoring and
coordinating the program with the support of Bank Staff. They provided leadership to address
bottlenecks or pending problems, and ensured attention to the every issue.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
Overall the Borrower’s performance is rated as Satisfactory given its high level of engagement
during the preparation, implementation and supervision. As described above, substantial progress
was made in implementation of the program despite the obstacles that prevented the achievement
of one of the outcome indicators, and partially meeting three others. The borrower participation
was crucial in the coordination among the different ministries and institutions involved in the
Program. The fragile social and security situation following the political crisis of 2009 also
played a role in the performance shortcomings.

6. Lessons Learned
The Fiscal Emergency Recovery DPC responded to a specific request from the Government of
Honduras to rapidly address a difficult fiscal situation—which arose due to the combined effects
of an internal political crisis and the global financial crisis—while launching several important
structural reforms. The main lessons from the implementation of this operation include:
Lingering impacts of the crisis and external shocks can have a significant impact on the
achievement of outcomes. The performance on a few outcome indicators was worse than
anticipated during the operation design due to stronger-than-expected effects of the global crisis
and the shocks to bunker fuel prices. While it is not possible to predict the impacts of external
shocks with any degree of certainty, in the future care should be exercised in establishing the
outcome indicators which are, to a large extent, outside of the sphere of control of the authorities.
While continued policy dialogue and technical assistance to the authorities—in this case through
the Programmatic Reducing Vulnerabilities for Growth DPC series and the Improving Public


                                                 16
Sector Performance technical assistance loan—can help mitigate these risks, they cannot
eliminate them completely.
Strong analytical underpinnings are a necessary component of a rapid response. The design
of the operation was backed by solid analytical work which enabled the Bank team to respond to
the Government request within the window of opportunity generated by the social and political
context. Analytical work prepared before the operation, such as the Fiscal Emergency Non-
Lending Technical Assistance; the Public Expenditure Tracking and Service Delivery Survey-
Education and Health; the Honduras Public Expenditure Review; and the Power Sector
Efficiency Enhancement Project allowed the Government and the team to identify priority policy
areas, build consensus around critical issues, and prepare the groundwork for future engagement
in the strategic objective areas under the new Country Program Strategy.
Ownership of reforms and a well-defined reform strategy are critical for a successful
outcome. Bank involvement in promoting consultation and consensus-building activities as well
as continued policy dialogue with the authorities was essential for the successful implementation
of the DPC program in a socially and politically polarized environment. Early re-engagement by
the donors and close collaboration within the donor community was also a key factor for the
success of this operation. However, the satisfactory outcome of the operation is to a large extent
a consequence of the Government’s commitment to address long-standing problems and the
development of a clear reform plan to achieve these objectives.
