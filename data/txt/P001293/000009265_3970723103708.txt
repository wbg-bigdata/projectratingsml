THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation.
Guarantor:             Republic of Kenya.
Amount:                 US$32.6 million equivalent.
Terms:                 Repayable in 20 years, including 5 years' grace, at
standard variable interest rate. KPTC would bear
the foreign exchange risk and pay to the Government
a fee of one percent (1%) p.a. of the principal
amount of the loan outstanding.
Project Description:  The project forms an integral part of the five-year
(1984-88) development plan of KPTC and would be
implemented during 1985-89. It would pursue the
expansion, improvement and modernization of the
infrastructure undertaken by the two previous
Bank-financed projects and support the institu-
tional development of KPTC. Emphasis would be
placed on strengthening KPTC's management systems
which would be monitored through a series of
technical and financial performance indicators. The
project comprises: (a) expansion of telephone and
telex switching facilities, associated cable
networks and subscriber plants, and expansion of
international and long-distance facilities; (b)
improvement in workshops and repair facilities and
provision of spare parts; (c) strengthening of KPTC
training programs and procurement of laboratory
equipment; and (d) improvement of KPTC's management
systems and provision of consultants' services for
studies, including a review of the telecommunica-
tions tariff structure. Business and Government
subscribers would remain the major beneficiaries of
the expansion of local and long distance telephone
and telex facilities, while the expansion of
telephone facilities to the provincial towns and
remote areas would primarily benefit the rural
population.
Project Risk:          Project implementation would be adversely affected
by inadequate improvements in the management
system. However, this risk is contained by the
monitoring and review procedure included in the
project.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Although telecommunications services in Kenya have improved over
the past few years, partly as a result of World Bank involvement, they
remain inadequate. Existing telecommunications services are mainly
concentrated in the largest cities and the quality of service is low. The
Government's objective for the sector is the provision of efficient
telecommunications services throughout the country, which requires
expansion, diversification, and modernization of its facilities. In
addition, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) aims to
improve the quality of service and revenue generation of its assets and
expand its training program.
1.02      The proposed project continues the network development of the two
earlier telecommunications projects in Kenya and places greater emphasis on
institutional development. In addition, a particular objective is to help
Kenya organize a parallel cofinancing package to secure the optimal
combination of prices and terms for equipment procured internationally.
The project comprises the currently unfunded portion of the ongoing five
year development program for 1987-88 and is expected to be completed by
June 30, 1989. The proposed loan of US$32.6 million will meet about 38% of
total project cost or about half of the foreign exchange cost of the
project. The remaining foreign costs will be met by a loan from the
European Investment Bank (23%) and export and mixed credits (26%). KPTC
will meet the local currency and the indirect foreign exchange costs (26%)
of the total project cost.
II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
2.01      The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC), an
autonomous government-owned entity established in 1977, following the
breakup of the East Africa Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, is
responsible for the provision of all domestic and international postal and
telecommunications services in Kenya. In addition to the public
telecommunications services, dedicated networks exist to meet the
specialized requirements of the police, military and civil aviation
services. Private users also operate radio link services in areas
inadequately served by the public network after obtaining a license issued
annually by KPTC. Beside a pole plant owned by KPTC, Kenya has no domestic
telecommunications manufacturing industry.
Access to Service
2.02      With an installed capacity of 150,000 lines and 101,000 connected
subscriber lines (DELs) as of July 31, 1984, Kenya's average telephone



-2-
density of 0.6 DELs per 100 population is among the lowest in "lower-middle
income" countries. Existing telecommunications services are concentrated
around the principal cities of Nairobi and Mombasa (illustrated in
Table 2.1)1/. Telex facilities, which are primarily used for
international communications are even more concentrated in these two cities
with Nairobi and Mombasa accounting for over 70% and 16% respectively of
the total telex lines in Kenya. In an attempt to extend the
telecommunications service, KPTC has substantially increased the number of
public call offices (PCOs) to 1,253 nationwide as of July 31, 1984, which
are accessible 24 hours a day. There are also 1,050 rental call
boxes 2/. Subscriber trunk dialing (STD) facilities for long distance
calls are available for subscribers connected to automatic exchanges.
Access to international service is available through two standard A earth
satellite stations, and through microwave radio links to Tanzania and
Uganda.

Source: KPTC
Usage of Service
2.03      An analysis of KPTC subscriber listings in 1981 estimated that
57% of the exchange lines in Kenya were connected to business premises or
government offices. Commercial and administrative traffic is likely to be
higher than these figures due to a large number of residential lines and
public call boxes being used for business purposes. In addition, analysis
of telephone billings for a typical month, July 1984, indicates that 71% of
KPTC's revenue comes from 20% of subscribers with monthly bills greater
than K Sh 1,000 (US$68) (Annex 2). It is estimated that more than 75% of
the telephone revenue is generated from business and about 14% from
government subscribers.
2.04      Since KPTC does not maintain statistical records on pulse metered
STD traffic flows, it is not possible to distinguish long distance STD
traffic volume within total metered traffic. Some spot samplings conducted
1/ See Annex 1 for details on regional distribution of service.

in previous years, however, indicate that more than half of the long
distance calls throughout Kenya originate from or are directed to Nairobi;
in medium sized towns this proportion is as high as 70%.
2.05      As in many other developing countries, telex service in Kenya is
essentially used for international messages, particularly for commerce,
which account for over 90% of traffic volume as measured by revenue
statistics.  In recent years the volume of telex traffic has closely
followed the increase in volume of Kenya's international trade. This
reflects the critical infrastructural role of telecommunications services
in Kenya's open economy.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
2.06      Local telephone service is only fair in the major cities with the
call completion rate averaging 45% compared to the 65-75% typical of good
local networks. This low completion rate mainly results from high traffic
per DEL and KPTC's inability to supply more DELs for business subscribers.
Faults averaging 1.2 faults per telephone per annum (a reasonable target
would be 0.5) indicate the scope for improvement in maintenance of cable
networks and subscriber plant as well as in the quality of repairs.   Only
about 30% of the faults are cleared the same day whereas 80% would be a
reasonable expectation particularly in the cities. Maintenance and repair
capability has declined recently due to difficulties in the procurement of
spares and miscellaneous repair material as a consequence of the foreign
exchange scarcity and Government import controls.
2.07      The long distance STD service which was heavily congested has
substantially improved since the commissioning in December 1984 of large
trunk switching extension equipment. In late 1984, subscriber
international dialing to major overseas destinations was made available
from major telephone exchanges in the Nairobi area. International
telephone traffic for the other part of the network is operator assisted
but the quality of service is good. Basic data on existing facilities are
set out in Annex 3.
Demand for Service
2.08      There has been a steady decline in the ratio of connected lines
to expressed demand for telephone service from 70% in 1974 to only 55% in
July 1984. Telex services have expanded fourfold during the last decade
but also have been unable to meet the growing demand. As of July 1984,
only two thirds of the expressed demand was being satisfied. Consequently,
domestic telegraph service remains an important mode of communication in
Kenya. Figure 1 (Annex 4) displays the historical and projected growth in
expressed demand and connected subscriber lines. The expected growth in
expressed demand is 11% per annum compared to the 12.3% growth per annum
experienced over 1979-83 reflecting lower economic activity. Supply is
projected to increase at the rate of 13.5%. However, even under optimistic
supply scenarios there is little possibility of meeting the expressed
demand by the end of the 1980s.



-4-
Sector Goals
2.09      To accord with national economic goals, the Government's
objective for the telecommunications sector in the current Five Year
Development Plan in Kenya is the provision of efficient telecommunications
services throughout the country, requiring further expansion,
diversification, and modernization of its facilities. Expenditure on
telecommunications will increase from an average of 0.7% of GNP over the
last five years to 0.9% for the current plan period. The Plan document
also states that KPTC should be financially self-sufficient and improve its
technical and financial management. The difficult economic situation in
Kenya and the shortage of government budgetary resources makes this
objective particularly important. In addition, KPTC's goals are to
optimize capacity utilization, improve the quality of service and revenue
generation of the assets, and expand its training program.
2.10      KPTC has translated these goals into the following program
objectives to be pursued during the 1980s:
(a) Improved quality of local, long distance, and international
telephone services through better network balance, improved
maintenance of installed plant as well as rehabilitation and
replacement of old assets;
(b)  Improvement of KPTC's institutional capabilities pertaining to
program planning and implementation, procurement, operational
efficiency including maintenance procedures, and financial
management;
(c) Expanded access to telephone service to meet unsatisfied demand
in both urban and rural areas including provision of public call
offices;
(d) Provision of telex lines to meet business needs; and
(e) Enhanced revenue generation from assets through elimination of
critical bottlenecks and appropriate tariff levels.
Sector Constraints
2.11      Institutional.  The operative constraint to the availability and
quality of telecommunications services in Kenya is the management of the
sector which determines KPTC's capacity to implement investment programs,
operate, and maintain the facilities. The quality of locally available
repair material and services is often inadequate (para. 2.06) and delivery
is unreliable, while KPTC's workshops are poorly equipped. KPTC has made
substantial progress in improving its organization, but this has been
outstripped by the growth in size and complexity of the network.
Consequently shortcomings remain in several areas such as investment,
manpower, and financial planning and programming of outside and subscriber
plant installation and maintenance.



-5-
2.12      Financial.  Another constraint to further investment is the
scarcity of foreign exchange resources. The telecommunications sector has
to compete with others to obtain such resources which are constrained by
the adverse balance of payments situation and Kenya's debt service
capacity. There is a shortage of requisite materials, equipment and spares
particularly imported items not financed through foreign loans and credits
(para. 2.06). Cost escalation due to inflation and staff growth in recent
years has limited the local funds available to KPTC, and the level of
telecommunications tariffs has become a binding constraint on KPTC's
ability to sustain its sectoral investment program. A tariff increase of
30% to be effected in 1985, will ease this constraint.
The Bank's Role
2.13      The Bank has had a constructive role in the development of the
telecommunications system in Kenya and the dialogue with KPTC is open and
constructive.  The first project (Loan 1650-KE), approved in 1979, is
completed and KPTC will submit a project completion report by mid 1985.
The second project (Loan 2155-KE), approved in 1982, is progressing on
schedule with 87% of the loan amount committed and 45% disbursed and is
expected to be completed in 19873/. The primary aim of these projects was
to assist Kenya in establishing a modern telecommunications network with
long distance and subscriber dialing facilities as well as expanding the
local service in Nairobi and some of the larger towns. Capacity increased
from 99,000 exchange lines (70,000 DELs) in 1979 to 150,000 lines (101,000
DELs) in July 1984 (Annex 3). Besides meeting a substantial part of the
foreign exchange needs for the requisite investments, the Bank has been a
source of independent technical and economic advice through its close
association with KPTC during project preparation and implementation and
through the provision of external expertise financed under the loans.
Immediate benefits such as KPTC's success in obtaining good prices for
equipment procured under ICB, have been complemented by the identification
of the institution building required to develop the requisite financial and
manpower bases within KPTC as well as the managerial and information
frameworks. The merger of KENEXTEL into KPTC was undertaken in 1982 on the
advice and with the encouragement of the Bank. Although the quality of
service has generally improved with these projects, KPTC has been unable to
meet the target for connecting new subscribers to the newly created
exchange capacity.  Insufficient spare capacity and inadequate maintenance
in the local network and difficulties in procuring miscellaneous connecting
material are the major causes. Consequently, the third project allocates
substantial expenditure to installation and cables in the subscriber
network and to training (about 50%).
2.14      The Bank's role is now to address the constraints facing the
sector (paras. 2.11 and 2.12) and to place greater emphasis on
3/ The telecommunications system in Kenya also benefitted from the Bank's
involvement in three loans to the East African Community (Loans 483-EA,
675-EA, and 914-EA) from 1967-74.

institutional development. The proposed project emphasizes the upgrading
and integration of the management systems to ensure better use of
financial, human, material and informational resources. The slow
connection rate of new subscribers (para. 2.13) reflects the need to
improve the balance of the network and planning. Emphasis will also be
given to training, maintenance, and operation procedures. In addressing
the financial constraint, a particular objective of this project is to help
Kenya organize a cofinancing package to secure the optimal combination of
prices and terms for equipment procured internationally.  The project also
contains many items which are unlikely to attract favorable financing and
consequently, will be financed by the Bank.
III. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The Program
3.01      Kenya's five-year Telecommunications Investment Program is
reviewed and rolled over every two years, at which time the costs and
dimensioning for the last three years of the preceding program are updated
and new projects for the following two years are added. The first
three-year slice of the 1984-88 program includes ongoing works under the
Second Telecommunications Project financed by the Bank (Loan 2155-KE),
extensions of switching facilities and urban networks financed by the
Japanese OECF, and long distance microwave routes financed by French
bilateral assistance. Implementation of these ongoing projects is
proceeding well and completion of the major components is expected by
1986. The program was revised by KPTC in consultation with the appraisal
mission. Two projects with an estimated cost of US$46.8 million, without
sufficient economic justification or considered premature at the present
stage of network development, were dropped from the program4/. The share
of building construction under the program has also been trimmed from K Sh
462.9 million (US$32.0 million) to K Sh 337.2 million (US$23.3 million).
The 1984-88 program will cost about K Sh 3,952.4 million (US$267.1
million), with 66% foreign costs (Annex 5). At negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the Bank would be informed by KPTC of any major changes
in its 1984-88 investment program.
The Project
3.02      The proposed Third Telecommunications Project comprises the
currently unfunded portion of the ongoing 1984-1988 five-year program and
will be implemented from 1985-1989. It pursues the expansion, improvement
and modernization of the infrastructure undertaken by the two previous
4/ A second international gateway from Mombasa including the Kenyan
contribution to a submarine cable linking Mombasa to Djibouti (US$37.3
million) and a maritime earth satellite station at Mombasa (US$9.5
million).

projects and provides support for the institutional development of KPTC.
Modern digital technology is being introduced to the Kenyan network under
the second project, and facilities to be procured under the proposed
project have been planned to complement these earlier investments. The
focus of the institutional development efforts under the project would be
on strengthening KPTC's management systems and sustaining the progress
which has already been made in the areas of asset utilization, operational
procedures, staffing and manpower development, financial control,
investment planning, procurement and project implementation. This will be
achieved through monitoring technical and financial performance indicators
and undertaking the recommendations of consultants's reports on
organizational and procedural changes.
3.03      In accordance with the sectoral objectives (paras. 2.09 and 2.10)
the project comprises the following:
(a)  (i)  Expansion of local telephone switching facilities
(44,700 automatic lines and 3,180 rural manual
lines), and associated cable networks and
subscriber plants;
(ii) Expansion of the long distance networks by the
installation of two microwave radio links,
multiplex equipment (2,028 channels) and trunk
switching equipment (3,568 trunk lines), and;
(iii) Expansion of telex facilities (3,500 lines).
(b) Improvement in the telecommunications workshops and
repair facilities and provision of spare parts;
(c) Strengthening of KPTC's training programs through
training experts and procurement of laboratory
equipment for the central training center;
(d) Improvement of KPTC's management systems and provision of
consultants' services for studies, including a
review of the telecommunications tariff structure.
A detailed list of physical items is provided in Annex 6, and
the scope of component (d) is identified in draft terms of reference in
Annex 12.
Project Cost
3.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at about K Sh 1,274.8
million (US$86.1 million) with a direct foreign exchange component to be
financed by external sources, of about K Sh 926.2 million (US$63.9
million) and a total foreign exchange component of K Sh 966.4 million
(US$65.3 million). Project cost estimates are based on equipment and civil

building construction, which has not been proposed for Bark's financing. (Local
tendering for selection of building contractors has already started.)
Contingencies
3.05       Foreign price contingencies are based on estimated annual foreign
cost increases of 5% in 1985, 7.5% in 1986, and 8% annually thereafter.
Local price contingencies for building construction, civil works and other
local expenditures reflect an estimated annual increase in local costs of
12% in 1985 and 1986 and 10% thereafter. Physical contingencies of 5% on
local and foreign equipment costs, 10% on the local cost of civil works,
and 10% on local and foreign costs of services have been added to base
costs.
Financing
3.06       Present market conditions in the world telecommunications
equipment industry, particularly for switching components, have resulted in
a willingness among suppliers to arrange financing on relatively favorable
terms. In order to mobilize additional resources and to secure the optimal



financing package, KPTC has invited international competitive bidding on
prices and terms for the largest telephone switching contract (estimated at
US$16.7 million). Neither the Bank nor European Investment Bank (EIB),
which participated in the appraisal, will participate in financing this
component. Securing the financing of the switching contract is a condition
of loan effectiveness. An EIB loan of US$14.6 million will finance
telecommunications hardware and its effectiveness is a condition of
effectiveness for the Bank 16an.
3.07      The financing plan is summarized in Table 3.2 below:

Procurement
3.08      Procurement arrangements are summarized below.  The Bank loan
would finance US$21.2 million of equipment, grouped in appropriate
packages, and procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Local manufacturers would receive preference of 15% or the import duty,
whichever is lower. Negotiations with existing suppliers would be used to
procure US$6.7 million of equipment including long distance switching
equipment for existing exchanges (US$1.9 million) and for cable connecting
material (US$3.9 million). This will result in standardization and
economies resulting from the use of existing common switching equipment,
and will maintain the standardization of installation and maintenance
procedures of jointing material. Bank approval of the negotiated contracts
will be required to ensure they are reasonably in line with those likely
under ICB. Limited international bidding (LIB) would be used to procure
US$2.7 million of equipment including hardware and manual switchboards for
the rural telephony, tools and spares for the workshops, laboratory

packages because the amounts involved are small or there are only a limited
number of suppliers for the goods to be procured. US$2.0 million of
consultants and training will be procured according to Bank guidelines.
The EIB loan will finance US$12.6 million of equipment procured along ICB
guidelines and one negotiated contract (US$2.0 million) procured in
accordance with EIB guidelines. Export and mixed credits (US$16.7 million)
would finance the switching contract to be procured following the
invitation of ICB on prices and terms (para. 3.06).
3.09       Contract Review.  During negotiations, it was agreed that prior
Bank review of procurement documentation would be required for those
contracts estimated to be larger than US$500,000. This implies that 12
contracts amounting to approximately US$26.6 million (82% of the proposed



- 11 -
Bank loan) will be reviewed. Random checking of smaller contracts would be
conducted during supervision missions.  The list of goods and services to
be procured under the project is presented in Annex 7. Bids for 65% by
value of the total estimated project cost have been issued.
Project Implementation
3.10      KPTC will implement the project which is expected to be completed
by June 30, 1989. The proposed implementation schedule is presented in
Annex 8. System design has been prepared for the network extension under
the project. KPTC's bidding documents have been redrafted in line with the
Bank's sample bidding documents; technical specifications for all material
and equipment are ready and tender invitations will be issued by April
1985. As for the previous projects, KPTC proposes to continue to retain
the services of engineering consultants for the procurement of electronic
digital switching equipment. The largest telephone switching contract is
expected to be finalized by mid 1985 and equipment manufacture completed at
the beginning of 1987. For the preparation of the technical specifications
for transmission equipment of the satellite earth station, KPTC retained
the service of INTELSAT. For the remaining long distance radio and
multiplex equipment, the procurement process will be undertaken by KPTC.
Installation of digital switching and transmission equipment would be done
or supervised by the respective suppliers. With the exception of three
small exchange buildings to be constructed under the project, most of the
switching and transmission equipment can be installed in existing buildings
and it appears unlikely that delays would occur for these project
components. In this respect, the past KPTC performance has been very
satisfactory. Procurement, manufacturing, and delivery of materials and
equipment for outside and subscriber plants should be completed toward the
end of 1986. Construction of buildings, cable ducts, and telephone wiring
in large administrative buildings would be carried out by local private
contractors under KPTC's supervision. Laying and jointing of cables, and
installation of distribution cabinets, poles, aerial cables and terminal
cabinets would be done by KPTC staff. For the latter, KPTC's past
performance has been less satisfactory. Although improvements have been
achieved in 1984, close monitoring would be required during supervision
supervision (through performance indicators, para. 3.12) and if necessary,
hiring of private contractors should be considered for large
installations. Delays in connecting new subscribers would not affect loan
disbursement but delay the benefits of the project. The training component
of the project has been prepared in cooperation with the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) (para. 3.03c) and would be implemented with
the assistance of experts from this organization. A team of consultants
would be selected to carry out the Management Improvement Program according
to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.11)
Disbursements
3.11      The proposed Bank Loan of US$32.6 million would be disbursed
against full standard documentation on the basis of (a) 100% of foreign
expenditures on switching and transmission equipment, cables and material,



- 12 -
telephone instruments, subscribers instruments, and fellowships; (b) 100%
of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures on workshop equipment
and tools, material for rural networks, air conditioning, power plants and
school equipment; and (c) 100% of total expenditures for consultants
services. In accordance with Bank procedures a limitation of no less than
US$20,000 equivalent would be imposed on disbursements for applications
submitted under procedures I, III, V, and VI. The estimated disbursement
schedule (Annex 9) reflects the experience of past telecommunications
projects in Kenya with an average disbursement profile of about five
years 5/ and the fact that 65% of the bids for this project have been
issued (para. 3.09).
Performance Indicators
3.12      A critical aspect of the upgrading of KPTC's management systems
is to monitor through selected performance indicators, its service quality,
financial situation, operating efficiency and program implementation, and
to take requisite corrective actions in a timely manner. KPTC will prepare
annually for Bank review an analysis of its performance against these
indicators (Annex 10). While the targets for later years are indicative,
those for 1986 were agreed by KPTC during negotiations, as representing
desirable and feasible levels of attainment. The targets for each of the
subsequent years will be agreed to jointly by the Bank and KPTC during the
preceding year together with corrective measures to be taken to improve
performance.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTATION AGENCY
Organization
4.01      KPTC is an autonomous government-owned corporation administered
by a seven-member Board of Directors, whose chairman and three members are
appointed by the Minister for Transport and Communications. Two members
are the ex-officio permanent secretaries to the Ministry of Transport and
Communications and the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The seventh
member, the managing director, is appointed by the Minister of Transport
and Communications in consultation with the members of the Board. The
Board establishes policy but fragmented management systems in KPTC make it
difficult to be effective. The managing director assisted by a deputy,
administers the day to day business of KPTC. KPTC has telecommunications
and postal operations. KPTC headquarters has three operational
departments: domestic telecommunications services, external
telecommunications services,and postal services; and five support
departments: finance, legal, buildings, personnel, and corporate planning,
5/ The profiles of the three East African Community Projects (Loans,
483, 675, and 914) and the first Kenya Telecommunications Project (Loan
1680-KE) are considered.



- 13 -
research and development.  Outside headquarters, the postal and
telecommunications services are managed by eight divisional managers who
handle local planning and construction, operation and maintenance in their
divisions. There are separate regional branches for telecommunications,
posts, buildings, accounts and personnel respectively. KPTC's organization
chart is given in Annex 11.
4.02      Through its earlier involvement, the Bank assisted in certain
organizational improvements (para. 2.13). However, as telecommunications
services expand, there is a continuing need to reassess organizational
structure and procedures. The corporate planning, research and development
department, for example, appears overstaffed and may be duplicating the
planning functions of other departments rather than being engaged in
strategic planning and coordination which are its appropriate functions.
This was particularly evident in the original formulation of the investment
financial and manpower components. There is a clear need for further
integration of the external telecommunications department into the
mainstream of KPTC operations to ensure the formulation and implementation
of sector policies based on consistent assessment of demand and traffic,
service quality, system choices and designs, cost estimates, procurement
methods, maintenance procedures and other operational matters. Management
consultants, to be provided under the project under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, will attempt to address those organizational
problems. Progress will be monitored through the performance indicators
(para. 3.12).
Staff and Training
4.03      As of December 31, 1983, KPTC's telecommunications staff totalled
about 10,700 equivalent to 112 employees per 1,000 DELs which is high.
Even after adjusting for 1,039 employees absorbed from the merger of
KENEXTEL into KPTC, this amounts to an increase of 35% over the 7,150 staff
in December 1981. KPTC is one of the few profitable parastatals in Kenya
and is particularly susceptible to external pressures to employ an
increasing number of people who may in fact be operationally redundant.
During negotiations, Government and KPTC agreed to take measures during the
period of project implementation to limit the growth of operational staff
to decrease the total staff/DEL ratio to 62 per thousand by project
completion.
4.04      KPTC's training facilities comprise (a) the Central Training
School (CTS) for intermediate and advanced training in telecommunications
techniques and postal operations, accounting, and administration; and (b)
the Regional Training School (RTS) for vocational training of technicians.
Specialized training has been introduced at CTS and KPTC is upgrading these
facilities to cater to the requirements of the expanding network and
introduction of digital technology. Although training capacity is
sufficient, a comprehensive manpower development plan and consistent
training program has not yet been adequately formulated. Consultants
services will be provided under the proposed project to prepare these.
Terms of reference and a schedule for consultant output were discussed at
negotiations and proposed terms of reference are contained in Annex 12.



- 14 -
4.05      KPTC also proposes to accommodate on the CTS campus, a new
African Advanced Level Training Institute (AFRALTI), a second regional
training center for telecommunications engineers from English speaking
countries in eastern and southern Africa but no administrative or financial
agreements for cost sharing among the countries have yet been concluded.
It is estimated that KPTC itself would utilize about 60% of the center's
facilities.  Buildings for all three schools will be constructed in phases
beyond the current program (1984-1988). The proposed loan will finance
equipment and requisite technical assistance to be implemented within the
current program period.
Billing and Collection
4.06      KPTC bills its telephone and telex subscribers monthly through a
centralized billing system which is computerized for downstream
procedures. The system appears to be generally satisfactory and the period
required to issue bills after the closing date each month has been reduced
from three weeks in 1981 to two now.
4.07      Subscribers must settle bills within 10-15 days.  In case of non
payment within the stipulated period, the outstanding amount is included in
the following month's bill together with a reminder. Deliquency on the
second bill leads to disconnection and a reconnection fee (K Sh 200 for
telephones) is charged to resume service. The credible threat of
disconnection results in private telephone bills arrears of only 2.2 months
equivalent and just under 2 months equivalent for telex. Government
departments remain problem subscribers and the situation has deteriorated
partly reflecting the tight squeeze in departmental budgets (see para.
5.09).
Accounting and Finance
4.08      Although KPTC has made significant progress in its accounting and
financial management since 1979, and now produces acceptable annual
financial statements, the systems in place remain fragmented and are not an
effective tool for management decision-making and control. Although the
telecommunications and postal operations are separate and exchange rate
adjustments are recorded, commercial accounting (accrual system) is only
used at year-end and such accounts are only available six months after the
end of the fiscal year. Day to day recording of all revenues and
expenditures is done on a cash accounting basis. Expenditure accounting,
budgetary control and cash and inventory management systems also continue
to be weak.
4.09      There are no multi-year budget forecasts and KPTC budget requests
for recurrent and capital expenditures for the following year are due at
the beginning of September and, after revisions, management presents the
budget to its Board for approval in November and requisite notifications
are in December. Until recently, cost overruns were routinely approved and
category swapping was allowed. Only in the last year has the internal



- 15 -
audit unit had authority to block vouchers in the case of budgetary
overruns. There is no operating policy for cash management and liquid
assets are deposited in local banks on an ad hoc basis often at relatively
low yields. KPTC does not borrow in the domestic market and has no credit
lines with local banks. Inventory management is poor and is confined to
basic bookkeeping resulting in some shortages, some excess stocks and
continued storage of many obsolete items. The problems of stores valuation
have been further exacerbated with the acquisition of KENEXTEL whose books
were not accurately maintained.
4.10      An internal audit department was created in 1976 and strengthened
in 1978 through the creation of a special stores unit. The department
currently employs 46 staff including 17 auditors, organized in three units
at headquarters. Each regional division (except for the three Nairobi
divisions which share one unit) has an audit unit of about twelve staff.
At present, the internal audit department is mainly concerned with the
vetting of payment vouchers and unable to undertake a comprehensive
physical inventory or provide more sophisticated auditing services.
Consultant services will be provided under the project on terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, to investigate and introduce improvements
to the accounting system such as the introduction of commercial accounting
and improved budgeting and control measures. Terms of reference (Annex 12)
have been discussed and agreed upon at negotiations.
Management Systems
4.11      The managerial framework, financial structure, manpower
development facilities and information base established with the inception
of KPTC are fragmented. Investment and manpower planning and resulting
procurement strategies, inventory management, and project implementation
are weak. Performance is not closely monitored and formulation of
corrective actions, budgeting and cost control, procedures for maintenance
and customer service, and utilization of information processing
capabilities are inadequate. Inconsistencies in these areas can no longer
be absorbed since the scale and complexity of management needs have
outgrown KPTC's organizational capabilities which consequently require
upgrading (para. 4.02). Consultant services will be provided under the
project and the draft terms of reference are given in Annex 12 which were
discussed and agreed upon during negotiations. The consultants should be
appointed no later than March 31, 1986.  It is also proposed that an
interim report will be produced six months after appointment and a final
report, containing recommendations and a plan of action will be submitted
to the Bank for review one year after appointment. The proposed schedule
was discussed and agreed upon during negotiations. The invitation of bids
for such consultancy services has been issued.
External Audit
4.12      The Controller and Auditor General of the Kenyan Government
produces the external audits of KPTC and maintains a staff of 13 on KPTC
premises to do so. The external audits for 1981 and 1982 point to the



- 16 -
weaknesses in the financial management, control and audit systems of KPTC
(para. 4.11). During negotiations, KPTC agreed to submit to the Bank its
draft financial statements within six months of the end of its fiscal year
and the corresponding external audit report three months thereafter.
Insurance
4.13      KPTC's insurance arrangements are satisfactory.  There is a fire
insurance policy for stocks, stores, operating plant and buildings (both
operational and residential) owned by the corporation; it also includes a
10% escalation formula to account for revaluation of the assets. In
addition KPTC has insured two years of revenue from consequential loss and
uses marine coverage for transshipment of goods.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Financial Performance
5.01      As its name implies, KPTC provides both postal and
telecommunications services in Kenya. As shown below in Table 5.1,
profitable telecommunications services have continued to finance the
steadily increasing deficits incurred by the postal operations since 1978.

services.
5.03      In the past, financial results have been satisfactory, yet these
are beginning to deteriorate.  The return on revalued assets has declined
from 15% in 1979 to 9% in 1983. It is clear that for 1984 KPTC will be
unable to comply with the minimum rate of return on revalued assets
covenant of 10% under the second project. This is due to cost increases
from both inflation and unwarranted staff expansion and delays in
connecting subscribers which have limited the revenue generation potential
of the plant (paras. 2.13 and 3.10).  Tariffs have not been adjusted since
1982, so not only is the return on capital employed insufficient but also
the operating surplus in 1984 is expected to be around K Sh 330 million,
somewhat lower than in 1983 of K Sh 350 million.
5.04      The sharp increases shown in revenue and operating costs in 1983
resulted from the merger of KENEXTEL into KPTC in 1982 and the accounts
were consolidated only in 1983. The highly profitable international
service operations increased revenues but operating costs also increased
since wages and staff related costs of KPTC employees were brought in line
with the higher KENEXTEL levels.
5.05      Revenues increased in 1982 due to a significant tariff increase
implemented on April 1, 1982. General revenue growth has been mainly due
to increased connected telephone and telex lines rather than increased
calling rates. After adjusting for the tariff change there appears to be a
steady decline since 1981 in the average traffic per line for both
telephones and telexes (Table 5.2). This presumably reflects the fact that



- 18 -
newly connected subscribers generally generate lower traffic per line than
the old established business ones and thus the average traffic per line has
a tendency to decrease when the number of connected subscribers expands.
This also reflects congestion of part of the system and, in the case of
international and telex traffic, it may be a consequence of a slowdown of
the export/import activities experienced in Kenya during this period.
5.06      Postal Operations.  The postal operations of KPTC have incurred
steadily increasing losses since 1978 (Table 5.3). The growth in postal
revenue averaged 17.1% per annum during the four year period 1979-83 while
operating expenses grew at 20.3% and the operating deficit ballooned from
K Sh 28.2 million (27.5% of revenue) in 1979 to K Sh 80.5 million (41.7% of
revenue) in 1983 in spite of tariff adjustment in 1982, and is expected to
top K Sh 110 million in 1984. A further tariff increase effective
January 1, 1985 is expected to allow the postal operations to generate
positive surpluses in the next few years.

Financial Position
5.07      The financial position of KPTC as of December 31, 1983 is
summarized in Table 5.4. (Historical Balance Sheets are contained in
Annex 16). The figures in Table 5.4 are based on provisional data pending
the final division of assets and liabilities of the former East African
Community finalized in 1984. As a result, KPTC is liable to the government
of Kenya for K Sh 213.8 million, with the principal to be paid in sixteen
equal bi-annual installments plus interest at 7.3% per annum on the



- 19 -
outstanding amount. This has been incorporated into the financial
projections below.

Total liabilities                                 4,803
5.08      As of the end of 1983, the current assets ratio was about 1.6
which is good. The long-term liability (including the pension fund) of
KPTC increased from K Sh 1.46 billion in 1982, to K Sh 1.94 billion mainly
as a result of borrowings to finance its telecommunications development
program which has changed its long term debt to equity ratio to 52:48.
Accounts Receivable
5.09      As of July 31, 1984, outstanding amounts due from private
telephone subscribers was K Sh 167.3 million or about 65 days of revenues,
decreased from 72 days at the end of 1982. Outstanding amounts from telex
subscribers have decreased over the same period from 85 days to 59 days of
billings. This improvement since end-1982 as regards telex and private
telephone accounts is due to improved billing and collection procedures
instituted by KPTC (para. 4.06).
5.10      Amounts outstanding from government departments however, were
K Sh 132.4 million on July 31, 1984, equivalent to 320 days of billings.
The situation has steadily worsened since the corresponding levels at the
end of 1982 and 1983 were K Sh 87.7 million (200 days equivalent) and
K Sh 111.3 million (275 days equivalent) respectively. KPTC continues to
press for payment and was recently able to persuade the Chief Secretary to
the Government to instruct the various departments to settle their
accounts. However, compliance is uncertain given the the precarious budget
situation of many of these agencies. As an offsetting measure, KPTC has
been withholding the transfer of telecommunications tax revenues which it
collects on behalf of the Government. The situation is unsatisfactory and
assurances have been given during negotiations for its resolution through



- 20 -
timed repayment of existing arrears and future account billings. Arrears
would be reduced as per Annex 10 from 320 days to 120 days by the end of
1986 and to 90 days by the end of 1987.  Progress in this regard will be
monitored through the performance indicators.
Valuation of Assets
5.11      KPTC has not revalued its assets to incorporate the effects of
inflation and effective currency devaluation pending final agreement on the
division of East African Posts and Telecommunications Community (EAPTC)
assets and liabilities, which was reached in 1984. Assurance were obtained
during negotiations that, in accordance with methods acceptable to the
Bank, KPTC will review the value of its fixed assets annually and calculate
the rate of return on that basis. A provision has been made under the
project for financing a detailed analysis of the value of fixed assets as
of December 1984 6/.
Projected Financial Performance
5.12      Annexes 17 and 18 show the projected financial statements of KPTC
for the period 1984-88 and are summarized below (Table 5.5). These are
based on a tariff adjustment leading to a 30% increase in telecommuni-
cations revenues being effected on July 1, 1985. An increase of this
magnitude has been approved by the Board of Directors of KPTC and its
implementation will be a condition of loan effectiveness. With these
adjustments, the projected

financial performance of the KPTC's telecommunications operation appears
satisfactory over the project implementation period. The return on
revalued net fixed assets is expected to average 12% during this period.
6/ The last study covered the assets in place up to December 1974.



- 21 -
To ensure continued financial viability KPTC would ensure that the return
on revalued assets does not fall below a minimum of 10%.
5.13      The postal tariff increase implemented on January 1, 1985 is
designed to make the postal operations generate an operating surplus each
year through 1987 and just break even in 1988. Thus the provision of
postal services is not expected to be a financial burden on KPTC's
telecommunications operations during the project implementation period.
5.14      KPTC will monitor its financial performance through selected
indicators including those pertaining to financial management and operating
efficiency (Annex 10). As covenanted in the legal documents the Bank will
participate in an annual review.
Financing Forecast
5.15      Annex 19 details the sources and applications of funds forecast
for the program implementation period 1984-88, again assuming a tariff
increase effective April 1, 1985. A summary is presented in Table 5.6.

5.16      KPTC's net internal cash generation would finance approximately
50% of the total program cost over the implementation period. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that KPTC's net cash flow each year
cover the estimated local costs of the following year's investment
program. The total debt service coverage is expected to remain about two
times.



- 22 -
Resource Mobilization
5.17      Government policy is to make provision of both postal and
telecommunications services self supporting. KPTC has recently implemented
a postal tariff increase (effective January 1, 1985) which should generate
an operating surplus during the next few years. In addition, the proposed
project provides for consultant services to study potential improvements in
the operations and management of postal services and to investigate tariff
structure changes to meet social equity and financial objectives.
Implementation of the telecommunications tariff increase, which is
necessary to ensure the financial viability of KPTC's investment program
(para. 5.12), will be a condition of loan effectiveness. Assurances were
given from Government and KPTC at negotiations that if the
telecommunications sector is used for further resource mobilization,
tariffs will be satisfactory and that adequate resources remain to meet the
investment requirements of KPTC.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Benefits
6.01      The economic analysis presented below pertains to the overall
five year (1984-88) development plan of KPTC of which the proposed project
is an integral part.
6.02      Economic activity in Kenya requires increasing amounts of both
transport and telecommunications facilities. The latter facilitates the
exchange of information, encourages efficient use of transportation
capacity and improves the efficiency of the service sector. With economic
development, the willingness of the population to pay for such services
increases and telecommunications becomes a preferred substitute for
physical transportation, ensuring effective use of available resources and
expertise.
6.03      Recognizing those benefits of telecommunications, the Government
of Kenya has accorded priority to the development of the sector, especially
in recent years. The previous five year development program (1982-86) was
substantially larger than the achievements under previous plans and on
completion will lead to substantial improvements in the telecommunications
infrastructure. The current development program (1984-88) continues this
effort (para. 3.03).
6.04      The business community and government administration (para. 2.03)
will remain the predominant users of telecommunications facilities.



- 23 -
Previous studies7/ have identified significant gains in business
efficiency due to improved telecommunications services. This was
reconfirmed by the appraisal mission during interviews held with six
enterprises in and around Nairobi. Their managements were unanimous in
their view that telephone services is a prerequisite for business activity
and that the expansion of extra exchange lines resulted in a visible
expansion in operations. For example, a distributor of industrial spare
parts and machinery claimed .that due to the installation of additional
telephone lines, his business expanded 35% permitting the hiring of six new
employees and the addition of three light trucks to the company's fleet.
Telex service is also important particularly for those firms with
significant international business links.
6.05      KPTC is one of the few profitable parastatals in the country and
is also a fiscal agent collecting a tax, equal to 15% of its billings, for
the Government. During the period of the development program the total tax
revenue generated is expected to be K Sh 1,528 million (US$100 million) of
which about K Sh 300 million would be incremental. The surpluses
generated 8/ in excess of the sector's investment needs are available to
Government which is the sole shareholder of KPTC.
Tariff Policy
6.06      A summary of the current telecommunications tariffs in Kenya
which have been in effect since April 1, 1982 is presented in Annex 13.
Government policy stipulates that KPTC be financially self-sufficient
(para. 2.09) and meet the financial obligations of its investment
programs. However, there is no periodic review and adjustment of tariffs
to ensure this policy and the recent cost escalation due to inflation and
staff expansion has resulted in KPTC being unable to sustain its
development plans at the prevailing tariff levels.
6.07      In qualitative terms the basic structure of telecommunications
tariffs recognizes the essential economic principles of public utility
pricing, yet there is a need for some adjustments. Local calls in Kenya
are untimed while long distance calls are pulse-metered with a discounted
rate for nights and weekends. This is an adequate approximation to a
7/ See, for example, the Staff Appraisal Report for the Second
Telecommunications Project (Report No. 3739-KE).
8/ In the past the operating surplus of the telecommunications account of
KPTC has been used to subsidize the postal services. In as much as
postal operations would otherwise have been subvented from budgetary
resources, this implicit subsidy (with a cumulative value of K Sh 332
million (US$22.4 million) as of December 31, 1983) also represents a
fiscal gain to the Government. In the future, however, it is expected
that postal operations will be self-supporting.



- 24 -
peakload pricing strategy which is economically efficient. Long distance
telephone and telex charges increase with distance but decrease on a per
kilometer basis reflecting the decrease in costs. The three-minute
(minimum charge) manual telephone call rate is approximately equal to the
charge for a three-minute minimum STD call which of course may be shorter.
Installation charges increase with distance at an increasing rate, again
reflecting of cost patterns. Following a study's recommendation (December
1980) these were doubled in April 1982. Rental charges were also increased
in 1982, but are not high enough to discourage low volume users of
telephone lines. Billing statistics for July 1984 show that 18% of the
telephone subscribers have monthly bills below K Sh 100 and generate only
1.5% of the revenues. There is thus scope for some increase in rental
charges to implicitly ration scarce exchange connections to high volume
users9/, particularly if the expansion in pay phones continues to serve
the lower volume users.
6.08      Demand for payphones far outstrips supply especially in urban
areas as evidenced by long queues in Nairobi, and KPTC is experimenting
with timing local calls made from these phones. It is also introducing the
pulse-metering of local calls, which is now possible in a cost-effective
manner with the introduction of electronic switching in the major urban
centers, and hopes to relieve the congestion in local networks as well as
raise additional revenue.
6.09      Part of the funds provided for consultant studies under the
proposed project will be utilized for conducting a tariff structure study,
the results of which will be discussed with the Bank and implemented in
1986 (Annex 12).
Least Cost Solution
6.10     The agreed investment program (para 3.01) represents the
least-cost solution for providing the service levels planned within the
constraints imposed by the existing configuration and technology of the
telecommunications network. The timing and dimensioning of various
elements in the system is based on generally accepted engineering practice
for selection of techniques and equipment after study of the feasible
alternatives.
Return on Investment
6.11      Incremental revenues and costs are based on the additional
telephone and telex connections commissioned in 1986 and thereafter. Part
of the investment costs include those for expanding the subscriber base in
1985 and produces conservative estimates. Based on these assumptions, the
9/ An appropriate balance must, however, be struck since many phones may
receive many more calls than they originate and hence generate
additional revenues at other points.



- 25 -
internal (financial) rate of return (IRR) for KPTC of the incremental
financial flows, is 12%10./ This figure understates the financial IRR to
the Government which is the sole shareholder of KPTC because it does not
account for the tax revenue raised (15% of billings). Taking this into
account the IRR for the shareholder is 16%.
6.12      The valuation of the cost streams for calculating the economic
rate of return (ERR) is relatively straightforward, yet the valuation of
benefits is considerably more difficult because the revenue streams only
represent a minimum estimate of the willingness of subscribers to pay for
telecommunications services. The use of telecommunications services also
generates substantial economic externalities such as the development of
business efficiency (para. 6.02). Consequently, it is reasonable to assume
that the economic benefits are at least greater than the payments made by
the subscribers and will remain so in real terms in the future. Based on
this assumption the economic rate of return for the investment program is
about 26%. Annex 14 details the methodology used for computation of both
economic and financial rates of return.
Risks
6.13      There are limited risks involved in the project.  Risk due to
physical damage is negligible while the commercial or market risk is
minimal due to the continued high unsatisfied demand and adequate provision
for price contingencies. Unexpected implementation problems in
commissioning certain components may produce delays, temporarily reducing
full utilization of other productive assets. However, the large number of
independent activities should limit the impact of such delays. A more
fundamental risk, however, is inadequate improvement in the management
which would adversely affect both the implementation and subsequent
operation of the telecommunications system. The proposed monitoring and
review procedure to be covenanted will contain this risk.
6.14      A sensitivity analysis was carried out, the results of which are
summarized in Annex 14. The worst case scenarios whereby capital costs
increase by 10% and revenue declines by 5%, or when the commissioning of
new connections is slower by around 20%, without any decrease in capital or
operating expenditures, yield an IRR of 10% and a corresponding ERR of 22%.
Environmental and Health Aspects
6.15      The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or
health impacts. Improved telecommunications services clearly improve the
the delivery system for health services of both routine and emergency
care. More efficient use of the transportation system, due to increased
use of telecommunications services would reduce environmental pollution,
promote energy conservation and marginally reduce traffic casualties.
10/ This figure assumes a tariff increase effective mid 1985. Without
such an increase the IRR would be less than 9%.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the following
major items:
(a) Terms of reference for a consulting firm to provide
assistance in upgrading KPTC's management systems,
tariff review and revaluation of assets. The
consultants will be appointed no later than
March 31, 1986 and an interim report will be
produced six months after appointment and a final
report, containing recommendations and a plan of
action will be submitted to the Bank for review one
year after appointment (para. 4.11 and Annex 12);
and
(b) Measures will be taken during the implementation
period to limit the growth of staff to decrease the
total staff/DEL ratio to 62 per thousand (para.
4.03).
7.02      The following major covenants were agreed upon during nego-
tiation:
(a) Performance indicator targets have been be agreed
upon for 1986. For subsequent years every year
during the project implementation period, KPTC will
(i) prepare for Bank review an analysis of its
performance vis-a-vis agreed indicators and (ii)
reach agreement with the Bank on targets, monitoring
and necessary corrective actions for the subsequent
year (paras. 3.12);
(b) rate of return on net revalued fixed assets in
operation of at least 10% will be maintained (para.
5.12); and
(c) KPTC's retained earnings each year (after debt
service, transfer to government, etc.) will cover
the estimated local currency requirements of the
following year's investment program (para. 5.16).
7.03      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that (a) the tariff increase
will have been implemented (para. 5.12); (b) the financing of the switching
contract through price and terms bidding will have been secured (para.
3.06); and (c) that the EIB loan will be effective (para. 3.06).
7.04      Subject to agreement on the above, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$32.6 million for a term of 20 years
including 5 years grace.

KENYA
KENYA POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (KPTC)
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Consultants
I. INTRODUCTION AND AIMS
A. Background
1.        The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) is
responsible for the provision of all public telecommunication services
(domestic and international) in Kenya. The telecommunications network in
the country has grown substantially in recent years and is projected to
expand further in the future. KPTC needs to significantly upgrade its
organizational capabilities in order to deal with the resultant increase in
scale and complexity of its management needs.
B. Objectives
2.        The purpose of this assignment is to assist KPTC in the design
and implementation of requisite management systems necessary for fulfilling
its mandate of optimal development and operation of telecommunication
services in Kenya. In addition to the processes relating to the internal
operations of the corporation, this assignment also includes, as discrete
parts, the formulation of an appropriate tariff structure for
telecommunications and the valuation of the fixed assets of KPTC.
C. Definitions
3.        Management Systems (not to be confused with Management
Information Systems (MIS) which are only a part) refer to the mechanisms,
responsibilities, procedures and facilities pertaining to the allocation of
resources (financial, material, human and informational) and the direction
of their use in all of KPTC's activities. They cover, among others,
aspects such as investment and manpower planning based on network
development requirements, procurement matters including consolidation of
contracts, project implementation including avoidance of bottlenecks,
monitoring of performance indicators and formulation of corrective actions,
budgeting and cost control, procedures for maintenance as well as customer
service, and utilization of information processing capabilities.



- 52 -                          ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 6
4.        The structure of telecommunications tariffs pertains to charges
paid by customers for access and use of telecommunications services. An
appropriate structure is one which facilitates economically efficient
provision of such services with due regard to costs and investment
requirements as well as national socio-economic objectives.
5.        Valuation of fixed assets takes into account the effects of
domestic and international inflation as well as technological changes to
obtain an adequate measure of the replacement value of the plant in
operation.
D. Approach
6.        This assignment is to transfer management know-how and know-why,
a large part of which cannot be adequately codified in written reports.
Consequently, the consultant firm will work closely with relevant staff and
management of KPTC to assist them through a hands-on process with both
analytical techniques and implementation of the recommendations. The
resources budgeted for this assignment will make due allowances in this
regard.
II. SCOPE OF WORK
A. Management Systems
7.        KPTC has, since its inception, established a managerial
framework, financial structure, manpower development and information base
to meet its perceived needs. The systems in place, however, remain
fragmented in that management decision making does not have the benefit of
interactive and timely flow of adequate information.  In order to avoid
possible inconsistencies in planning or delays in decisions and to promote
integration of technical and financial aspects of network development and
operation as well as to facilitate anticipation of potential problems it is
necessary to have a coherent decision support system.
8.        The consultants will thoroughly analyze KPTC's performance in
recent years along both technical and financial dimensions of its
activities and identify the critical issues the corporation faces. Based
on their findings, the consultants will review with KPTC's management the
list of performance indicators attached and agree on those which demand
priority attention. The consultants will then assist in devising suitable
procedures and formats for various units within KPTC to generate the
requisite information on an ongoing basis for timely management review.
Concurrently, the consultants will also assess the need for both long term
and short term strategies to address the issues, with special regard to the
critical role of focussed management attention. Finally, the consultant
team will assist KPTC staff in actually formulating and implementing these
strategies in a monitorable manner, e.g. through the performance
indicators.

Page 3 of 6
9.        In addition to relatively straightforward output and input
measures such as number of connected subscribers, staffing ratio, per unit
costs, service quality, profitability and liquidity, the following areas
must be specifically investigated:
(a) Manpower Planning - review KPTC's manpower plans based on
an assessment of current and projected needs due to
network expansion and changes in technology. The
consultants will assist in detailing the requirements,
targets and recruitment or training strategies.
(b) Training - identification of specific training needs for
new staff, redeployment and skill upgrading within the
system. In addition to technical training, financial
management and audit needs will be covered. The
consultants will also review the availability of
requisite facilities in the Central Training School (CTS)
and other institutions within Kenya and liaise with the
training experts in proposing course design and
structure.
(c) Maintenance - review the maintenance procedures and
assist KPTC in devising suitable maintenance strategies
for the network. The consultants will identify specific
constraints and methods for their alleviation.
(d) Stores - review the system for management of stores,
including both bookkeeping and physical movements, and
propose streamlining measures.
(e) Customer Service - analysis of KPTC response to requests
for customer service to both new and existing
subscribers. Both technical and financial aspects should
be covered.
(f) computerization - assist KPTC in developing a program for
effective use of information processing capabilities for
inventory control, financial management and maintenance
of system data base, and other purposes.  In the area of
billing and collection, for example, aging analysis
should be routinely available.
(g) Implementation - review of causes of various bottlenecks
in the implementatior of KPTC's investment programs. The
consultants will assist KPTC in developing methods for
programming of works, procurement of equipment, ensuring
availability of requisite materials, and commissioning of
facilities to bring new assets quickly into
revenue earning status.



- 54 -                          ANNEX 12
Page 4 of 6
(h) Budgeting and Control - review of KPTC's budgeting and
cost control measures to ensure rational resource
allocation. The consultants will also assist KPTC
management in practicing effective cost control while
providing sufficient flexibility in operations, e.g. to
field operatives to enable timely completion of projects.
(i) Accounting - investigate ways of speeding up the
translation of accounts into commercial format so that
requisite financial accounts are available on an ongoing
basis and not only after annual closing of books.
10.       The guiding principles for the analysis and recommendations
should be rationalization (rather than centralization necessarily) of
planning (strategic and operational), monitoring and control functions;
avoidance of duplication; due regard to the cost of information, i.e. only
that which can be deciphered and gainfully used should be generated; and
healthy resistance to seduction by glamorous technologies.
B. Tariffs
11.       In qualitative terms the structure of telecommunication tariffs
in Kenya reflects cognizance of basic principles of public utility
pricing. There are indications, however, that the translation of the
principles into detailed specification may be inadequate. The consultants
shall therefore assist KPTC in refining the principles and developing the
procedures for formulation and implementation of appropriate structures and
levels of charges for telecommunications in Kenya and actually apply them
to make necessary changes in the present structure.
12.       The following aspects should be specifically addressed:
(a) Demand Assessment - assess the characteristics of demand
for each of the services offered, and the sensitivity of
demand to the prices which might be charged. The work
would require a review of existing records of service
applications, service quality etc, and results from
sample surveys, as well as supplementary information
which may need to be collected;
(b) U!gze - carry out a complete review of usage data
including inter alia the business (including Government)
and residential usage patterns, traffic and traffic
congestion analyses, call rate analyses and local, long
distance and international revenue balance. Particular
emphasis should be placed upon peak call use.



- 55 -                       ANNEX 12
Page 5 of 6
International traffic pattern should be analyzed.
Assessment of significant imbalances between incoming and
outgoing long distance calls should also be made;
(c) National Development and Social Considerations - a
discussion and analysis linking national economic
development plans with the role of tariffs. In
particular these should focus upon tariff policies as
they relate to long distance charges. The consultants
should assess the basis for charging various groups of
services/consumers e.g., PCOs and rural consumers;
(d) Costs - analysis of the incremental costs of providing
different types of service should be made for different
parts of the network. This should be disaggregated into
capital and recurrent costs;
(e) Financial Implications - a financial impact analysis
should be made linking tariff policy and the resource
mobilization capabilities and financial viability of the
telecommunications sector. International inpayments and
outpayments should also be specifically examined;
(f) Organization - the consultants should review the
organizational aspects of tariff reviews, including
establishment of a review committee and the role of the
various departments. The consultants will also review
timing and methodology for reviewing, obtaining and
implementing tariff increases.
C. Valuation of Fixed Assets
13.       KPTC has not revalued its assets to incorporate the effects of
inflation and effective devaluation of Kenyan currency in recent years.
Furthermore, there may be certain discrepancies in the book values of the
assets of the erstwhile KENEXTEL which was merged into KPTC in 1982. The
last detailed analysis of the value of fixed assets for telecommunications
covered the period up to December 31, 1974.
14.       The consultants will assist the Finance Department of KPTC in
establishing the replacement cost of gross fixed assets as of
December 31, 1984 as well as the value of net fixed assets, based on
generally accepted accounting procedures (which shall be documented) and
the relevant information on actual operating conditions obtained from the
engineering staff. In addition, a methodology for annual revaluation on an
ongoing basis will be established and applied to ascertain the revalued
assets as of December 31, 1985.

III.  STAFFING
15.       The consulting firm will ensure that the team fielded has an
adequate complement of technical, financial and economic expertise as well
as experience in management of telecommunications operations. The
counterpart personnel will comprise the relevant staff and managers in
various departments of KPTC with actual line or staff responsibility which
they will continue to hold for the duration of the exercise.
16.       The firm will report on an ongoing basis to the Deputy Managing
Director of KPTC. Interim reports will also be forwarded to the World
Bank.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.        The proposed project is an integral part of KPTC's 1984-1988
investment program which also included ongoing works from various projects
including the Bank financed Second Telecommunications Project as well as
others assisted by other external donor agencies. The close
interrelationship between the various components of the investment program
makes it difficult and arbitrary to separate the incremental benefits and
costs of the project from the rest of the program. Hence the rates of
return computed below are based on the overall investment program minus the
capital expenditures to be incurred in outer years for preinvestment
activities of future development programs.
2.        In order to express the incremental costs and benefits in K Sh at
1984 constant purchasing power, a deflator of 12% per annum for 1985 and
1986 and 10% per annum for 1987-1989 has been used. The incremental cost
and revenue streams are assumed to remain constant from 1990 onwards.
3.        The life of the investments is assumed to be until the year 2006
when it is estimated the equipment provided under the program would have
completed its useful life.
4.        Incremental revenues and costs are based on the additional
telephone and telex connections which are commissioned in 1986 and
thereafter. This is a conservative estimate since part of the investment
costs include those for expanding the subscriber base in 1985. The nominal
revenue estimates are based on the assumption that a 30% tariff increase
will be effected in mid-1985. As in the case of the other financial
projections the traffic level is assumed to remain constant at the 1984
levels in the base case. The incremental cost estimates account for the
growth in operations and maintenance expenditure in accordance with new
connections as well as the growth in staff related costs based on
increments in employment above the level of end-1984. The nominal values
of incremental costs also include the effect of inflation.

5.        A summary of the financial streams including capital expenditure
an delflated incremental costs and benefits for the base case are presented
below.
Financial Streams (K Sh Million)
Capital           Incremental (Nominal)
Year         Expenditure          Revenues        Costs
1984            841.0               0             0
1985            661.3               0             0
1986            739.1             209.2          53.7
1987            710.3             519.6         161.3
1988            478.1             880.8         303.3
1989                            1,260.0         481.6
1990                            1,646,1         692.9
1991-2006
6.        The internal rate of return of the above financial streams for
KPTC is 12%. This value understates the true financial return of the
investments because it does not account for the additional revenue
generated for the Government (which is the sole shareholder of KPTC)
through the 15% telecommunications tax. Taking this into account the rate
of return is 16%.
7.        The economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated by including the
telecommunications tax as well as by assuming that the economic benefits of
a telephone or telex connection are at least equal in real terms to the
average revenue generated per line in 1983, and remain so in the future.
This yields an estimate for the ERR of 26% which should be regarded as a
minimum estimate because (i) all available evidence points to a
willingness of subscribers to pay a greater amount; (ii) the economic value
of improved quality of service has been neglected; (iii) further expansion
in the number of connections after 1990 permitted by the spare capacity in
the network has not been imparted an economic value; and (iv) various
externalities such as increased benefits to existing subscribers due to
expansion of the network have not been accounted for.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Projections
General
1.        The financial projections are based on estimates of network
expansion, e.g., number of DEL's in operation, and of staff strength in
accordance with the implementation schedule of KPTC's investment program.
2.        On the revenue side, the projections also assume that an average
tariff increase of 30% would be in effect as of mid 1985. Due to the
supply constrained nature of the system this tariff increase is not
expected to affect the aggregate usage of telecommunications services.
3.        On the expenditure side, the annual rate of inflation in Kenya is
estimated to average 12% in 1985 and 1986 and 10% thereafter.
Income Statement
4.        Telephone revenues are composed of three parts each of which is
estimated separately.
(a) Rental plus call charges: As a result of two
offsetting factors, namely the normal growth
expected in traffic generated by existing
subscribers and lower average call rates of new
subscribers the traffic volume per DEL is expected
to remain constant during 1984-88.
(b) Connection charges are based on the net increase
each year in number of connected DEL's. Average
connection charge also remains constant except for
the step increase in 1985 due to tariff charge.
(c) International inpayments are expected to grow in
accordance with the DEL's.
5.        Telegraph traffic is expected to remain constant over the period.
6.        Staff related costs for the base year, 1983, are estimated as the
sum of the following: 44% of Administration, 60% of maintenance, 80% of
accommodation and 100% of Operational, Training and Pension expenditures.
Projections for the subsequent years follow the growth in staff employed
with the average cost per employee also increasing at the rate of domestic
inflation.

7.        Operations and Maintenance costs for the base year, 1983, are the
residual after subtracting staff costs, depreciation and international
payments from the total operating expenditure. Projections follow the
growth in DEL's and include the effect of inflation as well.
8.        Depreciation is computed as 4.6% of the average gross fixed
assets in operation.
9.        International payments grow at the same rate as international
revenues.
10.       Interest payments are computed from the existing loans and
expected borrowings.
11.       Net non operational revenue/expenditure is assumed to remain
constant at K Sh 10 million every year.
Balance Sheet
12.       It is assumed that capital works take an average of two years to
be implemented completely. Consequently, work in progress at year end
equals the sum of the capital investment in that year and half that in the
previous year.
13.       The additions to gross fixed assets come from transfers from
works in progress.
14.       Accounts receivable are projected to equal a quarter of the
annual revenues i.e., three months equivalent.
15.       Long term debt represents existing commitments and proposed
borrowings. Withdrawals are equal to the estimated foreign costs of the
investment program.
16.       Liability at year end for international services is equal to the
payments accrued during the year.
17.       Pension fund liability equals that incurred during the year.
18.       Other current liabilities are estimated at 20% of the foreign
costs of the investment program.
19.       Investments and deposits are projected to grow at 10% per annum.
20.       Inventory levels are projected at 10% of gross fixed assets.
