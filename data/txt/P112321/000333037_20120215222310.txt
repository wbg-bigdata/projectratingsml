 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR EDUCATION –
            EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                        P112321-TF093956

                                  Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for Central African Republic – Global Partnership for Education,
   Education Sector Development Project, Grant no. 093956, P112321, will be extended
   from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

2. Progress towards the development objective is rated as “satisfactory? and remains
   achievable. With some difficulties at the onset, which were due to weak capacity in
   project management coupled with a lack of knowledge of Bank administrative and
   procurement procedures, the project began implementation in earnest in late 2009.
   Since then, PAPSE execution has progressed steadily overall and has produced
   notable results, contributing to the improvement of access and the enhancement of the
   teaching and learning environment. In 2010/11, GER for the primary level reached
   87.2%, surpassing the target of 79.5%. New entrants in the first grade were 115,803
   students compared to a target of 110,142. As for the second grade, the target has
   essentially been met with 47,107 new entrants, compared to 47,612 as planned.
   Students/teacher ratio reached 81/1, surpassing the target of 89/1. With the
   distribution of textbooks completed in 2010, the textbook/student ratio has also
   improved significantly to allow one textbook of each subject (reading and
   mathematics) to be shared by two students. At the onset of the project, one textbook
   had to be shared among 7 students.

3. With the exception of delays in the civil works program, after two years of
   implementation, all project activities are being executed satisfactorily, providing the
   following main outputs:

       The construction of four pedagogical centers and the rehabilitation of five others;
       A training strategy for primary education has been developed within the
       framework of the National Training Strategy;
       The teachers training program for 2008-2010 and 2009-2011 (a two-year training
       program) have trained 1,500 contractual teachers (750 each year) and 367
       community teachers (2009-2011);
       A total of 1,338,818 Mathematics and French textbooks have been purchased and
       distributed to all schools;
       Salary payments have reached 85% of the beneficiary teachers in a more regular
       manner;
       Production of the annual statistics on a timely basis (in November of each year) –
       an accomplishment that is rare among the countries in Africa; and

                                             5
       Increasing capacity in project management through on-time international
       technical assistance.

4. As of December 1, 2011 disbursements reached US$23.3 million, representing 59%
   of the grant amount. The Financial management review undertaken in September
   2011 rated the project as moderately unsatisfactory and high risk. However concrete
   steps have been taken by the project to redress the key outstanding issues, namely: (i)
   all rejected outstanding IFRs have been submitted and cleared by the Bank; (ii) new
   withdrawal applications have been submitted by the project and were in the course for
   payments; (iii) audit contracts for the year ended 2011 are in the course of finalization
   and will review the adverse opinion issued in the prior year; (iv) the fiduciary agency
   had strengthened their team by bringing in more qualified staff and the accounting
   software was on the ground to undertake the reconciliations that the project had not
   been able to accomplish.

5. The proposed extension is necessary to provide the Ministry of Primary and
   Secondary Education and Literacy the additional time to complete the civil works
   program, particularly the portion of the program that has been delegated to AGETIP
   for management. In addition, it will allow the 2010-2012 teacher cohort to graduate
   in September 2012. MEPSA has put in place an action plan to complete the project
   fully; particularly it has discussed and agreed with AGETIP on an execution schedule
   based on the Bank’s findings during the July 2011 implementation support mission.

6. This will be the first extension of the project.
