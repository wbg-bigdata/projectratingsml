ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
POWER PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 The Government of St. Vincent and The Grenadines
Beneficiary:              St. Vincent Electricity Services Ltd. (VINLEC)
A,nount:                  SDR 4.7 million (US$5.0 million equivalent), composed
of SDR 0.7 million of regular IDA funds and SDR 4.0
million of IDA Special Funds.
Terms:                    Standard
Relending Terms:          The IDA credits would be relent to VINLEC on terms of
20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the
IBRD interest rate at the time of credit approval. The
subloan would be denominated in US dollars.
Project Description:    The proposed project, which comprises VINLEC's total
1985-89 investment program, would meet the estimated
energy generation requirements through 1994, reduce
substantially the imports of petroleum products,
improve the quality of electricity services, reduce the
level of the system's distribution losses and improve
VINLEC's management and staff skills. The project
includes the construction of three hydroelectric power
plants, rehabilitation of existing diesel engine
generating plants, extension of subtransmission and
distribution facilities, a loss reduction program, a
training program and engineering/consultant services.
Benefits and Risks:       The project will reduce the country's dependence on
imported fuels by about 34,500 batrels of fuel per
year, resulting in foreign exchange savings equivalent
to US$1,300,000 annually. It will supply a reliable
and efficient source of power for the country's
development.
If dry season construction targets are not met, a delay
of ten months may occur, which could increase project
costs. Price contingencies included in the project are
expected to minimize this risk.

CHAPTER 1
THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01.     Hydroelectric power is the most important indigenous energy
resource of St. Vincent. Two hydroelectric plants were conmissioned in the
earLy 1950's. At present almost 20% of the total installed power capacity
is hydroelectric which in turn meets about 36%   of the island s total
electric energy requirements, the balance is met by diesel engine
generating plant. Future development of St. Vincent hydropower potential
ap:-ears to be promising as shown by the conclusions of a study financed by
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), for which the Bank was the
executing agency (see para.4.01). This study has identified economically
viable hydroelectric potential which amounts to about 15 MW with an annual
e3nergy capability of about 80 GWh, enough to meet the bulk of St. Vincent's
power requirements for about 15 years (during 1983 peak demand amounted to
5.5 MW and energy generation to about 29 GWh). The Government of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines has given priority to the developrent of this
indigeneous resource as it will greatly substitute for the diesel engine
plant generation. After the proposed Cumberland hydroelectric scheme is
commissioned, about 85% of the system total generation is expected to be
hydro.
1.02      St. Vincent's main non-commercial energy sources are charcoal and
wood which are mostly used for domestic purposes in the rural areas. The
lack of consumption statistics precludes an assessment of their
utilization. However, recent surveys carried out by the Energy Desk of the
Ministry of Finance (para. 1.07) suggest that charcoal and wood production
during 1981 and 1982 amounted to about 3,000 TOE/year.
1.03      Seismic surveys offshore the west coast of Barbados indicate that
St. Vincent may be endowed with some oil/gas deposits. In order to promote
oil exploration activities, the Government of St. Vi;acent has obtained a
technical assistarce grant for off-shore seismic -Lnvcstigation from
Petro-Canada International Assistance Corporation. Investigations are
expected to start soon.
1.04      St. Vincent forms part of the Eastern Carribean chain of volcanic
islands which have favorable prospects for geothermal development. In
particular, the area in which the Soufriere volcano is located (which
erupted in 1981) may prove to be endowed with geothermal reservoirs. A
Kank energy assessment mission (which included a geothermal expert)
recently visited St. Vincent and concluded that expenditures for carrying
out detailed geophysical, petrographic and geological studies are not
warranted at this time.  However, it would be useful tl'at the Government
starts reconnaisance surveys in order to prepare base data for future
studies.
1.05      The possible use of non-conventional sources of energy is being
investigated by the Government of St. Vincent and The Grenadines in
collaboration with other international organizations. A livestock
development project, financed through the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB),



-2-
is investigating the possibilities of producing gas from animal manure and
vegetable matter. Furthermore, biomass (bagasse and agricultural/foresting
wastes), crop-drying and biogas utilization is to be explored under the
ongoing Caribbean Development bank (CDB)/Caribbean Community (CARICOM)
Secretariat Kegional Energy Action Plan (REAP). The current limited
availability of bagasse and other agricultural wastes precludes the
development of biomass based power generation (co-generation).
CDS through its Technology and Energy Unit are also investigating
possibilities of developing wind-power and solar-heating alternatives.
Petroleum Imports and Petroleum Pricing
1.06      Imported petroleum products currently meet about 70% of St.
Vincent total energy requirements. They are imported by Shell (U.K.) and
Texaco (I)SA) from Trinidad and Tobago (90%), Curacao (6%) and Aruba (4%).
The following table summarizes the estimated consumption and import
expenditures during 1982:
Product                          Barrels         TOEI/        US$ (000)2/
Gasoline                            40,180          4,980           1,755
Diesel                              59,350          8,190           2,443

1/ TOE - net calorie content equivalent to 107 kilocalories.
2/ Import expenditures includes cost of petroleum products, insurance and
freight (CIF)
The Government of St. Vincent and The Grenadines through its Ministry of
Agriculture and Trade regulates imports and prices of petroleum products.
The different petroleum products presently consumed in St. Vincent are not
subsidized by the Government and their retail prices reflect the import
expenditures plus costs of marketing, profits, taxation, etc. The
following table summarizes the price structure at mid 198Z:
US$/US Gallon
Total Taxes Wholesale
Product             CIF Price    and Duties       Price      Retail Price
Gasoline                    1.04           0.27          1.47           1.60
Diesel                      0.98           0.13          1.31           1.38
Kerosene                    1.06           0.11          1.31           1.35

Aviation Gas                2.17           N.A.          N.A.           N.A.
The Bank's Energy Assessment mission which visited St. Vincent and other
islands of the Caribbean (see para. 1.04) will recommend that a regional
study be carried out by independent consultants (expected to be funded
thrDugh the UNDP/IBRD Regional Oil Exploration Project) in order to address
the issues related to refinery production rationalization, transportation
logistics and pricing.

Energy, Sector Organization
1.07      An Energy Desk was recently established in the Central Planning
Unit (CPU), of the Ministry of Finance, in order to gather and process
information related to the sector and to coordinate energy policy and
program development in the Government. In view of the small size of the
country and the energy sector, a more elaborate energy coordination
mechanism is not now required and the above arrangement is considered
adequate. At negotiations, agreement was reached with the Borrower that it
will maintain the Energy Desk with its current functions and
responsibilities, and it will provide the necessary funds and resources
for its sucessful operation.
Power Sector Organization and Regulation
1.08      The main institutions concerned with the power sector in St.
Vincent are the St. Vincent Electricity Services (VINLEC), the Ministry of
Public Works and the Ministry of Agriculture and Trade. VINLEC has an
exclusive licence for a period of 60 years (granted through the Electricity
Supply Act of 1973) to operate all the generating and distribution
facilities in the country as well as to sell electricity in all of its
territory. The Ministry of Public Works has certain defined
responsibilities related to such matters as tariffs (para. 1.09); licensing
and sub-licensing power supply rights; and as arbitrator on compensation to
property owners when their lands are affected by the construction of power
works. The Ministry of Agriculture and Trade regulates fuel prices. Given
the extent of VINLEC operations and the size of the sector, the above
arrangements are adequate. VINLEC is jointly owned by the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) of U.K. (it holds about 51% of the shares)
ard the Government of St. Vincent (49%).
1.09      The power sector does not have an independent regulatory body for
overseeing the utility operations, policies and tariffs. Under the
Electricity Supply Act of 1973 either VINLEC or the Minister of Public
Works (responsible for electricity services) may serve on the other a
written notice requesting changes in tariff rates. The Act provides that
the matter be referred to arbitration (the High Court judge) in case
agreement is not reached within 60 days from the service of the notice.
Otherwise, the increase becomes effective on the first day of the calendar
month following the expiry of 150 days from the date the written notice
mentioned above was served. Adequacy of the above arrangements is to be
assessed under a tariff study being financed by CDB (para. 1.11).



-4-
Tariffs
1.10      As mentioned in the previous paragraph the Electricity Supply Act
provides that either VINLEC or the responsible Minister may serve on the
other proposals for tariff changes. In practice VINLEC has initiated
tariff increases which between 1972 and 1982 are estimated to have averaged
1.4% per annum in real terms resulting in tariffs on the high side
(0.17US$/kWh) compared to most countries in the West Indies, which in turn
are generally high by World standards. The revenues from increased tariffs
were mainly used to meet increasing fuel costs.
1.11      VINLEC's present tariff (Annex 1, Table 1.1) consists of a basic
charge (consisting of a minimum charge for domestic consumers, a floor area
related charge for commercial consumers and a demand charge for industrial
consumers), a flat rate per kWh sold by consumer category as well as a fuel
surcharge. The surcharge automatically recovers fuel cost increases since
October 1973. Under the terms of the 1981 CDB loan a tariff study is to be
carried out. The study, which is to be based ort long run marginal costs
(LRMC) will review VINLEC's tariff structure. Meantime, based on the
estimated rate of return on the investment for the program (para. 6.06),
VINLEC's average tariff levels are estimaLed to be close to LRMC. The CDB
financed study was to be completed not later than December 31, 1982, but it
has been delayed pending the completion of the loss reduction study
(paras. 3.11 and 4.02). A consultant has recently been appointed to carry
out the study which is expected to be completed by mid 1984. IDA would
review this study and discuss the implnmentation of its recommendations
with VINLEC, the Government and CDB. At negotiations, it was agreed that
such recommendations as are agreed upon between the Government, VINLEC, IDA
and CDB would be implemented in accordance with an agreed timetable.
1.12      Sector Constraints
The major sector constraints are insufficient skilled manpower
and, because of the small size of the company, the lack of available
in-house specialist expertise to deal u:th planning and technical problems
outaide VINLEC's day to day operations. The project addresses these issues
by providing finance for: (a) a project manager and supporting staff to
administer the project; (b) managerial services to give support to VINLEC's
regular staff; and (c) a comprehensive training program.

CHAPTER. II
THE BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
General
2.01      The Borrower would be the Government of St. Vincent who would
relend the SDR 4.7 1/ million (US$5 miilion) IDA credits to VINLEC, the
project implementation agency, on the terms stated in para. 5.07.
Organization, Management and Staff
2.02      VINLEC is a limited liability company which was incorporated in
St. Vincent in 1961 under the Companies Act. The company has an authorized
share capital of Ec$1.5 million divided into 300,000 ordinary shares of $5
each of which 82,484 shares are issued and fully paid. CDC has effective
control over VINLEC through its 51% majority shareholding and its
representation on the Board of Directors. The remaining shares are owned by
Government. Under VINLEC's Articles of Association the number of its
directors is to be not less than three or more than five.  Under an agreement
between Government, VINLEC and CDC, as long as the present ownership
structure exists, three directors are nominated by CDC and two by
Government. Government nominees to the Board of Directors are the Minister
of H-ome Affairs and a local private businessman.  The Chairman of the Board
of Directors is the CDC representative for the East Caribbean. The Directors
are responsible for the overall management of VINLEC, but delegate authority
for the conduct of VINLEC's ordinary business to a General Manager.  The
Directors, who meet three times a year, reserve for themselves final approval
of such matters as VINLEC's capital and operating budgets, salary levels,
senior appointments, borrowings and union contracts.
2.03      Under a 1973 Agreement CDC provides VINLEC with management services
and gives VINLEC such advice as it requires on the management and operation
of the company. In recent years the management services have consisted
principally of a review of VINLEC's management and operational plans and its
budgeted and actual performance as well as internal auditing services and
assistance with overseas procurement and recruitment. In addition to
internal audit visits, a CDC senior engineer visits St. Vincent at least once
a year to inspect and advise VINLEC on its operations. VINLEC's senior
personnel also visit CDC's regional office from time to time. With the
strengthening of its management (para. 2;.05) VINLEC's dependence on CDC
management services has been reduced.  However, as a small organization with
limited in-house expertize, VINLEC will continue to need outside management
services (para. 2.08).
2.04      CDC informed Government some time ago of its desire to sell its
shares in VINLEC and to terminate the management agreement with VINLEC.
Negotiations between Government and CDC for the acquisition of CDC's shares
by Government have made substantial progress and the acquisition is expected
to be completed in mid 1984. Government has indicated that, responsibi',ity
1/ The SDR 4.7 million is composed of SDR 0.7 million regular IDA funds and
SDR 4.0 million of IDA Special funds.



-6-
and authority for VINI.EC's operations will remain unchanged after :Lct akes
new appointments to VINLEC's Board.  CDC has indicated its willingness to
continue to provide management services until an alternative source for such
services is arranged.
2.05      VINLEC's srganization chart is shown in Annex 2.  The organization
providles for three office heacds: a Secretary-Accountant, a Generation
Engineer and a Transmission-Distribution Engineer all reporting to the
General Manager. Although the organization structure is basically sound,
VINLEC's operations have been affected in the past by the lack of available
in-house professionals and by insufficient skilled manpower (see para.
1.12). VINLELC's management has recently addressed these problems and
qualified professionals have been retained to fill some of these positions.
VINLEC's General manager, a local national, is a qualified and experienced
engineer. Its Secretary/Accountant and Generation Engineer, who are
expatriates, are qualified professionals with substantial practical
experience. Together with their staff, they are capable of running VINLEC's
day to day operations. Until project completion VINLEC will employ an
experienced and qualified engineer to act as project manager, (paras. 4.07
and 4.17). VINLEC's accounting staff is generally satisfactory, but the
project's training component will help them to improve their potential for
advancement. To ensure the continuity of the company's management capability
VINLEC agreed during negotiations that itwill only appoint to the position of
General Manager and of Secretary/Accountant persons having qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Association.
2.06      VINLE('s total piermanent staff as of June 1983 amounted to 160
employees of whom four are university graduates (three engineers and one
accountant). The ratios of customers/number of employees and of MWh
sold/number of employees are 78 and 138 respectively. These figures are
similar to those of neighboring countries (St. Lucia, Grenada, Dominica) and
they are considered somewhat high.  Improved performance indicators were
discussed and agreed during negotiations (Annex 4, Tables 4.6 and 5.1)
including employment and efficiency targets in order to upgrade VINLEC's
performance.
2.07      Currently VINLEC's training program is very limited due to
financial constraints. The 1981 CDB loan contains a small component for the
training of a powerhouse supervisor, diesel mechanics and electricians.  The
proposed project contains a training component intended to upgrade VINLEG's
staff skills in the technical and administrative areas through scholarships,
in-house training and equipment (para. 4.05). At negotiations agreement was
reached with VINLEC that it will carry out the training component according
to a program satisfactory to the Association.
2.08      As noted in para. 2.03, VINLEC also requires outside services to
provide advise and assistance oti its annual and long-term planning as well as
technical advise relating to operations and maintenance and audit services
(para. 2.11). Consequently, it is necessary to continue the services
provided by CDC (paras. 2.03 and 2.04) after the management agreement has
been terminated. The agreement provides for 12 months notice by either
VINLEC or CDC to terminate the arrangement. To ensure the continuation of
adequate management services, agreement was reAched with VINLEC during



negotiations that VINLEC will emplor consultants whose qualifications,
experience and terms of reference are satisfactory to the Association. As
condition of Board presentation, a satisfactory management services contract
should be in effect. It is expected that the scope of the management
services required by VINLEC would decline as its in-house capability improved
as a result of the training program.
Income Taxes
2.09      Under the Electricity Supply Act, a special provision is made for
VINLEC to be subject to a 32% income tax rate on its profits, as compared to
the normal 40% tax rate for company taxation. Because of tax deductions for
capital spending in the form of initial and annual allowances, VINLEC is not
expected to incur any tax liability during project construction.
Management Information and Accounting System
2.10      VINLEC's management information and accounting systems are of a
good standard and effectively administered. They are based on CDC accounting
standards for the preparation of financial information and the recording and
classification of accounting transactions. These standards call for annual
budgets and the preparation of annual, quarterly and monthly financial
reports on performance as well as the preparation of five-year forecasts.
VINLEC's billing system is computerized and after some initial problems is
now working well. Recently, VINLEC's stores accounts were computerized and
general ledger and accounts payable records are to be computerized by mid
1984.
Auditing
2.11      VINLEC's external audits are carried out by the international
accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand, and the arrangement is satisfactory.
During negotiations it was agreed with VINLEC that it will employ auditors
satisfactory to the Association and will submit its audited accounts to the
Association not later than four months after the end of its fiscal year end.
VINLEC's operations are not large enough to justify the employment of a full
time internal auditor. However, in addition to external audits an internal
audit of VINLEC's accounts is carried out by CDC, involving about nine staff
weeks each year. The internal audit includes a review of the operation of
the accounting system as well as test checking of documents supporting
accounting transactions. The audit has been valuable in maintaining the
efficiency of VINLEC's accounting department, an. provision for such services
would be included in a new management services contract (para. 2.08).
Billings and Collections
2.12      In 1980 accounts receivable had risen to about 120 days.  The 1981
CDB Loan Agreement requires VINLEC to maintain its accounts receivable at a
level not exceeding 60 days. Since 1980 considerable progress has been made
by VINLEC in reducing its receivables which in August 1983 were reported to



- 8 -
be about equal to 60 days sales.  The improvements have been largely brought
about by prompt billings through the use of a computerized billing system and
improved collections on Government accounts, which account for about 10% of
outstanding receivables.  It is expected that VINLEC will be able to maintain
its improved collection performance and reduce the level of outstanding
accounts receivable further to about 50 days before the end of 1984.
Insurance
2.13      VINLEC insures against third party liability, fire, special perils
such as hurricane and workmens compensation liability and the adequacy of the
coverage is reviewed regularly. The project is not expected to contain any
unusual insurance risks.



CHAPTER III
The Power Market
Access to Electricity
3.01      During 1983 about 52,500 inhabitants, representing about 44% of
the total population of the island of St. Vincent, had access to
electricity services. It is estimated that availability of electricity in
the urban areas (mainly Kingstown, Chateaubelair, Barrouallie, Layou, and
Georgetown) averaged about 65% while in the rural areas it amounted to
about 30%. During the same year average electricity consumption per capita
amounted to about 250 kWh/year and installed power generating capacity to
about 85 watts per inhabitant. St. Vincent's per capita installed
capacity, energy consumption and access to electricity are among the lowest
in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)1/.
Historic Power Market
3.02      Total electricity sales in the island of St. Vincent increased
from 13.8 GWh in 1974 to 21.3 GWh in 1983 at an average annual rate of
about 5.0%. During the same period, maximum demand (non-coincidental) has
increased from 3.6MW in 1974 to 5.5MW in 1983 at an annual average rate of
about 4.8% (see Annex 3, Table 3.1). It should be noted that during the
period 1979-1983, electricity sales and maximum demand increased only at an
average annual rate of only 2.2% (from 19.5 GWh in 1979 to 21.3GWh in 1983)
and 2.9% (from 4.9MW in 1979 to 5.5MW in 1983) respectively. The
relatively slow growth of 2lectricity consumption during 1979-1983 was
mainly due to the frequent scheduled and emergency load shedding as a
result of: (i) the system's inadequate reserve capacity; and (i-5 the low
reliability level of the existing diesel generating units2/.  VMNLEC has
already made comnitments to install a new 2.9MW diesel generator (expected
to be commissioned late in 1984) which should partially solve these
problems (see para. 4.04).
3.03      The structure of electricity consumption has changed during the
period 1974-1983. The greatest decline in consumption share among the
major categories of consumers was experienced by the residential category
(from 41.9% of total generation in 1974 to 33.6% in 1983) followed by the
commercial category (from 32.9% in 1974 to 27.3% in 1983). The share of
the industrial category has increased from 6% of total generation in 1974
to 11.4% in 1983 mainly due to the promotion of light export oriented
industries in 1978 (a flour mill, a yacht factory and a banana box plant)
I/ Per capita installed capacity. energy consumption and electrification
rates of other Caribbean countries are respectively: Barbados: 383
watts, 1,329 kWh and 81%; Belize: 276 watts, 558 kWh and 33%; Dominica:
84 watts, 229 kWh and 55%; Jamaica: 313 watts, 960 kWh and 35%; and St.
Lucia: 120 watts, 504 kWh and 50%.
2/ It is estimated (based on the frequency, duration and magnitude of the
load shedding occurances) that yearly unserviced energy and capacity
demand (1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983) amounted to about 600MWh/year and
0.5MW/year respectively.



- 10 -
and in 1980 (a dairy product plant and an industrial glove factory). Annex
3, Table 3.1 illustrates in detail the evolution of electricity sales and
generation in St. Vincent during 1974-1983. A summary for 1974 and 1983 is
given below:

1/ This percentage represents the variation of the ratio losses/total
generation.
2/ Excludes captive plant.
Existing Power Facilities
3.04      St. Vincent's current electricity requirements are met by two
hydroelectric plants: South Rivers (870KW) and Richmond (1,100KW); and two
diesel engine generating stations: Kingstown (2,13OKW) and Cane Hall
(5,450KW). Currently the hydroelectric power plants' output covers about
20% of the system peak demand requirements and about 36% of the yearly
energy generation. The balance, 80% of the system peak demand and 64% of
the annual energy generation, is supplied by the diesel engine generating
plant. Details of VINLEC's power generating facilities, including nominal
and firm capacities as well as yearly energy generation capabilities, are
given in Annex 3, Table 3.2.
3.05      VINLEC delivers electricity to its customers through a system of
1lkV and 6kV sub-transmission lines totalling about 130 kilometters in
length covering the southern, western and eastern part of the Island (see
map attached); about 1OMVA capacity of step-down transformers installed at
several substations and about 650 kilometers of 400V and 230V distribution
lines.
3.06      Currently electricity supply in St. Vincent is less than
satisfactory. Daily load shedding and system outages are very common in
the island due to the low availability of the diesel engine generators. A
comprehensive program for upgrading the existing diesel engines and
improving the diesel plant operational and maintenance practices is
included in the proposed project (see para. 4.05). System losses have
reached unacceptable levels (26.3% of total generation during 1983) mainly
due to overloaded distribution equipment, lack of capacitor banks required
to improve the system power factor, uncaliberated metering equipment and
electricity theft (see para. 4.02). A loss reduction program is discussed
in para. 3.11.



- 11 -
Future Power Market
3.07      The UNDP financed the feasibility and the detailed design studies
to develop the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme for which the Bank was the
executing agency. One of the assignments of the Consultants (Shawinigan
Engineering - Canada) was to assess St. Vincent's future power market.
The most probable load growth scenario was developed by the Consultants
after comparing three alternative projection methodologies: (i)
extrapolation of historical electricity consumption trends; (ii)
econlometric correlation between total electricity consumption and forecast
socio-econonic indicators (income per capita, population, tariffs); and
(iii) detailed analyses of consumption by different customer categories.
IDA, the Government of St. Vincent and VINIEC reviewed these forecasts and
concurred with the Consultant's recommendation of adopting the forecast
based on the econometric correlation.l/
3.08      St. Vincent total electric energy requirements, including losses,
are expected to increase at an average annual rate of about 2.8% from
28.9GWh in 1983 to 37.1GWh in 1992.  Maximum demand (non-coincidental) is
expected to increase fron 5.5MW in 1983 to 7.1MV in 1992 at an average
annual rate of about 2.8%.  Total sales are expected to amount to 33.4GWh
in 1992; an average annual increase of about 5.1X from 1983 total sales
which amounted to 21.3GWh. Due to the proposed loss reduction program
(para. 3.11), the system's transmission and distribution losses are
expected to decrease at an average annual rate of about 11% from 26.3% of
total generation in 1983 to about 10% in 1992. The only substantial change
in the structure of electricity consumption is expected to occur in the
industrial sector whose share of 11.4% of total generation in 1983 will
increase to 23.1% in 1992. Energy and power demand forecasts are
illustrated in detail in Annex 3, Table 3.1. A summary of this table for
1983 and 1992 is given below:
Average Annual

average precipitation year conditions (Annex 3, Tables 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5) to
neet the future market requirements were prepared by Shawinigan
Engineering.  These simulation studies were used to: (i) determine sizing
and comnissioning dates of new power plant additions; (ii) evaluate
probable yearly generation and peak capacity requirements from each
individual power plant; (iii) estimate the probability and duration of
VINLECts system ability to meet the required loads; and (iv) derive margins
of power and generation reserves. The methodology utilized by the
Consultant to define the energy/power balances and the system's reliability
as well as the assumptions, hypotheses and results of these studies are
considered adequate.
3.10      The analyses described above have provided the following main
conclusions: (i) system performance up to the commissioning of the Cane
Hall No. 4 diesel unit (para. 4.04) by late 1984 will be unsatisfactory
due to the reduced availability of the existing diesel engine generators;
(ii) power supply after 1984 will be adequate except when the Cane Hall
No. 4 diesel unit is out of line due to forced outages; (iii) the
Cumberland scheme should be commmissioned during 1988/1989 to meet
increased system loads (earliest commissioning of Cumberland scheme would
reduce substantially existing and forecast diesel generation); (iv) the
quality of service that will be experienced atter the commissioning of
Cumberland is adequate and no additional generating plant before 1992 is
required; (v) new generation would be required after 1992 (diesel or
hydro); and (vi) comparison of LOLE results for the hydro and diesel
alternative plans (see para. 6.03) significantly improve the relative
economic betiefits of the Cumberland scheme.
TransmLission and Distribution Losses
3.11      VINLEC's transmission and distribution losses during 1983
amounted to about 7.6 GWh or about 26.3% of total generation. This loss
level is considered excessive for a utility whose sub-transmission and
distribution systems are relatively small. Obsolete subtransmission/
distribution facilities, overloaded equipment (transformers, conductors),
lack Jf capacitor banks (required to reduce losses and to ir.prove the
system's power facto.), deficient metering equipment and electricity theft
are the main causes of the high level of the system's losses. The
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) financed a detailed study which
recommended measures to reduce these losses (these measures mainly consist
in reinforcing the existing sub-transmission/distribution systems through
line reconductoring, installation of new distribution and capacitor banks,
upgrading and installation of metering equipment). The Government of St.
Vincent and VINLEC have agreed with IDA to include the loss reduction
program in the proposed project and to implement it simuLtaneously with the
construction of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme. Financing for the
loss reduction program will be provided by CDB (para.4.10). At the
completion of the works related to the loss reduction program, it is
expected that the current level of losses will be reduced to about 10% of
total energy generation. The targets and the contents of the loss
reduction program are based on the CDB study. At negotiations agreement
was reached with VINLEC that it will carry-out the proposed loss reduction
program according to a timetable stisfactory to the Association.

CHAPTER IV
THE EXPANSION PROGRAM
Background
4.01      The conclusions of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme studies
(para. 3.07) clearly indicate that: (i) the least cost alternative to meet
VINLEC's future system load is to develop simultaneously three hydro plants
at Cumberland river; and (ii) substitution for thermal generation would be
achieved through the operation of the above scheme (see chapter 6), thus
reducing considerable quantities of petroleum imports.
4.02      As mentioned in paragraphs 3.06 and 3.11, the adequacy of power
supply in St. Vincent is less than satisfactory.  These problems have been
addressed through measures recommended (which include the implementation of
different works) by an evaluation carried out by IDA (utilizing experts on
diesel engines) to upgrade the existing diesel engine generating plant and
by a CDB financed study to reduce VINLEC's system losses. The Government
of St. Vincent and VINLEC have requested IDA financing to carry out the
1985-1989 subtransmission/distribution expansion program.
4.03      Given the Limited access of VINLEC and the Government of St.
Vincent to the international financial markets and the reduced amounts of
financing available to them, it has been agreed between the Government of
St. Vincent, VINLEC, IDA and other international development institutions
(USAID, CIDA, CDB,. ElB - see para.4.10) to implement simultaneously the
works mentioned in the aLove paragraphs (which constitute the totality of
VINLEC's 1985-1989 investment program) as well as manageriaL assistance,
studies and training programs, utilizing the funds which have been secured
from these financial institutions.
The Project
4.04      As part of the 1981-1984 power expansion program, VINLEC is
installing a 2.9 KW medium speed-four stroke diesel engine (through CDB
financing) capable of burning only light or distillate fuel (utilization of
a diesel engine operating with heavy fuel-Bunker C - was precluded because
arrangements for delivery of such fuel do not exist at present). This unit
is scheduled to be commissioned by late 1984. Due to the ,large size of
this unit (2.9 MW), the availability of VINLEC's generating plant (total
available capacity of about 7.2 MW and peak demand of 5.5 Ml{) is likely to
be adversely affected by the new diesel unit forced outage rate (para.
3.10). VINLEC based the selection of this unit on financial considerations
(the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder whose contract included very
favorable financing terms) and on the relative short period for its
delivery and installation.
4.05      The proposed Power Project, which comprises the construction of
all the works included in VINLEC's 1985-89 power investmenc program, is
expected to: (i) meet the estimated energy generation requirements thrcugh
1994; (ii) reduce substantially the imports of petroleum products (about
34,500 barrels/year which is equivalent to 33% of St. Vincent current total
consumption); (iii) improve the quality of electricity services; (iv)
reduce the high level of system losses; (v) to improve VINLEC's management
and staff skills through a comprehensive training program and managerial
assistance fron consultants; and (vi) studies to develop future
hydroelectric schemes.

(ii) Installation of about eight river streamgauging facilities
and about twelve rainfall stations at different rivers in
order to establish a network which will be the basis to
develop additional hydroelectric sites;
(iii) Rehabilitation of the three existing diesel units at Cane
Hall diesel plant (about 3,500 KW) and the four existing
diesel units at Kingstown diesel plant (about 2,100 KW);
(b) Tranmission and Distribution
Installation and reconductoring of H.V. (11 kV, and 6 kV),
and L.V. (400V and 230V) sub-transmission and distribution
lines. Addition and replacement of capacitors (about 3,600
KVAR), distribution transformers (about 3,000 WVA), customers'
metering equipment (about 6,000 customers); service drops; street
lighting and purchase of utility vehicles. The above works are
required to cover: (i) VINLEC'S 1985-1989 transmission and
distribution expansion program; and (ii) loss reduction program.
(c) Training Program
Implementation of a training program addressed to upgrade
VINLEC's staff skills. The program will consist of scholarships
abroad for VINLEC technical and adminisrative staff; specific
in-house training programs for plant operators and linemen; and
training materials and equipment.
(d) Engineering and Consultant Services
(i) Consultant' services for providing managerial,
administrative, financial and technical assistance to VINLEC
for the duration of the project;



- 15 -
(ii) Consultants' services for engineering and supervision of the
construction of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme;
(iii)  Individuio   expert services for Cumberland project management
on behalf of VINLEC for the duration of the project;
(iv)  Individual expert services for engineering and
implementation of the loss reduction program;
(v)  Consultants' services for studies related to the developnent
of new hydroelectric schemes.
4.06      Detailed design and bidding documents for the Cumberland
hydroelectric project were prepared by Shawinigan Engineering (Canada).
Issuance of bidding documents for the purchase of equipment and materials
and for securing civil contractors is expected to take place by June 1984
and the construction to start by September 1985.  Bidding documents related
to the works included in the rehabilitation of the diesel engine generating
plant and VINLEC's sub-transmission and distribution programs are expected
to be completed before December 1984 and procurement activities to start
immediately after (see para. 4.16).
4.07      The Government of St. Vincent, VINLEC and IDA have agreed on the
terms of reference for the Consultant/Engineering services. The services
from the consulting firm for the engineering and supervision of the
construction of Cumberland and from the individual expert who will act as
Project Manager on behalf of VINLEC are expected to be secured by May
1984. The services of the individual expert for the loss reduction program
are expected to be secured by December 1984. The services from the
Consultants for the aspects related to VINLEC management are expected to be
secured by August 1984, and the consulting services to carry-out
feasibility studies for development of new hydroelectric schemes will be
secured during the implementation of the proposed project (these studies
are to be completed by 1987/1988). At negotiations, VINLEC submitted
satisfactory evidence to IDA that a consulting firm for the engineering and
supervision of Cumberland scheme and that a Project Manager, both
acceptable to IDA, have been selected. As condition of effectiveness of
the credits VINLEC should submit evidence to IDA that the above Consulting
firm and Project Manager have been contracted for the duration of the
project.
Project Cost Estimates
4.08      The total project cost, including physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at US$30.8 million, of wbich US$24.0 million is
the foreign exchange conponent. This estiimate does not include interest
during construction. A summary is given in the table below; detailed

The project cost estimates are based on the following: (i) for the
Cumberland Hydroelectric plants, estimates are based on the Shawinigan's
detailed design studies. Prices are at March 1984 levels. Although the
estimated unit cost is high (4,500 US$/KW), the proposed scheme is the
least cost alternative to meet St. Vincent power requirements (see
Chapter 6), and the total cost is considered reasonable because of the
nature of the works involved; (ii) for the rehabilitation of the diesel
engine power plant and for VINLEC's transmission and distribution programs,
estimates are based on unit prices of equipment and materials and their
quantities precisely specified in both programs. Prices are at October
1983 levels and the bulk of the equipment is to be purchased through
competitive bidding(transmission and distribution) or on special order
(diesel engine parts and equipment). The estimates are considered
adequate; and (ili) for the loss reduction program estimates were based on
the CDB study which was reviewed by IDA and they are considered adequate.
4.09      Physical contingencies were calculated as follows: (i) for the
Cumberland hydroelectric plant, contingencies are estimated at 12%, 10% and
7% of the direct costs of the civil works, equipment and engineering
respectively; and (ii) for the other components of the project, physical
contingencies are estimated at 10% of the direct costs.  The percentages
utilized to derive physical contingency estimates are considered adequate.

Price contingencies were derived using the following annual escalation
rates applied to direct costs and physical contingencies:
Percent (%)

Import taxes and other duties are not included in these estimates because
VINLEC is exempt from these levies.
Project Financing Scheme
4.10      The financing plan for the project will be as follows:
(a)   foreign exchange costs (including indirect foreign exchange
costs) which amount to US$24.0 milion would be financed by the
proposed credit, grant and loans;
(b)   local costs which amount to US$6.8 million would be financed by
VINLEC and by the proposed credit, grant and loans;

4.13       Contracts for the supply of equipment anid materials for VINLEC's
transmission and distribution expansion program (to be financed by IDA) as
well as for the loss reduction program (to be financed with funds from the
proposed CDB loan) will be procured through internationol competitive
bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with IDA and CDB guidelines,
respectively. Direct purchases from original manufacturers of the existing
diesel engines (to be financed by IDA) will be appropriate for contracts
related to the supply of the corresponding equipment, parts,
instrumentation and associated services from the manufacturer
(US$967,000). The training program (US$811,000), which includes such items
as scholarships abroad and training equipment and materials, will be
procured through limited international tendering (LIT) and direct
purchases. Consultants' services (engineering and supervision of the
contruction of Cumberland and hydroelectric power studies) and the
individual expert to be retained as Project Manager will, be secured
utilizing IDA guidelines (US$2,843,000).
4.14      Three separate contracts will be awarded for the Cumberland
hydroelectric plants: (i) civil works (US$8,327,000) to be financed by
USAID; (ii) turbines and generators (USS3,111,000) to be financed by EIB;
and (iii) pipeline, electrical and mechanical equipment, transmission and
communications (US$7,208,000) to be financed by CIDA. The streamgauging
and rainfall netwcrk (US$251,000) and the managerial services (US$562,000)
will be financed by USAID and CIDA respectively.  The above contracts will
be procured in accorQance with the corresponding donor's regulations.
These regulations are compatible with the adequate execution of the
proposed project. During the procurement and construction stages of the
project, IDA will verifyi/that: (i) the different contracts financed by the
above agencies comply with she specifications established in the bidding
documents which are co be reviewed by IDA (see paras. 4.01 and 4.06); (ii)
construction, supply and installation of the works/goods are carried out in
a timely fashion; and (iii) the corresponding prices are within reasonable
limits. No manufacturers exist in St. Vincent which produce the
specialized equipment and materials required for the project. A general
civil contract will be awarded to a foreign contractor for the civil works
related to the Cumberland scheme. The works included in the
transmission/distribution and loss reduction programs will be implemented
through VINLEC's force account and local contractors which will be hired
thorough procedures acceptable to IDA. Preference for bid evaluation
purposes for local manufacturers and contractors has not been requested by
the Government.
Disbursements
4.1.      The IDA and Special Fund credits are estimated to be disbursed
over a period of seven years (see Annex 4, Table 4.4). The disbursement
schedules reflect applicable IBRD/IDA standard disbursement profiles which
are based on the Bank's experience in similar projects.
1/ Agreement was reached with the other agencies. A Memorandum of
Understanding (to be signed by all co-financiers) has been prepared to:
(i) address and coordinate aspects related to the implementation and
financing of the proposed project; and (ii) define the co-financiers'
role during the implementation of the proposed program.



- 21 -
Proceeds from the proposed Special Fund credit would be applied to the
payment of the following expenditures:
(i) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods for the
rehabilitatioa of the diesel engine generating plant, VINLEC's
transmission and distribution expansion program, and training
program;
(ii) 100% of the expenditures for the expatriate services provided by
the manufacturers of the existing diesel engines;
(iii) 100% of the expenditures related to the: (a) consulting services
for the engineering and supervision of the construction of the
Cumberland scheme; (b) hydroelectric power studies; and (c)
training program (scholarships, training experts).
Proceeds from the proposed IDA credit would be applied to the payment of
100% of the expenditures related to the services of the Project Manager.
All requests for disbursements of funds from the credits would be fully
documented. Retroactive financing for up to US$200,000 is proposed for
payment of the Consultants and Project Manager (US$80,000) and of the
rehabilitation of the diesel engine plant (US$120,000) incurred and paid by
the Borrower after May 1, 1984. The proposed retroactive financing will
cover advanced expenditures directly related to (i) the services of
engineering and supervision for the Cumberland project; (ii) project
management; and (iii) purchase of parts and related services for the
rehabilitation of the diesel engine plant. The closing date for the
proposed credit would be June 30, 1991.

4.16      VINLEC will engage contractors for the civil works and for the
manufacturing, supply and installation of the electro-mechanical equipment
for the Cumberland power plants through procurement procedures indicated in
para. 4.14. It is expected that these contracts would be awarded to firms
from the donor'  countries with broad experience in similar works.
Invitations to bid are expected to be issued by June 1984 (Annex 4, Table
4.5). Given the limited extent of the other project components (rainfall
and streamgauging network, rehabilitation of diesel engines, transmission
and distribution and loss reduction programs), their implementation would
be carried out through VINLEC's force account and local contractors (para.
4.14). Annex 4, Table 4.5 provides the details of the implementation of
the contracts included in the Cumberland hydro scheme.

4.17       VINLEC wilL engage the services of an expert as Project Manager
for the implementantion of Clu,berland and it will retain the services of a
Consulting firm for the engineering and supervision of the construction of
the proposed hydroelectric scheme. VINLEC has selected the Project Manager
and Consulting firm and it will sign the corresponding contracts before the
date of effectiveness of the Credits.  With the above arrangements VINLEC
will be able to execute the project adequately.
4.18       Monitoring standards have been established to achieve efficient
implementation of the project as well as to help improve the performance of
VINLEC. Overall project execution will be monitored against target dates
shown in the implementation schedules (Annex 4, Table 4.5 and para. 4.16).
VINLEC's operational, financial and managerial performance will be
monitored through indicators which have been agreed at negotiations.
Agreed performance targets are included in Annex 4, Table 4.6. and Table
5. .
Environmental Aspects
4.19       Thc proposed Cumberland hydroelectric project presents few minor
environmental problems inherent in the construction of the three new power
stations.  Limited extensions of grazing land and agricultural land will be
affected due to the construction of the power houses and storage tanks.
The penstocks, with a total length of about 6 knm, will cut through some
grazing land and agricultural land.  VINLEC would compensate property
owners as required by law and would provide access through walkways/ramps
over the penstocks as required. The extraction of water for power
generation from the Cumberland river will affect the supply of water at
some points in the reach of river which are currently used for washing
clothes. VINLEC would extend an existing water supply pipeline to the
affected points in order to supply water to the users. The effects of this
arrangement on the Cumberland power output are negligible. Interference
with the agricultural activities during the period of the construction will
be mitigated through adequate construction techniques (use of small
construction equipment and labor-intensive techniques). The 33kV
transmission line from Cumberlnnd to  (iakgstown (about 20km) associated with
the Cumberland scheme will he built parallelling the existing lkV line
from Richmond to Kingstown (see attached map). The 33kV line right-of-way
clearing would be minimum. VINLEC transmission and distribution programs
(expansion and construction) will be implenented in urban centers with due
regard to environmental and aesthetic considerations. Except for the
Cumberland scheme, natural drainage patterns would not be affected.



- 23 -
4.20      It is expected that arrangements for land expropriation and
right-of-ways required to implement the project would be largely completed
before starting the construction of Cumberland. At negotiations assurances
were obtained from the Government and VINLEC that these arrangements will
be finalized in due time in order to avoid project construction delays.
The submission of satisfactory evidence of completion of the above
arrangements is a condition of IDA and Special Fund credits'
effectiveness. The legal documents include the following clauses reflecting
the obligation of VINLEC to: (i) provide access through walkways/ramps over
the penstocks as required; (ii) extend water supply pipelines from the
existing one in order to supply water to the affected points; and (iii)
reduce interference to agricultural activities during the construction of
Cumberland (see para. 4.19).
Project Risks
4.21      The Cumberland hydroplants are subject to the risks normally
associated with the construction of civil works in areas where dry and wet
seasons are well marked as the storage (balancing) tank and the dams
associated with the power plants are to be built during the dry seasons of
1986 and 1987. If these targets are not met, a delay of up to 10 months
may occur. Given the small size of the civil works and its simplicity of
design, the Cumberland scheme is free of major geological problems. The
other project components (transmission and distribution, rehabilitation of
diesel plant, streamgauging and rainfall network) face no special physical
risk. Provision has been made to engage a Project Manager and Engineering
Consultants (para. 4.17) as well as Managerial Consultants (para. 2.08) to
assist VINLEC during the implementation of the proposed project and to
improve VINIEC's managerial capacity.  In view of the nature of the
proposed works, the project cost estimates are adequate and no major
costoverrun is expected (para. 4.08). However, insufficient action on
matters related to VINLEC's finances could result in project delays or
negative Institutional performance (paras. 5.11 through 5.15).
Cumberland Inspection
4.22      The successful operation of the Cumberland scheme would be
closely linked to the adequate maintenance of its civil works and
electro-mechanical equipment. At negotiations with the Government and
VINLEC agreement was reached that the above installations will be monitored
and inspected after completion at least once every two years by experts
acceptable to IDA and that a copy of the inspection report is submitted to
IDA.

4.23      Annex 7 includes the list of the documents utilized to process
the project and to prepare this report.

CHAPTEY V
FINANCE
Introduction
5.01      Between 1978 and 1982 VINLEC's financial operations have been
characterized by high electricity production costs (with fuel costs aLone
accounting for 43% to 50% of revenues), high tariff levels (17 US cents/kWh in
1982) and insufficient cash to adequately meet plant maintenance and capital
spending needs. VINLEC's total capital spending of about US$0.8 million between
1978 and 1982, mainly transmission and distribution extensions, was financed by
internal cash generation but this left insufficient cash for VINLEC either to meet
its amortization payments underthe CDC loan, (para. 5.03) which were subsequently
rescheduled under a 1983 agreement 1/, or to maintain an adequate Liquid
position. Dividends have been paid infrequently on VINLEC's shares and have been
small in amount. No accumulated cash is available to meet VINLEC's capital
spending which on project completion is expected to about triple VINLEC's fixed
assets in real terms. VINLEC did not incur any long-term debt between 1974, when
debentures were issued to CDC, and 1981. A 1981 approved CDB loan of US$3 million
equivalent to Government is being onlent to VINLEC and is to be mainly used for a
2.9 MW generating unit. Loan disbursements started in 1983. The proposed
project, by substituting hydro-electricity for diesel generation, will help VINLEC
to improve its earnings. By 1990 VINLEC's significant costs will be depreciation
and interest, which are estimated to account for 40% of revenues, compared to 18%
in 1983. In 1990 fuel costs are estimated to equal 13% of revenues compared to
39% in 1983.
Past Financial Performance
5.02      From 1978 to 1982 VINLEC made rates of return on historically valued net
fixed assets varying from 1.6% in 1979 to 19.2% in 1982, when the effect of large
tariff increases became effective. Operating expenses varied fron 90% of revenues
in 1978 to 99% in 1980. In 1979 and 1980 operating income was insufficient to
meet interest charges but after substantial tariff increases VINLEC's financial
performance improved in 1981 and 1982. Between 1979 and 1982 revenues and
expenses grew by an average annual rate of about 26% and 22% respectively with kWh
sales growing by an average annual rate of about 3%. Average revenues per
kilowatt hour sold increased by an average annual rate of about 23X between 1979
and 1982. This was about 10% above the estimated annual inflation rate during the
same period.
1/ This agreement has to be approved by the Parliament of St. Vincent. Approval
is expected by mid 1984.

Assets and Revaluation
5.04      VINLEC's fixed assets were revalued in 1980 by CDB by adjusting a
consultants property appraisal report to reflect, inter alia, more realistic
asset lives. Under the 1981 CDB agreement, VINLEC is required to revalue its
assets annually applying suitable revaluation Indices. The index to be used
for this purpose is expected to be agreed between CDB and VINLEC shortly.
It is expected that the agreed methodology would be acceptable to the
Association.  However, during negotiations agreement was reached with VINLEC
that it will annually revalue its fixed assets in accordance with methods
acceptable to the Association. It was also agreed during negotiations that
the results of the revaluation would be included in separate statements
together with the audited accounts. This information would be used to
measure the annual rate of return performance (para. 5.10).

5.06      CDB, CIDA, and USAID appraised the project at the same time as the

1984; CIDA April 1984; USAID May 1984.  EIB approved their loan in November
1983.
5.07      CIDA finance would be provided by Government to VINLEC as equity.
During negotiations agreement was reached with Government that it will relend
the proceeds of the credit to VINLEC under a subsidiary loan agreement
providing for a term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period, at the
IBRD interest rate at the time of Board approval of the Credits. In the
financial projections this has been assumed to be 10%. It was also agreed
that the loan would be denominated in US dollars.  The execution of the
subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of credit effectiveness.



- 27 -
5.08      CDB, EIB and USAID finance is expected to be provided by Government
to VINLEC on the following terms:
Interest      Grace        Amortization

-     Years----
CDB                10              5             15
EIB                 4              5             15
USAID               2 I/          10             30
The terms of the EIB loan provide that, under the onlending agreement between
Government and VINLEC, the loan shall be treated as a subordinated loan
convertible into share capital. Also, if VINLEC is unable to service all or
part of the debt service during the first 15 years of the loan, the
corresponding amount of debt service due by Government to EIB may be
postponed. As a condition of effectiveness of the credits, the parties
providing for the CIDA contribution, the USAID, CDB and EIB loans should have
notified the Association that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness
or of the first disbursement of their finance have been fulfilled subject
only to the effectiveness of the credits.
Tariffs
5.09      VINLEC's tariffs increased by an average of about 1.4% per annum in
real terms between 1972 and 1982, largely to meet increased fuel costs. On
January 1, 1983 average tariff rates were increased by about 8%. A further
increase was made on February 1, 1984 which is estimated to increase average
revenue per kWh sold by about 11%. The tariff increase is principally
required to finance VINLEC's 1984 transmission and distribution extension
program. As noted in paragraph 1.09, VINLEC is required to give 150 days
notice of tariff increases. At negotiations Government agreed that, within
90 days of the submission of rate increase applications, it will take all
necessary actions on its part to enable VINLEC to meet the agreed rate of
return requirements (para. 5.10). Government also agreed that it will
approve the rate increase required to meet the 1985 rate of return
requirements by October 31, 1984. It is estimated that this will require a
9% tariff increase. At negotiations agreement was also reached with VINLEC
that before July 31 in each of its fiscal years it will review whether, on
the basis of forecasts satisfactory to the Association, it would neet the
rate of return requirements. It was also agreed that, if the forecast
indicated that VINLEC would not meet these requirements it will not later
than August 31 of each fiscal year submit an application for rate increases.
5.10      The 1981 CDB loan, requires VINLEC to earn a rate of return on
average net revalued assets of at least 3% in 1983 and 1984, 4% in 1985 and
6% in 1986 and thereafter. To help finance its immediate and future capital
needs and progress towards earning a reasonable rate of return on capital
employed, it was agreed with VINLEC during negotiations that it will
malntain its tariffs at a level which will yield rates of return on average
net revalued fixed assets in operation as follows: 1985, 4%; 1986 and 1987
1/ This is to be increased to 3% during the amortization period.



- 28 -
6%; 1988 and 1989, 7%; 1990 and thereafter - 8%. To achieve the foregoing
requirements it is estimated that the following nominal tariff increases
would be required.  It is expected that tariff increases over the period 1985
- 1992 would be slightly less than inflation. From 1990 onwards income taxes
would add to VINLEC's expenses to be recovered from its tariffs.

Future Financial Performance
5.11      Projected income, baLance sheet and cash flow statements for 1984
to 1992, together with notes and assumptions, are shown in A.nnex 5,
tables 5.2 through 5.6.
5.12      The financial projections are based on the assumption that VINLEC
would increase its tariffs not later than January 1 each year, to meet the
financial objectives referred to in the paragraph 5.10.  With the expected
reduction in fuel and maintenance costs in 1989 and 1990 when the project is
placed in service, VINLEC's earnings will increase considerably.
5.13      The proportions of equity and debt capital provided as project
finance would enable VINLEC to waintain a satisfactory capital structure
throughout 1984 to 1992 with a debt/equity ratio varying from 39/61 in 1992
to 56/44 in 1987. Debt service coverage would be good throughout, never
dropping below about 2. To protect VINLEC's financial viability it was
agreed with VINLEC during negotiations that it will not undertake any
investments in excess of US$400,000 (other than to finance the project) until
project completion unless it has furnished to the Association satisfactory
evidence that such investments are technically, financially  nd economically
justified and that VINLEC will have adequate financial resources to carry out
the investments. It was also be agreed that, VINLEC will not incur long-term
debt, writhout the Association's consent, unless net income before interest
and depreciation is at least 1.5 times future debt service, including
proposed new borrowings.
5.14      Despite the foregoing favorable expectations regarding VINLEC's
future financial performance, VINLEC's cash position is projected to be tight
during project implementation. Therefore, VINLEC has arranged to extend its
bank overdraft facilities to EC$3 million. It is estimated that this would
be sufficient to meet VINLEC's cash needs.
5.15      To help avoid the distribution of funds needed to help finance the
project, Government agreed during negotiations that it would reinvest in
VINLEC any dividends paid to it until project completion.

CHAPTER VI
ECONOMIC A?NALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
6.01      As part of the studies financed by UNDP (paras. 3.07 and 4.01)
Shawinigan prepared VINLEC's 1985-1992 generation expansion program.  The
objective was to select the least cost power generating alternative which
will meet the system's capacity and energy requirements through 1994. The
economic analysis was made on the basis of the discounted cash flow method.
The Cumberland scheme was selected as a result of the comparisons carried
out with other power generating alternatives (both hydro and thermal).
Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed in order to evaluate the
eNIAts of possible variations of capital costs, fuel prices, power plant
comm:ssioning dates and electricity sales. 'The above analyses were
reviewed by IDA and found adequate. Detailed discussion of the least cost
solution is included in the following paragraphs.
6.0R      In order to determine the least cost hydroelectric alternative,
fiv l1ydropower generating schemes (Cumberland, Colonaire/Union, Buccament,
Yambou and Colonaire) were selected based on the adequacy of their
characteristics (unit generation costs, power plant sizing with the
objective of effectively reducing utilization of petroleum products for
power generation and power plant comnissioning dates).  Four alternative
hydroelectric developments (which consist of different combinations of the
above schemes) were compared utilizing the discounted cash flow method.
The development of the Cumberland scheme1] provides the least cost
alternative to meet the 1987-1994 power requirements. Details of the
analyses, which are summarized below, are included in Annex 6, table 6.1.

1/ The Cumberland optimum installed capacity (3,370 KW) was derived by
comparing five different turbine discharge capacities at each of the
power plants utilizing the discounted cash flow method. The costs and
benefits associated with each of the five alternative turbine discharges
were calculated based on the corresponding installed and firm capacities
(K(W) and average and firm energies (MWh). The selected optimum
installed capacity at the three power plants provides the scheme's
highest economic net benefit.

demand and 29,700 MWh of net generation during 1983) precludel/ the
consideration of future power plant additions other than hydroelectric and
diesel engine generating alternatives (the main factor which limits the
options of alternative plans is the maximum thermal plant unit size in view
of system's peak demand, amount of sytem capacity reserves and degree of
system reliability). Therefore, least cost analyses were carried out by
comparing the Cumberland hydro scheme (para. 6.02) to alternative programs
consisting of new diesel engine generating plants: one based on additions
of diesel engines burning distillate fuel (diesel No.2) and the other based
on diesel engines buring heavy fuel (Bunker C). For the latter, assumption
was made that in the future adequate heavy fuel (Bunker C) delivery
arrangements would exist in St. Vincent. The following parameters were
utilized in the analyses: (i) fuel costs landed in St. Vincent were
estimated at US$35 per US barrel for diesel No. 2 and US$28 per US barrel
for Bunker C and; (ii) heat rates of the diesel engines are equivalent to
10,000 BTU/kWh (engines burning diesel #2) and to 9200 BTU/kWh (engines
burning Bunker C). The analyses show that the full implementation of the
Cumberland scheme is the best economic alternative to meet VINLEC's power
requirements during the period 1987-1994. A summary of the results is
given in the following paragraphs:
(i) The Cumberland scheme is the least cost alternative when compared
to diesel plant burning distillate fuel (diesel #2) for discount
rates up to 14% which compares favorably to St. Vincent's
opportunity cost of capital, currently estimated at 10%;
(ii)  when compared to diesel plant burning Bunker C (residual fuel),
the Cumberland hydro scheme is the least cost alternative for
discount rates up to 12% (if no real escalation is assumed for
fuel prices)
(iii) a sensitivity analysis was made assuming that fuel prices would
increase about 2%/year in real terms between 1985 and 1990 and
about 4%/year oetween 1991 and 1995. Under these assumptions
the Cumberland scheme is the least cost solution for discount
rates up to 16% when compared to diesel plant burning distillate
fuel and up to 14% when compared to diesel plant burning Bunker
C;
(iv)  Comparison of present worth of system costs was made with the
Cumberland scheme delayed by one year to 1990/1991. The
implementation of Cumberland as scheduled, 1989/1990, is the
least cost alternative for discount rates up to 15%;
1/ Development of a geothermal steam based power plant was excluded
because of the leading time (see also para. 1.04) required for its
implementation (investigations, development of the geothermal field and
construction of the plant would require 8 to 10 years). Other
non-conventional sources were not considered suitable because the
irregular operating cycle of the scheme (wind operated generators) or
inadequate quantities of available agricultural/foresting wastes
(biomass based power plants). Coal fired power plants were excluded
because of the small size of the power generating units required for
VINLEC's system.

The results of the economic analyses also show that reasonable
variations on the capital costs (+/- 10%) do not affect the conclusions of
these studies.  The implementation of the selected hydroelectric scheme is
economically justified both in terms of meeting the system's future load
increases and of energy substitution.
The early commissioning of Cumberland would increase
substantially the benefits associated to the hydroelectric scheme due to
the reduction of the utilization of petrolum products (diesel and lube-oil)
for power generation. Details of the least cost solution analysis are
included in Annex 6, Table 6.2.
6.04      The subtransmission and distribution programs, which include the
1985-1989 expansion and loss reduction programs, have been designed on the
basis of the 1985-1992 load forecast and the measures required to reduce
the system losses. Since the objective of these programs is to supply
electricity services to some 400 new consumers each year and to upgrade the
system's efficiency and quality of service through improvement and
expansion of the existing system, the subtransmission and distribution
networks will be designed and constructed in accordance to VINLEC's
standards (provided by CDC based on British standards) which are
appropriate. Given the reduced extension of these networks and the
magnitude of the loads flowing through them, changes of existing voltage
levels and conductor sizing will be limited to those recommended by the CDB
loss reduction study (para. 3.11). These arrangements are adequate. The
energy to be saved through the implementation of the loss reduction program
is estimated at about 7,000 MWh/year (10,000 barrels of fuel/year). Its
economic rate of return is estimated at 22% and the benefit/cost ratio at a
discount rate of 10% is 1.9.
Return on Investment
6.05      The proposed project is the complete 1985-1989 VINLEC investment
program.  The rate of return on the corresponding investment was estimated
as the discount rate which equalizes the present values of the economic net
cost and benefit streams associated with the investment program. The
economic net cost streams include: capital investments of the generation
program (including the 2.9 MW diesel plant at Cane Hall, the 3.4 MW
Cumberland hydro scheme and the rainfall and streamgauging network);
sub-transmission/distribution programs (expansion and loss reduction);
general investments (buildings, furniture and such); costs of operation and
maintenance related to the above capital investments; and fuel costs
corresponding to the incremental sales of electricity. The economic net
benefit streams were evaluated by: (i) forecast revenues from incremental
sales of electricity (corresponding to the generation of the new 2.9MW
diesel engine power plant at Cane Hall) at the average retail level as of
December 1983 (about 0.18 US$/kWh) and alternatively, at the forecast
(1984) tariff levels (about 0.20US$/kWh - see para.5.10); and (ii) savings
due to the reduction of petroleum products consumption used for power
generation in the existing diesel engine power plants (corresponding to the
generation of the proposed Cumberland hydroelectric scheme) valued at the
estimated fuel prices in St. Vincent.



- 32 -
6.06      The rate of return of the proposed program using prevailing
tariffs as of December 1983 is estimated at approximately 10%. If benefits
are valued at forecast tariff levels, the internal rate of return is
estimated at 11%. The rate of returns are similar to St. Vincent's
estimated opportunity cost of capital (10%) which indicates that VINLEC's
average tariff Levels are close to long run marginal costs - LRMC (see
para.1.11). Despite these results, tariffs will need to be increased
further during the implementation of the proposed project in order to help
finance the corresponding costs (para. 5.10). However, over its life
(about 50 years) the project would be an important factor tending to reduce
tariff levels. Details of the rate of return analysis are included in
Annex 6, Table 6.3.
6.07      Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact on
the rate of return as a result of reasonable variations on the capital
costs (I/- 10%) and revenues (+/- 10%).  The results of these analyses,
whicii are tabulated in Annex 6, Table 6.4, indicate that the variations of
the above parameters do not ffect substantially the return on the
investment (except under the most adverse assumptions i.e., capital costs
of the investment 10% higher and expected benefits 10% lower than the base
case).

FIRST POWER PROJECT
CHARACTERISTICS OF CUMBERLAND HYDRO SCHEME
1. Description
The hydroelectric potential of the Cumberland river will be fully
developed through the construction of three schemes. About 86% of the
total catchment has been utilised in this three stage development of the
Cumberland river. The schemes are:
Cumberland-l, or the upstream scheme;
Cumberland-2, in the middle reach of the river;
Cumberland-3, or the downstream scheme.
The gross heads which have been developed for each scheme
decrease in the direction of flow and are directed by the river gradient.
The developed heads are 165 m, 84 m and 48.5 m for the upper, middle and
lower schemes, respectively. The arrangement of the schemes gives, in
effect, a cascade development of the river with little loss of head between
the schemes.
The component parts of each of the three schemes are a low
diversion weir, sediment tank, storage (balancing) tank, pipeline and
powerhouse. The pipelines are almost entirely of woodstave construction
which is considered to be suitable for the conditions and experiences in
St. Vincent. In addition, the selection of this type of pipe allows a
least-cost solution for the water conveyance system.
A distance of 4,5 km separates the three powerhouses which have a
total capacity of 3370 kW. The power output from the upper development is
1370 kW, that of the middle is 1200 kW and the lower development
contributes 800kW. The total average energy which can be generated is
about 20,5 GWh per annum.
The inclusion of the storage (balancing) tank in each scheme,
especially the upper one, is of decided advantage since it allows a higher
firm peaking capacity during the dry season. The storage tank is filled by
reducing output during the off peak hours, and is emptied during the peak
load hours, allowing adequate distribution of the plants' capacity (KW)
and energy (kWh) during peak and off-peak hours. The inclusion of the
above tanks does not increase the average energy output. Since the layouts
which have been preferred place the powerhouse of one scheme close to the
dam and storage tank of the downstream plant, discharges from the tailrace
of the upper and middle schemes are led directly to the storage tank of the
downstream plant. This is the normal operating mode, but under other
circumstances the discharges from the tailrace can be returned directly to
the river. With this arrangement, the size and cost of the settling tanks
for the middle and lower schemes have been reduced.

ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 4
The use of a turgo-impulse type turbine for the two upper schemes
and a Pelton turbine at Cumberland-I are being considered. Final choice of
the turbines will be made when the detailed design is completed by February
1984 and will depend on the final size, net output and the cost of the
generating equipment. At Cumberland-2 and Cumberland-3, the use of Pelton
turbines is inappropriate because of the lower heads and higher flows.

3. Estimated Flows
The proposed developments in the Cumnberland river required the
preparation of the long term daily flow duration curves at four points.
These were at the dam sites at Convent and Hermitage (Cumberland #1), Grove
(Cumberland #2) and Spring Village (Cumberland #3). This was done by
estimating rainfall, evapotranspiration, hence runoff and then applying the
flow duration coefficients. From the values of rainfall and evaporation,
the mean annual flow for the three developments are:
Catchment         Rainfall    Evapo-            Runoff      Mean

The Cumberland river flow regime follows in general the flow
pattern of other rivers in St. Vincent. Its monthly flow distribution as a
proportion of the average runoff is given below:
DRY SEASON                          WET SEASON

Qaverage
The above ratios were utilized to calculate the approximate
monthly energy generation.
The design floods for the weirs and cofferdams at the four dam
sites on the Cumberland river are:

4. Energy delivered
The amount of electrical energy delivered in a given year depends
on the amount of runoff available in that year and the normal, expected
losses. The amount of energy delivered for different water supply
conditions was estimated assuming a water utilization factor of 95% and
transmission losses of 5X.  Results for typical wet and dry years are shown
in the tables below together with corresponding values for the average
year. For the three cases it is assumed that the flows follow the same
time variation pattern as in the dimensionless flow duration curve which
was developed, and that the plant flows are those given in paragraph 2
above.
