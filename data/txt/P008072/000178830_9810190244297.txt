ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
POWER PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                The Government of St. Vincent and The Grenadines
Beneficiary              St. Vitncent Electricity Services Ltd. (VINLEC)
Amount:                  SDR 4.7 million (US$5.0 million equivalent), composed
of SDR 0.7 million of regular IDA funds and SDR 4,.0
million of IDA Special Funds.
Terms:                   Standard
Relending Terms:         The IDA credits would be relent to VINLEC on terms of
20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the
IBRD interest rate at the time of credit approval. The
subloa.n would be denominated in US dollars.
Project Description:    The proposed project, which comprises VINLEC's total
1985-89 investment program, would meet the estimated
energy generation requirements through 1994, reduce
substEantially the imports of petroleum products,
improve the quality of electricity services, reduce the
level of the system's distribution losses and improve
VINLEC's management and staff skills. The projec:t
includes the construction of three hydroelectric power
plants, rehabilitation of existing diesel engine
generating plants, extension of subtransmission and
distribution facilities, a loss reduction program, a
training program and engineering/consultant servLces.
Benefits and Risks:      The project will reduce the country's dependence on
imported fuels by about 34,500 barrels of fuel per
year, resulting in foreign exchange savings equivalent
to US$1,300,000 annually. It will supply a reliable
and efficient source of power for the country's
development.
A                                 If dry season construction targets are not met, a delay
of ten mnrths may occur, which could increase project
costs. Price contingencies included in the project are
expected to minimize this risk.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF IDA
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDITS FOR A
TOTAL AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO $5 MILLION
TO ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
FOR A POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on proposed
development credits to St. Vincent and the Grenadines (St. Vincent) for
a total amount of SDR 4.7 million ($5 million equivalent) on standard IDA
terms to help finance a First Power Project. One of the credits is for
SDR 0.7 million of IDA funds; the other for SDR 4.0 million of IDA Special
Funds.  The proceeds of the credits would be relent to St. Vincent
Electricity Services Ltd. (VINLEC) on terms of twenty years, including a
five-year grace period, at the IBRD interest rate of the time of approval.
The subloan would be denominated in US dollars.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic report (St. Vincent and the Grenadines:  Economic
Situation and Medium-Term Prospects, Report No. 4370-CRG, dated April 1,
1983) was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 14, 1983.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
Background
3.       St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the less developed
countries (LDCs) of the Eastern Caribbean, situated in the Windward Islands
chain, is endowed with a tropical climate, ample rainfall, alluvial soils
and verdant plains traversed by fast flowing rivers. The virtually
impenetrable range of volcanic mountains require that, for the most part,
the country's population of about 110,000 live along the coastlines of the
black sand beaches of the main island. One of the country's greatest
assets may well be in the still untapped potential of its dependencies--the
Grenadines, a chain of eleven smaller islands extending southward with high
potential for yachting and tourism.
4.       The population is well educated, with an adult literacy rate of
about 80%. Almost 70% of the population is under the age of 25, resulting
in a relatively high dependency ratio.  In spite of a rapid decline in the
infant mortality rate, from about 69.6 per 1000 of live births in 1972 to
about 45.6 in 1981, the average annual rate of population growth in recent
years has slowed to about 2%, owing mainly to increased emigration and to a
slight decline in the birth rate. The young population, however, has led
to a steady stream of school leavers who have caused the labor force to
increase at a much faster rate than can be absorbed by the economy.



- 2 -
5.       In accordance with its resource endowment, the country's economic
development has been based on export agriculture, largely bananas,
arrowroot and vegetables, and to some extent on tourism. More recently, an
embryonic manufacturing sector has emerged. As indicated in paragraph 4
above, however, the pace of economic development has not been sufficient to
generate adequate employment for the burgeoning labor force; unemployment
is the country's most serious problem. Although no accurate data exist,
the Labor Commission estimated it at 20-25% of the labor force in 1982,
compared to about 10% in 1970. This level excludes the impact of
pervasive, although hard-to-measure underemployment.
Economic Developments; 1970-81
6.        The economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines has exhibited sharp
fluctuations in growth in recent years. Like most other islands of the
Eastern Caribbean, it found its economy buoyed along by favorable external
conditions during the 1960s. A combination of events during the early
1970s, however, led to prolonged economic stagnation. Adverse weather
conditions (highlighted by severe droughts in 1973 and 1975) seriously
depressed agricultural outputs and exports. Falling world prices for the
country's main export commodities caused the p(erformance of the key sectors
to deteriorate even further. In particular, arrowroot exports declined in
1973 to 31% of their 1966 level as the entry of substitute starches into
the world market depressed arrowroot prices. The deteriorating economic
conditions were further exacerbated by the escalation of consumer prices
which commenced in 1973 and continued at a rapLd pace as oil prices
quadrupled. The economy was thus confronted wLth simultaneous inflation,
stagnation and deteriorating employment opportunities. Tourism, however,
surged briefly, benefiting from political disturbances in nearby islands,
although not sufficiently to offset the impact of other unfavorable
economic developments. In an attempt to arrest the economic decline, the
Government placed strong emphasis on export diversification in 1975. Lands
previously used for arrowroot cultivation were shifted to banana, vegetable
and tobacco production; and large estates were converted into small plots
with the objective of increasing output and crieating additional employment
opportunities.
7.        The economic outlook brightened during 1976-78 as a result of
several favorable events. Ideal weather condiltions combined with
increasing world demand and prices and increasead public sector capital
expenditures in agriculture led to a vigorous output expansion of most
agricultural products, particularly bananas and vegetables. Economic
activities, however, slowed down again during 1979-80 as a result of a
volcanic eruption in 1979 and a major hurricanes in 1980 which impacted
largely on agriculture. Following a timely rehabilitation program, the
economy rebounded strongly in 1981 when GDP at factor cost grew by about
12% in real terms. The rapid recovery was led by the agricultural sector
where production reached 1978 levels and by continued expansion of enclave
industries. Inflation, meanwhile increased from 8% in 1978 to about 17% in
1980, but subsequently declined to about 13% in 1981 reflecting the
deceleration of global inflation.



- 3
Recent Economic Developments, 1982-83
8.        The economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines exhibited signs of
a slowdown in 1982 compared to 1981 with GDP growing by about 2.1%. The
slowdown reflected weak performance in agriculture as a result of a drcught
in the early part of the year, a decline in tourism and only modest grcwth
in the other main sectors. Gross domestic savings which were positive in
1981 turned negative in 1982 as consumption expenditures grew by almost
9%. The level of gross domestic investment was maintained, however, at 25%
of GDP, as a result of the continuing high inflows of project-related
external public assistance.  The rate of price inflation declined from 13%
in 1981 to 8% in 1982, reflecting a deceleration in the rate of increase in
import prices.
9.        The consolidated current account of the public sector improved
from a deficit of EC$0.3 million in 1980/81 to a surplus of EC$0.4 million
in 1981/82. The General Government's (including the Central Government,
the Kingstown Board, the National Provident Fund and the Philatelic
Services) current account showed a surplus of EC$4.3 million while the nine
nonfinancial public enterprises had a deficit of EC$3.9 million in
1981/82. The operations responsible for the deficit of the nonfinancia.l
public enterprises included the sugar factory, the Banana Growers and
Arrowroot associations as well as the water and electricity authorities.
The sugar factory, after a number of years in which the sugar industry was
abandoned in St. Vincent, restarted operation recently and was experiencing
extraordinarily high start-up costs.  The authorities are taking measures
to reduce operating costs. The Banana Growers Association's deficit
resulted from a drought-induced drop in output and the continuing
depreciation of sterling. Revenue improvement is predicated on the
subregional response to the exchange rate problem. In the case of
arrowroot, there is the need to explore cost reduction methods and to
promote the product through capitalizing on its unique properties in food
products and for cosmetics. Tariff measures have been implemented to
improve the revenues of the St. Vincent Electricity Services, Ltd. and the
Central Water and Sewerage Authority and should strengthen their finances.
10.       Following a strong improvement in the current account deficit: of
the balance of payments in 1981, there was a renewed deterioration in 1982,
mainly because of lower export prices and volumes and a decline in
tourism.  The resource gap, which was about 19% of GDP in 1981, rose to
about 26% of GDP in 1982 as the volume of exports declined by 5% while
imports rose somewhat in excess of 4%. The current account deficit widened
to almost US$12 million in .1982.  About 75% of the deficit was financed by
net foreign capital inflows which increased by 11% over the previous year.
External public debt at the end of June 1982 was US$17 million or 23% of
GDP. Nevertheless, the debt: service ratio remained at a low of about 33% of
exports of goods and nonfactor services as a result of the highly
concessionary terms of the outstanding loans.



- 4-
Development Issues and Strategy
11.       The medium- and long-term development: objectives of the
Government emphasize the promotion of export-oriented and
import-substituting employment-generating activities. In this connection,
the modernization of agriculture and the expansion of industry are the key
strategies, supplemented by the development of tourism in the Grenadines.
The major constraints facing this strategy are the inability of the system
to generate adequate domestic savings, the lack of adequate managerial
manpower and an inadequate infrastructure, especially in power, water and
transportation.
12.       The Government's efforts in the modernization of agriculture
involve output diversification in view of of the uncertain prospects for
its banana industry, which accounts for about 40% of the total value of
exports. Current efforts are directed at improving productivity of both
the banana and arrowroot industries and an expansion in acreage for
vegetables, fruits and root crops. The substantial quantities of livestock
and fishery products imported could be partly substituted by increased
domestic production. Development possibilities for livestock are, however,
constrained by the small size of existing stock. In the case of
fisheries, the lack of chilling facilities, proper flake ice supplies, and
modern boat equipment constitutes the major obistacle. The main need of the
agricultural sector (including fisheries) is for an adequate level of
support services in marketing, extension, research and credit for which
external assistance will be needed.
13.       Major progress has been made in industrial development.  The
promotional efforts of the St. Vincent Development Corporation (DEVCO) need
to be maintained with the continued provision of factory shells. DEVCO
also needs to be strengthened through either the provision of additional
lines of credit or opening it up to a wider participation through the issue
of shares. The Government is committed to developing a strong private
sector in industry and welcomes additional foreign private investment. The
basic investment incentives package is good. Given the stable political
climate, competitive wages, good industrial relations, and a relatively
well-educated labor force, the prospects are favorable for continuing the
present trend of industrialization.
14.       The development of the tourism industry in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines has been haphazard. Assessing its potential is difficult
because of the lack of attractions in St. Vincent, but the Grenadines
have a great potential centered around yachting, white sand beaches and
high quality hotels. In order to promote the industry, a variety of
measures are required, which include: (a) the strengthening of the Tourist
Board with respect to setting hotel and restaurant standards, training, and
promotional activities, and (b) the urgent formulation of a master plan for
the tourism sector. The Tourist Board is expected to receive a tourism
adviser under a technical assistance program by CDB whose main
responsibility would be to develop a master plan.



15.       The lack of an adequate air access to the island both for cargo
and tourists and inadequate container handling facilities at the port are
major obstacles. Similarly, water and electricity supplies are unreliable
and inadequate to sustain rapid expansion of industry and tourism. The
Government is cognizant of these constraints and major physical
improvements to the harbor, upgrading of the airport, and studies of water
and energy supplies are under way with external financial and technical
assistance.
16.       Recent Government measures to improve public finances, including
reduction in non-wage current expenditures and broadening of the tax base
are commendable. Domestic resource mobilization needs further
strengthening through the implementation of the proposed Social Security
Scheme and the introduction of realistic interest rates on domestic savings
in the banking sector. Domestic savings could also be improved over the
long term by constraining increases in private consumption of luxury-type
commodities. In this context, tax measures on luxury items would have to
be strengthened. The educational system also requires restructuring to
meet the country's changing needs for industrial manpower.
Public Sector Investment and Financing
17.       The proposed and ongoing public sector investment program for
FY82/83-FY85/86 amounts to about EC$192 (US$71) million, of which ongo:Lng
projects constitute about 31% of total outlay. The program implies an
annual public sector investment expenditure of about EC$48 (US$18) million,
which is double the average actual investment expenditure for
FY79/80-FY81/82. This unusually high level of planned public sector
capital expenditures would result mainly from the proposed Cumberland
Hydroelectric Project, which accounts by itself for approximately 30% of
the proposed capital expenditures over this period. Apart from the new
emphasis on power, the program is similar to the public sector investment
pattern during the previous years. It includes agriculture, transportation
and some residual investment in manufacturing.
18.       The Government expects to mobilize about EC$156 (US$58) million
or some four-fifths of the total outlay from external sources on
concessionary terms. Some EC$53 (US$20) million of the total program
outlay are already available for ongoing projects with firm commitments,
leaving EC$103 (US$38) million to be mobilized. The principal donors
providing finance are the United Kingdom (UK), the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB),
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the European
Economic Community (EEC). They have generally indicated their intention to
continue assistance in financing the public sector investment program. The
domestic counterpart requirement amounts to EC$36 (US$13) million. Public
sector savings, although improving recently, have been very low over t:he
past years. Provided the authorities are successful in their efforts to
strengthen the finances of the public sector enterprises by overcoming the
high production cost of the sugar factory, by improving the price
competitive position of the Arrowroot Industry Association, and by



-6-
implementing future tariff changes as appropriate for electriclty and
water, public sector savings should increase. Given such action, for
1983-86, the cumulative public sector savings are estimated at about EC$28
(US$10) million (including an estimated EC$8 (US$3) million per annum
surplus from the proposed social security scherie). The net domestic
borrowing by the public sector would thus not exceed EC$9 (US$3) million
over the program period and should prove manageable.
Economic Prospects
19.       The economic slowdown experienced in 1982 persisted Ln 1983 as
economic recovery in the industrial economies, on which St. Vincent and the
Grenadines are dependent, advanced at a slow peace. As the OECD's economies
improve further, however, it should become possible for St. Vinicent to
achieve an average GDP growth rate of about 5% over the 1984-86 period,
owing mainly to a strong expansion in industry and a somewhat slower growth
in both agriculture and tourism. The public sector finances should be
expected to improve over the period as cost redluction and tariff measures
are adopted to strengthen the relatively weak finances of the nonfinancial
public enterprises. The expected expansion in project-related activities
should cause imports of capital goods to rise rapidly, especially during
the first half of the period. Exports are projected to recover, especially
after 1984, as new manufacturing establishments become fully operational
and export agriculture becomes more competitive owing to cost reduction
measures which are now being formulated. The resource balance is therefore
projected to decrease from US$22 million in 1983 to US$16 milliLon in 1986.
The current account deficit of the balance of payments is thus projected to
decrease from US$14 million in 1983 to US$8 million in 1986, and is
expected to be financed largely by project rela!ted grants and loans.
20.       The external debt, which is estimated at US$17 million in
1981/82, is expected to quadruple over the 1984-86 period because of the
size of the proposed public investment program (including the proposed
hydroelectric project). The debt service ratico is currently about 3% of
exports of goods and nonfactor services. The low ratio is explained by the
low interest and long-term structure of the debt. In spite of the present
low debt service ratio, St. Vincent and the Grenadines will have to acquire
most of its external capital inflow on a grant or highly concessional
basis. Assuming the authorities continue to adopt appropriate budgetary
controls (especially with regards to the nonfinancial public sector
enterprises), and to introduce necessary additional revenue measures and
improve tax administration, part of the local costs of St. Vincent's
investment program could be met with domestic resources, but donors should
be prepared to finance the bulk of local cost requirements of externally
supported projects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
21.       St. Vincent and the Grenadines gained independence from the
United Kingdom in 1979. It became a member of the Bank and IDA in 1982.
St. Vincent is also a member of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), a
regional development bank with which the Bank Group has had three lending



- 7 -
operations, which were approoved :Ln fiscal years 1976, 1980 and 1983.  Bank
Group strategy has been to zhannel resources to the small countries of the
Eastern Caribbean through the CPB, except in those instances where projects
have been beyond CDB's technical or financial capacity.  Furthermore, Bank
Group strategy has also been to maintain an active economic policy diaLogue
with the Governments of these small islands and assist them in obtaining
external financing of their investment programs through the Caribbean Group
mechanism along the lines discussed in paragraph 23 below.
22.       The Bank Group's second operation with CDB is helping to finance
an Electricity Expansion Project in St. Vincent, which includes diesel
generation and related investment.  The CDB is using US$700,000 of IBRD
funds, US$685,00C of IDA funds and US$1,000,000 of EEC Special Action Funds
to help finance the project. The CDB subloan for the project was made
early in 1983 and will help meet electric power demand until the Cumberland
hydroelectric project comes on stream. The diesel equipment for the
project has been ordered, but has not yet arrived in the country. CDB also
has under consideration a feeder road project for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, which, if approved, will be eligible to receive US$1 million of
IDA funds under the Bank Group's FY83 Credit to CDB.
23.       St. Vincent has participated in the Caribbean Group for
Cooperation in Economic Development (Caribbean Group) since its inception
in 1977. The Group has functioned under Bank leadership as an aid
coordination mechanism for the region. Through the work of the Caribbean
Group, the Bank has conducted a dialogue with the Government on its
development priorities and economic policies, and has played a leading role
in helping to obtain and coordinate external assistance, both technical and
financial, for St. Vincent. Economic reports and project lists and
profiles have been prepared, submitted to donors, and discussed at country
subgroup meetings which have generally been held at the time of the annual
Caribbean Group meeting.  In the context of the preparation of these
reports, Bank staff have maintained a dialogue with the Government on the
formulation of realistic investnent programs based on resource availability
and absorptive capacity.  The country subgroup meetings have focussed
attention on the central issues of economic performance and priority
financing requirements of Governments,   The Caribbean Group has also
promoted regional activities which have benefitted the country. These
activities have included technical assistance programs for energy, tourism,
transportatior, and export promotion, as well as assistance for the
preparation and securing of financing for private sector investment
projects.
24,       No other direct Bank Group financing is foreseen for St.
Vincent over the near term. It is likely, however, that the country will
continue to receive Bank Group financing indirectly, through CDB. Future
loans from CDB will likely be for essential infrastructure and for projects
which would help the Government carry out its export-oriented development
strategy. The Bank and the country will also maintain a close association
through the continuing act:ivities of the Caribbean Group.

PART [II - THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
25.       Hydroelectric power is the most important indigenous energy
resource of St. Vincent. Two hydroelectric plants were commissioned in the
early 1950s. At present almost 20% of the total installed power capacity
is hydroelectric, which in turn meets about 36% of the island's total
electric energy requirements; the balance is met by diesel engine
generation. Future development of St. Vincent's hydropower potential
appears to be promising as shown by the conclusions of a study financed by
UNDP, for which the Bank was the executing agency. The study identified
economically viable hydroelectric potential which amounts to about 15 MW
with an annual energy capability of about 80 GWh, enough to meet the bulk
of St. Vincent's power requirements for about 15 years. (During 1983 peak
demand amounted to 5.5 MW and en,ergy generation to about 29 GWh). The
Government of St. Vincent has given priority to the development of this
indigenous resource, which should reduce substantially the country's
imported oil requirements. After the proposed Cumberland hydroelectric
scheme is commissioned, about 85% of total system generation is expected to
be hydro.
26.       St. Vincent's main noncommercial en(ergy sources are charcoal and
wood, which are mostly used for domestic purposes in the rural areas. The
lack of consumption statistics precludes an assessment of their
utilization. However, recent surveys carried out by the Energy Desk of the
Ministry of Finance suggest that charcoal and wood production during 1981
and 1982 amounted to about 3,000 TOE annually.
27.       Seismic surveys offshore the west cDast of Barbados indicate that
St. Vincent may be endowed with some oil/gas deposits. In order to promote
oil exploration activities, the Government of St. Vincent has obtained a
technical assistance grant for off-shore seismic investigation from
Petro-Canada International Assisitance Corporation (PCIAC). Investigations
are expected to start soon.
28.       St. Vincent forms part of the Eastern Caribbean chain of volcanic
islands which have favorable prospects for geothermal development. In
particular, the area in which the Soufriere volcano (which erupted in 1981)
is located may prove to be endowed with geothiermal reservoirs. A Bank
energy assessment mission (which included a geothermal expert) recently
visited St. Vincent and concluded that expenditures for carrying out
detailed geophysical, petrographic and geologLcal studies are not warranted
at this time. The mission concluded, however, that it would be useful for
the Government to start reconnaissance surveys in order to prepare base
data for future studies.
29.       The possible use of nonconventional sources of energy is being
investigated by the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in
collaboration with other international organizations. A livestock
development project, financed through the Car:Lbbean Development Bank (CDB),



-9-
is investigating the possibilities of producing gas from animal manure and
vegetable matter. Furthermore, biomass (bagasse and agricultural/forestry
wastes), crop-drying and biogas utilization is to be explored under the
ongoing CDB/Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Regional Energy Action Plan
(REAP). The current limited availability of bagasse and other agricultural
wastes precludes the development of biomass-based power generation. CDB,
through its Technology and Energy Unit, is also investigating possibilities
of developing wind-power and solar-heating alternatives.
Petroleum Imports and Petroleum Pricing
30.       Imported petroleum products currently meet about 70% of
St. Vincent's total energy requirements. They are imported by Shell (U.K.)
and Texaco (USA) from Trinidad and Tobago (90%), Curacao (6%) and Aruba
(4%). The following table summarizes the estimated import expenditures
during 1982:
Product                          Barrels         TOE1/        US$ (000)2/
Gasoline                            40,180          4,980          1,755
Diesel                              59,350          8,190          2,443
Kerosene                             7,100            930             316
LPG                                  9,520             923            698
Aviation gas                         1,090             143             99
Total       117,240         15,166          5,311
1/ Each TOE has a net calorie content equivalent to 107 kilocalories.
7/ Import expenditures include cost of petroleum products, insurance and
freight (CIF).
The Government of St. Vincent, through its Ministry of Agriculture and
Trade, regulates imports and prices of petroleum products. The different
petroleum products presently consumed in St. Vincent are not subsidized by
the Government and their retail prices reflect the import expenditures plus
costs of marketing, profits, and taxation. The following table summarizes
the price structure at mid-1982:
US$/US Gallon
Total Taxes Wholesale
Product             CIF Price    and Duties       Price      Retail Price
Gasoline                    1.04           0.27          1.47           1.60
Diesel                      0.98           0.13          1.31           1.38
Kerosene                    1.06           0.11          1.31           1.35
LPG (US$/pound)             0.25           N.A.          N.A.           0.39
Aviation Gas                2.17           N.A.          N.A.           N.A.
The Bank's energy assessment mission which visited St. Vincent and other
islands of the Caribbean has recommended that a regional study be carried
out by independent consultants (expected to be funded through the UNDP/IBRD
Regional Oil Exploration Project) in order to address the issues related to
refinery production rationalization, transportation logistics and pricing.



- 10 -
Energy Sector Organization
31.       An energy desk was recently established in the Central Planning
Unit (CPU), of the Ministry of Finance, in order to gather and process
information related to the sector and to coordinate energy policy and
program development in the Government. In view of the small size of the
country, a more elaborate energy coordination mechanism is not now
required. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government will
continue to maintain the energy desk with the current functions and
responsibilities, and provide the necessary funds and resources for its
successful operation (Section 4.01, draft Credit Agreement).1!
Power Sector Organization and Regulation
32.       The main institutions concerned with the power sector in
St. Vincent are the St. Vincent Electricity Services Ltd. (VINLEC), the
Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Agriculture and T'rade. VINLEC
has an exclusive license for a period of 60 years (granted through the
Electricity Supply Act of 1973) to operate all the generating and
distribution facilities in the country as well as to sell electricity in
all of its territory. The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for
reviewing requests for tariff adjustment; licensing and sublicensing power
supply rights; and deciding, as arbitrator, on compensation to property
owners when their lands are affected by the construction of power works.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Trade regulates fuel prices. Given the
extent of VINLEC operations and the size of the sector, the above
arrangements are adequate. VINLEC is jointly owned by the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) of UK (it holds about 51% of the shares) and
the Government of St. Vincent (49%).
33.       The power sector does not have an independent regulatory body for
overseeing utility operations, policies and tariffs. Under the Electricity
Supply Act of 1973 either VINLEC or the Ministry of Public Works
(responsible for electricity services) may serve on the other a written
notice requesting changes of tariff rates. The Act provides that the
matter be referred to arbitration (the High Court judge) in case agreement
is not reached within 60 days from the service of the notice. Otherwise,
the increase becomes effective on the first day of the calendar month
following the expiry of 150 days from the date the written notice mentioned
above was served. Adequacy of the above arrangements is to be assessed
under a tariff study being financed by CDB.
1/   "Draft Credit Agreement" refers to the draft Development Credit
Agreement. There are parallel conditions in the draft Special Fund
Agreement, but these are not specifically referenced in this Report.



- 11 -
Tariffs
34.        As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Electricity Supply
Act provides that either VINLEC or the responsible Ministry may serve on
the other proposals for tariff changes.  In practice VINLEC has initiated
tariff increases which between 1972 and 1982 are estimated to have averaged
1.4% per annum in real terms resulting in tariffs on the high side
(0.17US$/kWh) compared to most countries in the West Indies, which in turn
are generally high by world standards. The revenues from increased tariffs
were mainly used to meet increasing fuel costs.
35.        VINLEC's present tariff consists of a basic charge (consisting of
a minimum charge for domestic consumers, a floor area related charge for
commercial consumers and a demand charge for industrial consumers), a flat
rate per kWh sold by consumer category as well as a fuel surcharge. The
surcharge automatically recovers fuel cost increases since October 1973.
Under the terms of the 1981 CDB loan a tariff study was to be completed not
later than December 31, 1982, but the study has been delayed pending the
completion of a loss-reduction study. A consultant has recently been
appointed tg carry out the tariff study which is expected to be completed
by mid-1984. It was agreed at negotiations that the Government would
furnish IDA a copy of the study when it is completed (Section 4.02(a),
draft Credit Agreement).  IDA would then review the study and discuss its
conclusions, and the implementation of its recommendations with VINLEC, the
Government and CDB. It was also agreed at negotiations that the Government
would promptly thereafter put into effect such structure and level of rates
for the sale of electricity as shall be agreed upon between the Government,
CDB, VINLEG and IDA (Section 4.02(c), draft Credit Agreement).
Sector Constraints
36.        The major sector constraints are insufficient skilled manpower
and, because of the small size of the company, the lack of available
in-house specialist expertise to deal with planning and technical problems
outside VINLEC's day-to-day operations.  The project addresses these issues
by providing financing for: (a) a project manager and supporting staff to
administer the project; (b) managerial services to give support to VINLEC's
regular staff; and (c) a comprehensive training program.
*                                          PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37,        The project was identified by a feasibility study completed in
August 1983, which was financed by the United Nations Development Programme
and supervised by IDA as the executing agency. Appraisal took place in
September 19830 Negotiatfions were held in Washington in April 1984. The
St. Vincent delegation was led by Mr. Arthur F. Williams, Minister of
Communications, Works and Labor and the VINLEC delegation by its General
Manager, Mr. Joel Huggins.



- 12 -
Project Objectives
38.       The electricity supply in St. Vincent is unreliable and
inadequate to meet future load demand. Daily load shedding and system
outages are common. System losses have been iat unacceptably high levels,
reaching 2b.3% of total generation in 1983. The electricity system is
dependent on imported fuels. The principal olbjective of the project is to
provide St. Vincent with efficient and reliable sources of power to meet
the country's growing needs. The project is expected to: (a) meet
estimated requirements for increasing energy generation through 1994 at the
lowest possible economic cost, by (i) rehabilitating some of the existing
diesel units, and (ii) meeting additional demand with increased
hydroelectric capacity, instead of with more costly thermal generation,
which relies on imported petroleum products; (b) reduce the import of
petroleum products that would otherwise be necessary by about 34,500
barrels per year, which is equivalent to 33% of St. Vincent's current total
consumption; (c) reduce outages and system losses; (d) improve the
management and operation of VINLEC; and (e) sltudy the feasibility of future
hydroelectric development.
Project Description
39.       The project includes the construction of all works in VINLEC's
1985-89 power investment program. The physical works and consulting
services included in the project are as follows:
a) Generation
i)     installation of three hydroelectric power-generating
plants on the Cumberland river having a capacity of
about 3.4 MW;
ii)    installation of about eight river steamgauging
facilities and about twelve rainfall stations on
different rivers in order to establish a network which
will be the basis for developing future hydroelectric
sites; and
iii)   rehabilitation of seven existing diesel units at two
thermal power plants.
b)  Transmission and Distribution
Installation and reconductoring of high and low voltage
subtransmission and distribution lines; addition and
replacement of capacitors (about 3,600 KVAR), distribution
transformers (about 3,000 KVA), customer metering equipment
(about 6,000 customers); service drops; street lighting; and
utility vehicles. The foregoing works are required to cover
VINLEC's loss reduction program, as well as its 1985-1989
transmission and distribution programs;



- 13 -
c) Training Program
Scholarships abroad for VINLEC's technical and administrative
staff; specific in-house training programs for plant
operators and linemen; and training materials and equipment;
d) Engineering and Consultant Services
Engineering and consultant services to provide:
i)     managerial, administrative and technical services to
VINLEC;
ii)    supervision of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme and
the VINLEC loss-reduction program; and
iii)   studies for the development of new hydroelectric
schemes.
The Power Market
40.       During 1983 about 52,500 inhabitants, representing about 44% of
the total population of the island of St. Vincent, had access to
electricity services. During the same year availability of electricity in
the urban areas averaged about 65% and about 30% in the rural areas, while
annual average electricity consumption per capita amounted to about 252
kWh/year and installed power-generating capacity to about 83 watts per
inhabitant. St. Vincent's per capita installed capacity, energy
consumption and access to electricity are among the lowest in the
Caribbean. As a result of the project, it is estimated that by 1992,
65,000 inhabitants will have access to electricity services.
41.        Electric power sales have been projected to grow as follows in
the 1983-92 period:
Average Annual
Sales                         1983              1992         Increases 1982-92

- 14 -
Industrial demand is expected to increase more rapidly than other demand
categories because VINLEC's increased supply of reliable power will
encourage industrial users to substitute VINLEC power for the more costly
self-generated power that now accounts for more than 50% of the power
presently consumed by industrial users.
Implementation
a. The Implementing Agency
42.       VINLEC is a limited liability company, three of whose five
directors are appointed by CDC, and two by the Government of St. Vincent.
The Chairman of the Board is the CDC representative for the Eastern
Caribbean. CDC provides VINLEC with management services under a 1973
agreement and gives VINLEC such advice as it requires on the management and
operation of the company. In recent years the management services have
consisted principally of a review of VINLEC's management and operational
plans and its budgeted and actual performance as well as internal auditing
services and assistance with overseas procurement and recruitment. CDC
informed Government some time ago of its desire to sell its shares in
VINLEC and to terminate the management agreement. Negotiations between
Government and CDC for the acquisition of CDC's shares in VINLEC by the
Government have made substantial progress and the acquisition is expected
to be completed in mid-1984. Government has indicated that, apart from
changes in the members of the Board, the responsibility and authority for
VINLEC's operations will remain unchanged.
43.       VINLEC's organizational structure is sound, but its operations
have been adversely affected in the past by lack of available in-house
professionals and by insufficient skilled manpower. At the present time
there are sufficiently competent personnel capable of running VINLEC's
day-to-day operations. To ensure adequate project management, VINLEC is
expected to employ a project manager to supervise and administer the
project (Section 2.02 (b), draft Project Agreement); and to ensure the
continuity of VINLEC's management capability it was agreed during
negotiations that VINLEC would only appoint as General Manager and
Secretary/Accountant persons having qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Association (Section 3.04, draft Project Agreement).
44.       VINLEC's total permanent staff as of June 1983 amounted to 160
employees of whom four are university graduates (three engineers and one
accountant). The ratios of customers/number of employees and MWh
sold/number of employees are 78 and 138 respectively. These features are
similar to those of neighboring countries and considered somewhat high.
Improved performance indicators were discussed and agreed upon during
negotiations, including employment and effiLciency targets in order to
upgrade VINLEC's performance. The proposed project contains a training
component intended to upgrade VINLEC's staff skills in the technical and
administrative areas through scholarships, in-house training and
equipment. VINLEC requires outside services to provide advice and



- 15 -
assistance on its annual and long-term planning as well as technical advice
relating to operations and maintenance and audit services. Consequent:ly,
it is necessary to continue the services provided by CDC after the
management agreement has been terminated.  The agreement provides for 12
months' notice by either VINLEC or CDC to terminate the arrangement. To
ensure the continuation of adequate management services, it was agreed
during negotiations that, if, as expected, the foregoing agreement is
terminated, VINLEC would employ new management services under terms of
reference acceptable to IDA (Section 2.02(c), draft Project Agreement).  It
is expected that the scope of the management services required by VINLEC
would be reduced as its in-house capability improved as a result of the
training program.
b. Financial Position of VINLEC
45.       Between 1978 and 1982 VINLEC's financial operations were
characterized by high electricity production costs (with fuel costs alone
accounting for 43% to 50% of revenues), high tariff levels (17 US cents/kWh
in 1982) and insufficient cash to meet adequately plant maintenance and
capital spending needs. In the same period, VINLEC's rates of return on
historically valued net fixed assets varied from 1.6% in 1979 to 19.2% in
1982, when the effect of large tariff increases became effective.
Operating expenses varied from 90% of revenues in 1978 to 99% in 1980. In
1979 and 1980 net operating income was insufficient to meet interest
charges but, after substantial tariff increases, VINLEC's financial
performance improved in 1981 and 1982. Between 1979 and 1982 revenues and
expenses grew by average annual rates of about 26% and 22% respectively
with kWh sales growing by an average annual rate of about 3%. Average
revenues per kilowatt hour sold increased by an average annual rate of
about 23% between 1979 and 1982. This was about 10% above the estimated
annual inflation rate during the same period.
46.       Under an earlier financing agreement with CDB, VINLEC is required
to revalue its assets annually applying suitable revaluation indices.
During negotiations it was agreed that VINLEC would annually revalue its
fixed assets in accordance with methods acceptable to IDA.  The annual
revaluations will not be included in VINLEC's audited income statements and
balance sheets, but it was agreed during negotiations that the effects of
such revaluation would be presented to IDA in a supplemental statement to
the audited accounts (Section 4.03, draft Project Agreement). This
information would be used to measure the annual rate of return
performance. Futhermore, it was agreed during negotiations that in order
to help finance its immediate capital needs and progress towards earning a
reasonable rate of return on capital, VINLEC would maintain its tariffs at
a level which would yield rates of return on average net revalued fixed
assets in operation as follows: 1985 - 4%; 1986 and 1987 - 6%; 1988 and
1989 - 7%; 1990 and thereafter - 8% (Section 4.04(a), draft Project
Agreement). It was also agreed during negotiations that within 90 days of
the submission of rate increase applications by VINLEC, the Government
would take all necessary actions to enable VINLEC to meet the
aforementioned rate of return requirements, and that not later than



- 16 -
October 31, 1984 the Government would take all necessary actions to meet
the 1985 requirements (Section 4.04, draft Credit Agreement). For its
part, VINLEC agreed to submit any required rate increase applications to
the Government not later than August 31 each year (Section 4.04(c), draft
Project Agreement).
47.       VINLEC's debt/equity ratio in the 1984-92 period is projected to
range between 56/44 in 1987 to 39/61 in 1992. Debt service coverage in the
same period is not projected to drop below 2. VINLEC agreed that until
project completion it would not undertake investments other than those
contained in the project in excess of $400,000 without furnishing IDA
evidence of the soundness of the investment and adequacy of its resources
(Section 4.07, draft Project Agreement). Agreement was also reached with
VINLEC not to incur long-term debt without IDA's; consent, unless net income
before interest and depreciation is at least 1.5 times future debt service
(Section 4.05, draft Project Agreenent).  Agreerent was reached with the
Government during negotiations that if any dividends were paid to it by
VINLEC during project implementation, they would be reinvested in VINLEC
(Section 4.03, draft Credit Agreement).
48.       VINLEC's management information and accounting systems are of a
good standard and effectively administered. Its billing system is
computerized and working well. Under a loan agreement with CDB, VINLEC is
obliged to maintain accounts at a level not exceeding sixty days. Accounts
receivable are at a sixty-day level and further improvement is expected;
VINLEC's external audits are being carried out satisfactorily by an
international accounting firm. During negotiations VINLEC agreed that it
would employ auditors satisfactory to the Association and submit its
audited accounts to the Association not later than four months after the
end of its fiscal year (Section 4.02, draft Project Agreement).
c. Arrangements for Project Execution
49.       Issuance of bidding documents for the purchase of equipment and
materials and for securing civil contractors is expected to take place by
June 1984 and the construction to start by July 1985. Bidding documents
related to the works included in the rehabilitation of the diesel engine
generating plant and VINLEC's subtransmission and distribution programs are
expected to be completed before December 1984 and procurement activities to
start immediately after.
50.       The Government of St. Vincent, VINLEC and IDA have agreed on the
terms of reference and the selection of a consulting firm for the
engineering and supervision of the construction of the Cumberland
hydroelectric plant and for the individual expert who will act as Project
Manager on behalf of VINLEC; such services are expected to be secured by
June 1984. Contracts for these services would be special conditions of
effectiveness (Sections 6.01(f) and 6.01(g), draft Credit Agreement).
Consulting services to carry out feasibility studies for development of new
hydroelectric schemes will be secured during the implementation of the
proposed project. These studies are to be completed by 1987/88.



- 17 -
51.       The acquisition of necessary lands and rights of way for the
Cumberland scheme by VINLEC, and the performance or granting by St. Vincent
and its agencies of all necessary acts, consents and approvals required to
authorize VINLEC to start carrying out the project would be special
conditions of effectiveness (Sections 6.01(c) and 6.01(d), draft Credit
Agreement).
Cost Estimates
52.       The total project cost, including physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at US$30.8 million, of which US$24.0 million is
the foreign exchange component. This estimate does not include interest
during construction. The project will be exempt from local taxes arid
duties. The following is a summary of project costs:

54.       The IDA credits will finance project costs for transmission and
distribution work, diesel plant rehabilitation, engineering and supervision
services and training. As indicated in the above cost table other project
financing would be available from CDB (loss reduction program), CIDA
(pipeline, electromechnical equipment, transmission), EIB (turbines and
generators) and USAID (civil work and rainfall and streamgauging network).
Additional details concerning cofinancing arrangements are contained in the
Annex IV Table, "Project Packages and Cofinancing Arrangements." As a
condition of effectiveness of the IDA credits all conditions of
effectiveness of the financing from other agencies will have been met
(Section 6.01(b), draft Credit Agreement).  IDA and the other agencies will
enter a Memorandum of Understanding describing the project supervision and
coordination arrangements that have been made between the participating
financing agencies. CIDA will provide grant financing to the Government
which will then make an equity contribution to VINLEC. The CDB financing
will be provided to VINLEC on terms of 10% interest, over a 20-year period
including five years of grace on principal payments. The EIB financing to



- 19 -
the Government will be on terms of 4% interest, over a 20-year period
including five years of grace on principal payments. USAID financing to
the Government will be on terms of 2% interest, over a 40-year period
including ten years of grace on principal payments.  The Government will
relend the EIB and USAID loans to VINLEC on the same terms.
Relending Terms
55.       The Government will onlend the proceeds of the IDA credits to
VINLEC for a term of twenty years, including a 5-year grace period, at the
IBRD interest rate at the time of credit approval.  The subloan will be
denominated in US dollars.  The execution of a satisfactory subsidiary loan
agreement would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01(a),
draft Credit Agreement).
Disbursements
56.       It is estimated that the proposed credits would be disbursed over
a period of seven years.
57.       The proposed IDA credits would be applied to the payment of the
following expenditures:
(i)  100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods for the
rehabilitation of the diesel engine generating plant ($912,000),
VINLEC's transmission and distribution expansion program
($773,000), and training program ($35,000);
(ii) 100% of the expenditures for the expatriate services provided by
the manufacturers of the existing diesel engines ($55,000); and
(iii) 100% of the expenditures related to the: (a) consulting services
for the engineering and supervision of the construction of the
Cumberland scheme ($1,285,000); (b) hydroelectric power studies
($359,000); (c) services of the Project Manager ($782,000); and
(d) training program (scholarships, training experts) ($776,00).
58.       All requests for disbursements of funds from the IDA credits
would be fully documented. Retroactive financing for up to US$200,000 is
proposed for payment of the consultants and project manager (US$80,000) and
of the rehabilitation of the diesel engine plant (US$120,000) incurred and
paid by the Borrower after May 1, 1984. The proposed retroactive financing
will cover advanced expenditures directly related to: (i) the services of
engineering and supervision for the Cumberland project; (ii) project
management; and (iii) purchase of parts and related services for the
rehabilitation of the diesel engine plant. The closing date for the
proposed credit would be June 30, 1991 (Section 2.04, draft Credit
Agreement).

Procurement
59.       Equipment and materials for VINLEC's transmission and
distribution will be procured by international competitive bidding.
Equipment, parts, instruments and associated services for the
rehabilitation of existing diesel generators will be by direct
procurement. Technical assistance services financed by IDA and the
training program will be contracted for in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. The purchase of other equipment, services and technical
assistance not financed by IDA will be in accordance with the guidelines of
the particular external financing agency, or the Government of
St. Vincent. Any of the foregoing procurement financed by the IDA Special
Fund Credit will be limited to suppliers from countries eligible under the
Special Fund Resolution effective on the date of the Credit Agreement.

Project Benefits
60.       The project contains the least cost power generating alternative
which would meet St. Vincent's electric power needs through 1994. A review
was made of alternative generation systems and it was concluded that the
only possible alternatives were hydroelectric, or diesel generation plant
facilities. Other nontraditional sources were judged to be urLreliable or
insufficient to meet load requirements. The Cumberland generating
facilities were compared to other hydroelectric and diesel engine
generating plants using the discounted cash flow method. In comparing the
Cumberland scheme to other hydroelectric schentes, four alternative schemes
were considered. Least cost analyses were also carried out by comparing
the Cumberland hydro scheme to alternative prcgrams consisting of new
diesel engine generating plants. In making the analysis, fuel cost prices
used ($35 per US barrel for diesel No. 2 and US$28 per US barrel for bunker
C) are below the average price levels in the region. The Cumberland scheme
was found to be the least cost alternative.
61.       The internal economic rate of return of the project using
forecast tariff levels (1984) is about 11% and about 10% in the case of
either of revenues being 10% less than forecast, or capital costs being 10%
higher than forecast. Use of hydroelectric power will reduce the country's
dependence on imported fuels by about 34,500 barrels of fuel per year,
resulting in foreign exchange savings equivalent to US$1,300,000 annually.
The project will supply a reliable and efficient source of electric power
essential for St. Vincent's economic developme!nt.
Risks
62.       The Cumberland hydroelectric plants are subject to the risks
normally associated with the construction of civil works in areas where dry
and wet seasons occur. The dams and storage tank included in the project
are to be built during the dry seasons of 1986 and 1987. If dry season
construction targets are not met, a delay of 10 months may occur. The
project has no other special physical risks arnd does not have any
significant environmental risks. Technical assistance and training
financed by the project should help assure the timely completiLon and
success of the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
63.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between St. Vincent and
the Grenadines and the Association, the draft Special Fund Agreement
between St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Association as Administrator
of the Special Fund established with funds contributed by certain members
of the Association, the draft Project Agreement between St. Vincent
Electricity Services Limited and the Association and the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. Special conditions of the project are lLsted in
Section III of Annex III. The following would be special conditions of
effectiveness (Section 6.01, draft Credit Agreement):



- 23 -
(i) The signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between
St. Vincent and VINLEC;
(ii) The meeting of conditions of effectiveness by St. Vincent: and
VINLEC for the project financing to be made available from
CDB, CIDA, EIB and USAID;
(iii) The acquisition of necessary lands and rights of way for the
Cumberland scheme by VINLEC;
(iv) The performance or granting by St. Vincent and its agenciLes
of all necessary acts, consents and approvals required for
VINLEC to start carrying out the project;
(v) Satisfactory contracts for the services of a Project Manager
and a consulting firm for the engineering and supervision of
the project; and
(vi) Cross effectiveness conditions between the Development Credit
and Special Fund Agreements.
64.       I am satisfied that the proposed credits would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
65.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed IDA
and IDA Special Fund Development Credits.
