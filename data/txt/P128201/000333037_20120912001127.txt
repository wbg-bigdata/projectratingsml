                     This DPC2 supports: (i) promoting government efficiency and effectiveness
                     through sound fiscal and public financial management and procurement, and
                     strong public administration; (ii) fostering private sector development by
                     improving the policy environment and facilitating productive employment
                     opportunities; and (iii) expanding access to infrastructure in a sustainable
                     manner.
                      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bhutan, covering FY11-14, is
                      aligned to the 10FYP. The CPS emphasizes selectivity and proposes World
                      Bank Group support for development in Bhutan in two broad areas: (i)
                      economic diversification, job creation, and financial inclusion – for increasing
                      growth and employment led by the private sector; and (ii) spatial planning and
Program               public services – for enhancing standards of well-being. These areas are
Development           underpinned by two cross-cutting themes of capacity building for good
Objectives and        governance and environment.
Contribution to CPS
                      The objectives of both operations in this series are consistent with the CPS
                      because both support implementation of the 10FYP. The three focus areas of the
                      DPCs link well with the CPS areas of engagement. The first DPC component on
                      promoting government efficiency and effectiveness will contribute to the cross-
                      cutting theme on governance in the CPS. Improved budgetary processes, better
                      fiduciary systems, expanded e-governance, and stronger public administration
                      will strengthen institutional capacity and will help improve the quality of
                      services for citizens. The second DPC component on private sector development
                      aligns directly with the economic diversification and financial inclusion pillar of
                      the CPS, and actions to enhance employability and improve the policy
                      environment for the private sector will contribute to the corresponding CPS
                      goals. The third DPC component on improving sustainable access to
                      infrastructure will support spatial planning and public services. Institutional
                      strengthening in the roads and urban sectors will ultimately help provide better
                      access and quality, while measures to promote environmental sustainability and
                      strengthen disaster risk management will contribute to better environmental
                      stewardship.
                      The main risks are: (i) aggregate demand pressures could linger resulting in
                      persistent rupee shortage. Mitigating factors include: recent monetary and fiscal
                      tightening; a calibration of capital spending by the RGoB based on foreign grants
                      or loans; and commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination
                      between Ministry of Finance, the Royal Monetary Authority, in consultation
                      with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced by quarterly review of
Risks and Risks
                      macroeconomic performance. The expansion of the existing line of credit with
Mitigation
                      the Government of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should help
                      ease pressures on the rupee; (ii) capacity constraints due to the small scale of
                      government – mitigated by the RGoB’s ongoing capacity building efforts (in
                      many areas supported by development partners); and (iii) political risk of
                      changing government priorities – mitigated by the RGoB’s wide consultations on
                      the development agenda and its commitment to sustaining reforms.

                 A PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
                          TO THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN

                                        I.       INTRODUCTION

1. The second Development Policy Credit (DPC2) proposes financial support to the Royal
Government of Bhutan (RGoB) in the amount of SDR23.9 million (US$36 million equivalent). The
DPC2 is the second and final operation in a programmatic series that supports the RGoB’s Tenth Five
Year Plan (10FYP).1 The development objectives of the series are: (i) promoting government efficiency
and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial management and procurement, and a strong
public administration; (ii) fostering private sector development by improving the policy environment and
facilitating productive employment opportunities; and (iii) expanding access to infrastructure in a
sustainable manner. The DPC2 reinforces reform areas supported by the First Development Policy Credit
(DPC1)2 and builds the earlier policy-based operations. The DPC2 is aligned with World Bank’s strategic
directions set out in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY11-14).

2. With a strong record on development, Bhutan is a well-performing country in South Asia.
Real GDP grew by 8.5 percent during the past decade underpinned by political stability, prudent
macroeconomic management, and the development of a hydropower sector. Atlas GNI per capita in 2011
is US$2,070, second only to Maldives in the region. While recognizing the importance of economic
growth in alleviating poverty, the RGoB also prioritizes sustainable development. Therefore, its
development vision attempts to maximize Gross National Happiness – a vision that places as much
weight on the social, spiritual, intellectual, cultural and emotional needs of a society as it does on
economic gain. In addition, several initiatives are in place to reduce corruption before it becomes a major
issue, use its hydropower resources to fund socio-economic development, strengthen fiscal management
to counter the impacts of economic volatility, foster private sector development to help diversify the
economy, and provide gainful employment for its educated youth. With a Transparency International
Corruption Perceptions Index of 5.7 in 2011, the country ranks better than others in the region. It had a
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating of 3.9 in 2011 – also the highest in the region.
On the social front, the country has already achieved three Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and
is on track to achieve the rest.3

3. However, Bhutan faces several challenges. As a small open economy dependent on hydropower
revenues and budgetary grants, economic volatility complicates macroeconomic management. In the
10FYP, slightly over half the total Government revenues are expected to come from grants and sales of
electricity to India. Therefore, revenues are dependent on the timing of hydropower projects coming on
stream as well as on the seasonality of hydropower revenues, and on timely receipt of grants. Moreover,
the development of a vibrant private sector is constrained by the absence of scale economies,4 limited
access to finance, mismatched skills of the labor force, and under provision of infrastructure in a country
with a difficult terrain. Because of a thinly spread population and high transport costs, benefits from
urban agglomeration need to be promoted – therefore, urban management is important. Finally, given its
vulnerability to natural disasters, Bhutan needs to put in place robust plans to manage risks proactively.

4. The first democratically elected Government set out its development agenda in the 10FYP.
The RGoB is committed to maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework by keeping the fiscal deficit
below 5 percent of GDP on average over the Plan period through prudent expenditure patterns and by
keeping current expenditures in line with domestic resources. In the first two years of the 10FYP
(FY2008/09 and FY2009/10), including foreign grants averaging 14 percent of GDP, the RGoB ran small
fiscal deficits averaging of around 1.8 percent of GDP.5 However, because of ambitious capital
expenditures,6 the deficit rose to 2.1 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 and widened further to 3.5 percent in
FY2011/12. In FY2012/13, largely because of expenditure compression and rationalization measures, the
fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 1.6 percent of GDP.

5. While Bhutan was largely insulated from the global economic crisis, it was affected by shocks
resulting from natural disasters. The impact of the global economic crisis was felt temporarily through
lower convertible currency revenues from tourism (US$31.8 million in 2009, down from US$38.8 million
in 2008). Tourism revenues rebounded in 2010 and 2011. Meanwhile, natural disasters imposed
significant economic costs. In May 2009, floods resulting from Cyclone Aila caused US$15 million in
damage to infrastructure, followed by an earthquake in September that caused US$94 million in losses
and reconstruction costs.7 An earthquake centered in the northeastern part of India in September 2011
resulted in losses and reconstruction costs of about US$56 million.8

6. As pointed out in the DPC1 Program Document, the World Bank supported Bhutan’s
development agenda using three budget-support operations before this programmatic series. The
First and Second Development Policy Grants were a programmatic series designed to support medium-
term reforms.9 These two operations of US$15 million in FY06 and US$12 million in FY07, helped
deepen policy dialogue and achieve selected development goals. Following the first democratic elections
in 2008, a stand-alone Development Policy Financing for Institutional Strengthening (DPFIS) operation
for US$20.22 million was approved under the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to support the
development goals of the 10FYP.10 The ICRRs for all three operations show that they have satisfactorily
achieved their development objectives.11 Progress under these operations include improving fiscal and
financial management and procurement, enhancing transparency and accountability in public services,
fostering private sector development, enhancing employment opportunities, promoting access to and
enhancing the quality of infrastructure, and supporting environmental sustainability.

  The RGoB publishes budget reports and financial statements on their website:

   The DPG series highlighted measures to: (a) enhance the delivery of public services by strengthening fiscal
management, (b) increase the effectiveness of public spending by improving financial management and procurement
processes, (c) create better income earning opportunities by improving the investment climate, facilitating greater
labor market flexibility, and increasing foreign direct investment, (d) raise educational attainment, particularly in
previously under-served areas, by expanding access to high quality education services, and (e) reduce maternal
mortality by increasing the number of births delivered in health facilities.
10
   The DPFIS supported: (a) promoting good governance through sound fiscal and public financial management and
procurement, and strong accountability institutions; (b) fostering dynamic labor markets, ensure skills match, and
generate employment; and (c) expanding access to infrastructure (roads, hydropower, ICT) in an environmentally
sustainable manner.

7. The current two-operation programmatic series responds to RGoB’s request to support its
institutional reforms and to provide untied resources for its development agenda. As the young
democracy deepens institutional reforms in pursuit of its development goals, assistance from the World
Bank will be crucial. The RGoB has indicated that the World Bank’s budget-support operations have
helped in furthering the RGoB’s policy reform agenda and has requested its support to carry this forward.
While other development partners assist Bhutan, their financing is largely project specific and disburses
over time. The DPC series are valuable because they are quick disbursing operations that can be
deployed flexibly by the RGoB. Most important, they provide support during a critical transition in the
Bhutanese economy, which is making massive upfront investments in productive capacity in the
hydropower sector to generate a perpetual stream of significantly higher electricity export revenues.
These resources are vital, therefore, to ensuring the sustainability and growth of the Bhutanese economy
and supporting the general welfare for its people. As requested by the RGoB, this series builds on the
previous DPFIS and focuses on strengthening institutions to:

        Promote government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial
         management and procurement, and strong public administration;
        Foster private sector development by improving the policy environment and facilitating
         productive employment opportunities;
        Expand access to infrastructure in a sustainable manner.

                                     II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

8. Bhutan’s location provides opportunities and challenges. Nestled in the eastern Himalayas,
Bhutan is bordered by two Asian giants – China and India. Its tiny population of about 713,300 is spread
over 38,394 square kilometers. Elevation ranges from 200 meters in the southern foothills to some peaks
in the north that are around 7,000 meters above sea level. Bhutan’s picturesque topography consists of
tall mountains, thick forests and tumultuous rivers. In keeping with its philosophy of sustainable
development, Bhutan’s constitution requires that 60 percent of its land area be covered by forests (around
72 percent of the land was under forest cover in 2010). Challenges include a difficult terrain – tall
mountains with sheer drops – that makes connecting remote areas difficult and expensive. Moreover,
Bhutan is located on the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, whose movements and collisions cause
frequent earthquakes in the area. It also experiences other disasters such as landslides, forest fires, and
glacial lake outburst floods.

9. Bhutan transitioned peacefully from a monarchy to a multi-party democracy in 2008,
following a decade of planning and consultations. This transition started under the leadership of the
Fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who stepped down in December 2006 in favor of his son, Jigme
Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. After widespread consultations and preparations,12 the Constitution was
finalized and elections were held. The King is the nominal head of state while the executive power rests
in the hands of an elected Government led by the Prime Minister. The new democratic system consists of
a National Council and a National Assembly. The National Council has 25 members of which 20 are
elected and 5 are appointed by the King. The National assembly has 47 elected members who are
affiliated with political parties. Election for the National Council was held on December 31, 2007 and for
the National Assembly on March 24, 2008. The ruling party, Druk Phuensum Tshogpa, holds 45 of the
47 seats in the National Assembly. The next elections both the National Council and the National
Assembly are due within the year and the dates are being decided by the Election Commission.




12
  These included the establishment of numerous constitutional bodies, including an election commission, an anti-
corruption commission and an independent auditor-general.

                          A.       Recent Economic Developments in Bhutan

10. Bhutan’s growth performance remains strong. Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 7.8
percent over the period 2008/09-2011/12 (Table 1), which is in line with the target for the 10FYP. Both
hydropower13 and non-hydropower sectors contributed almost equally to GDP growth between 2008/09
and 2011/12. Growth in GDP of the hydropower sector (construction, generation and transmission)
slowed during 2010/12 because of the phasing of construction activities and temporary technical
problems with the operation of Tala plant. Value added in the non-hydropower sector during the 10FYP
was driven mostly by manufacturing and services. The former was largely because of new industries
coming into the country attracted by the availability of power.

11. The Bhutanese economy showed signs of overheating until recently, but fiscal and monetary
actions coupled with physical controls, have helped dampen the pressures. Growing aggregate
demand because of expanding fiscal deficits, spillovers from rising hydropower expenditures, and
sustained growth in private sector credit led to overheating of the economy in the recent past. Given that
most of the increase in aggregate demand translates into a demand for rupees in a small open economy
(India is Bhutan’s largest trading partner), this resulted in a shortage of rupees by end-2011.14 The RMA
sold US$200 million – around 20 percent of reserves – to meet the rupee obligations. The demand for
rupees showed no signs of abating and the RMA had to impose emergency rupee restrictions in March

13
   Hydropower sector GDP is defined as value added in electricity generation/distribution as well as construction of
power plants.
14
   Bhutan had around 7.0 months of import cover by end FY12, which while lower than at the beginning of the
10FYP, are still at a comfortable level. However, Bhutan faces a shortage in rupee reserves because its imports
from India outstrip its exports. Bhutan’s constitution requires that convertible currency reserves be maintained at a
level equivalent to 12 months of “essential? imports. Convertible currency reserves are built from loan/aid
proceeds and to a lesser extent, through tourism. The definition of essential imports was not clear until recently,
when a Task Force looking into the rupee shortage defined it as “sustenance of livelihoods and continuation of basic
economic activities in the country. On the sustenance of livelihood, food, household and medical items etc are
included. Basic economic activity does not envisage any expansion, but allows for the provision of raw materials,
replacement and spares for capital equipment.? The earmarking of reserves to meet the constitutional requirement,
when added to the reserves pledged to secure the State Bank of India overdraft facility and debt service due every
year, leave little room for selling convertible currency reserves to buy rupees.

2012 (Box 1). Recent policy actions by the RGoB and the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), have
resulted in the reduction in aggregate demand pressures. Evidence shows that the private sector credit
growth has slowed remarkably. The impact on balance of payments is expected with some delay. Fiscal
tightening has been put in place for the current fiscal year with a projected deficit of 1.6 percent (down
from 3.5 percent in 2011/12). As a precaution, the RGoB secured an increase in the line of credit from
Government of India (from Rs. 3 billion to Rs. 10 billion at 5 percent) and plans to use a SAARC
Currency Swap arrangement announced in May 2012.

12. Inflation has remained high, mostly reflecting price developments in India and to some extent
domestic demand pressures. Year-on-year inflation spiked to 13.5 percent in the second quarter of 2012
(Figure 1). Price increases were driven mainly by an increase in the food prices (18.4 percent), while
non-food price increases have also been high (10.7 percent). Bhutan’s inflation tracks India’s closely, as
the latter is the source of 80-90 percent of imports and its currency is pegged to the Indian rupee (Figure
2). While prices in Bhutan are largely influenced by developments in India, there is some evidence that
domestic demand pressures are also fueling inflationary expectations. For example, looking at the non-
tradables, house rents showed a rise in 2010/11 (11 percent) before moderating somewhat in the first half
of 2011/12. A wedge seems to have opened up with Indian inflation since the beginning of the year with
Bhutanese prices rising more, possibly because of rupee shortage fuelling profiteering by big traders and a
rise in transport costs.

13. Monetary policy contributed to overheating until early 2012, but measures adopted since
March 2012 have addressed it. Total credit continued to grow at rates well above 30 percent (year-on-
year) from December 2010 until March 2012, driven by a strong demand for housing and vehicles.15
Since March 2012, in response to policy measures by RMA, growth in credit to private sector decelerated
rapidly to 28 percent by end-May 2012 (Box 1). Month-to-month credit growth showed even sharper
decline to 10 percent (three-month moving average of seasonally adjusted data) by end-June 2012,
raising the likelihood of a credit crunch. While moderation in credit will cool the overheating, it needs
close monitoring and proactive management to prevent rapid contraction. Over time, the policy tools
introduced by RMA are expected to improve monetary transmission and allow interest rates – which have
generally been low and negative in real terms – to play a more important role in monetary policy.

  This creates pressure on the balance of payments – fueling demand for imports from India and adds to the rupee
shortage.
                                                                                                      5
                     Box 1: Rupee restrictions, credit and liquidity control measures
Faced with rupee shortage, the RMA adopted some emergency measures to enforce the existing foreign exchange
regulations more rigorously and added some new restrictions in the money and banking sector. With these in place,
the RMA also introduced several policy measures control credit growth.

Stronger enforcement
Rupee-denominated transactions. The following rupee-denominated transactions will be permitted subject to
documentary evidence: (i) Payments related to Government and public sector corporations; (ii) Payments for import
of capital goods, spares, raw materials and other inputs for industries (manufacturing and services); (iii) Payments
for import of oil and fuel products; (iv) Payments for medical supplies and equipment; (v) Payment for the import of
construction materials for approved housing constructions (by the Dzongkhag Authorities and Municipalities) as on
8th March 2012, by individuals/business entities; (vi) Payments for the import of goods excluding transport/vehicle
goods (except for public transport buses) by individuals/business entities etc.; (vii) Payments for education/training
and medical treatment expenses in India.

Foreign exchange surrender requirement. All export proceeds must be surrendered by exporters through the
banking channel within 91 days from the date of export.

Access to convertible currencies. With effect from May 4, 2012, the Annual Travel Scheme (US$3,000) facility will
be made available for collection from only the Bank of Bhutan’s exchange counter at Paro International Airport for
passengers with a boarding pass.

New restrictions
Access to rupee cash from commercial banks. Release of Indian Rupees in cash to Bhutanese nationals by
commercial banks (including rupee withdrawals through credit/debit cards and pre-paid cards) will be limited to Rs.
10,000 per day, with a maximum monthly limit of Rs. 50,000 per person if they have a citizenship identity card.

Non-Resident Foreigners’ accounts. Non-resident foreigners could not open any deposit accounts from 9th March
2012. All existing deposit accounts were closed by 15th March, 2012 under the following conditions – (i) all
accounts closed on or before 9th March, 2012 were paid in INR/BTN; (ii) term deposit accounts maturing after
March 9th, 2012 had the option to pre-mature by 9th March, 2012 or continue till maturity with no further renewals.
(iii) for those term deposits opting for the premature, payments were paid in INR/BTN. However, for those term
deposits opting for full maturity were paid only in BTN.

Private credit. In collaboration with the financial institutions, access to Indian rupees for the import of construction
materials for new housing and for personal transport vehicles was temporarily suspended.

Credit and liquidity control measures
The RMA has taken a number of steps since March, 2012 to address the rupee shortage by dampening credit growth
and the evolving liquidity position of the Banks. The RMA put in several measures to deal with credit growth,
which it had to re-calibrate to deal with liquidity squeeze that ensued as the foreigners closed their accounts and the
wholesale depositors withdrew their deposits in a sizeable manner to pay taxes and dividends. Currently, the
measures include: (ii) Increased risk weighting (150 percent) on loans in sectors that represent over 20 percent of
banks’ portfolios to be complied by end-2012; (ii)      Increased provisioning on NPLs in the sector on which the
bank has the greatest exposure; (iii) The introduction of a new Policy Rate, Short Term Liquidity Adjustment
Window facility (RSTLAW), and base rate; and (iv) a directive issued to NBFIs (insurance companies and the
NPPF) to discontinue lending activities from June, 2014; and (v) reduction in Cash Reserve Ration (CRR) to 5
percent by June 2012.

14. The recent widening of the central government’s deficit has been due to growing capital
expenditures. Bhutan has followed a prudent rule of meeting its current expenditures entirely out of
current revenues (excluding grants). However, capital spending rose sharply starting 2010/11 by 7
percentage points of GDP, resulting in a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent in 2011/12 ( Table 2). This is a 5-
percentage points of GDP swing during the 10FYP, which added to aggregate demand pressures. The

2012/13 budget commits to narrows the fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP, mainly through expenditure
compression and rationalization.

15. Off-budget hydropower activities contribute to aggregate demand during the construction
phase. Project spending was small during 2007/08-2008/09, with no major construction activity taking
place. However, with the beginning of the construction work for the two Punachu Hydropower Projects,
project spending has risen sharply since 2009/10. Projects are financed by India, with a large grant
component and the bulk of the material/equipment and labor also coming from India. However, some
portion of this spending spills over to the local economy through ancillary activities contributing to
aggregate demand. Once the construction phase is over, much of this pressure is expected to dissipate.

16. Although public sector debt is high and on the rise, this is mostly for commercially viable
hydropower projects. As of June 2012, public sector debt was estimated to be 75.8 percent, compared
to 63.9 percent a year earlier (Table 3).16 Of this, around 24 percent of GDP is owed to the multilateral
creditors and 51.1percent to bilateral creditors. The ADB is the largest multilateral creditor, while the

     Excludes state-owned enterprises debt for which comprehensive data are unavailable.

Government of India is the largest bilateral creditor. Before 2011/12, hydropower debt was twice the
non-hydropower debt. Most of the public debt is owed to external creditors, and domestic debt is
negligible. Debt service obligations rose since 2007-08, with the start of repayment for GoI financed
hydropower projects (Figures 3 and 4).

17. The external position has deteriorated since 2008/09, with strong demand for imports
outstripping exports. The current account deficit was 24.3 percent of GDP in 2010/11, compared with
10 percent in the previous year, as export growth was unable to keep pace with growth in imports –
particularly imports from India. Part of the increase in imports from India was related to the construction
of new hydropower projects and imports of fuel, but consumption-related imports also grew strongly. In
particular, there was a marked increase in imports of vehicles, which grew at 50 percent per year on
average during 2009-11, facilitated by easy credit. The overall balance of payments remained in surplus
in 2010/11 due to sizable grants and concessional loan disbursements. However, Bhutan’s balance of
payments position with India was in deficit, as the large capital and financial account surpluses with India
were insufficient to close the widening current account deficit. This has resulted in a shortage of rupees.

18. Faced with growing difficulties in financing transactions with India, the RMA has resorted to
expensive short-term liquidity facilities. By end-November 2011, the RMA borrowed Rs. 3 billion
from a line of credit from the Government of India at 5 percent and Rs. 8 billion at 10 percent from the
State Bank of India (SBI) through an overdraft facility. In December 2011, having reached its rupee
overdraft limits with the SBI, the RMA sold US$200 million from its convertible currency reserves. The
purchase of rupees also allowed the RMA to clear all outstanding borrowings from the SBI. However,
demand for rupees did not let up, and the RMA had to resort to the SBI overdraft facility again.

19. On the social front, poverty is declining, other social indicators have improved, but
malnutrition is persistent. Over the past decade, Bhutan has made progress in reducing poverty.
According to the US$1.25 a day international poverty line, the poverty rate declined by more than half
between 1990 and 2008. As a result, it is on track to achieve the MDG on poverty reduction. Meanwhile,
Bhutan has attained or is on-track to achieve many of the MDGs. In education, the net primary school
enrollment and primary completion rates are 92 percent and 90.2 percent, respectively (2009). Bhutan
has already achieved MDG of halving the proportion of people without access to improved water source
and sanitation facilities. In health, mortality rates of under-five children were reduced by about half (from
123 to 61.5) between 1990 and 2007. Infant mortality has also decreased from 90 to 40.1 per 100,000
live births over the period 1990-2007. The target of reducing it by two-thirds by 2015 appears feasible.
However, improvements in general wellbeing have not translated to better nutrition for children. More
than a third of children are stunted. The problem is particularly severe in the Eastern region, where the
prevalence of stunting is 42.8 percent. Chronic malnutrition can translate into lower potential for learning
and development of the next generation.

                                   B.      Macroeconomic Outlook

20. Bhutan’s growth outlook is favorable in the medium term, but its short-term prospects are
subject to downside risks. Growth is expected to remain strong, underpinned by the construction of
hydropower projects. Value addition in the hydropower sector is projected to rebound strongly, with new
projects being constructed and coming on stream. Non-hydropower sectors, in particular, manufacturing,
are also expected to perform strongly due to the commissioning of the Dungsum Cement Project (Table
4). Nevertheless, whether this growth scenario is realized hinges on the authorities’ persistence in
addressing the macroeconomic challenges. They are well aware of the implications of the rupee
restrictions, and intend to lift them once demand for imports is curbed through the macroeconomic policy
measures. Meanwhile, structural measures are also being considered to expand the economy’s production
base in the longer term, thereby reducing import dependence and creating domestic employment.

21. The 2012/13 Budget, endorsed at the National Assembly in June 2012, is a step in the right
direction. The budget envisages a reduction in the central government deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP,
from 3.5 percent in 2011/12, through expenditure compression and rationalization. In particular, the
budget allocation for capital expenditure is lowered sharply from 24 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 16
                                                     9
percent, with priority given to the completion of on-going works. No new activities are planned that
would spill over to the 11FYP (2012/13 is the last year of the 10FYP). Allocations for non-essential
current expenditure are cut, and the resulting savings are redirected towards spending on maintenance of
public infrastructure. Revenue is expected to decline sharply, mainly due to a projected fall in external
grants by 5 percent of GDP. The budget also projects lower domestic revenue, because of the higher
maintenance costs and investment requirements associated with the Tala Plant is likely to compress the
budgetary contribution from the electricity sector. To boost revenue and stem demand for imports for
India, the government proposed a number of new tax measures, but only the green tax measure of 20
percent on vehicles above 1800 cc and 5 percent for the rest was approved by the Parliament. The
revenue benefits from this measure will materialize only when the rupee restrictions on vehicles are lifted.
The budget deficit will be financed by the combination of external and domestic sources. However, the
consolidated fiscal deficit (central government deficit and hydropower deficit) is projected to widen
because of the increase in project spending. Hydropower spending is projected to rise significantly
because of the number of planned hydropower projects (Table 5). While hydropower project costs are
financed by grants and loans by the Government of India, there will be some impact on the domestic
demand.

22. Government debt is expected to rise further on account of borrowing for the construction of
new hydropower projects. Public debt has risen owing to hydropower project investment. After
declining to 64 percent by 2010/11, public debt is expected to rise to 96 percent of GDP by 2012/13 as a
result of investments in the hydropower sector. The interim 2012 debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
shows that most indicative debt thresholds are breached in the baseline scenario putting Bhutan at a high
risk of debt distress. The present value of public debt is projected to peak at 115 percent of GDP in
2014/15. However, risks are mitigated by the concentration of debt in commercially viable hydropower
projects, which account for more than half of total debt. Other mitigating factors are also important,
including Bhutan’s strong project implementation record and good governance, and India’s strong energy
demand growth.

23. The outlook on the financial sector remains favorable. The monetary measures put in place to
deal with the rising aggregate demand were discussed earlier. In addition, based on reported data, banks
are well capitalized and portfolio quality remains acceptable. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was
18.6 percent as of March 2012, in excess of the 10 percent prudential requirement. Asset quality has also
seen a generally improving trend over the past several years; however, there has been a recent
deterioration in 2011/12, with gross Non Performing Loans (NPLs) increasing by March 2012 from 7.7
percent to 8.7 percent and from 2.1 percent to 4.1 percent net of loan loss provisioning. According to
banks, most lending to the housing sector – the largest sectoral exposure of banks at 25 percent of total
loans – is for construction of rental properties in urban areas, and there is significant pent-up demand for
rental property due to urban migration. Moreover, banks indicate that they apply conservative loan-to-
value ratios (60 percent), although lack of data on real estate values makes this difficult to confirm. So
far, gross NPLs to the sector remain low, at just over 3 percent.

24. Overall, the current macroeconomic framework of Bhutanese authorities is adequate. Robust
growth prospects, a frugal fiscal stance, sustainable long-term public debt, broadly appropriate monetary
policy stance and precautionary foreign reserve management (including the Indian Rupees) lend
credibility to the macroeconomic framework. The Bhutanese economy has good potential to realize the
targeted 11 percent annual growth in the next three-years because of hydropower investments already
underway. Fiscal management has always adhered to the golden rule of containing current expenditures
below current revenues excluding foreign grants. The government has programmed to rein in fiscal
deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP on average for the next three years. Although the scope for additional
revenue mobilization remains limited in the run up to the elections in March 2013, the government has
managed to introduce a broad-based green tax on import of personal vehicles that could yield revenues
once the imports are allowed. The projected near-term rise in public debt is mainly to invest in
hydropower projects with guaranteed export purchase agreements; the long-term debt remains
sustainable. Despite the constraints of a monetary policy regime with a currency pegged to the Indian
Rupee, the RMA successfully neutralized the recent overheating of the economy by deploying several
monetary policy tools supplemented by temporary trade restrictions. The RMA has shown willingness to
recalibrate rapidly policy levers as the situation evolves. The RMA is managing foreign reserves with
goals of liquidity, safety and return (in that order) to maintain foreign reserves equal to one year of
essential imports – a constitutional requirement. Though Bhutan has adequate convertible foreign
currency reserves, the steady erosion of Rupee reserves proved problematic since December 2011. In
addition to introducing/enforcing foreign currency regulations (in addition to fiscl and monetary
measures), the RMA utilizes lines of credit with Government of India and overdraft facilities with the
State Bank of India and the Punjab National Bank to replenish Rupee reserves and plans to use the
SAARC currency swap arrangement as well.

25. Going forward, Bhutan needs to gradually reduce its reliance on foreign savings and diversify
the economy, which would help boost employment and strengthen capacity to earn foreign
currencies to support trade and development. The authorities are aware that past development
paradigm, that was successful in bringing the country to this point, may no longer be sustainable. These
changes will take time, but Bhutan needs to seize this opportunity to more realize its vision of gross
national happiness. The proposed DPC2 is aimed at supporting the long-term structural transformation of
the Bhutanese economy.

     III.   BHUTAN’S REFORM PROGRAM AND THE PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

26. The RGoB’s reform program, set out in the 10FYP, remains unchanged from what was
described in the DPC1 Program Document.17 The 10FYP was based on consultations with a range of
stakeholders, including the private sector and local government bodies across the country. The
overarching objective of 10FYP is to reduce headcount poverty from 23.2 percent in 2007 to 15 percent
by the end of the Plan period.18 To achieve this goal, growth needs to be sustained and the RGoB set
itself a target of 7.7 percent over the medium term driven by construction, electricity, and transport and
communication. The strategic priorities for the 10FYP are: (i) vitalizing industry; (ii) strengthening
national spatial planning; (iii) synergizing rural-urban development; (iv) expanding strategic
infrastructure; (v) investing in human capital; and (vi) fostering an enabling environment through good
governance. The DPC1 Program document highlighted elements of the RGoB’s overall reform program
that form the basis of this programmatic series covering FY2009/10 to FY2012/13. These areas were
chosen because the RGoB identified them as crucial at the start of the series. Because the DPC1
document describes these areas in detail, they will not be repeated here. Instead, this section will focus on
progress made in the reform areas supported by this DPC series.

17
  This section draws from the DPC1 Program document.

  See RGoB (2009). “Tenth Five Year Plan (2008/09 to 2012/13): Strategic Policy Perspectives and Dimensions
and Sectoral Objectives.?
                                                     12
(a)     Promoting government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public
financial management and procurement, and strong public administration

27. In a young democracy, the 10FYP sees good governance as cross-cutting issue to create an
enabling environment for development. The RGoB prioritizes the strengthening of the public financial
management (PFM) and procurement systems. To ensure better public service delivery and streamline
procedures, the RGoB is committed to use Information and Communication Technology. As a pre-
emptive measure, the RGoB aims to strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to promote
transparency and reduce costs of public service delivery.

28. Several reforms were undertaken to strengthen the fiduciary systems for public financial
management and procurement systems. Based on the findings of the PEFA report, the RGoB aims to
strengthen the PFM framework – focusing on areas such as predictability and control in budget execution,
and accounting recording and reporting that are in need of improvement. Meanwhile, the RGoB has also
made progress on adopting international standards for accounting and financial reporting by Bhutanese
companies – many of which are in the public sector. For competent financial reporting and transparency,
the RGoB wants to develop Bhutanese Accounting Standards in line with the International Accounting
Standards (IAS)/International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the public and private sector.
International consultants were hired to assist the RGoB in defining the standards and its implementation,
including advising the RGoB on the changes required in the necessary policy and legal frameworks to
harmonize the accounting and financial reporting requirements. Towards this objective, RGoB has
established an Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan (AASBB). A road map has been
prepared by AASBB towards the adoption of standards aligned to IAS/IFRS.

29. The RGoB also took steps to improve the transparency and efficiency of public procurement.
Building on the progress described in the DPC1 Program document, the RGoB aims to strengthen its
procurement systems based on the findings of the recently validated Use of Country Systems (UCS)
Assessment.19 Progress was made in implementing the short-term recommendations of the UCS
Assessment – which include the issuing a Procurement User’s guide, strengthening the Public
Procurement Policy Division (PPPD), establishing a PPPD website, creating an independent bid review
body, publishing contract awards immediately after award, and revising the Standard Bidding Documents
for goods and works.

30. The RGoB has embarked on an ambitious Government to Citizen (G2C) program to provide
services electronically to citizens in a timely fashion through community centers. The G2C service
program is likely to result in a significant decline in the travel time needed to access services in a country
with significant geographical barriers. The program is likely to be operational across Bhutan by
December, 2012 when all 205 community centers begin functioning. The program has defined
turnaround standards for some 72 individual services in key areas including: timber permits, security
clearances, civil registration services (births and death certificates, issuance of citizen identity cards,
household information records), and trade licenses among others. This program flows from the Integrated
Public Service Delivery System (IPSDS) initiative that conceptualized the idea of delivering services in a
simplified and integrated fashion across Bhutan. The IPSDS initiative was a prior action under DPC1; the
G2C Program transforms IPSDS into a project, supervised by the Prime Minister’s office and the
Committee of Secretaries which serves as its Board.

31. Although Bhutan outperforms its neighbors on Transparency International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index,20 it has taken proactive steps to further strengthen its Anti-Corruption legal

19
   This UCS assessment aims to introduce the use of national procurement systems for projects funded by the World
Bank.
20
   In 2011, Bhutan ranked 38th out of 183 countries with a score of 5.7.
                                                       13
framework. Given that Bhutan’s economic growth stems in significant measure from corruption-prone
sectors – such as hydropower and construction – the RGoB’s focus on anti-corruption is not misplaced.
Since the DPC1 document went to the Board, the RGoB took significant steps to strengthen its legal
framework by undertaking a United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) self assessment
and passing the 2011 Anti-Corruption Law, which takes into account many of UNCAC recommendations.
The ACC also further strengthened its own capacity to deal with corruption in 2012 by revamping the
rules governing asset declarations by public servants.

(b)    Fostering private sector development by improving the policy environment and facilitating
productive employment opportunities

32. The RGoB aims to diversify the economy through a vibrant private sector and provide gainful
employment to its citizens. A strategic priority of the 10FYP is to revitalize industry, for which it is
important to improve the investment climate by streamlining rules and regulations and modernize the
financial sector infrastructure. The RGoB is cognizant that Bhutan’s industrial and export base is narrow,
and is exposed to single market (India) and single commodity (hydropower) risks. Bhutan faces growing
challenges in creating suitable productive employment opportunities in the private sector for its educated
and semi-skilled population, and for the youth.

33. To provide the necessary framework for private sector development, the RGoB prepared an
Economic Development Policy (EDP) in April 2010 as a prior action under DPC1. The EDP sets the
agenda and the general direction for the development of the economy for the next 10 years by providing
incentives for promoting investments in areas prioritized by the RGoB. A number of policies and laws
are being formulated or reviewed to implement the EDP, including the business licensing policy,
simplification of industry (medium and large) application, streamlining environmental clearances,
development of informational e-portal, the mineral development policy, Public Private Partnerships
policy, the renewable energy policy, the micro small and medium enterprises policy, the consumer
protection bill, and the enterprise registration act. The Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) is
responsible for reviewing the implementation of the EDP, monitoring performance, making projections
about the future, and recommending appropriate policy measures. No meetings of ministries and agencies
of RGoB have yet been held to discuss the implementation status of various provisions of the Policy.
Meanwhile, the GNHC has requested UNDESA to assist in the review of the EDP in preparation for the
11th Plan. Moreover, the RGoB also aims to enhance Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to increase
employment, earn foreign exchange, and benefit from technology transfer. Updated FDI Rules and
Regulations have been prepared to implement the amended 2010 FDI Policy. The RGOB has also
prepared a Public Private Partnership (PPP) Policy to govern institutional arrangements for government
facilitation of PPPs and proposed an institutional framework for PPPs,21 expected to be submitted to the
Cabinet before the start of the 11FYP. The industrial infrastructure development policy (governing
economic zones) has also been drafted and is expected to be submitted through GNHC screening in the
next few months.

34. Bhutan has taken several steps to modernize its financial sector infrastructure. The RMA
established a Credit Information Bureau (CIB) in 2009/10, as a DPC1 prior action.22 This was done to
make the financial system more efficient and reliable by improving credit risk assessment, reducing
extraordinary amounts of collateral, lowering default risk, and enabling expansion of credit-based
lending. The CIB is now fully operational, incorporating information on 96 percent of consumer data and
42 percent of commercial data of all bank accounts as of February 2012 and generating an average of 100
reports per day and an average monthly income of Nu 800,000. Meanwhile, an Electronic Funds Transfer
Clearing System (EFTCS) was inaugurated in June 2010 in Thimphu and will be expanded to other

21
   This was also supported through technical assistance by the World Bank with funding from the Public Private
Advisory Facility (PPIAF).
22
   This reform was captured in the Doing Business 2012 report and Bhutan jumped from the 170th to the 126th rank.
                                                       14
regions. As of January 2012, Nu.37.40 million (US$750,000) worth of transactions were processed
monthly through the EFTCS – a 25 percent increase since September 2011. The system’s functionalities
include credits (salaries, dividends) and debits (utility bill payments). The coverage of EFTCS increased
from 22 to 37 institutions between March 2011 and January 2012, including the MoF and the Royal Audit
Authority, are using National Electronic Clearing System Credit to transfer of funds relating to salaries,
Provident Fund contributions, taxes relating to salaries, loan repayments, and TA/DA. The National
Pension and Provident Fund has also started disbursing pensions through this system. Future
functionalities under consideration include Initial Public Offering refunds and government taxes. The
RMA plans to draft a Payment and Settlement Systems Act, with technical assistance from the Reserve
Bank of India. To allow for interoperability of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and bank Point of
Sale terminals, the RMA launched Bhutan Financial Switch, a national card switch system in December
2011. The RMA has also made the National Electronic Funds Transfer System available to the public
since December 2011.23 The RGoB has also drafted a financial inclusion policy, with support from the
World Bank,24 which is set to be finalized by September 2012.

35. Meanwhile, the RGoB also aims to strengthen the institutional framework underpinning the
labor market. The 10FYP established the fight against unemployment as a key area of focus, and set a
target to bring unemployment down to 2.5 percent in the medium term. While still above the target rate,
unemployment came down to 3.1 percent (from 3.3 percent in 2010) in 2011, which is a welcome
downward trend.25 This was helped, in part, by improved labor and employment policies and regulations,
active labor market programs focusing on skills development using public private partnerships, and
enhanced intermediary services including labor market information and job counseling. An important
strategic initiative under the 10FYP is to improve employment conditions in the private sector through the
enforcement of the 2007 Labor and Employment Act and its regulations. To implement the Act, the
RGoB had approved 14 Rules and Regulations on Employment Conditions.26 To fully implement the
Labor and Employment Act, the RGoB issued two additional sets of regulations focusing on Occupational
Health and Safety in March 2012,27 which emphasize both preventive and protective measures to be
implemented by workers and employers with a particular focus on the important construction sector, but
also on the health and safety in any workplace. The RGoB has asked for World Bank help in building
capacity to implement these Rules and Regulations.

(c)         Expanding access to infrastructure in a sustainable manner

36. The RGoB recognizes that, for a small, landlocked economy like Bhutan, the expansion of
infrastructure is important. The development, expansion, and maintenance of rural economic and
communication infrastructure such as local markets, farm and feeder roads, irrigation schemes, electricity,
and communication centers will be undertaken, as they are vital for stimulating and sustaining a thriving
rural economy. Moreover, given the rapid projected pace of urbanization, enhancement of national urban
management capacity through institutional strengthening of various agencies and municipalities involved
in urban development is a 10FYP goal. Finally, the RGoB is committed to securing ecologically
balanced and sustainable development, while promoting economic and social progress. In recognition of
its environmental fragility, Bhutan has developed reasonably sound environmental acts, regulations,

  This system is a nationwide inter-bank fund transfer system that facilitates transfer of funds among individuals
and institutions.

   These include rules on minimum wage, provident fund, foreign workers’ recruitment, acceptable forms of child
labor, sexual harassment, leave, workers’ compensation, gratuity, worker’s associations, internal service, labor
inspection, grievance procedures, and penalties regulations.
27
   These Regulations relate to (i) Regulations on Occupational Health and Safety in the Construction Industry and
(ii) Regulations on Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare.
                                                              15
guidelines, and codes of practices. The RGoB also realizes the importance of having an effective and
robust disaster management and response system, and aims to move towards a proactive approach
through putting certain mitigation measures in place, having communities prepared, and providing an
effective response in case of a disaster.

37. The RGoB aims to promote institutions that help meet road sector targets. The 10FYP has an
ambitious road construction and expansion program – and this is justifiable given the topography of
Bhutan. An important target for 10FYP is to ensure that 85 percent of the rural population lives less than
half a day’s walk from the nearest road-head, up from 77.5 percent in 2005. The sector was guided by the
Road Act of 2004 and the Road Sector Master Plan (RSMP), which provides the strategic tool to guide
the development of road infrastructure over 20 years. In 2009, the RGoB published Guidelines on Road
Classification System and Delineation of Construction and Maintenance Responsibilities, which clarify
ownership and roles of various agencies as regards to planning and budgeting, implementation, and
maintenance. To reflect changes suggested by the road classification guidelines, the existing Road Act of
2004 was amended and submitted to the Parliament for adoption in 2012.

38. The RGoB also aims to foster urban development and strengthen municipal management.
Economic development is linked to rapid urbanization, with resulting challenges for Bhutan. The RGoB
has undertaken various measures to meet the growing challenges. Given the ongoing decentralization, to
create a more autonomous local government system, the RGoB has prepared the Local Government Act
(LGA) 2009.28 The RGoB has finalized and approved the Thromde (Municipal) Rules for the
implementation of the new LGA. These Rules give legal effect to the provisions of the LGA, and specify
responsibilities, procedures, functions, and revenue sources of the Thromde. Going forward, the RGoB
expects to implement these Thromde Rules, starting with measures like municipal budgets for Thimphu
and Phuentsholing City Corporations. A Thromde Finance Policy has been prepared and is being adopted
by the RGoB in 2012 to support the municipal reform towards more decentralized and accountable local
governments. Selected priority measures such as computerization of property tax records and municipal
asset registers are being implemented under the World Bank’s Urban Project.

39. The RGoB realizes the importance of having an effective disaster management and response
system, given its vulnerability to natural disasters. It is looking to move away from an ad hoc system,
with an ex-post rather than ex-ante funding mechanism in place. The preparation of a Disaster
Management Bill constitutes the central element of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework
(NDRMF). The Disaster Management Bill would strengthen the institutional framework for DRM in
Bhutan, with the formation of a National Disaster Management Authority. The enactment of the Disaster
Management Bill will empower the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) as the secretariat and
executive arm of the National Disaster Management Authority as well as the National Coordinating
Agency for disaster management. The draft Bill underwent review in a series of consultation meetings
and workshops with various stakeholders. It has been endorsed by the Cabinet during its 114th session on
October 4th, 2011 and submitted to the Parliament on November 7th 2011. The bill was deliberated and
endorsed by the National Assembly during its 8th session on January 20th 2012, and by the National
Council during its 9th session on June 19th, 2012. The Bill will be presented to a joint session of the
National Assembly and National Council for the final deliberation and enactment. The following
activities will be carried out following the enactment to operationalize the Disaster Management Act: (i)
Institutionalization of disaster management committees and working groups at various levels. (ii) Setting
up of financial arrangements. (iii) Drafting and finalization of rules and regulations to supplement the
Disaster Management Act and (iv) Establishment of Critical Disaster Management Facilities.

28
  The overall direction of urban development is provided by Bhutan’s National Urbanization Strategy (BNUS) of
2008, which emphasizes: (1) municipal reform towards more decentralized and accountable local governments; (2)
balanced regional development by creating urban hierarchy and identifying regional centers; (3) prioritization of
investments in the two major cities and regional centers; (4) environmental protection and cultural conservation; and
(5) capacity building of urban institutions.

        IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE ROYAL GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                    A.       Links to Bhutan’s Country Partnership Strategy

40. The World Bank’s program for the period FY11-14 is set out in its Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which is aligned with the RGoB’s 10FYP. The CPS has two broad areas of
engagement: (i) economic diversification, job creation, and financial inclusion to increase growth and
employment led by the private sector; and (ii) spatial planning and public services to enhance the living
standards and increase well-being. Cutting across these broad areas for engagement are two themes –
capacity building for good governance and environment. During several rounds of CPS consultations, the
RGoB has reiterated its request for continued support through budgetary operations.

41. As mentioned in the DPC1 Program Document, this DPC series directly supports the goals of
the CPS – both of which seek to support implementation of the 10FYP. More specifically, the first
DPC component on promoting government efficiency and effectiveness will contribute to the cross-
cutting theme on governance in the CPS. Improved budgetary processes, better fiduciary systems,
expanded e-governance, and stronger public administration will strengthen institutional capacity and
achieve better quality of services for citizens. The second DPC component on private sector development
aligns directly with the economic diversification and financial inclusion pillar of the CPS, and actions to
enhance employability and improve the policy environment for the private sector will contribute to the
corresponding CPS goals. The third DPC component on improving sustainable access to infrastructure
will support spatial planning and public services. Institutional strengthening in the roads and urban
sectors will ultimately help provide better access and quality infrastructure, while measures to promote
environmental sustainability and disaster risk management will contribute to better environmental
stewardship and improved sustainability of infrastructure.

                      B.      Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

42. The World Bank worked in close coordination with the IMF on this programmatic series. The
IMF and the World Bank staffs consult regularly on key macroeconomic issues and advice provided to
the RGoB. The staffs also collaborate on routine tasks such as the Joint Staff Advisory Note of Bhutan’s
10FYP (PRSP), the 2011 DSA, as well as the recent interim update of the DSA in 2012.

43. The World Bank is also coordinating with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in putting
together this operation. The ADB is planning a budget support operation in early 2013 totaling US$30
million under Asian Development Fund (ADF), which will be disbursed in two tranches over 2-3 years.
The ADB program would likely focus on fiscal and debt management – the latter drawing on the recent
Debt Management Reform Program prepared by the World Bank. The Staffs of ADB and the World
Bank have ensured that the areas for support under their respective operations complement each other to
maximize the development impact.

44. The World Bank maintains regular contact with other development partners as well, which is
made easy because of their relatively small number in Bhutan. For instance, progress under DPGs 1
and 2 was reviewed at workshop held in Bhutan in April 2008, which was attended by the main
development partners. These discussions were reflected in the focus areas for the DPFIS, which are
largely continuing under this DPC program. Discussions at the workshop also centered on sectors and
themes that could be supported by future operations. Additional donor consultations to discuss the new
reforms and the Bank’s program were organized in October 2008, June 2009, and June 2010. The latest
round of consultations was held in June 2012 with donors and civil society organizations to discuss the
policies and actions supported by the DPC2.

                                                    17
45. On specific reforms supported by this DPC series, the World Bank is working with
development partners. The World Bank, IMF, and United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
teams are supporting RGoB’s efforts to develop a sound multi-year fiscal framework and improve public
expenditure management. The Bank’s ongoing PFM work has undertaken comparisons of national and
international public sector accounting and auditing standards, and is moving towards alignment or
adoption of international standards of accounting and auditing in a phased manner, in collaboration with
other donors, including ADB. The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) has supported
the PEFA Assessment of the Bhutan’s financial management systems which forms the basis for further
PFM reforms, while Helvetas, UNDP, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have
participated in consultations around it. To strengthen procurement systems in Bhutan, the Bank and
DANIDA have collaborated on a series of procurement reform measures. The ADB has also collaborated
with the Bank’s procurement team to further the united approach to support the RGoB modernize its
public procurement system. The UNDP has supported the RGoB in preparing its Economic Development
Policy, which is reflected in this DPC program. The Bank has collaborated with the UNDP on the
Damage and Needs Assessment (DNA) following the 2009 and 2011 earthquakes in Bhutan.

                          C.      Relationship to Other Bank Operations

46. The proposed DPC2 seeks to support the World Bank’s investment operations by highlighting
policy and institutional changes that will contribute to some of the projects achieving their expected
results. The initiatives under the proposed DPC1 and DPC2, on macroeconomic/fiscal management and
fiduciary systems, will have cross-cutting impacts enhancing the effectiveness of public spending, as well
as include specific elements that will be central to the implementation of the procurement training project.
Several of RGoB’s efforts supported by DPC1 and DPC2 on private sector development will be important
to the Private Sector Development project, including the labor law, FDI regulations, and the cost of doing
business. The skills enhancement/employment component of the DPCs complements the objectives of
the Education Development Program, by focusing on employability of Bhutanese youth. Initiatives
supported under DPC1 and DPC2 on strengthening infrastructure — particularly road development —
will complement the Second Rural Access Project (RAP II), which focuses on helping residents of
beneficiary dzongkhags to utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and services. Policy reforms
supported under the urban development component support the policy objectives of the Second Bhutan
Urban Development Project (BUDP2).

47. The earlier Development Policy Operations (DPOs) have been complemented by technical
assistance, and this approach will continue. Several Institutional Development Funds (IDF) grants
support objectives of the DPC series. There was a deepening engagement on macroeconomic, fiscal, and
financial management issues, through IDF grants supporting capacity in these areas. An IDF grant on
Public Financial Management focused on building capacity within the RGoB for better expenditure
control and information, and enhancing technical capacity in internal and external audit. Another IDF is
assisting the development of the Multi-Year Rolling Budget/Public Expenditure Management System
(MYRB/PEMS), to monitor performance better. The RGoB, through the National Environment
Commission Secretariat (NECS), is also implementing an IDF Grant for Strengthening Institutional
Capacity for Implementation of Environmental Safeguards, with the aim of revising/updating the existing
environmental codes of practices and guidelines and developing new ones, improving capacity and skills
for decentralization of environmental clearances, enforcement and monitoring, training of trainers, etc.
To strengthen the recently-established Public Procurement Policy Division (PPPD), the Bank has
approved a three year IDF which aims to support the operationalization of this division. The Bank also
approved an IDF grant to strengthen the institutional capacity of the MoLHR to facilitate employment and
labor market entry of Bhutanese youth. In addition, the Bank team is leveraging technical assistance
funds from other sources. The RGoB has requested further IDF’s to help support the implementation of a
few DPC2 prior actions.
                                                    18
                                        D.      Lessons Learned

48. This operation builds on lessons from Implementation Completion and Results Reports
(ICRRs) of previous policy-based lending operations and their reviews by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG). This operation also benefits from the World Bank’s wider experience in
providing budgetary support.

   Leveraging policy-based lending with technical assistance and investment operations can be
    important for promoting key reforms. For instance, the satisfactory outcomes in ICRs of DPGs 1 & 2
    were, in part, due to the fact that they were supported by World Bank assistance for private sector
    development, education, procurement, and HIV/AIDS. Similarly, the DPFIS also benefited from
    World Bank projects in procurement, rural access roads, and private sector development. The current
    DPC series builds on this experience in several ways – leveraging on the Bhutan Urban Development
    Project II, private sector development project, and procurement work.

   Experience also shows that analytical work is important for building support for reforms within the
    government. Reform actions that are supported by specific background studies – as in the Investment
    Climate Assessment (ICA) work for private sector development reforms, the PEFA assessment for
    public financial management reforms, the Use of Country Systems (UCS) study for procurement
    reforms, and the Damage and Needs Assessment (DNA) for the disaster risk management reforms –
    have been welcomed by the government. This DPC2 builds on the PEFA, ICA, DNA and the UCS
    (see section E below).

   Previous evaluations also show that the World Bank needs to carefully assess the prospects for
    impact in sectors where other donors play much larger roles. For instance, in the power sector, other
    donors like the Government of India and the Asian Development Bank play bigger roles than the
    World Bank. As such, this DPC2 focuses on sectors where its small IDA lending envelope can have
    maximum impact.

   Institution and capacity building efforts are essential for success. Experience has shown that reforms
    have succeeded in Bhutan where adequate capacity either already exists, or was mobilized as a part of
    the deepening engagement in the area (such as in procurement). The proposed DPC2 takes that into
    account and has mobilized additional technical assistance to support government counterparts in their
    work. For example, the World Bank hired experts to provide technical assistance in formulating the
    Thromde Finance Policy and helped build capacity.

   In small countries like Bhutan, where government capacity is stretched, it is more productive for
    reforms to take place in a programmatic framework. This gives time for the government to pace
    itself and work towards the reforms in a phased and incremental manner. This DPC series contains
    two operations and moves reforms sequentially to preserve continuity of reforms. In between the
    operations, it is also important for the World Bank to remain engaged to support implementation of
    policy reforms through its advisory and lending activities.

   Identifying indicators to measure progress is difficult, especially in a country like Bhutan with limited
    capacity and data. The DPFIS experience also shows the difficulty in finding suitable indicators of
    progress, when attribution is difficult. This DPC series makes efforts to rely on quantitative and
    qualitative progress indicators that can be measured or assessed within the duration of the series.

                                        E.       Analytical Underpinnings

49. The proposed DPC2 benefitted from recent analytic work and knowledge gleaned from
broader World Bank engagement in Bhutan through investment projects and non-lending technical
assistance. The first policy objective of increased public sector efficiency and effectiveness was
informed by the 2010 Public Financial Management Accountability Assessment. In addition, the 2010
Use of Country Systems Assessment also helped design this operation. The second policy objective of
private sector development was based on the 2010 Investment Climate Assessment. The World Bank’s
engagement on labor issues using an IDF also helped inform this component. The third and final policy
objective on sustainable infrastructure is based on the World Bank’s engagement through the Bhutan
Urban Development Project. The Damage and Needs Assessment following the recent earthquakes
helped inform the Disaster Risk Management reforms. The macroeconomic section in this report draws
on the World Bank’s ongoing macroeconomic updates, IMF Article IV reports (various years), the
recently updated joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability analysis and the recently finalized World Bank’s
Debt Management Reform Program.

                                   V.        THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                          A.       Operation Description

50. The DPC series has three overarching development objectives. These are: (a) promoting
government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial management and
procurement, and strong public administration; (b) fostering private sector development by improving the
policy environment and facilitating productive employment opportunities; and (c) expanding access to
infrastructure in a sustainable manner. These objectives are closely aligned with the strategic priorities of
the 10FYP, and were formulated in consultation with counterparts in the RGoB, development partners
and civil society organizations.29

51. The RGoB’s reform program warrants financial and analytical response from the World
Bank. Even under normal circumstances, the strength of the RGoB’s reform plan and progress to date
would merit support from the World Bank. The current rupee shortage has exposed the difficulties in
macroeconomic management faced by small economies like Bhutan that undertake capital projects that
are large relative to the size of the economy. On the one hand, taking a long view of the Bhutanese
economy, these hydropower projects have a significant growth generating potential, raise the standard of
living, will earn foreign exchange, and will help integrate the Bhutanese economy into regional/global
economy. Therefore, Bhutan’s push to expand its hydropower sector by 2021 is understandable.
However, in the transition period, this will create problems for macroeconomic management. Under
these circumstances, Bhutan needs to undertake a mix of (i) macroeconomic policies that aim to stabilize
aggregate demand in the short term and (ii) structural policies that boost productivity and diversify the
economy in the medium to long term. This DPC series is trying to assist with both through the World
Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue, including for the Medium Term Fiscal Framework, and the structural
reforms it supports. This financial support complements the ADB operation planned over the next 2-3
years, with focus on fiscal and debt management.

52. Programmatic approach. The World Bank engagement is proposed as a programmatic series
consisting of two single-tranche operations supporting the RGoB’s reform agenda over 2009/10–2012/13.
The Bank and the RGoB teams designed the operations as a programmatic series to preserve continuity of
reforms, to leverage stronger policy actions, and to better monitor implementation of institutional
measures. A US$24.75 million DPC1 was presented to the Board in November 2010 using Bhutan’s

IDA15 allocation. This DPC2 operation – of US$36 million using Bhutan’s IDA16 allocation – is to be
presented to the Board in October 2012, to be disbursed against prior actions. These prior actions are
based on the six indicative triggers set out in the DPC1 document with modifications, as well two new
prior actions relating to strengthening governance and disaster risk management (Table 6).

                                                                        DPC2.

                          B.      Policy Areas for Support under DPC2

53. The proposed DPC2 supports specific policy measures within the RGoB’s overall program that have
been mutually agreed as critical to disbursement of funds (Annex 1). This section presents the individual
prior actions within the broad framework (described in Section III), which will form the legal basis for
disbursement of the proposed DPC2. The proposed DPC follows the good practice principles on
conditionality (Box 2).

             Box 2: The Proposed DPC and Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The proposed operation is closely aligned with the RGoB’s priorities set out in the 10FYP, and evolved
through a participatory process involving local governments and central agencies. The program chooses
those policy measures that the RGoB deems essential to the successful implementation of their program
while complementing other donor assistance.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The program has been developed to support the 10FYP and the reform matrix was developed in close
coordination with the RGoB. All missions have been held jointly with the RGoB counterparts, and aide
memoires have been prepared and agreed with the RGoB. In the RGoB, the coordination of external
assistance is systematically handled by the Ministry of Finance. There are regular donor meetings at the
technical level, and the broad DPC reform program — as well as individual elements in public financial
management, procurement, infrastructure, and private sector — has been discussed with relevant donors.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The accountability framework and mode of assistance (budget support) are customized to Bhutan’s
circumstances. Budget support is a response to the RGoB’s request, and builds on lessons from past
successful attempts to implement policy-based reforms. It takes into account the low share of budget
support in the RGoB’s overall external assistance. The triggers and prior actions were developed keeping
in mind the timings for disbursement, as requested by the RGoB.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The triggers and actions for the proposed DPC series represent only those actions that are deemed critical
for achieving the program’s development objectives. They are identified in close consultation with the
RGoB. Given the limited capacity in a small country, selectivity is particularly important. The DPC
series picks up specific actions (Annex 1) from the RGoB?s wider reform program for the disbursement
of funds.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support
Although monitoring and evaluation remains challenging, the RGoB is taking steps to strengthen this.
The Bank’s supervision plan, along with the indicators in the Policy Program Matrix provides a

                                                    22
framework in which to review progress. During the supervision phase of the operations, benchmarks will
be regularly evaluated and interim steps taken by the RGoB will be monitored.


                                      Proposed Prior Actions for DPC2

Component A: Promoting Government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public
financial management and procurement, and strong public administration

     i.   Prior action for DPC2 (1 of 8)

The RGoB authorizes the Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan to issue Bhutanese
Accounting Standards and to set criterion for phase-wise implementation of said standards by Bhutanese
companies.

Issue: The objective of this prior action is to ensure consistency and comparability of financial statements
prepared by Bhutanese companies30 for stakeholders to have more confidence in them and the companies,
in turn, can access international finance. As a background, Bhutan currently does not have clear
accounting standards and Indian Accounting Standards are often followed in practice. Because there are
no clear guidelines on the accounting standards, financial statements are inconsistent as evident in a
review of the financial statements of a sample of 22 companies. With the growing number of companies
and opening up of the economy, the RGoB wants to improve the quality of financial reporting by
following accounting standards that are aligned with International Accounting Standards/International
Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS). This is expected to lead to consistency and transparency in
financial reporting, improve access to international capital markets, enable benchmarking with global
peers, and attract foreign direct investment. Accordingly, to promote high quality financial reporting and
auditing standards that are consistent with international best practice,31 the Accounting and Auditing
Standards Board of Bhutan (AASBB) was established in May 2010, under the chairmanship of the
Auditor General of the Royal Audit Authority (RAA) and consultations were held with stakeholders
including the MoF, RMA, and members of industry groups. Given the shortage of qualified accountants
in Bhutan,32 which makes it difficult to adopt all measures simultaneously, the AASBB prepared a
roadmap for implementation of IFRS in three phases and linked the roadmap with concomitant measures
to build capacity. Of these, in the first phase, 18 standards have been identified for implementation with
effect from January 2013 – while the more complex ones will be implemented over the medium term
(Box 3). This DPC2 seeks to support issuance of Standards and the setting of criterion for their phase-
wise implementation.

Status: This prior action has been met. The RGoB authorized the AASBB on February 16, 2012 to issue
the accounting standards and to set the criterion for implementation of the standards in a phased manner
by Bhutanese companies. Accordingly, AASBB has decided to fully adopt the IFRS by 2021 in phased
manner and has developed Bhutanese Accounting standards (BAS, modeled on IFRS) for the interim
period. AASBB issued the notification for this on April 6, 2012. The said Bhutanese standards will be
adopted in a phased manner with 18 standards from January 1, 2013. For small and medium companies, a
separate set of standards has been issued which is modeled on IFRS for SMEs and will be applicable for

30
   The accounting and auditing standards being issued by AASBB will apply to companies in the public and private
sector. The Phase I Standards will apply to 33 large companies, which include wholly-owned large government
companies, financial institutions and listed companies. Of these 33 companies, 20 belong to public sector. Given
the large number of public sector companies, this prior action has been included under this development objective
although it will apply to the private companies as well and will therefore support the second development objective
of DPC2.

the period beginning January 1, 2014. To ensure legal compliance under the Companies Act of Bhutan,
the Registrar of Companies has initiated steps to amend the existing rules under the Companies Act to
mandate BAS in a phased manner. This is likely to be completed by October 31, 2012. The World Bank
is planning to use an IDF to help support the implementation of the Standards in Phase I.

                              Box 3: Phase-wise Accounting Standards in Bhutan
The AASBB has decided to adopt the IAS/IFRS in three phases, and plans to complete the process by 2019. Full
IFRS adoption is scheduled to happen by 2021. The phased approach ensures timely compliance with IFRS but is
also accompanied by significant building of capacity to implement the standards. This is particularly important in a
small country with limited capacity.

Phase I (2013-15) consists of 18 standards. These standards are: Presentation of financial statements; Inventories;
cash flow statements; Accounting policies, change in accounting estimates and errors; events after balance sheet
date; construction contracts; income taxes; property plant and equipment; revenue; accounting for Government
grants and disclosure of Government assistance; the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates; borrowing costs;
related party disclosures; consolidated and separate financial statements; earnings per share; interim financial
reporting; provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets; and operating segments.

Phase II (2016-17) consists of 9 standards. These standards are: leases; employee benefits; accounting and
reporting by retirement benefit plans; investment in associates; interests in joint ventures; impairment of assets;
intangible assets; investment property; and agriculture.

Phase III (2018-19) consists of 10 standards. These standards are: financial reporting in hyperinflationary
economies; financial instruments: presentation; financial instruments: recognition and measurement; first time
adoption of international financial reporting standards; share-based payment; business combinations; insurance
contracts; non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations; exploration for and evaluation of mineral
resources; and financial instruments: disclosure.

  ii.   Prior action for DPC2 (2 of 8)

In line with the short-term recommendations from the Procurement Use of Country Systems Assessment,
the RGoB (a) issues a Procurement Users Guide, (b) strengthens the PPPD, (c) establishes a PPPD
website, and (d) amends the Procurement Rules and Regulations 2009 to include (i) an independent bid
complaint review mechanism, (ii) requirements to publish contract award soon after award, and (iii)
revisions to the Standard Bidding Documents for Goods and the Standard Bidding Documents for Works.

Issue: The objective of this prior action is to increase the efficiency of public procurement. A Use of
Country Systems (UCS) Assessment was prepared that aims to introduce the use of national procurement
systems for all competitive bidding in World Bank supported countries where procurement standards are
deemed adequate. A baseline has been established from its findings. Around 50 percent of the sub-
indicators pass the requirements established by the OECD/DAC methodology and an additional 2 percent
of the sub-indicators pass with conditions, while 48 percent of sub-indicators fail to meet the required
conditions. The Assessment recommends actions for further strengthening of public procurement over
the short, medium and long term. For the purposes of DPC2, the RGoB is expected to implement the
priority short-term recommendations of the report and amend the Procurement Rules and Regulations
(PRR) of April 2009, where necessary (Box 4).

                          Box 4: Short-term Recommendations of the UCS Assessment

The World Bank Board approved the “Use of Country Procurement Systems in Bank-Supported Operations:
Proposed Piloting Program? in 2008 and the RGoB expressed interest in participating in this pilot program. To
establish a baseline for public procurement reform in Bhutan, an assessment of the national procurement system was
conducted in two stages. In stage I, the national procurement system was assessed with reference to international
best practice using the OECD/DAC methodology. The assessment focused on the legislative and regulatory
framework; the institutional framework and management capacity; the procurement operations and market practices;
and the integrity and transparency of the procurement system. Stage II determined whether the RGoB procurement
policies and procedures were consistent with those of the World Bank. Based on the findings of the assessment, a
World Bank validation mission agreed upon an action plan with the RGoB. This action plan includes short,
medium, and long term measures aimed at improving the public procurement system.

This DPC2 focuses on the short-term recommendations of the UCS assessment – some of which require
amendments to the Procurement Rules and Regulations, 2009. The short-term recommendations focus on the
following: (i) preparing a User's Guide to support procuring entities in executing procurements, which includes
detailed guidance on the contents of bidding documents; (ii) Improving the oversight framework by strengthening
the Public Procurement Policy Division so that it can play its regulatory and supportive role more effectively; (iii)
Establishing a website for the Public Procurement Policy Division; (iv) Modifying the relevant rules to include
independent bid complaint review as part of the mandate of the Tax Appeals Board with the Public Procurement
Policy Division serving as its secretariat for bid complaint reviews; (v) Including specific requirements to publish
contract award information immediately after contract award; and (vi) Revising the Standard Bidding Documents
for Goods and Works to include certain provisions. Short-term recommendations iv-vi require amendments to the
2009 Procurement Rules and Regulations.

Source: World Bank (2010). “The Kingdom of Bhutan: Draft Report on the Assessment of the Public Procurement
System (Stages I and II).?

Status: This prior action has been met. A User’s Guide has been prepared and was issued on June 15
2012. The Public Procurement Policy Division has been strengthened with 7 full-time staff compared to
3 in 2008. A website has been created with help from an IDF Grant, but needs further improvement to be
officially launched. An Independent Review Body has been established on June 15 2012 to review
complaints on bids. The 2009 Procurement Rules and Regulations have been amended to publish
contract awards. The Standard Bidding Documents for Goods and Works have been revised and the
Procurement Rules and Regulations amended accordingly, and an amendment to this effect was issued on
June15, 2012.

 iii.   Prior action for DPC2 (3 of 8)

Parliament adopts a new Anti-Corruption Law and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) adopts new
Asset Declaration Rules.

Issue: The objective of this prior action is to improve the ACC’s ability to prevent, investigate and
prosecute corruption. Bhutan outperforms its neighbors on Transparency International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index. However, given that Bhutan’s economic growth stems in significant measure from
corruption-prone sectors, the RGoB has taken a proactive stance on curbing potential corruption. Bhutan
had a 2006 Anti-Corruption Law, which needed strengthening in several ways by: highlighting the
preventive function of ACC; clarifying what constitutes a corruption offense and a range of penalties
attributable to each one; authorizing the use of investigative techniques prescribed by United Nations
Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC); establishing a framework of cooperation with other countries
to deal with corruption; and delineating powers of ACC with respect to seizure or freezing of assets
during investigation, as well as confiscation after prosecution. The ACC needed to take further measures
to strengthen its own ability to tackle corruption by revamping the rules governing asset declarations by
public servants by: replacing the impeachment of public servants with a fine-based system that is more
practical to implement; taking a more targeted approach to asset declaration; introducing a transparent
                                                         25
formula for calculating disproportionate assets; laying out the functions of Asset Disclosure
Administrators (ADAs) in agencies; authorizing the Royal Audit Authority with auditing compliance with
asset declaration requirements across agencies and allowing for the destruction of declarations after ten
years; and making filing easier online. This DPC2 supports the RGoB’s move to pass a comprehensive
Anti-Corruption Law and the new Asset Declaration Rules that address the concerns mentioned above
(Box 5).

         Box 5: Improvements in the 2011 Anti-Corruption Law and the 2012 Asset Declaration Rules

The new Anti-Corruption law of 2011 contains sweeping changes compared to Bhutan’s first piece of anti-
corruption legislation passed in 2006 and now repealed. Critical changes in the new Anti-Corruption law, 2011
include:

        An expanded code of conduct for the Anti-Corruption Commission, including vesting it with the power to
discipline its own staff for violations.

       The emphasis is on the preventive functions of the ACC in addition to its investigative and prosecutorial
roles. Measures include defining a legal framework for administering asset declarations and debarment processes;
empowering the ACC to work with the private sector to develop ‘Business Codes of Conduct’; and allowing the
ACC to ask private individuals to file asset declarations when required.

         The new law also clearly sets out what constitutes a corruption offence and the range of penalties
attributable to each one. Previously corruption offences were scattered across the Bhutan penal code and several
offences laid out in UNCAC were not included in the old law. Key changes include: (i) A Wider Definition of
Bribery: While the previous law did make giving and accepting a bribe a corruption offence, the new law also
includes ‘promising’ a bribe as well as ‘soliciting’ one, as per UNCAC standards. In line with UNCAC, the new
law also penalizes bribery involving a foreign public servant, including employees of international organizations.
(ii) Active Trading in Influence: The law makes using influence to obtain “work, employment, contracts, or other
benefits from a public agency? an offence,? as recommended by UNCAC. (iii) Money Laundering: Concealing,
converting, or transferring the proceeds of illegally obtained wealth is now treated as a corruption offence in Bhutan.
(iv) Bringing the Private Sector within the Ambit of the Law: The new law contains several sections that cover
“commercial bribery? (this includes bribery among private individuals) as well as fraud in bids, auctions, and
contracts with public agencies (covered under the earlier law but in less depth). It also includes a section making
embezzlement of funds, securities, and property in the private sector an offence.

        The new law also includes a key section authorizing the use of special investigative techniques
recommended by UNCAC, including allowing the monitoring of suspicious consignments, permitting informers to
give or receive a bribe, conducting physical surveillance and undercover operations, wire-tapping, and intercepting
communications (with the authorization of a court).

         A major change in the new law is the establishment of a framework for cooperation with other states to
address corruption, including tracking property, freezing, and confiscating illegally acquired assets, creating joint
investigative panels, and allowing for the transfer of criminal proceedings and sentenced persons from one
jurisdiction to another. This new chapter fulfills in large measure the requirements that UNCAC imposes on
signatory states with respect to cooperation in the fight against corruption.

        Finally the new law lays out in greater detail the power of the ACC with respect to seizure or freezing of
assets during investigation, as well as confiscation after prosecution. It also strengthens the provisions relating to
witness and informer protection, another requirement of UNCAC.

Moreover, the ACC has also taken further measures of its own to strengthen its ability to tackle corruption. In line
with the 2011 Anti-Corruption law, it has revamped the rules governing asset declarations by public servants. The
Asset Declaration Rules, 2012 are a marked improvement on those issued in 2008 in the following respects: (i) The
2008 Asset Declaration rules imposed the extreme penalty of impeachment on Schedule 1 public servants who failed
to declare their assets. In practice, however, the legislature was loath to carry out this sanction as a result of which
no public servant was penalized for not filing a declaration. The 2012 Asset Declaration rules replace impeachment

                                                          26
with a fine-based system that is more practical to carry out. (ii) In addition, the 2008 Asset Declaration rules
required all public servants regardless of rank to file asset declarations. The 2012 Asset Declaration rules take a
more targeted approach: Unscheduled public servants in the grade of P5 or above need to file an asset declaration
unless they belong to a vulnerable area of public administration (e.g., a procurement unit). All high level (Schedule
1) public servants continue to file asset declarations without distinction. (iii) The 2012 Asset Declaration rules also
introduce a transparent formula for calculating disproportionate assets; a fifty percent or greater increase in the
assets of a public servant in a given year triggers an inquiry by the head of the agency concerned and a referral to the
Anti-Corruption Commission if necessary. (iv) The 2012 Asset Declaration rules clearly lay out the functions of
Asset Disclosure Administrators in agencies, and task the Royal Audit Authority with auditing compliance with
asset declaration requirements across agencies, and allows for the destruction of declarations after ten years.

Status: This prior action has been met. The RGoB has moved to strengthen the framework for addressing
corruption by passing a comprehensive Anti-Corruption law in 2011 that incorporates many of the
standards set out by the UNCAC and effectively prepares for Bhutan’s accession to UNCAC in the near
future.33 This new law is an improvement over the 2006 Law by addressing the shortcomings mentioned
above. The 2011 Anti-Corruption law is comprehensive and addresses the problems described above in
the 2006 Law. In addition, the newly adopted 2012 Asset Declaration Rules are an improvement over
those issued in 2008 and address all areas mentioned above.

Component B: Fostering private sector development by improving the policy environment and
facilitating productive employment opportunities

     iv.   Prior action for DPC2 (4 of 8)

RGoB approves revised Foreign Direct Investment Rules and Regulations.

Issue: The objective of this prior action is to increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into
Bhutan as envisaged under the 10FYP. To achieve the objectives set out in the EDP,34 the RGoB has
adopted the FDI Policy 2010 to encourage FDI in both manufacturing and service sectors. The objectives
of the FDI policy are to: (i) support private sector development; (ii) generate employment; (iii) promote
capital inflows; (iv) foster transfer of skills and appropriate technology; (v) expand market access and
international trade; and (vi) enhance foreign currency earnings. The FDI Policy has the following
features: (a) lists priority sector activities which shall be fast tracked for approval and clearances; (b)
allows FDI in other activities with specified maximum foreign investors’ equity and minimum project
costs; and (c) lists activities where FDI will not be permitted. The Policy was finalized after extensive
consultations with stakeholders, and the FDI Committee that worked on it has representation from the
private sector. Both the Bank and the IFC provided advisory services on the formulation of the FDI
Policy. As a next step, the RGoB issued rules and regulations to help support the implementation of the
Policy, which is supported under the DPC2 (Box 6).

Status: This prior action has been met. In February 2012, the Ministry of Economic Affairs shared the
draft Rules and Regulations for implementation of the FDI Policy with stakeholders – including the Bank
and IFC. After several rounds of consultations, the draft was finalized and adopted by the RGoB in mid-
July 2012.

  To provide the necessary framework for economic development, the RGoB adopted an Economic Development
Policy (EDP) in April 2010 as a prior action under DPC1.

                                     Box 6: 2012 FDI Rules and Regulations

The 2012 FDI Rules and Regulations seek to implement the 2010 FDI Policy.

         The FDI Rules and Regulations set out the following: sectors and size of investment; currency of
investment; collaboration and franchise; company incorporation; subscription; debt equity ratio; lock-in period;
foreign exchange and borrowing; repatriation of dividends and investment capital; expatriate employment, work
permits, visas and dependent cards; taxation; land for FDI business; incentives and exemptions; and protection of
intellectual property rights.

        They also provide the details of: eligibility for registration of FDI business; the FDI registration
application; FDI Registration certificate; FDI business approval process; sector licenses; rejection of business; FDI
Register; amendments, suspension or cancellation of FDI business.

       The Rules and Regulations also specify: the composition of the FDI Facilitation Committee; Project
Approval Committee; the powers of the Department and its immunity; disposal of investment; dispute settlement
mechanism; appeals mechanism; monitoring and reporting of FDI businesses; penalties for violations etc.

  v.    Prior action for DPC2 (5 of 8)

RGoB approves two regulations on Occupational Health and Safety for (a) the Construction Industry and
(b) other sectors.

Issue: The objective of this prior action is to improve working and employment conditions in the private
sector, which is an important goal in the 10FYP. Improving the working conditions in the private sector
is becoming increasingly important to attract particularly young Bhutanese to jobs outside the historically
preferred public sector jobs. Until 2007, when the RGoB approved the Labor and Employment Act, there
was no labor market legislation in Bhutan. To implement the Act, the RGoB has approved 14 Rules and
Regulations on Employment Conditions, which was a measure supported by the World Bank’s DPFIS.
To fully implement the Act, the RGoB had planned on issuing eight additional Rules and Regulations,
focusing on Occupational Health and Safety. There were some delays in developing these remaining
Regulations as they are highly technical in nature and needed further refinement and consultation. It was
finally decided to collapse the eight remaining Rules and Regulations on Occupational Health and Safety
into two volumes. This is not a dilution of the initial discussion under this DPC series, but a re-grouping
into Occupational Rules and Regulations for the (i) construction industry and (ii) other industries. These
Rules and Regulations emphasize both preventive and protective measures to be observed and
implemented by workers and employers to ensure their safety, health, and welfare and protect them from
work-related risks. The World Bank supported these efforts through an IDF. The DPC2 seeks to support
the adoption of the two remaining sets of rules and regulations on Occupational Health and Safety.

Status: This prior action has been met. The two remaining Rules and Regulations on Occupational
Health and Safety (in the construction industry and other industries) were adopted by the Ministry on
March 7, 2012 and came into effect from May 1, 2012. The RGoB has asked the World Bank to help
train staff so that these standards can be better implemented.

Component C: Expanding Access to Infrastructure in a Sustainable Manner

 vi.    Prior action for DPC2 (6 of 8)

RGoB submits the new Road Bill to the Parliament.


                                                         28
Issue: The objective of this prior action is to improve road network planning and maintenance following
the revised road classification system. Reforms in the roads sector were introduced into development
policy lending in Bhutan, starting with the DPFIS to exploit synergies with investment lending
operations. A key sector strategy under the 10FYP is to formulate a comprehensive plan for strategic
infrastructure development. As a first step towards strengthening the policy framework in the roads
sector, a measure supported by the DPFIS was for the RGoB to prepare and publish Guidelines on the
Road Classification System and Delineation of Construction and Maintenance Responsibilities, which
clarify ownership and roles of various agencies as regards to planning, implementation, and maintenance.
These guidelines were adopted in 2009. This, in turn, necessitated changes in the Road Act of 2004. This
DPC2 supports the drafting and presentation of the revised Roads Bill to the Parliament with a view to
improving planning and implementation of the road sector plans and programs.

Status. This prior action has been met. The Ministry of Works and Human Settlements drafted and
shared the revised Road Act with all stakeholders, including the World Bank. The revised Roads Bill was
submitted to the Parliament.

vii.    Prior action for DPC2 (7 of 8)

RGoB adopts the Thromde (Municipal) Finance Policy (TFP).

Issue: The objective of this prior action is to provide a financially sustainable policy framework for the
delivery of public services by municipalities (Thimphu, Phuentsholing and other Class A Thromdes).
The World Bank hired an international expert to provide technical assistance for drafting the TFP and
bringing it in line with international standards. The TFP aims to assist the Thromdes to establish sound
financial management practices, strive towards financial sustainability and self-reliance. Municipalities
will collect all the taxes, charges and fees as stipulated in the Local Government Act (LGA), as well as
receive development grants. They will adopt measures to improve budget implementation and municipal
financial management. With the approval of the TFP, the RGoB will begin implementing selected
priority measures, with particular focus on Thimphu and Phuentsholing. In fact, selected priority
measures from the TFP are already being implemented with support from the municipal finance and
management component of the ongoing Second Bhutan Urban Development Project. These include:
design and implementation of the system for digitization of property tax records in Thimphu and
Phuentsholing Thromdes; computerization of municipal asset register; and drafting the strategy for
municipal accounting reform and a policy note on internal controls. This DPC2 supports the adoption of
a TFP in Bhutan.

Status: This prior action has been met. The TFP was adopted in mid-July, 2012. Selected priority
measures from the TFP are being implemented in the Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes under the
World Bank’s Urban Project and will be replicated in the other two thromdes when they are ready.

viii.   Prior action for DPC2 (8 of 8)

RGoB submits the Disaster Management Bill to the Parliament.

Issue: Bhutan is prone to multiple natural hazards like earthquakes, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods forest
fires and landslides. Although the loss of life has been minimal, these disasters often impose significant
costs in terms of damaged infrastructure and cultural assets that draw tourists. Although recovery work
was carried out immediately after all the disasters, it was often ad hoc. To make the disaster risk
management and response program more systematic and streamlined, the RGoB plans to enact Disaster
Management legislation. The drafting of a Disaster Management Bill was initiated in 2007, drawing on
the existing principles in the National Disaster Risk Management Framework, 2006. The draft bill has
undergone a number of reviews through a series of consultation meetings and workshops with various

                                                   29
stakeholders including: (i) District Administrations, Ministries and Agencies including the High Court
and the Office of the Attorney General; (ii) International experts; (iii) Deputy Speaker and other members
of the National Assembly, and the Legislative Committee on environment and urban development.
Several presentations were made on the Bill to the Cabinet. This DPC2 supports the drafting and
presentation of the Disaster Management Bill to the Parliament.

Status: This prior action has been met. The draft Bill was presented to the Parliament on November 3,
2011 after being approved earlier by the Cabinet on October 4th 2011. The National Assembly has since
approved it on January 20th 2012, and the National Council on June 19, 2012. The Bill will now be
presented to the joint session of the Parliament for final enactment.

                           VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                 A.      Poverty and Social Impacts

54. Overall, the poverty and social impacts of the key policies supported by this programmatic
series are expected to be positive. No negative impact is anticipated.

 The first policy area helps improve public sector efficiency and effectiveness, which will have
  direct positive social effects. There is a growing agreement that quality of public spending affects
  poverty. Pro-poorness of public expenditure in Bhutan is indicative of the scope for the poor to
  benefit from government budget. Spending (current and capital) on education and health account for
  25 percent of budgeted expenditure in FY 2012-13. In addition, agriculture sector spending 12
  percent of budget) also benefits the poor whose livelihood depends – close to 80 percent of the poor -
  on agriculture in the rural areas. Actions supported by this programmatic series relate to bolstering
  fiduciary systems for public financial management, improving transparency and efficiency of public
  procurement, and strengthening public administration. Such actions are expected to result in
  transparent use of public resources, including crucial social sector expenditures. These actions are
  also expected to result in improved service delivery in all sectors. The municipal finance reform
  under the planned DPC would help decentralize revenue and expenditure functions making the
  authorities more accountable to the local poor. Finally, improvements in governance are also crucial
  for entrepreneurial decisions on long-term investments, growth and poverty reduction in an economy.

 The second policy area aims to foster private sector development and generate employment.
  The actions supported by this programmatic series aim to create an enabling environment for private
  enterprise; enhance access to credit to create a vibrant private sector; strengthen the institutional
  framework that underpins the labor market; and improve employability of job-seekers. Access to
  credit has been limited for all but for those in poorest quintile had only one-half the access of the
  richest. In urban areas most poor have indicated that improvements in labor and employment creation
  are a welfare priority for public action for improving their welfare. Reforms that aim at creating jobs
  through development of a vibrant private sector and enabling better skill matches will have direct
  social benefits because of enhanced employment opportunities. The enforcement of the Labor and
  Employment Act through supporting Rules and Regulations will remedy the institutional void and
  provide basic protection to all workers. Moreover, by limiting child labor, the Act will protect poor
  children – a group where child labor is most prevalent. The increased access to and quality of
  training programs that cater to low-paid workers will enhance labor market opportunities of these
  workers. The urban poor rate vocational training facilities more than twice as important compared to
  the non-poor. Better guidance for jobseekers, particularly via enhanced job-matching services, will
  help young people to find jobs faster, and to ensure better job matches (including enabling higher
  wages). Occupational health and safety rules and regulations will provide better working conditions
  for all workers.

                                                   30
 The third policy area aims to expand access to infrastructure in a sustainable manner. Actions
     supported in this area include promoting institutions to help meet road sector targets, fostering urban
     development and municipal management, and promoting environmental sustainability. The rural
     poor have highlighted road infrastructure and bridges besides electrification to be the most important
     welfare priorities that will improve their living conditions. Actions to improve infrastructure
     availability will directly help poor and remote communities to access basic services and markets.
     Infrastructure investments are expected to greatly enhance productivity and competitiveness and
     stimulate new businesses and create new jobs, while enriching the quality of life for all Bhutanese.
     Measures to improve urban management/finances will help alleviate the costs of agglomeration, that
     fall disproportionately on the poor. Bhutan, located in seismically most active zones of the world, is
     susceptible to multiple natural hazards such as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods in the north and flash
     floods and land-slides in the rest of the country. The incidence of poverty is higher in most of the
     eastern and southern dzonghkhags ranging from 29 percent to 53 percent – with nearly a third of the
     country’s population living in these districts.35 The 2009 earthquake which inflicted close to US $100
     million in losses and damages hit the eastern part of the country.36 The poor tend to live in more risk
     prone areas and are less able to afford self-insurance mechanisms to cope with natural disasters. The
     measures to improve disaster risk management under the proposed DPC will mitigate the risk for
     these vulnerable poor.

                                      B.       Environmental Aspects

55. Bhutan has accorded a high priority to environmental conservation and sustainable
development. Bhutan’s constitution, the 20 year perspective plan (Bhutan 2020), the 10FYP, and the
National Environment Strategy, all enshrine the concept of sustainable development. Projects or
developmental activities are not permitted in protected areas. All development proposals are subject to
environmental assessment as required by the Environmental Assessment Act (2000) and Regulation for
the Environmental Clearance of Projects and Regulation on Strategic Environmental Assessment (2002).
The RGoB has made progress in strengthening environmental considerations by enacting the National
Environment Protection Act of Bhutan (NEPA 2007), an umbrella environmental act. Building on
experience, Bhutan is also in the process of revising Environmental Act, Regulations, and the Application
for Environmental Clearance Guidelines as well as Environmental Codes of Practices.

56. The RGoB’s reform program highlighted above is expected to improve institutions for
environmental practices. Reforms of environmental regulations will clarify mandates, roles, and
responsibilities. Revised Application for Environmental Clearance Guidelines and new environmental
quality standards will improve environmental mainstreaming. A web-based information management
system that is under preparation will enhance availability of data.

57. All development proposals are subject to environmental screening and assessment processes
and procedures which result in environmental management plans that incorporate specific
recommendations for mitigating potential negative impacts. The NECS, the designated Competent
Authority and District Environmental Officer are responsible for issuing environmental clearances and
monitoring. At present NECS monitors ambient air quality at four locations, and carries out annual
compliance checks by reviewing compliance with environmental standards as well as with the terms and
conditions included in the environmental clearance. Surprise or unannounced checks may also be carried
out. Protected areas and forest protection/conservation measures are strictly enforced. At various
projects, compliance checks are also carried out by the district environmental office or by the designated

competent authority. Although there is limited capacity, the practice of compliance checking has
contributed to improving environmental management practices and performances.

58. No major environmental concerns are noted for the first two themes supported under the
DPCs. Measures to promote good governance and effective public spending are unlikely to have
negative environmental consequences, and are expected to be environmentally neutral. Potential
environmental concerns of encouraging greater employment through fostering private sector dynamism
include the risk of increased pollution from industries, and lower health and safety of the workers. The
proposed Rules and Regulations on Occupational Health and Safety are expected to address health and
safety concerns. To minimize, mitigate, and manage the risk of increased pollution, the RGoB will ensure
that environmental standards are not lowered and environmental due diligence is maintained in all private
sector investments, including FDI. The FDI Policy incorporates international best practices, to ensure
that environmental standards are met. All FDIs are subject to Bhutan’s stringent environmental
requirements.

59. The potential environmental concerns related to access to infrastructure are more important.
However, it is to be noted that infrastructure expansion is part of the RGoB’s 10FYP regardless of this
operation. By supporting environmental sustainability, the DPC series actually mitigates those concerns.
Adverse environmental impacts of DPC2 are expected to be minimal, since the RGoB is committed to
applying strict environmental guidelines. In the roads sector, the Department of Roads (DoR) has gained
considerable experience in Environmentally Friendly Road Construction (EFRC) during implementation
of RAPI and RAPII, and the approach is being mainstreamed to all road construction activities. In urban
development, only limited environmental impacts are expected from the expansion of municipal services
in the designated local areas, and proposed activities are unlikely to have adverse impacts on natural
habitat and forest resources. In fact, activities supported under the proposed BUDP2 are likely to
contribute to improving environmental conditions of cities. Project design includes provision of a
wastewater treatment plant and an Environmental Management Plan that supports specific measures to
mitigate relevant, though minor, impacts that are likely to result from the project activities — for example
slope disturbances and erosion, air quality and noise issues during construction, labor and labor camp
issues, etc. Building on the ongoing RAP II experiences, BUDP2 also proposes to use Country Systems
on environmental safeguards.

60. However, there is room for strengthening the environmental management in Bhutan. The
Bhutan Country Environmental Safeguard Review, the Equivalency and Acceptability Reports,37 and
Bhutan Country System Evaluation-Environmental Safeguard38 make similar recommendations for
strengthening environmental management system in Bhutan. These include reforms in policies
(legislative framework) and institutions as well as need for capacity strengthening. As noted earlier, the
RGoB is gradually revising existing policies/ legislations, implementing some capacity strengthening
measures such as orientations and trainings within few projects, and National Environmental Commission
Secretariat is slowly moving towards more decentralized environmental enforcement by deputing
environmental officers to District, and by planning to establish four regional environmental offices in near
future. However, these efforts do not seem to be guided by a longer-term country-plan and hence appear
to be ad hoc or an isolated activity. And there are many recommendations which are yet to be
implemented. In the given context, RGoB needs to be encouraged in preparing country-plan with
resource allocation that provides guidance for time-bound implementation of the recommendations made
for strengthening Bhutan’s environmental management system.

                       C.      Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation

61. The Department of Public Accounts (DPA), Ministry of Finance, will be responsible for overall
implementation and monitoring of the DPC program. The RGoB has already established an inter-
ministerial group of officials, headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, to provide overall
coordination for the DPC process. This group has worked with the Bank team since DPOs were first used
in Bhutan and is therefore familiar with Bank procedures. The Bank team will supervise the project by
monitoring actions and reviewing implementation progress of the proposed operation. The Policy
Program Matrix of the proposed operation will provide a results framework that describes expected
outputs/outcomes, as well as indicators by which to gauge progress and monitor interim steps.
Implementation Support Missions will be undertaken at regular intervals, in consultation with the RGoB.

62. Monitoring and evaluation remains challenging, as significant data gaps and uncertainties are
still being addressed. The National Statistics Bureau (NSB) of Bhutan has prepared a National Statistics
Development Strategy (NSDS) with the support of the World Bank Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
Building to improve the coordination and strengthen the capacity of the Bhutan Statistical System (BSS)
to meet users’ data needs. The NSDS provides a framework and action plan that aim to align the
statistical development strategy with wider poverty-focused national development programs and
strategies. The NSDS is consistent with Bhutan’s overall development vision, and will lead to better
monitoring of development outcomes under the upcoming DPC program. In parallel, the Bank is also
working with the RGoB to further support statistical development through technical assistance.

                                       D.      Fiduciary Aspects

63. The World Bank team has been engaged in public financial management issues, through an
extensive TA/capacity building program with oversight agencies, supervision activities on
investment projects, as well as the DPC support to RGoB’s reform program, as described above.
While several challenges remain (including the timeliness of accounting and reporting, the monitoring of
financial performance, the effectiveness of internal audits, and the execution of other control functions),
the core elements of an adequate financial management system are largely in place, including publication
of the budget. Progress is also being made in strengthening the capacity of the accountability and
oversight institutions, and establishing the necessary legal underpinnings needed to ensure that the
financial management and transparency demands arising from the increased revenues and spending
expected over the coming years are met.

64. The overall fiduciary framework is adequate to receive the proceeds of DPC2. The positive
trajectory of improvements in financial management stems from RGoB’s commitment to: (a) strengthen
the legal framework; (b) enhance institutional capacity and internal control framework; (c) improve the
financial management information system, and (d) strengthen the oversight of public finances. Together,
these actions are aimed at increasing accountability and improving the timeliness, quality, transparency
and reliability of the RGoB’s accounting and reporting functions. These positive steps, as well as the
RGoB’s demonstrated focus on results and strong commitment for continued PFM reforms, provide a
satisfactory basis for proceeding with the proposed budget support operation.

65. The IMF has not carried out a Safeguards Assessment of the Royal Monetary Authority
(RMA), Bhutan's Central Bank. As part of the appraisal for DPC2, the audit reports and published
annual financial statements for the last two financial years FY10-11 were reviewed by the World Bank.
The auditors have issued an unqualified report and the auditors are the Royal Audit Authority. The
accounts and audits were compiled and conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and
auditing standards. Based on the audit reports and the satisfactory track record in the operation of special
(designated) accounts in several IDA-financed investment operations in the past, which have been held in

                                                    33
the RMA, it was concluded that the Bank has reasonable assurance that the control environment for
foreign exchange at the RMA is satisfactory.

66. In procurement, external donors have looked favorably on the national procurement system.
The UCS Assessment to follow uniform procurement procedures highlights a number of areas which need
to be further improved, and together with the Bank and other development partners, efforts are underway
to harmonize the use of Bhutan’s fiduciary (including procurement) and safeguards systems. As noted
above, there is a deepening engagement on procurement issues, and the RGoB has moved forward on key
items of their reform program, including: (a) revising the procurement manual (including drafting and
issuing standard bidding and request for proposal documents); (b) creating a central Public Procurement
Policy Division; and (c) improving capacity through procurement training (improving implementation of
rules and facilitating decentralization of procurement functions). Overall, the procurement risk can be
gauged as medium, but in partnership with other donor agencies, the Bank team is working with the
RGoB to continue moving forward on fiduciary reforms.

                                 E.      Disbursement and Auditing

67. The process is unchanged from what was described in the DPC1 program document. Once the
credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the RGoB will submit to the IDA an application
for withdrawing the proceeds, provided that IDA is satisfied with the progress achieved by the
Government in carrying out the Program and with the adequacy of the country's macroeconomic policy.
IDA will disburse the US dollar proceeds of the credit in one tranche to the Government Consolidated
Fund (Budget Fund) Account of RGoB maintained with RMA after which the disbursed foreign currency
will be converted within five (5) business days to local currency and made available to finance budgeted
expenditures of RGoB. Transactions and balances of the account will be promptly and fully incorporated
into the Government’s accounting records and financial statements. The government will confirm to the
Bank within 45 days of disbursement, the receipt of these funds and its credit into the Government
Consolidated Account of the country (including the date of receipt, exchange rate applied to convert the
Credit proceeds into Bhutanese Ngultrum and name/number of the government’s bank account in which
the funds have been deposited). The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of the Debt
Management Division, Department of Public Accounts, MoF.

68. Disbursement of the credit proceeds would not be linked to specific purchases. However, the
RGoB would not use the credit proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank’s standard negative
list which includes expenditures on military hardware and environmentally hazardous goods. If any
portion of the credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Financing Agreement,
IDA shall require RGoB to refund the amount to IDA.

                                  F.      Risks and Risk Mitigation

69. No major risks that are likely to derail the reforms are identified. However, there are some
risks that can affect implementation progress — but mitigation measures are also in place.

 Macroeconomic risks. There are several risks, with mitigating factors.

        (i)     The main risk is that the aggregate demand pressures could linger resulting in persistent
        rupee shortage because of high off-budget hydropower expenditures and capital spending by
        state-owned enterprises. While these expenditures are fully financed by India or other
        development partners, the risk is that they could boost ancillary private sector activities, which
        could add to the rupee shortage in the gestation period. Mitigating factors include: recent
        monetary and fiscal tightening; a calibration of capital spending by the RGoB based on foreign
        grants or loans; and commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination between
                                                    34
        Ministry of Finance, the RMA, in consultation with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced by
        quarterly review of macroeconomic performance. The expansion of the existing line of credit
        with the Government of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should help ease
        pressures on the rupee.
        (ii)     Recent rapid credit growth in recent years has increased financial sector vulnerabilities.
        Mitigating factors include actions by RMA to adjust prudential regulations and norms – as done
        recently – to help curb large exposures to some sectors. Periodic stress tests by the Banks should
        also help monitor risks.
        (iii)    The interim Debt Sustainability Analysis (2012) shows Bhutan to be at a high risk of debt
        distress. Risks are mitigated because public debt is sustainable in the long term and debts are
        concentrated in the commercially viable hydropower projects, which account for half the total
        debt. Other mitigating factors include Bhutan’s strong project implementation record and good
        governance, and India’s strong energy demand.

 Capacity risks. The preceding DPOs identified risks related to technical capacity constraints and put
  forward some mitigation measures, including the provision of appropriate technical assistance to
  support the RGoB in implementation of the reforms. In addition to technical capacity, high-level
  managerial capacity is also in short supply. To some extent, familiarity with World Bank procedures
  and continuity of key counterpart officials will help mitigate this risk. As in the case of the earlier
  DPOs, the design accounts for capacity constraints through selectivity and limiting the number of
  prior actions. It will also seek to leverage technical assistance resources.

 Political risks. Changes in government priorities and working officials could affect the relevance
  and implementation of the program. The upcoming elections next year could give rise to populist
  pressures and put further stress on the fiscal/external situation. Sustainability is helped by ownership
  of the reform program by the current government (and civil service). The DPC program is a response
  to a request by the RGoB, which is on board with the reform program supported by the proposed
  DPC series as anchored in the RGoB’s own 10FYP. Key counterpart officials have not changed, and
  the inter-ministerial group of officials steering the implementation have already had experience in
  satisfactorily implementing the earlier DPO program.

1.   Bhutan’s growth has remained robust, but the current account deficit has widened.

    Bhutan’s economy has expanded at a robust pace driven by the hydropower sector developments. GDP
     growth is estimated at nearly 8 percent in 2011/12 (from 8.5 percent in 2010/11), and is projected to reach
     12.5 percent in 2012/13 due to the acceleration in hydropower-related construction. Inflation has risen,
     reaching 13.5 percent in 2012Q2, with both food and nonfood components accelerating. Bhutan’s
     medium term outlook is favorable, as growth should remain strong at around 8–9 percent over the
     medium term, driven by developments in the hydropower sector, manufacturing, and domestic services.
    The current account deficit has widened to an estimated 23 percent of GDP in 2011/12 driven in part by
     strong imports related to the hydropower sector, but the overall balance of payments deficit was 5 percent
     of GDP due to sizable grants and loan disbursements. Strong growth in domestic demand has fueled the
     demand for Indian rupees (since about 80 percent of Bhutan’s imports are from India), contributing to a
     rupee shortage. Convertible currency reserves, however, are broadly adequate (US$723 million in July
     2012).
    Challenges in the banking sector caused by high credit growth have come to the fore. While credit growth
     has remained high at 26.2 percent year-on-year in June, it has moderated since March—contracting in
     sequential terms in June—as a result of tight liquidity and policy measures (see below). Loan
     concentration, particularly in real estate/construction and personal loans, is significant. Interest rates,
     albeit low, have started to increase. Financial stability indicators are generally adequate, but concerns
     about a prospective deterioration in asset quality have intensified as nonperforming loans (net) have risen
     to 5.9 percent from 3.1 percent of total loans a year earlier.
2.   Current policy settings are broadly appropriate, and overheating pressures are being addressed.

    Monetary conditions need to continue to be recalibrated to ensure that prospective credit growth remains
     in check and liquidity conditions are appropriate. The Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan has taken
     appropriate steps to address high credit growth and improve its ability to manage liquidity, particularly
     with the introduction of the policy rate and base rate as well as liquidity adjustment facility, though the
     policy rate has been set at a low level. Financial sector supervision should be strengthened and prudential
     tools should continue to be used proactively. Greater financial intermediation in recent years may have
     increased systemic vulnerabilities stemming from rapid credit growth.
    Fiscal policy has generally been prudent, but the widening of the fiscal deficit in 2011/12 has contributed
     to overheating. The budget deficit, estimated to have reached 4.3 percent of GDP, has led to greater
     demand for imports, putting pressure on the demand for Indian rupees and exacerbated the rupee shortfall.
     Strong commitment to the 2012/13 budget deficit target of 1.6 percent of GDP is welcome, as current
     expenditure declines as a share of GDP on the back of spending restraint and tax revenue is expected to
     improve slightly. While public debt is sustainable over the long term, the risk of debt distress stems from
     the possibility of shortfalls in aid-based foreign financing. Public debt has increased significantly since
     2009/10 as a result of investments in the hydropower sector and is projected to exceed 93 percent of GDP
     in 2014/15, putting Bhutan at high risk of debt distress. However, risks are mitigated by the concentration
     of debt in commercially viable hydropower projects, which account for nearly two-thirds of external debt.
                                                     53

      The rupee shortage reflects a structural imbalance in Bhutan’s economy, but overheating has also
       contributed. The spending on hydropower projects in the pipeline and volatile exports to India (due to the
       strong seasonality in electricity generation) continue to contribute to volatility in net rupee inflows. While
       the hydropower projects are financed by rupee loans and grants, ancillary private sector development
       (particularly construction) and aid inflows have fueled imports. However, loose aggregate demand
       policies (high credit growth and a widening of the fiscal deficit) have also contributed to the balance of
       payment pressures. Measures to curb credit growth are expected to alleviate the rupee shortage and fiscal
       restraint will also help.
