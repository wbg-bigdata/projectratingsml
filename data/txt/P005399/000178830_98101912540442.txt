I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The objectives of the proposed BNDE-IX project are to support
Government objectives of industrial development in Morocco namely:
(i) improving the efficiency and fostering competitiveness of existing
industries; (ii) promoting and diversifying manufactured exports; and
(iii) encouraging increased private investments.
1.02     The proposed project provides for a loan of US$70 million to BNDE
for (i) a traditional line of credit of $56 million with the objective of
providing funds to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of industrial
projects through 1981-83; (ii) a pilot component of $14 million to finance
the foreign exchange cost of export-oriented industrial projects.
1.03     The BNDE-IX loan follows the previous loan to BNDE by the Bank
(Loan 1428-MOR, US$45 million) which became effective in December 1977, and
which is now essentially fully committed. The loan would finance mainly
BNDE's traditional industrial projects satisfying, in particular, a minimum
economic rate of return. The pilot export component is designed to improve
BNIDE's promotion and financing of export-oriented projects. BNDE will
develop and test special procedures to identify and select a limited number
of such projects from its pipeline for financing under the proposed loan,
and such projects would also be specially supe.tseA to provide useful
feedback data to prepare BNDE for a possible furtlher Banik loan focussing on
the financing of projects designed for export-oriented industries.
Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR)
1.04     The relevant PPAR is No. 1805, dated November 23, 1977, covering
the fifth loan to BNDE (Loan 736-MOR). The Completion Report forming the
basis for the PPAR was prepared at the same time as the appraisal of the
eighth loan to BNDE (Loan 1428-MOR). Points stressed in the PPAR such as
the need for realistic interest rates, and the dangers inherent in financ-
ing large public sector projects in which BNDE's influence on project
design is marginal, had been taken into account in BNDE VIII and are also
fully reflected in the preparation of BNDE IX (paras. 3.08, 3.09 and 4.28).

II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Performance and Constraints
Performance
2.01     In order to redress its rapidly deteriorating external financial
situation, the Government initiated an interim Austerity Plan (1978-80).
The Plan curtailed the growth of large capital intensive industries and
developed an industrial policy more adapted to the objectives and limited
resources of the country: continuation of economically justified long-term
investments (cement and sugar for local market; phosphoric acid for
exports); development of the manufacture of intermediate and capital goods;
strengthening of the industrial exports policy; industrial decentraliza-
tion; and the promotion of SSI for employment creation. At the same time
the Government reassessed its industrial development strategy which had
previously been based on investments in large capital intensive and mainly
public sector enterprises, and on a policy of import substitution for
consumer and intermediate products. Investments decreased substantially,
imports of manufactured goods (mainly intermediates and capital goods)
dropped by 15% in volume in 1978-79, the growth of manufacturing slowed
down to 4.5% p.a. in those years, and the growth of employment deceler-
ated. Fxports of manufactured goods increased in volume at about 17% p.a.
in 1980; as compared with 10% p.a. during 1973-77, contributing to a reduc-
tion in the deficit of the balance of payments from 17% of CDP in 1977 to
an estimated 8%A: in 1980.  Textiles and chemicals emerged as significant
export industries with food processing, which has traditionally exported
about 7% of its production; these three sectors account for about 90% of
manufacturing exports. The share of manufactured exports in total exports
increased from 23.6% in 1975 to 38.5% in 1979. The export potential for
manufactured goods will be more fully developed under the new 1981-85 Plan
(para. 2.05).
Constraints
2.02     There are several constraints that still limit the possibilities
of growth of the manufacturing sector: the balance of payments deficit
remains substantial, and limits increases in imports of equipment and raw
materials for industry, resulting in under-utilization of capacity; the
pervasive lack of well-trained technicians and foremen in manufacturing;
and the current incentive system (para. 2.09).
2.03     Foreign investments have been limited as a result of the moroc-
conization policy introduced in the early 70's, administrative delays, and
the shortage of skilled labor, even though guarantees are provided for the
transfer of dividends and the repatriation of capital. The incentives of
the Investment Code (duty exemptions on imported equipment, 2% interest
rebates on long and medium term BNDE loans to manufacturing, and income tax



- 3 -
exemptions) have not encouraged industrial enterprises to select labor
intensive processes, and the exports incentives (tax exemptions on import-
generated profits, and lower interest rates on short-term export credits)
have been insufficient to offset the negative impact of protection on the
price of local inputs and the relatively higher profitability of the
domestic market.
B. The 1981-85 Plan
2.04     General Objectives and Strategy.  A rapid rate of population
growth (over 3% p.a.) and a high level of unemployment (9.7% in 1980)
require an acceleration of the growth of output and employment. The Plan
targets a GDP growth of about 6.5% annually, which would allow an annual
increase in consumption of about 2.5% per capita in real terms and an
annual growth of employment of 3.7%, i.e. slightly more than the projected
3.3% annual growth of the labor force during the period. To achieve this
objective while overcoming the severe foreign exchange and savings con-
straints of the past few years, the Plan emphasizes export-oriented growth
with a projected real growth of exports of 8.5% p.a., and a major domestic
savings effort. However, the large volume of investments, estimated at DH
110 billion in 1981 prices, to support this strategy means that external
financing requirements will remain substantial over the 1981-85 period.
2.05     The Industrial Sector.  Industrial investment is projected to
total DH 20.9 billion (19% of total investments) during 1981-85 and gene-
rate a growth rate of 8.4% p.a. in industrial value added, increasing
industrial employment by 5.3% p.a. The 1981-85 Plan for industry gives
first priority to the increase of industrial exports, as without such
exports Morocco could not continue importing the raw materials and equip-
ment goods it needs without further destabilizing its balance of payments.
Under the 1981-85 Plan, investments in export-oriented projects, including
manufacturing, would total about DH 11.6 billion (55% of total projected
investments) of which DH 10.7 million are for large projects for phosphate
derivatives in which Morocco has a marked competitive advantage. Exports
of industrial products are projected to grow by 13.3% p.a. and their share
in total exports should continue rising, reaching 45% by 1985 compared to
38.5% in 1979.
2.06     The other major objectives for industry in the new Plan are (i)
the promotion of labor intensive small and medium scale industries (12% of
total industrial investment or DH 2.6 billion); the Bank is supporting this
effort through the Second Small Scale Industry project (SSI-II), presented
to the Board in July, 1981; and (ii) the selective development of engineer-
ing industries (15% of total industrial investments or DH 3.1 billion).
The recent review of the engineering industries by the Bank 1/ should

further help to develop this subsector where imports represented 60% of
total manufacturing imports in 1977.
2.07     Bank Support.  The Bank supports the Plan's objectives and would,
through the proposed project, the SSI-II project, other supportive action
to industry, and its sector work help the Government reach these objec-
tives. In addition, a number of measures to be taken to strengthen
exports, to reform the incentive system for industry, and to improve the
procedures for project selection and evaluation, project tendering and
product standardization were agreed upon during recent discussions on
industrial policy in Morocco. Financing for some of these measures is pro-
vided under the SSI-II project.
2.08     Concerning export promotion, the recently created Centre Marocain
de Promotion des Exportations (CMPE), assisted by the International Trade
Center (ITC) in Geneva, should become the central institution for the pro-
motion and the development of exports. ITC has proposed a 3-year (1982-84)
assistance program to CMPE to be financed by UNDP.
2.09     A revision of the incentives system (Protection, Investment and
Export Codes) will be undertaken by the Government after a series of
studies to assess the current system and to recommend appropriate changes,
are completed by the end of this year; these studies, supported by the
Bank, have been in progress since 1979. They will serve as a basis for
rationalizing the protection and price structure, and for recommending new
incentive systems. Government recommendations for reformulating the struc-
ture of protection and of the incentive codes are expected in the first
quarter of 1982, and the promulgation of a new Export and Investment Code
is scheduled for the end of 1982, while the completion of a gradual reform
of the protection structure and tariffs is envisaged by mid-1983. The new
Codes are expected to reduce administrative delays, and the various biases
that exist presently between sectors and between firms. They are also
expected to offer more effective incentives to foreign investors to award
subcontracting contracts to Moroccan firms, and encourage transfers of
technology particularly needed by the engineering industries.
C. Investment Demand in Manufacturing and BNDE's Role
2.10     The new Plan estimates the amount of investments in the manufac-
turing sector only (excluding OCP 1/) at DU 10.2 billion (US$2.0 billion)
in 1981-85, 80% of which in the private sector and 20% in Government
sponsored projects (sugar mills, and a steel rolling mill in particular).
Besides its own direct lending activity, BNDE plays a major role in the
distribution of medium-term loans by commercial banks to the industrial

sector. Medium-term loans for industry, initially extended by commercial
banks, may be rediscounted with the Central Bank (BdM) but only if
appraised and approved by BNDE. During the 1974-78 period BNDE has been
instrumental in providing financing for 45% of all industrial projects
approved under the 1973 Investment Code, for 24% of total investment costs
of all industrial projects, of which 16% consisted of BNDE's direct loans
and 8% of rediscountable loans extended by commercial banks and approved by
BNDE. BNDE will continue to have a major responsibility in the financing
of manufacturing investments, and BNDE's approvals forecasts for 1981-85
show that BNDE will provide $92 million/year financing for the manufactur-
ing sector, of which $60 million in the form of direct BNDE loans, $31.5
million in rediscountable medium term loans, and $0.5 million in BNDE's
equity participations. This $92 million compares to total average invest-
ments projected (excluding OCP) of US$408 million per year; as a result,
in 1981-85, BND)E's share in the financing of the manufacturing sector
(excluding OCP) should remain close to the 24% level achieved in 1974-78.
However, besides the rediscountable loans and the SSI investment program to
be carried out mainly by commercial banks, the value of investments in
manufacturing (excluding OCP) to be financed by BNDE itself through direct
lending would increase from 16% in 1974-1978 to about 20% in 1981-85,
reflecting BNDE's financing of a larger number of industries. This
increase reflects a somewhat ambitious program for BNDE, in view of the
need to put greater emphasis on the quality of project appraisal in order
to more carefully select projects to reduce the future risks of arrears,
and to improve the current level of profitability. It also suggests that
BNDE needs an increasing technical and institutional assistance in order to
keep up its key position as the major source of financing for the manufac-
turing sector, and the only financial institution authorized to provide
industrial projects with contractual long term financing under the 1973
Investment Code. Under the proposed Bank loan, BNDE would receive over a
30-month period (mid 1981-end 1983) about US$20 million annually, or about
33% of its projected direct annual lending requirement for manufacturing.
2.11     In line with the 1981-85 Plan orientation to give high priority
to the increase of manufactured exports BNDE, under the proposed project,
would have to allocate a minimum of US$l0 million or 20% of the loan amount
to export-oriented projects. 1/ Total investment in manufacturing for
export-oriented projects (excluding OCP) would total DH 763 million or
US$153 million during 1981-1984 ($38 million/year), mainly in textiles and
food processing (see Annex 2) and BNDE could be expected to finance these
projects with an annual amount of US$9 million 2/. The export loan com-
ponent of the proposed project (US$4 million p.a.) would therefore provide
44% of BNDE's projected needs for financing export projects during the
1/ See definitions in para. 5.08.

projects, in line with the average percentage of financing in manufac-
turing projects provided in 1974-78.

commitment period of the proposed loan. The financing of export-oriented
projects is a practically new activity for BNDE, and BNDE must develop its
identification and appraisal capability in this field (see Chapter IV). As
of September 1980, BNDE's tentative pipeline of 8 export-oriented projects
totalled US$18 million in investment costs, with a total direct financing
requirement of US$5 million from BNDE.
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
3.01     Morocco has a well developed financial sector.  It consists of
fifteen commercial banks, five specialized institutions, and two savings
banks, which are controlled by the Banque du Maroc (BdM), Morocco's Central
Bank.  Medium- and long-term financing is provided to private investors
mainly by three of the specialized institutions; the agricultural credit
bank (CNCA), the housing and tourism bank (CIH), and the industrial bank
(BNDE), all of which have received Bank loans. There is also a capital
market at the Casablanca stock exchange where shares of private companies
are listed and traded, but its role is limited (less than 300,000 shares
traded in 1979) and has been declining (volume of shares traded declined by
75% between 1975 and 1979).
A. Impact of the 1978-1980 Austerity Plan
3.0?     Late in 1977, the Government recognized the need to bring public
consuraption, investment, and imports under an increased control to avoid a
liquidity crisis. To restore the balance between investment and savings,
several deflationary measures were taken in 1978. Public capital expendi-
tures were curtailed by limiting Government reliance on both Central Bank
advances and foreign loans with maturities of less than ten years; short-
term credit by commercial banks to the private sector was tightened; and
interest rates on time deposits were increased to stimulate domestic
savings, the low level of which is a serious weakness of the Moroccan
economy.
3.03     As a result of these actions and other austerity measures, the
Moroccan economy entered a recession cycle. The industrial production
index did not rise between 1978 and 1979, and capital expenditures declined
(in current prices) by 27% in 1978 and 13% in 1.979. Preliminary data for
1980 seem to indicate, however, a turnaround in both production and invest-
ment trends in the manufacturing industry.
3.04     To curb inflationary pressures, the Government limited the growth
of short-term credits to 10% in 1979, but freed the growth of rediscount-
able medium-term credits and of loans to exDorters. The results did not
meet the Government's expectations, because short-term credits granted by
the banking system increased by 13% in 1979 while medium-term ereditg



decreased by 2/; the same undesirable pattern, but more pronounced, was
observed during the first ten months of 1980. The credit squeeze worsened
the traditional poor liquidity of the Moroccan commercial banks, leading
them to rely considerably more on the Central Bank rediscount and on the
interbank short-term money market, where interest rate reached 10.5% in
late 1979. This situation did not ease in 1980 and, for the first time
since 1975, the Central Bank raised its basic rediscount rate, from 4.5%
to 6%.
*                               B.  Interest Rates and Cost of Capital
3.05     The Government determines interest rate ceilings on both deposits
received and loans granted by financial institutions in Morocco. The
interest rate structure was overhauled on October 1, 1980 in consultation
with the IMF; the new structure is detailed in Annex 1. Interest rates
were increased on the average by one-half percent on term deposits to
attract more savings, and lending rates were also raised by 1-2% because of
higher inflation and increased cost of borrowing for financial institutions
(para. 3.07). This followed a previous raise in interest rates on term
deposits in mid-1978. Term deposits increased by 36% in 1978 and 24% in
1979, and the share of deposits maturing beyond four months in the total
rose from 61% in 1977 to 65% in 1979. The recent restructuring is expected
to continue this trend.
3.06     Cost of Resources.  The cost to the commercial banks of local cur-
rency resources varies widely depending on their maturity: sight deposits
yield no interest, except for Moroccan workers abroad on repatriated sav-
ings (3% p.a.), and insurance companies (4% p.a.); short-term deposits
yield from 4% p.a. for one-month deposits to 9% for eighteen-month
deposits, and there is no ceiling for deposits maturing beyond eighteen
months. Cost of rediscount facilities at the BdM ranges from 3.5% for
commercial paper for agriculture to 5% for medium-term paper, while the
basic rediscount rate is 6%. Local currency bonds carry interest rates up
to 10% p.a. and can be issued only by specialized financial institutions
(CIH, BNDE, CNCA) and large public enterprises. The cost of directly
contracted foreign exchange resources is not regulated by the Government
and thus reflects international rates, although the Government influences
the choice of borrowed currencies, and indirectly their cost, because it
bears the exchange risk.
3.07     Lending Rates.  For the first time since 1975, lending rates were
raised across the board in October, 1980. The maximum rates charged by
commercial banks on rediscountable loans were increased from 8% to 9% p.a.
for short-term loans, and from 8% to 10% p.a. for medium-term loans. BNDE
is now charging a single rate (12% p.a.) on all its loans regardless of
maturity, instead of 10% for medium-term loans and 11% for long-term loans
as was the case until October 1980.



- 8 -
3.08     Effective Cost of Borrowing.  In spite of this rate restructuring,
the effective cost of capital for industrial borrowers is 10% p.a. regard-
less of maturity. This is because all BNDE-financed industrial projects
approved under the 1973 Investment Code are eligible for a 2% per annum
interest rate rebate. (The same applies to Bank-financed SSI subloans with
a maturity of more than seven years because their interest rate is pegged
to BNDE's.)
3.09     Interest rates have, however, been positive in real terms in most
recent years and are expected to remain positive given projected inflation
rates. Inflation remained moderate through 1976 because of an array of
price controls and subsidies, which shielded domestic prices against rapid
changes in international price levels. Inflationary pressures, however,
developed in 1977 and prices as measured by the cost-of-living index rose
12.5%. Austerity measures imposed in 1978 slowed down the inflation rate
to 9.7% in 1978, 8.3% in 1979, and 9.4% in 1980. Over the commitment life
of the proposed project (from 1981 through 1983), nominal and effective
rates (12% and 10%) are expected to be positive compared to projected
inflation rates averaging 8-9% p.a.
C. Financial Intermediaries for Financing Industry
3.10     The Commercial Banks.  At the end of October 1980, the fifteen
commercial banks had total assets of DH 20.5 billion ($4.1 billion).  The
degree of concentration is high: two banks (BCP and BMCE) accounted for
44% of total assets at the end of 1979, and five other banks (BCM, BMCI,
CDM, SGMB, and iMICB) accounted for another 43%.  The banking network
totalled 543 branches at the end of 1979, but its geographical distribution
is uneven because 25% of all branches are located in Casablanca and another
50% in cities along the Atlantic coast.
3.11     Financial intermediaries are responsible for the bulk of medium-
and long-term credits to the economy, and had granted 84% of outstanding
loans at the end of 1979, compared to 16% by the commercial banks. Finan-
cial intermediaries are specialized by sector of activity. CNCA lends pri-
marily to agriculture and to agro-business operations 1/, CIH lends to
tourism projects and housing 2/, and CDG is a Government institution in
charge of public fund management (e.g., pension and insujrance funds, postal
savings, etc.). BNDE plays a key role in financing capital expenditures of
the Moroccan industry (see Chapter TV).

3.12     Financing of industrial investment takes various forms, from
medium- and long-term credits granted by commercial banks and BNDE, to
supplier credits from abroad, leasing, and equity participation. There are
no data on supplier credits. Although discussions with industrial pro-
moters showed that these credits are available, the exchange risk involved
is often a deterrent. Banks, such as BMCI, offer 3-year loans limited to
the financing of equipment; processing delays are short, but the cost is
higher than medium-term credits. Leasing, introduced in 1965, is offered
bv three institutions (Maroc-Leasing, Maghrebail, Credico), but its impact
is still marginal with financing peaking at DU 121 million in 1977. Equity
participations are taken occasionally by the banks and BNDE, but there is
no company specializing in venture capital although the idea is under
consideration. There are also less orthodox forms of financing such as
short-term credits to promoters to help them raise the necessary equity,
and short-term revolving credits to allow banks a greater spread than on
straight medium-term loans; the extent of such practices is not known.
IV. BANQUE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
A. Structure
4.01     Since the Bank's last appraisal of BNDE in 1976, the corporate
status of BNDE has remained unchanged, but its ownership structure has
somewhat been altered. Details on BNDE's organization and ownership
structure are available in the Project File, and major features are
summarized below.
4.02     Ownership and Control:  As agreed with the Bank, BNDE doubled its
capital to DH 140 million ($28 million) in December 1977. The Moroccan
Government directly controls 34% and indirectly another 16% through Caisse
de D6pot et de Gestion (GDG; 11%), Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI;
2.2%) and five other publicly controlled financial institutions (2.8%).
Consenuently, Government control has increased since 1976 from 38% to 50%,
principally through CGD which was not previously a BNDE shareholder. The
increase in Government ownership is not expected to influence BNDE's
policies and management; furthermore, CDG's presence in BNDE's Board in the
person of its competent and highly regarded Director-General constitutes a
positive development.
4.03      Board and Committees:  Except for the above, no major changes in
institutions represented in BNDE's Board have occurred since the last Bank
appraisal. Foreign institutions, including IFC, are represented by eight
directors compared to ten for the Moroccan Government and two for private
Moroccan shareholders. IFC is the sole foreign member of the Executive
Committee of BNDE which meets monthly to review and recommend final
approvals of all loans amounting to DH 7 million or more (DH 4 million
before 1979).

B. Management and Staff
4.04     There have been major changes in BNDE's management and staff
starting with the appointment in January 1978 of Mr. Abdelkader Benslimane,
former Finance Minister, as President Director-General. At about the same
time, BNDE's experienced Director of the Economics Department and his
deputy left BNDE to fill senior positions elsewhere. Two other depart-
ments, Engineering and Promotion, were also without a titular Director at
the time of appraisal. These latter developments had affected BNDE's
performance negatively, particularly as regards its economic projects and
sector work; in addition, inadequate follow-up on loans resulted in mount-
ing arrears.
4.05     These problems were regularly discussed with BNDE during super-
vision missions, and were examined in detail during the appraisal in
November 1980. Partly as a result of these discussions, the President
instituted a broad organizational review of the staffing and management
needs of BNDE in the light of its widening scope of operations. As a
result, a new organizational structure 1/ was put into force on January 5,
1981.
4.06     The reorganization involves the consolidation of the present six
Departments into four larger ones, each headed by a Director seconded by a
full time Deputy Director. In addition to the present three Directors who
are confirmed in their respective expanded Departments (i.e. Finance and
Loan Administration, Project Appraisal, Follow-up and Legal), the former
Director of the Promotion Department, who had been on secondment as a
Vice-President to the African Development Bank, takes over the newly
created Development Department. The new structure aims to group in each
new department related and complementary activities for better coordination
and efficiency. Two Deputy Directors-General will coordinate operations
between the four Departments, and act for the President Director-General
during his absence.
4.07     Within the new structure greater autonomny and authority will be
given to the Directors, and the appointment of Deputv Directors allows
better supervision and provides training for potential future senior
managers. The Appraisal Department will include four Divisions: for
Engineering, for Financial and Economic Appraisal, for Rediscounted Loans
(para. 2.09), and for Small and Medium Scale (SMI) Projects; an Export
Promotion lUnit has been set up (para. 5.13) in this Department, and is
expected to develop into a full Division when the work-load warrants this
and suitable additional staff has been attracted. The new Development
Department will also have four Divisions, namely the new Sector Studies
1/ Details in the Project File.



- 11 -
Division, the Investments Division dealing with equity participations, an
External Relations and Promotion Division, and a Statistics Division.  The
Finance Department will contain a Treasury Division and a Loan Administra-
tion Division.  Finally, the Follow-up and Legal Department will have a
Division for Follow-up, which will control projects under construction and
in consultation with the Finance and Appraisal Departments arrange periodic
visits to projects and consultations with clients, a Legal Division for
general legal work, and a Division for Loan Recovery.  The latter Division,
which will include lawyers as well as financial analysts and can draw on
staff of other departments, was especially created to deal with the serious
loan arrears situation at BNDE (para. 4.25); it started to take strong
action in early 1981, including arranging visits by BNDE management if pay-
ments due are delayed by a month, and to initiate legal action if payments
cannot be agreed upon after this period.
4.08     The strong caliber of the Department Directors and their deputies,
the increased responsibilities delegated to them by the President, and the
morale boost created by the promotion of younger but experienced profes-
sionals to Division Chief positions, have all strengthened BNDE's institu-
tional base. BNDE's performance is expected to significantly improve once
the key Divisions are adequately staffed. A staffing plan was agreed upon
at negotiations to ensure an adequate number of experienced staff will be
placed in the newly-formed Divisions which will play important roles in
BNDE's future operations (Follow-up, Loan Recovery, Export Promotion, and
Sector Studies). Also, in view of the substantial size of BNDE's loan
portfolio (over 500 loans under supervision), the growing complexity of its
operations (i.e., SSI financing, export financing, etc.) and the need to
tighten supervision of clients, a computerized management information
system for administrative functions, loan supervision, and appraisal is
required; the financing will be provided by the Kuwait Special Fund.
4.09     At the end of 1980, BNDE's total staff of 170 included 78 profes-
sionals, compared to 60 professionals in 1976. The professional staff
includes 6 engineers and 2 junior engineers (compared to a total of 4
junior engineers in 1976) and 19 economists; the economic staff of BNDE
was more than doubled during 1980 in anticipation of the above mentioned
reorganization.
4.10     Training of Staff:  In view of the recent reorganization, and the
increases in staff and changes in functions which have occurred, further
training is essential. For example, the staff of the Export Promotion Unit
would benefit from exposure to international or national agencies in other
countries that are concerned with export promotion; also, the new
economists, as well as existing financial, economic and engineering staff,
could benefit from training designed to sensitize them to the subsectoral
impact of projects as well as their social and economic evaluation. To
determine the training requirements, it was agreed with BNDE that a senior
consultant will visit BNDE this year to agree on suitable training programs.

C. Operations
4.11     Characteristics of Operations;  BNDE's operations experienced a
substantial slowdown in 1978-79 as a direct result of the economic reces-
sion in the country which led many industrialists to delay their invest-
ments. However, since end-1979, a marked increase in operations, so far
particularly reflected in approvals and commitments, has started as shown
below:

Rediscounted Loans    282    370.8  191    171.9  198    201.6  271    377.8
4.12     The average size of direct BNDE loans declined to DH 6 million
($1.2 million) during the 1978-80 period, compared to DH 9.4 million ($1.9
million) in 1976-77, indicating the shift to smaller projects; these
smaller projects also required shorter terms (about 7 years) as compared
with loans for large, often state-owned, enterprises. The general decrease
in the size and terms of BNDE's direct loans partly reflects Morocco's
industrial investment strategy which increasingly emphasizes smaller indus-
tries. This is a desirable development, since BNDE can play a more impor-
tant financial and technical role in the smaller private enterprises (see
also PPAR 1805) as the large state-owned enterprises have contributed more
than proportionally to their portfolio to BNDE's arrears problems (para.
4.27).
4.13     During the period 1977-80, over 75% of the amount of BNDE's
approvals were in the private sector, compared to 45% in 1974-76, as the
Government curtailed the development of large new projects. Following the
Moroccanization laws of 1973, loan approvals for foreign-controlled enter-
prises have dwindled to an insignificant level (about 3% of the total in
1979/80). During the period 1977-80, 39% of BNDE's approvals were for
loans to the manufacturitg icd,-stty (mechanv&ical U%, ioo& pTlcessing 1%%,



- 13 -
textiles 8%, cement 4%, others 1%); transport accounted for 21%, and mis-
cellaneous for the rest (fishing, hotels, etc.).
4.14     The geographic distribution of BNDE's loans continues to reflect
the concentration of industries in the Casablanca-Mohammedia area. This
area accounted for about 60% of all BNDE's loan and equity investment
approvals in 1974-80. The balance of approvals was generally well spread
over other major urban centers (i.e. Rabat, Marrakech, Agadir, Fes, Tanger,
etc.).
4.15     During the period 1977-79, BNDE committed 12 new equity invest-
ments for DP 30.1 million ($6.0) compared to 28 investments for DH 33 mil-
lion ($6.6 million) during the period 1974-76. As of December 31, 1979,
BNDE held participations in 34 industrial enterprises accounting for 60% of
total outstanding equity investments of DH 96.7 million ($19.3 million), in
6 tourism enterprises (15% of total), and 8 financial institutions (25% of
total).
4.16     Bank Loans to BNDE.  The Bank has made eight loans to BNDE amount-
ing to $184.7 million, net of cancellations. The BNDE VII loan (1061-MOR)
of $30 million was fully committed and disbursed before the original clos-
ing date of December 31, 1979. The BNDE VIII loan (1428-MOR) of $45
million became effective December 21, 1977, and is now fully committed;
disbursements amounted to $26 million as of May 1, 1981, or 40% below the
expectations at the time of appraisal. The slow disbursement pace stems
from the economic slowdown experienced in Morocco during 1978-80 (para.
2.01); the loan is now expected to be fully disbursed within six months of
the original closing date of September 30, 1981. The ERR of projects under
Loan 1428-MOR ranged from 18% to 50%, well above the 10% minimum.
4.17     During 1977-79, the total investment cost of projects involving
BNDE financing amounted to about DH 5 billion ($1 billion), compared to DH
6 billion ($1.2 billion) in 1974-76. BNDE's direct loan and equity
approvals for these projects amounted to DR 1.5 billion ($300 million) and
rediscounted loan approvals to DH 0.7 billion ($140 million); the balance
was provided from equity funds, Government grants, and other loan financing
mostly in the form of suppliers' credits.
D. Resource Position

Resource Gap (December 31, 1980)                   196,515
4.19     BNDE's resource gap of DH 197 million (t39 million) as of
December 31, 1980 is mainly due to the resurgence of BNDE lending activity
in 1980 after a pause in 1979. Direct lending commitments, which reached
DH 511 million ($102 million) in 1980, went up 92% compared to 1979
reflecting the upsurge in economic activity following the 1978-79 reces-
sion. Since the previous appraisal at the end of 1976, BNDE's continuous
resource mobilization efforts have been successful and total outstanding
resources increased by 60% from DH 1,768 million ($354 million) at the end
of 1976 to DH 2,821 million ($564 million) in September 1980. As regards
local currency, which represented 41% of total resources as of December 31,
1980, BNDE has received resources from share capital increase (DH 70 mil-
lion in 1977), net cash generation and local borrowings. Bond issues (most
of them 15-year at 7.5%) represented 90% of local borrowings or 31% of
total resources in December 1980.
4.20     As regards foreign exchange resources, the Bank has continuously
supported BNDE's objective to diversify its sources of funds. This objec-
tive has been substantially achieved. The proportion of Bank funds decrea-
sed from 42% of total resources outstanding in mid-1974, to 20% at the end
of 1976 and to 8% in December 1980. Other foreign exchange resources come
from a variety of sources such as public institutions in capital surplus
Arab countries, ADB and KfW, as well as two LIBOR indexed Euro-dollar
borrowings contracted in 1976 and 1977 for a total amount of US$165 million
and representing 19% of total resources outstanding in September 1980.



- 15 -
E. Financial Performance
4.21     Profitability.  As indicated in Annexes 4 and 7, BNDE's profit-
ability has been sound during the 1977-1979 period although it declined
significantly in 1979. Profit before taxes declined from DP. 42.7 million
($8.5 million) in 1978 to DP 37.6 million ($7.5 million) in 1979, but
recovered to DH 40 million in 1980. This decrease is mainly due to the
high cost of LIBOR indexed Euro-dollar borrowings, the average cost of
which increased from 13% in 1978 to 20% in 1979 and the first half of
1980. This resulted in the fall of BNDE's interest spread which declined
from 1.8% in 1977 to 1.0% in 1979 and was 1.2% in 1980. However, the
Euro-dollar borrowings are being repaid rapidly and will have been com-
pletely repaid in 1982, while BNDE has just increased its nominal interest
rate to a uniform 12% p.a. for all loans compared to 10% for medium-term
loans (up to 7 years) and 11% for long-term loans; as a result, the
interest spread is expected to rise to 1.6% in 1981, 2.2% in 1982 and 3.0%
in 1983, provided BNDE does not again have to increase its borrowings in
the expensive Euro-currency market (Annex 14). In addition, BNDE's annual
administrative expenses have remained relatively low and represented about
0.7% of average assets in 1980.  The deteriorating trend in BNDE's profit-
ability reversed in 1980, and BNDE's profitability is expected to continue
to improve and remain satisfactory during the 1981-84 period (see Annexes
11 and 14). To ensure that BNDE maintains a satisfactory level of profit-
ability, it will be a condition of the proposed loan that BNDE maintains on
a best effort basis its profit before tax at a minimum of 25% of its equity
from 1982 onwards. Although in recent years this percentage was below 20%
(Annex 7), BNDE's reduction in euro-currency borrowings and new interest
policy would permit it to adhere to this agreement (Annex 14).
4.22     Financial Position.  BNDE's audited balance sheets for the 1977-79
period, and unaudited balance sheet as of December 31, 1980 are detailed in
Annex 6 and show that BNDE's total assets increased by 33% between 1977 and
1980 with an increase of DH 506 million ($101 million) (+ 29%) in its net
portfolio outstanding. This growth of BNDE's lending activity particularly
in 1978 has brought about a 10% increase in term borrowings, from DH 1,688
million ($338 million) in 1977 to DR 1,855 million ($371 million) in 1980.
Consequently, the debt-equity ratio increased from 8.9:1 in 1977 to 9.9:1
in 1978 (i.e. almost the 10:1 limit agreed with BNDE in the 1061 MOR Bank
Loan Agreement). Decreased borrowings in 1978 and 1979 coupled with high
repayments contributed to a lower debt-equity ratio (9.7:1 at end 1979, and
9.3:1 at end 1980); projections (Annex 14) indicate that the debt-equity
ratio will remain well below 10. As a result, no capital increase is con-
sidered necessary for 1981-83. However, if the 1981-85 Plan generates a
vigorous upturn of the economic activity, BNDE's commitments could be
higher than projected, requiring a more aggressive plan of resources
mobilization. If so, the debt-equity ratio would increase again, and its
evolution should be reviewed carefully during supervision.
4.23     Liquidity and Debt Service.  BNDE ended the year 1980 with a rela-
tively tight liquidity situation. This is attributable to a lower growth



- 16 -
of cash generation from operations, and the increased level of arrears
which created a liquidity squeeze between loan collections and debt repay-
ments. At the time of appraisal of the BNDE-VIII loan (1428-MOR) the risk
of a liquidity squeeze was recognized; to minimize this risk an agreement
was reached with BNDE to maintain a minimum debt service ratio of 1:1. 1/
The ratio has evolved as follows:
Table 4.03: MOROCCO - BNDE DEBT SERVICE RATIO
(December 31)                 1977         1978          1979          1980

Debt service ratio          1.40/1          1.07/1       1.05/1        1.00/1
4.24     The debt service ratio is projected 2/ to improve very substan-
tially in the coming years as a result of measures taken by BNDE, including
a strengthening of the portfolio, as shown in Annex 14. To provide ade-
quate safeguards against a future liquidity squeeze BNDE has committed
itself to raise the debt service ratio to a minimum of 1.1 as of January
1982.
F. Quality of Portfolio and Audit
4.25      As indicated in table below, BNDE's arrears situation has
seriously deteriorated since 1978.  The portfolio affected by arrears 3/ of
more than three months was DH 844 million ($169 million) or 33.7% of the
loan portfolio outstanding as at December 31, 1980. This high level is
only due in part to the slowdown of economic activities under the 1978-80
austerity Plan; it raised serious questions about the quality of BNDE's
loan portfolio and BNDE's loan supervision procedures.
I/ The debt service ratio is defined as the ratio of total loan collec-
tions, debt interest charges and internal cash generation (i.e., profit
before taxes plus non cash charges), to debt service payments (i.e.,
principal plus interest charges).
2/  Based on the conservative assumption of payment of 85% of principal and
96% of interest due in each year, and provided BNDE does not have to
further increase its Eurocurrency borrowings.
3/ A subsectoral distribution of BNDE's arrears is available in the
Project File.

4.26     BNDE's outstanding loans are either guaranteed by CCG and/or are
secured by sufficient collateral (para. 4.27). About 55% of BNDE's loans
are covered by guarantees provided by the Government's Caisse Centrale de
Carantie (CGC). However, at the time of the appraisal, the value of CGC
guarantee remained untested since CCG had never paid BNDE according to the
terms of the guarantees. CCG honored its guarantee for the first time in
December 1980 by covering DR 6.9 million ($1.4 million) due to BNDE by
SEFFRIF, a public sector mining company in serious financial difficulties,
and paid DH 10.8 million (US$2.2 million) for CNA (coal mine) in April 1981
and DH 3.5 million (US$0.7 million) for Asment de Temara (cement) and
SEFERIF in May 1981. The guarantees cover, for public companies, all
interest and principal payments which are not paid within three months of
the due date ("full guarantee") and for private firms, only losses which
remain after all funds recovered through the courts have been accounted for
("conditional guarantee").
4.27     Analysis of Arrears.  The arrears can be classified as follows: I/

Arrears (12/31/80)
(DR 5 = $1)                                          DH million
(a) Companies no longer in operation                    26.2               10
(b) Companies under litigation                         35.7                14
(c) Companies operating at a loss                     136.7                54

($50 million)
For the companies no longer in operation, BNDE has taken firm steps to
recover its funds from CCG (DH 2.6 million in full guarantees and DH 4.8
million in conditional guarantees), and by instigating legal action. The
most serious and immediate problem are the companies operating with
1/ Further details in the Project File.

financial or technical difficulties. More than half of the arrears in the
latter category affect large state-owned enterprises; these companies are
directly responsible for 78% of the increase of BNDE's arrears from June to
December 1980. However, of the total arrears of DH 136.7 million, DH 72.6
million is covered by a full CCC guarantee, and DH 6.3 million by a condi-
tional guarantee. Payment of the full guarantees, which are due, would
reduce the outstanding total loan arrears by 29%; a substantial amount of
these arrears will be paid over the next two years 1/. Finally, BNDE will
enforce payments due from viable companies through the newly formed Loan
Recovery Division (para. 4.07).
4.28     Action on Arrears.  The arrears reached a peak of 10% of the out-
standing loan amount in December l98Q0. BNDE has since succeeded in reduc-
ing the arrears to 8.9% of outstanding loans as of April 30, 1981, partly
due to a more forceful collection policy, and partly as a result of the
payment of guarantees due BNDE by CCG. At negotiations, a plan of action
was agreed with BNDE and the Government to settle arrears owed by the four
borrowers with the largest amounts in arrears 2/. The plan of action
outlines the successive steps leading either to a reestablishment of the
financial viability of each borrower on a basis satisfactory to BNDE after
thorough examination covering technical, marketing and financial aspects as
warranted; or to CCC payments corresponding to the arrears and according to
an agreed timetable. BNDE therefore projects that arrears will be reduced
to 8.0% of loans outstanding by end 1981, 6.9% by end 1982 and 5.5% by end
1983. On the basis of these projections which have been reviewed in
detail, as well as of the auditors' assessment of BNDE's provisions for
losses on outstanding loans, arrears should not put BNDE's financial
position at excessive risk.
4.29      Loan Provisions.  BNDE's reserves on loan risks amounting to
DH 93 million ($17 million) or 3.7% of the loan portfolio outstanding at
December 31, 1980 are fully earmarked to cover losses on loans 3/; BNDE
1/ In order to improve the efficiency of CCG, the Government has agreed to
increase CCG's staff, and to press for the collection of guarantee fees
owed by firms to CCG (the lax collection procedures in the past explain
some of the cash shortages experienced by CCG, resulting in delayed
guarantee payments). Finally the Government has agreed to review in
depth the legal and administrative framework of CCG.
2/ In particular a program of restructuring has been agreed for a large
textile complex, a construction (prefab housing) group, a cement
company and a coal mine.
3/ Provisions for losses on individual direct loans are considered
case-by-case by the auditors. Total provisions (DH 16 million at
December 31, 1979) are deducted from the special reserve for loan risk,
the balance of which is considered part of the equity. Audited figures
for 1980 are not yet available.



- 19 -
allocates up to 1/7 of interest income on loans to these reserves. The
level of provisions is adequate for a portfolio which has good security,
although liquidity problems may arise due to the slow legal proceedings
involved in foreclosure on mortgaged assets and the delays in CCC payments.
4.30     Equity Portfolio.  BNDE's net investment portfolio at end 1979 of
DH 96.7 million ($19.3 million) comprises 48 participations, of which 8
financial institutions (25%), 6 tourist enterprises (15%) and 34 industrial
enterprises (60%). The financial yield of the investment portfolio
improved from an average 4.7% in 1978 to 5.1% in 1979, earned mainly from
the 27 companies operating profitably. These companies account for 59% of
BNDE's investment; the estimated increase in value on these investments
is about 51% over their cost to BNDE (equal to DH 29.1 million or $5.8
million).
4.31     Equity Provisions.  In 11 enterprises facing financial difficul-
ties, BNDE's investments amount to DH 32.8 million ($6.6 million). The
auditors estimate their value at 45% of cost, implying a possible loss of
DH 18.3 million ($3.7 million) that should normally be provisioned. How-
ever, BNDE has provisioned only DH 3.3 million ($0.7 million) on 8 enter-
prises, The balance of DH 15 million ($3.0 million) relates to 2 public
sector enterprises, Cellulose du Maroc (DH 10.2 million) and SNEP (DH 2.5
million) and a private one, Asment de Temara (DH 2.3 million). The
detailed analysis provided in the audit report supports BNDE's position not
to provision for these investments. Considering that the increases in
equity values offset losses to a certain extent, one can conclude that the
quality of the equity portfolio is acceptable.
4.32     Audit.  Audits at BNDE are satisfactory, and are conducted by a
reputable international accounting firm. However, in view of the large
arrears, in-depth auditing of this aspect will be arranged by BNDE. A
s-tatement with details of the arrears will be prepared quarterly, together
with BNDE's plan of action on how to reduce these arrears. The distribu-
tion of BNDE loans will be shown in the audit reports to indicate exposure
by_sector, as well as arrears by sector.
C. Resource Requirements
4.33     Based on BNDE's operational forecasts (para. 4.38), BNDE's
projected resource requirements and financing plan for the period 1980-83
are detailed in Annex 10 and summarized below:
{

Bond issues                                                         600.0
Resource gap (12/31/1980)                                          (196.5)
Subtotal local resources                                         1,105.1

Total resources identified                                       1,208.0
C.  Resource Gap (10/80-12/83)                                          610.0
4.34     Taking into account the resource gap amounting to DH 196.5 million
($39 million) as of December 31, 1980 and assuming that DH 156.9 million
($31 million) identified in foreign exchange 1/ will materialize, BNDE
would need DH 610 million ($122 million) in additional new resources to
meet its commitments through the end of 1983. Under the proposed Bank
loan, DH 437.5 million ($87.5 million) would become available to BNDE 2/,
and these funds are expected to be fully committed by the end of 1983. The
resource gap would therefore be reduced from DH 610 million to DH 172.5
million ($34.5 million) at that time.
4.35     BNDE's local resource mobilization strategy over the period
1981-83 is to continue raising funds through bond issues. BNDE thus
expects to issue a total of DH 600 million ($120 million), or DH 200 mil-
lion ($40 million) annually as in the past, through the end of 1983. These
10 or 15-year bond issues, the financial charges of which are expected to
be 9.5% or 10%, are well tailored to BNDE's lending terms for manufacturing
and BNDE should have no problems in placing them.
4.36     The DH 157 million ($31 million) in foreign exchange resources
identified so far by BNDE are at an advanced stage of discussions. BNDE
expects to secure them for 10 years at fixed interest charges of 9-10%
p.a. In order to finance the remaining resource gap of DH 172.5 million
($34.5 million), BNDE will continue its resource mobilization efforts.

(DH 87.5 million).
2/  DH 350 million ($70 million) under the proposed BNDE IX loan and DH
87.5 million ($17.5 million) under the proposed SSI II loan.



- 21 -
4.37     The proposed Bank loan would cover about 15% of BNDE's total addi-
tional resource needs for the period October 1980-end 1983, and account for
about 30% of the estimated import component of the projects financed by
BNDE during this period. The Government will continue as in the past to
cover the foreign exchange risk on the proposed Bank loan.
H. Prospects
4.38     The value of industrial investment approved in Morocco in 1980 was
DH 1641 million ($328 million), a 58% increase over 1979.  BNDE's realistic
program of commitments for 1981-84 takes into account the recovery of
industrial investments, which are, however, not likely to reach the high
levels of the years 1975-77. After the sizeable increase of its lending
operations in 1980 as compared with 1979, BNDE expects its direct loan and
equity commitments to increase by 5% p.a. in current prices from DH 560
million ($112 million) in 1981 to DH 654 million ($131 million) in 1984.
BNDE's commitments of medium-term rediscountable loans are expected to
increase from DH 250 million ($50 million) in 1981 to DH 300 million ($60
million) in 1983 (see Annex 8).
4.39     The assumptions underlying the financial projections for BNDE are
given in Annex 9. BNDE's projected income statements are detailed in Annex
11. Prospects are good for the period 1981-84, and BNDE's profitability
should improve markedly as compared with the years 1978-80. Operating pro-
fits (profits before taxes) should increase by 48% between 1980 and 1981,
from DH 40.0 million ($8 million) to DH 59.4 million ($11.9 million) 1/ and
expand regularly thereafter to reach DH 113.1 million ($22.6 million) in
1984, or 21% of average net worth as compared with 17% in 1980 (Annex 14).
These good prospects are primarily due to:
(a) an increase in the income from loans. The income from loans would
increase from 10.2% of average loan portfolio in 1980 to 11.8% in
1984. The increase results in particular from the recent increase
of BNDE's nominal interest rate (para. 3.07); this, combined with
the drop in financial charges (a) will increase the spread on
BNDE's lending operations to satisfactory levels (para. 4.21);
(b) a drop in the financial charges borne by BNDE, as the cost of debt
will progressively decrease from 9.0% in 1980 to 8.4% of average
debt in 1984. This drop is linked to the rapid repayments of the
Eurodollars borrowings contracted in 1977 and to the more steady
growth of BNDE's commitments during 1981-84;
1/ The one year loan of Swiss Francs 100 million at 0.75% above the Swiss
equivalent of the Libor recently signed by BNDE (February 1981) should,
however, increase BNDE's financial charges in 1981-82. As a result,
BNDE's operating profits in 1981 and 1982 might be somewhat lower than
projected at the time of appraisal.



- 22 -
(c) the relatively moderate cost of BNDE's administrative expenses,
which will amount to less than 1% of average total assets during
the period 1981-84.
BNDE will be able to maintain its 8% dividend policy while increasing its
equity basis. By 1982, cash dividends would represent about 30% of
net-profit compared to 82% in 1980, with the balance going to reserves.
The part of profit allocated to the Special Reserve for Loan Risk would
increase from DH 6.6 million ($1.3 million) in 1980 to an average DH 29.6
million ($5.9 million) in 1981-84. 1/
4.40     BNDE's projected balance sheets are detailed in Annex 13.  BNDE
has projected a conservative program of commitments for the period 1981-84,
and its total assets are expected to remain approximately constant during
1980-84 at around DP 2.8 billion ($560 million). The net equity and loan
portfolio would slightly decrease from DH 2.2 billion ($440 million) in
1980 to DH 1.9 billion ($380 million) in 1984. The projected financial
position is sound. Total long-term debts would stay at about DH 1.7-1.9
billion ($340-$380 million) during the period. Assuming no further
increases nor rescheduling in Euro-borrowings, Euro-dollar debt would
decline from 14% at the end of 1980 to 2% of total debts outstanding in
1982. The projected debt/equity ratio will remain below the 10:1 limit
(Annex 14), and would improve as sizeable reserves (after deducting
adequate provisions for real risks of loss on loans and equity) would build
up, primarily through the Special Reserve for Loan Risks which would
increase by 150% between 1980 and 1984.
4.41     With a strong improvement of its profitability as well as a slight
reduction of its total long-term debt, BNDE would not face any liquidity
problems during 1981-84 provided its resource mobilization program
(para. 4.36) is successful. As noted above, the latter has a good chance
of being met.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01     The proposed project supports the development of the industrial
sector, and complements the SSI-II project and the Bank program of economic
and sector work.
1/ BNDE has the possibility to allocate up to 1/7 of its income to a
tax-free special reserve.



- 23 -
A. Objectives
5.02     The principal objectives of the loan are:
(a) the provision of foreign exchange needed to finance efficient
intermediate size projects in the industrial sector; this is a
continuation of the lines of credit provided to BNDE under
previous Bank loans;
(b) the promotion and financing of efficient export-oriented projects
(minimum 20% of loan component); the selection, evaluation and
promotion of these projects, as well as other studies to be under-
taken, will also help to develop BNDE expertise in this field at a
time that promoting exports is one of the major Government
objectives;
(c)  to provide continued institutional support to BNDE by developing
and strengthening its organization, especially in the area of
project supervision, collection of arrears, staff training and
capabiLity in the export field.
B. Justification
5.03     Sector Support.  The loan will support the Government's program to
strengthen the industrial sector. BNDE has developed extensive experience
in the evaluation, selection and financing of medium-sized and small manu-
facturing enterprises, particularly in the private sector, and its assis-
tance is of crucial importance to channel funds to the most viable and
efficient enterprises. (It should be noted that BNDE has been entrusted by
the Government to evaluate and advise on all industrial loans requiring
term financing under the provisions of the Industrial Code.)
5.04     Export Development.  In line with the Government's objectives to
develop an efficient export industry, the loan will encourage BNDE to seek
out and promote such industries. In this respect, the effort required
under this loan should be seen as a pilot program for developing BNDE's
capabilities in this field. This pilot program could be followed by a
full-fledged export-oriented project in a similar way as the SSI pilot
program under BNDE-VIII led to the SSI-I loan.
5.05     Provision of Resources.  BNDE has been able to attract an increas-
ing amount of alternative foreign exchange resources. While in 1974 the
amount of Bank funds amounted to 87% of total foreign exchange borrowings,
this percentage had dropped to 13% in 1980. However, the confidence
expressed by the Bank in continuing to lending to BNDE is still considered
an important factor to facilitate the mobilization of alternative stable
interest rate foreign resources, while helping BNDE to reduce excessive
dependence on fluctuating rate euro-currency borrowings.



- 24 -
5.06      Institutional Support.  Besides the support to be extended under
the export program, the Bank's assistance is still highly valued by BNDE
management. Such assistance covers field visits including loan super-
vision, staff training, sub-project reviews, and management assistance. In
addition, under the provisions of this loan, financial and possibly tech-
nical support will be extended to BNDE to update its administration, proj-
ect supervision, and appraisal procedures by the introduction of a manage-
ment information system.
C. Loan Features
5.07     Use of Loan.  Of the $70 million loan, at least 20% ($14 million)
will be used for financing the foreign exchange capital cost of export-
oriented projects, as defined below. The loan will also include additional
features to assure greater BNDE involvement in the promotion and support of
export-oriented projects, including staff training. Subprojects financed
under the Bank must show minimum FRRs and ERRs of 12%.
5.08     Eligibility Criteria for Export Oriented Projects.  Export-
oriented projects are defined as those which, as a result of the project,
will export at least 20% of production, or incremental production in the
case of expansion projects. Exports will be calculated as a percentage of
the sales revenue. The export projects must have a minimum FRR and ERR of
12%, and must generate net foreign exchange earnings.
5.09     Loan and Sub-Loan Maturities.  The amortization schedule will be
based on the aggregate repayments of the sub-loans. The sub-loans will
have a maximum repayment period of 15 years, including up to 4 years
grace.
5.10     Free Limit.  In view of the serious arrears situation, the free
limit of $2.0 million established under the last loan will be retained. In
view of the inflation which has taken place since 1977 (para. 3.09), there
will thus be an effective tightening of the Bank's supervision on the
evaluation of sub-projects by BNDE. There will be no free limit on
sub-loans for export-oriented projects to ensure a maximum feed-back from,
and supervision of these loans. The upper aggregate free limit would be
60% of the total loan amount, or $42 million; there was no aggregate free
limit under the previous loan, and this resulted in the submission of a
large number of small projects below the free limit which did not permit
the Bank to review regularly the quality of BNDE's appraisal work.
5.11     Sub-Loan Limit.  In line with the provisions of the previous loan,
there would be an upper limit. Taking into account the inflation since the
previous loan was approved in 1977, the new limit has been set at $6.0 mil-
lion per sub-loan, or $8.0 million after including the outstanding balance
on any prior sub-loan made to the same enterprise. As a result of this
limit, together with the free limits set above, the Bank would expect to



- 25 -
make a full review of about five projects above the free limit and of five
export-oriented projects, representing about 33% of all the projects
financed under the proposed loan component and about 50% of the loan
amount; a further 20 projects below the free limit would be reviewed in
less detail.
5.12     BNDE Institutional Development in Relation to Export Promotion.
In addition to promoting export-oriented projects to satisfy the loan
requirements, and developing methods to assess export potential and
performance, BNDE has agreed to undertake further work on developing its
export project appraisal and supervision capability. Agreement was reached
with BNDE on the creation of an Export Unit (initially staffed with 3
persons) in the Appraisal Department (para. 4.07), and the Sector Studies
Division of the Development Department will also review export potentials
and constraints as part of the industrial sector and sub-sector work it
will undertake. BNDE has also expressed its interest in the work of the
various working groups on exports to be established under any proposed SAL
Loan (para. 2.08). Training to be provided for staff directly involved in
these working groups will be determined in consultation with BNDE's manage-
ment after a review by a Bank consultant.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
5.13     Procurement for the loan will follow the normal procedures used
in Bank-financed DFCs, and the main responsibility for checking the sub-
borrowers procurement procedures will rest with BNDE, whose procedures are
satisfactory. The inherent self-interest of the entrepreneurs has led to
almost universal international bidding or shopping. The amounts involved,
often spread over several contracts, are too small to justify the cost and
possible delays involved in international competitive bidding procedures. 1/
5.14     Disbursements for the loan will only be made on the basis of
standard documentation giving evidence of expenditures. The estimated
disbursement schedule of the loan is given in Annex 16; the loan is
expected to be fully committed by December 31, 1983, and to be fully dis-
bursed by December 31, 1986. The foreign exchange risk of the loan will be
borne by the Government.
1/ The Bank-financed sub-loans are small, averaging about $1 million;
under the last BNDE loan only 2 sub-loans exceeded $2 million.
Similarly, the total foreign exchange cost of any project partly
financed with Bank funds was small, with only 2 out of 42 projects
under the last loan exceeding $3 million.



- 26 -
E. Benefits and Risks
5.15     The proposed loan to BNDE is designed to assist industry in
general; however, the new focus under this loan to promote a substantial
export-oriented component is expected to have a major impact on BNDE's
future role in industry, in line with the countries basic policies. There
is no special risk associated with that approach.
5.16     Secondly, the loan will help BNDE to stabilize its resource plan
and reduce its previous reliance on highly fluctuating euro-currency
resources. This would have a positive impact on BNDE's debt service and
profitability.
5.17     Thirdly, this project will serve as a new focus for institutional
support between the Bank and BNDE. Our assistance is particularly needed
in the area of project supervision and in the training of economists and
financial staff to develop an expertise in export promotion and financing.
5.18     In spite of the higher arrears experienced by BNDE, partly as a
result of the past unfavorable economic conditions in the country, BNDE
remains a creditworthy institution and ranks high among Bank-supported
development banks in efficiency and sophistication of operations. There
are no special risks attached to the proposed loan.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Banque Nationale Pour le Developpement Economigue
Major Assumptions for BNDE's
Five-Year Operational and Financial Forecasts
(1980-1984)
A. Operational Forecasts
1.    Loan and equity investment approvals are based on (i) the
investments projected under the new 1981-85 Plan in sectors where
BNDE's activity is important (manufacturing, transport, mining);
and (ii) a pipeline of projects submitted or to be submitted to
BNDE for financing.
2.    Commitments and disbursements are based on a case-by-case
study of the status and estimated implementation schedules of
projects in the pipeline, and on past trends in BNDE's activities.
3.    Loan repayments are assumed to be on average 7 years, in-
cluding an average grace period of 1 year.
B. Financial Forecasts
1.    Income Statements
(a) Interests on direct loans are calculated on the average
loans outstanding at the beginning and end of each year;
BNDE's loans outstanding bear interest rates of 10% on
medium term loans and 11% on long term loans through the
end of 1980, and 12% thereafter for all loans regardless
of maturity. As far as SSIs are concerned, the rates are
10% for medium term loans and 12% for long term loans.
Long term loans are defined as those exceeding 7 years.
BNDE is assumed to receive annually 96% of all interests
due.
(b) Revenue on rediscounted loans is assumed to increase an-
nually by DH 500,000.
(c) Commissions on loans are assumed to increase annually by
DH 500,000.
(d) Dividend revenue is based on an assumed average annual
yield of 5% on investments disbursed and outstanding.
(e) Other income from rent, deposits and miscellaneous is
assumed to increase annually by DH 120,000.



- 37 -
(f) Charges on borrowings are calculated as above in (a).
Charges on borrowings outstanding are available in pro-
ject file. For new borrowings, the following charges
are assumed:
-  I B R D                         9.5%
-  Arab Funds                      9.5%
-  Local bonds                    10%
-  Libor US$                      15%
-  Libor Swiss Francs              8%
(g) Personnel cost and salaries are assumed to increase an-
nually by 10%.
(h) Other administrative expenses are also assumed to increase
annually by 10%, except for transportation costs (20%).
(i) Amortization and depreciation follow Moroccan fiscal prac-
tices.
(j) Provisions and allocations to reserves
(i) For provision for losses on equity investmentS an
annual allocation of DH 2 million is assumed based
on past trends, and taking account of portfolio build-
up.
(ii) For the special reserve for loan risks   an annual
allocation deductible from taxable income is allocated
up to a maximum one-seventh of interest earned on di-
rect loans. This reserve may be available wholly or
in part for distribution, provided back tax deductions
are repaid entirely.
(iii) For the reserves for rediscounted loans an annual al-
location of DH 38,000 to DH 45,000 is assumed.  The
annual allocation is limited by law to 0.15% of new
commitments, and the total reserve to 0.50% of amounts
outstanding at end of year.
(k) Income taxes are calculated based on the following rates applied
to taxable income:
Up to DH 500,000                 40%
DH 500,001 to DH 2,000,000       44%
Over DE 2, 000, 000              48%



- 38 -
The following deductions from taxable income are allowed for
BNDE and assumed to continue:
(i) Annual allocation to the special reserves for direct
loan risks (up to a maximum one-seventh of interest
earned on direct loans).
(ii) Annual allocations to reserve for risks on redis-
counted loans.
(1) For the investment reserve, allocations are made on the basis
of the following rates applicable to taxable income:
Up to DH 50,000                0%
DH 50,001 to DH 150,000        5%
Over DH 150,000                8%
This reserve is not available for distribution.
(m) Legal reserves are built-up annually by 5% of net profits.
(n) For dividends an 8% rate is maintained, which represents an
annual distribution of DH 11.2 million.
