A: Project Development Objective.
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The proposed Project is the third in a planned series of three operations in support of the
Government's health sector recovery and development program.  Its objective is to support the
development of a viable Basic Health System of primary health care, public health and disease control.
More specifically, the Project will support the following:
(a) development of a primary health care system based on cost-effective interventions;
(b) reduction of lost productivity due to preventable illnesses, disabilities and premature deaths; and
(c) improvement of national capacity for managing the health sector.
In each Entity of BiH (Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska (RS), respectively), these objectives
will be achieved through:
(a) training and deployment of family doctors, nurses and allied professionals;
(b) development of an environment that is supportive of family medicine and nursing practices;
(c) incentives and innovative techniques to increase the productivity of health service managers,
family doctors, nurses and allied professionals;
(d) rehabilitation and equipping of primary care facilities;
(e) development of regulations, institutions and competencies for accreditation and quality assurance;
and
(f) policies and interventions for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, accidents
and injuries.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
Policy-based social sector operation, where IDA's lending presence can be catalytic with other
donors, both in terms of funding and sector policies. It is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy
Progress Report (IDA/r98-11 11) of July 15, 1998:
"Immediate post-war reconstruction projects helped meet war victims' needs and rebuild hospitals;
however, sustainable provision of health care has not yet been systematically addressed. A planned
Basic Health Project (FY99) will help establish cost-effective primary health care and build entity
health care provision capacity. Health sector financing studies are also underway as part of
preparation. "
CAS document number: 16866-BiH Date of latest CAS discussion: August 6, 1998
The proposed project is fully consistent with the Bank's Sector Support Strategy for the Health,
Nutrition and Population Sector, approved by the Board of Directors in CY97. It is also consistent with
the draft ECA Regional Strategy for Health Nutrition and Population.
2. Main sector issues, Government strategy and World Bank assistance:
Main Sector Issues:
The principal issues in the health sector are: (a) the absence of a sustainable health finance system;
(b) a mismatch between health needs and health services; and (c) a weak coordination of international
donor activity in primary health care and public health care. These are caused by multiple factors related
to the weak economy, political and social context, infrastructure, incentives and management systems as

well as training and deployment of staff. The following paragraphs present a summary of key issues.
More detailed information is contained in project files, available on request.
a) Absence of a sustainable health finance system.
The pre-war situation. Estimates of pre-war total health expenditure vary. According to the
Federation Ministry of Health (MOH), in 1991 it was about US$245 per capita, or 8.2 percent of GNP'.
This was on the high side of the range encountered in the region. Until the early 1990's, the health
system in BiH was financed through governmental institutions called "self-management communities of
interest", SIZs. These provided health insurance, social security and disability benefits to employees and
their families. Insurance revenues were obtained from compulsory contributions from employers and
employees (gross salaries), pensions and other personal incomes at an average rate of about 9-12 percent,
as well as through contributions paid by farmers. With a minuscule unofficial unemployment, 74 percent
of health insurance revenues came from state workers/enterprises, 19 percent from the pension fund and
about 7 percent from the agriculture/private sector, while co-payments were low but increasing.
The health sector was already facing a trend of expenditures in excess of revenues before the war.
Resources that could be raised for health services were limited by the State. At the same time, rights to
health care and special categories of the insured (exempted from payments) could not be curtailed due to
social and political reasons. Essentially, there were structural, legal and financial issues to be resolved
before a sustainable health finance system could be established. In addition to the large infrastructure, the
reasons for these high costs were that payments were based on norms for number of beds, items of
equipment, as well as staff and size of buildings, all of which combined to create perverse incentives.
Prices for services and salaries were based not on market indicators, but were adjusted to the available
resources in a system of "points". These points were allocated to items on cost sheets where the value for
each point was changeable. Over-specialization and high rates of utilization, referrals and prescribing
also contributed to high costs. Co-payments became more widespread, with out-of-pocket payments
accounting for perhaps an additional 3 percent of total health care expenditures.
A plan to deal with the increasing imbalance between health sector costs and revenues was initiated
shortly before the war. It called for strengthening the role of the health insurance fund as an independent
purchaser, encouraging private provision of health services, ensuring that the expenditure of the insurance
fund did not exceed its income, and increasing co-payments. The implementation of this plan was
prevented by the war, during which the unified financing system collapsed. Three systems emerged, two
for the Federation and one for RS.
The post-war situation2. The total health expenditure was DEM420 million (US$280 million), of
which 86% was in the Federation. Expenditures exceeded income in both Entities. The actual
overspending was larger in the Federation, but was greater in proportion to income in RS. Consolidated
overspending was US$11 million. Eighty three percent of total income was domestic and allocated via
the Health Insurance Funds.  Sixteen percent of total income was from  international sources.
International sources of income comprised a greater proportion of total in RS, leaving it more vulnerable
in the event of sharp reductions in external assistance. An unofficial estimate of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) for BiH in 1997 was DEM5,803 million, of which 72 percent was in the Federation and
28 percent in RS3. Approximately 9 percent of GDP was spent on health in the Federation and 4 percent

was spent in RS. Consolidated expenditures were 7 percent of GDP, a decline of 1.2 percent from 1990.
Actual expenditures may be similar those of 1990, as the Health Resource Account under-estimated the
value of out-of-pocket payments made for private health services and some co-payments in the public
sector. Health expenditure per capita has declined from DEM364 (US$245) in 1990 to DEMI 13.5
(US$75) in 1997. Revenues from health contributions have improved in the Federation since the wartime
collapse: DEMIO-40 per capita in 1993-1995, DEM95 in 1996 and DEM1304 in 1997. Health
expenditure ratio to GDP was not low, especially since it was underestimated by the Health Resource
Account. Key to the problem was the collapse in absolute spending, which could not support the large

It appears that the Federation allocated more funds (84 percent) to curative care, compared to
74 percent in RS. The real disparity may not be so large, since the difference results from the larger
proportion of funds allocated by international agencies in RS. Some of these were used for curative care,
but could not be apportioned back to either primary, secondary of tertiary care.
Policies, legislation and regulations. For clarity in examining the main issues regarding health care
financing and payment mechanisms, it is important to distinguish among the following three:
(a) Revenue generation, structure and efficiency of the proposed finance regime: In principle,
nothing precludes the health services from being financed through general revenues (instead of
earnarked payroll taxes), or a combination of these two. However, the Government of the
Federation has already passed a Health Insurance Law in 1997, which becomes the practical
starting point for discussions and possible amendments. A Health Insurance Law is under
preparation in the RS.
(b) A politically acceptable and effective formula for redistribution of a percentage of insurance
revenues among Cantons or Regions. This is required if the poorer cantons or regions are to be
able to afford essential health services. It is also a source of political tension.
(c) Management of health services within each canton or region. There is a need to closely examine
the statutes, regulations and tools to ensure an effective balance between Entity-level
responsibilities for setting policies, standards and guidelines, and cantonal- or regional- level
responsibilities for management of services.

In the Federation, a Health Insurance Law was approved in December 1997, providing for most
health services to be financed from earmarked payroll taxes and devolving most health financing
responsibilities to the cantons. Although the law provides for a Federation Fund, its implementation has
proceeded so far in a way that constraint the development of an effective Federation-wide function in
revenue redistribution and regulation of cantonal Funds.  A continuation of this practice -and
implementation of the Law in its current form - would pose serious risks, principal among which are the
following:
*  Fragmentation of risk pools, particularly in the smallest cantons;
*  Wide variations in revenues and access to health services among cantons;
*  High administrative costs and inefficiencies;
*  Perpetuation of "ethnic" divisions (since the law provides for a voluntary merger of Cantonal
Insurance Funds, there is a risk of mergers along the lines of "ethnic affiliation");
*  Wide variations among cantons in the revenues per capita available for health services (See
Table lb. There is no universal agreement within the Federation on an optimum formula for
revenue generation and redistribution among cantons (the politically sensitive question of
"solidarity"); and
*  Mergers of wealthier cantonal funds, to the exclusion of the poorer funds.

However, the Federation MOH has issued in December 1998 the draft of the "Policy and Strategy of
Health Financing Reform in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina". In this comprehensive
document, the Federal MOH is stating its commitment towards sustainable health financing reform. The
aims of this reform are5:
*  to establish a uniform health care system in the Federation which will be based on the cantonal
organization as opposed to the ethnic one;
*  to develop a sustainable health financing system by means of establishing three types of health
insurance and also by mobilizing all available resources in the community for health care;
*  to control the expenditures at the macro level;
*  to develop instruments for the implementation of the health policy objectives through the
contracting process;
*  to improve institutional efficiency;
*  to promote the principles of solidarity; and
*  to promote pluralism in ownership patterns.
In particular, the policy document has considered the issues of federal solidarity, priority setting in
health care and equity, advantages of economies of scale (i.e., number of cantonal funds), as well as a
process of decentralization. Plans and activities to realize these objectives are yet to be implemented.
In RS, the main institution for health care financing is the Public Health Insurance Fund. The Fund is
in a transitional phase, with a National Office and eight branches. From January 1999, it will have a
National Office in Banja Luka and four branch offices. A new Health Insurance Law will be introduced
in the first half of 1999. The draft statutes include provisions to extend insurance cover to groups of
residents not covered under existing law, provisions for a "solidarity fund" to cover expenditures for
treatments outside the RS, hemodialysis, provisions to target user participation on higher priority services
and lower income users, together a "basic minimum package of services", which is currently being
defined. The subject of a basic minimum package of services, including political and conceptual issues,
is addressed in further detail under "Government Strategy". The main themes of planned reforms in
health financing are contained in a recently produced policy document.6
The Fund incurred a deficit of approximately DEM3.5 million in the first half of 1998. Revenues
were barely sufficient to cover salaries of health workers. The basic collection problems include the
following: (i) a high rate of unemployment; (ii) refugees and displaced persons are uninsured but have the
right to health care; (iii) the cost of health care for pensioners and their families, who number about
390,000, is about 12 times their revenues; and (iv) as of mid-1998, the RS Government had transferred to
the Fund only 40 percent of what was expected, and it "owed" the Fund an estimated DEM17 million.
The RS Government has taken several steps to address these problems. For example, it has requested
international organizations to pay insurance contributions for their employees. It intends to sign
conventions with foreign governments, requiring insurance premia to be paid by RS citizens living abroad
but with dependents in the country. Consideration will be given to hypothecating part of excise taxes on
alcohol and tobacco for the Health Insurance Fund. The overall financial status is unlikely to improve
significantly without strong and sustained economic growth.

A mismatch between health needs and the health system.
Health system organization.
The health system is weak in the primary and secondary prevention of non-communicable diseases,
and in community-based services. The pre-war health system in BiH was centralized and open-ended. It
featured a reliance on specialists, use of technology often without reference to evidence for effectiveness,
and high referral rates from general practitioners (GPs) who were neither required to possess, nor
provided with special training for the task. In primary care, service delivery was divided among many
practitioners based on age, sex and disease type or service need. In the post-war environment, these
weaknesses remain. They have been compounded by a fragmentation and lack of benchmarks in training
programs for GPs, supported by a variety of external agencies. There are no established systems for
accreditation and quality assurance. There is no systematic approach to improve the performance of
workers. The system remains input-driven, with scant attention to the development and use of modem
health system management methods. These problems remain unresolved by the intra- and immediate
post-war emergency assistance.
Health status: what are the problems?
Post-war epidemiological data are patchy. In addition to the Yugoslavia-wide pattern, the war
resulted in an unusual pattern. For the Federation alone, the estimated number of war-injured persons is
at least 200,000, just under 10 percent of the population. Of these, over 50 percent were seriously injured.
In addition, there is a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorders (the War Victims Rehabilitation
Program addresses these issues). The limited post-war data, on-going analysis of pre-war data, as well as
intensified efforts to improve the post-war database, provide the basis for making reasonable
extrapolations for planning and management. They are considered in the following paragraphs7
Table 2a below shows the top causes of loss of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in BiH from
1991, the most recent year for which a complete dataset was available8. The following four causes
accounted for 63 percent of all DALYs lost: (i) circulatory; (ii) mental illnesses; (iii) neurological
disorders; and(iv) cancer. The loss of productivity attributable to these conditions is an important
justification for improving public health and primary health care systems. In addition, there is a
persistence of humnan suffering and misery, uneven access to basic services, inequities and a service
delivery system that is ill-prepared to meet the needs of the population in terms of illnesses due to
lifestyles, primary prevention and secondary prevention. For example, tobacco-related deaths accounted
for about 10 percent of all DALYs lost ( Table 2b, Selected Risk Factors, 1990). The need to control
risk factors such as these is the operational basis for developing effective primary care and public
health interventions. Such risk factor control is needed at the levels of the individual, the
community and each Entity of BiH, using a combination of interventionsW0. Unless this is done, BiH
will face an even greater burden of preventable chronic illnesses in the medium and long term,
7 Materials presented in this section are based largely on work done in the summer of 1998 by Mr. Peter Cowley and Ms.
Veronica Vargas, in cooperation with professionals from both Entities. They are subject to revision upon refinement of the
database.
B A frequently used measure of the burden of disease is the disability adjusted life year (DALY). It is a composite measure of
death and disability, combining the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. Years of life lost from
premature mortality are estimated with respect to a standard expectation of life at each stage. Years lived with a disability are
translated into an equivalent time loss though multiplication by a set of weights that reflect reduction in functional capacity. As
such, the DALY represents an attempt to combine in a single indicator the impact of disease on mortality, morbidity and
disability.

code. For more details of computations and methodology, please refer to Annex 4.

Primary health care in the Federation and in RS is currently organized in Dom Zdravlja (DZ) and in
Ambulanta. DZs were equipped in order to deliver medium-complexity specialist diagnostic services (X-
ray, ultrasound, clinical laboratory, physiopathology, obstetrics & gynecology, occupational health,
physiotherapy, etc.). The quantity of technology installed in such facilities is rather large but often
underutilized as a result of a non-intensive use of human resources (ineffective training; specialist-led
health care system, low priority on primary care). The large number of DZs (80 in the Federation and 49
in RS) located in each municipality allows accessibility to health services by the population but leads to
redundancy of structures and equipment.

The lack of maintenance and inadequate financial resources during the war led to a substantial decline
in the state of health facilities, both in terms of buildings and in terms of installed technology. In several
DZs, new medical equipment has been provided by many donors, but with little coordination and without
attention to the recurrent cost implications.
In June 1998, a rapid appraisal of the "primary care equipment" was undertaken with support from
the World Bank. The exercise revealed wide variations among health facilities in the availability, status
and use of medical equipment. In most cases, installed equipment were obsolete, out of order due to poor
maintenance, unused due to lack of consumables, or underutilized due to lack of personnel. In other cases
(e.g., clinical laboratory), the donated equipment appeared to have solved the immediate problems; but

many doubt the viability of continued use of many of the devices with sophisticated technology since
these require very expensive consumables and maintenance.
The total replacement value of medical equipment installed in DZs was estimated at US$36 million
for both Entities13. For the 583 ambulantas in both Entities, the estimated replacement value was
approximately US$4 million. These numbers imply unsustainably high recurrent costs relative to needs
and financial resources of the country. A reasonable strategy for a sustainable approach would
include: (i) a progressive reduction of under-utilized, obsolete and complex equipment (currently
installed in DZs) and a replacement of such equipment with new, more cost-effective technology, in
line with the actual needs of Family Doctors and Nurses; and (ii) a redistribution of selected
equipment from DZs to hospitals and/or laboratories at the cantonal or regional levels).
Global costs for upgrading the ambulantas and DZs are estimated at DEM30 million in the Federation
and DEM16 million in RS. These estimates, from the rapid assessment in June 1998, must be
interpreted with caution. First, they are subject to more detailed assessments on a case-by-case basis.
Second, it is important to avoid equating primary health care with building or rehabilitating structures.
PharmaceuticalsI4.
There are no reliable data on the total market size for pharnaceuticals in BiH. According to rough
industry estimates, based on 1997 figures, the total public plus private market for drugs and medical
products in the Federation (including the demand being met through humanitarian aid, and through a
parallel "gray" market for drugs that has developed in both Entities) was about US$147 million, of which
pharmaceuticals accounted for 60 percent. Comparable market estimates were not available for RS. The
total market figure for the Federation in 1998 indicates a per capita pharmaceutical expenditure of about
$35 per annum. In comparison, the per capita expenditures in 1997 were about US$18 in Romania
(Australian Health Insurance Commission, 1998) and US$80-85 in Croatia (World Bank estimates, 1998).
The actual pharmaceutical expenditures (excluding humanitarian aid), however, were much smaller. Out-
of-pocket payments for drugs without prescriptions are unquantified, but anecdotal information suggests
that they are probably significant.
By most accounts, the parallel market dominates the formal market. The parallel market developed as
a result of the extensive smuggling of drugs across borders with RS and Yugoslavia. This unregulated
flow of drugs across the border, bypassing customs and other inspections, has important practical
implications for the drug sectors in the Federation and RS. Detailed public sector expenditures (i.e.,
MOH plus the insurance systems) were not available. However, according to the RS Health Insurance
Fund, pharmaceutical expenditures were typically about 20 percent of the Fund's total annual
expenditures, which were about US$27 per capita in 1997 and were expected to increase to US$50 per
capita in 1998.
There is no comprehensive National Drug Policy in either Entity. Both have committed themselves
to developing such a policy by 2000, with assistance from WHO and EU PHARE. In the Federation, an
Essential Drug List (EDL) was developed in 1995 with WHO assistance. This list has since undergone
three revisions and currently has 220 drugs, which are identified by their generic names. Similarly, the
RS has developed its own EDL, with about 300 drugs. However, the process of developing these EDLs
has not been sufficiently guided by a disease-based and treatment-protocol oriented approach. Entity-
13 The total replacement value is an estimate of the current market value of existing equipment, if it were replaced with new
equipment. It is different from planned investments under the Basic Health Project.

Discussion. June, 1998.

level therapeutic guidelines do not exist, although some efforts are being made in both entities, with
WHO and EU assistance. Hospital formularies have not been developed in either Entity.
There is no formal system of government price control in either Entity. The MOH in each Entity
merely registers the prices of drugs (during drug registration) in the market. Drugs registered in one
Entity can be easily transported into the other. Quality control needs attention, in terms of equipment,
personnel and implementation. Some support is being provided by the EU for this purpose.
c) Weak coordination of international donor activity in primary health care and public health.
Donor activities remain weakly coordinated at the primary health care level. This is due in part to
weak MOH capacity for coordination in both Entities, and partly due to the large number of agencies
active in the health sector - estimated at about 140 at the end of 1997. It was also due to the dominance of
"relief' or "humanitarian" assistance in the immediate post-war era, over more systemic capacity
building. The Entity MOHs are taking steps to improve the situation, as are a number of large
international agencies active in primary health care.
Government Strategy.
a) Status of work.
The post-war reconstruction and development programs in both Entities, which are supported by the
Bank, emphasize the development of a Basic Health Program. The main elements are: (i) a primary
health care based on the family medicine concept; (ii) a shift from the pre-war emphasis on large hospitals
and polyclinics towards more efficient use of outpatient facilities and home-based care; and (iii) a greater
emphasis on cost-effective public health, disease prevention and control. In the Federation, elements of
this strategy are outlined in several documents, including the following: Federation Health Program:
Health Reform and Reconstruction (January 1998); Public Health and Health Care: Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (January 1997); and a draft Strategic Health System: Plan, Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (1998). In RS, Government strategy is outlined in several documents, including
the following: Republika Srpska: Strategic Plan for Health System Reform and Reconstruction 1997-2000
(1997) and Public Health and Health Care: Republika Srpska (January 1997).
Although the principles are sound and each MOH is focused on the right objectives, the strategies
and implementation plans need greater focus to address the systemic problems. In addition, there is a
need to clearly define benchmarks, assumptions, indicative timelines andworkplans to reach at least the
same operational standard as the War Victims Rehabilitation Project (IDA Credit Number 28960, Trust
Fund Number 24035) and the Essential Hospital Services Project (IDA(ITF) Credit Number N003-0
BOS), both of which are under implementation.
b) An emerging consensus on sector policy and strategies.
The Government of each Entity is working with the World Bank, EU-PHARE and DFID to achieve
the objectives of defining sector policy and strategic plans. The near-term objectives include the
completion of the following in each Entity: (i) a detailed revenue and expenditure study of the
health sector, with the preparation of a National Health Account; (ii) studies and reports on
implementable approaches to priority setting in health; and (iii) policy documents, strategic plans
and indicative timelines for a phased approach to the rationalization of infrastructure and reform
of management systems throughout the health sector.



Page 12
The main themes of the ongoing work are as agreed with the Entity Governments under the Essential
Hospital Services project [IDA(ITF)Credit Number N003-0 BOS, Document Number T-6991-BiH,
Appendix 12, paragraph 4.3.1 .]. The most recent activities were undertaken in November and December
1998 during a six-day workshop and study tour to the Netherlands, and a three-day study tour and
workshop in Slovenia for technical experts and policy makers from both Entities. The workshops were
organized jointly by the EU-PHARE Health Finance Program and the World Bank. Drafts of the policy
papers were completed in the Slovenia workshop in the middle of December 1998. At this workshop,
Ministers of Health and other representatives of both Entities also agreed to establish a Committee for
Inter-Entity Coordination, to address health sector issues where joint work is necessary or desirable.
More specifically, the ongoing work includes the following topics:
*  Legal and institutional basis for health sector reform (in RS, for example, a draft Health Insurance
Law is under preparation and scheduled for Parliamentary consideration/approval in March,
1999. The MOH and the Health Insurance Fund have specifically requested assistance from the
Bank to ensure that the law is consistent with objectives of long-run sustainability and
efficiency);
*  Design of new hospital payment mechanisms and of strategy for achieving a slimmer, more cost-
effective hospital sector;
*  Design of a restructured primary health care system;
*  Design of a new and consistent system for monitoring indicators of access to care, quality of
health care processes, health status, and health outcomes for each Entity and sub-Entity;
X  Design of management information systems for hospitals, primary care providers, and insurance
institutions that would, in turn, provide a database for the functions of research, planing, planning
and evaluation, and preparation of inputs to a National Health Account;
*  Design of Entity-level guidelines for regulation of health services at the sub-Entity level;
*  Design of a range of incentives to encourage the delivery and use of more cost-effective health
services (a functional approach to the "basic package of health services" concept), including
epidemiological information (burden of disease), cost-effectiveness, health technology
assessment and business planning, the refinement and use of EDLs and targeted interventions, as
well a careful introduction of formal co-payments; and
* Examination of approaches to inter-Entity and intra-Entity issues of referrals and portability of
access to health services.
c) Improving core health workforce and management.
Of crucial importance are the definition and agreement by the Entity Governments and partner
agencies on a common approach to re-training of general practitioners. A single set of standards, a
common methodology, and agreement on benchmarks and curriculum objectives are all required. Equally
important is the centralization of the specialization programs at the university teaching centers. These
would be connected with regional sites where re-training activities are ongoing. This would lay the
groundwork for future community-based teachers for the specialization process. It is expected that a
formal Government decision will be made in each Entity by mid-1999, establishing these programs and
specifying the approaches.
Significant investments are required to establish a culture of professional management based on
principles of cost-effectiveness and efficiency. In addition to training, this requires the introduction of
performance incentives, a move towards outcome- or output-based measures of performance, and use of
quality assurance management techniques in clinical care. The costs associated with poor quality would
be reduced by doing things right the first time.

d) Improving donor coordination.
Both Entities are working to improve coordination among the large number of donors. In RS, a
Health Strategy and Coordination Unit was established in mid- 1998 to serve this purpose. The Federation
MOH is taking similar steps in this regard. There have been some significant improvements in 1998 in
terms of donor coordination in primary health care. The collaborating organizations include EU-PHARE,
DFID, IOM, ICRC and WHO, and the World Bank (through direct support for the Entity MOHs and
through the International Facilitators' Group (IFG), established in 1997 at the Bank's initiative).
World Bank Assistance
a) Investment operations and advisory services.
Three operations supported by the Bank were envisaged in the early stages of assistance to the health
sector of the Federation. As the first step in addressing the extensive needs, a new and more cost-
effective approach to physical and psycho-social rehabilitation services was developed by the Federation
MOH, with assistance from the Bank, WHO and others. The Project, with a total cost of US$30.0
million, was approved by the Board of Directors of the World Bank on May 16, 1996, and is being
financed as the first reconstruction initiative in the health sector: the War Victims Rehabilitation
(WVR) Project.
The second operation is the ongoing Essential Hospital Services (EHS) Project, which covers both
Entities and focuses on the most urgent needs in the hospital sub-sector as well as support for the reform
of the health finance system. The rationale for selecting this as the second operation included: (i) the
need to address quickly the most pressing hospital needs within a rational framework, thereby reducing
the risk that uncoordinated and expensive investments in the health sector would jeopardize sustainability;
(ii) the demonstrated commitment of the MOH of each Entity to the operation; and (iii) the uncertainty
that prevailed in 1996 about the future organization of primary health care while the strategic options for
a third operation -- the Basic Health Project (BHP) -- were being defined through a process led by the
MOH of each entity. It was envisaged that a Bank-supported operation, focusing on selected priority
components of a broader Basic Health Program, would be the third in a planned series of three
operations. The concept of a Basic Health Program, initially outlined in 1996 in the WVR Project
document (Technical Annex), has gained broader acceptance among several agencies supporting the
MOHs, including the CIDA-financed Queen's University Family Medicine Development Program in
BiH, WHO, IOM, MSF-Belgium and EU PHARE. Hence, the Bank will support both Entities as part of a
larger process, and with a clearly defined operational framework, through this BHP.
b) Adjustment operation.
In 1996, it was envisaged that the Transition Assistance Credit for the Federation (TAC, Report No.
P-691 I-BIH, November 19, 1996) would provide financial support and legal leverage to create a
sustainable health finance system. The specific actions are detailed in paragraphs 40-45, in Annex II and
in the policy matrix of the report cited above. Perhaps the most crucial expectation was that in
paragraph 44:
"A fixed nominal amount -- initially a maximum of DM10 per month -- will be paid into the
Federation Health Fund from the health insurance contributions of each employee within the
Federation. For at least nine months beginning in October 1996, the Federation Government will
supplement these deposits with matching payments on a one-for-one basis, up to a limit of DM3.3
million per month. The Federation would finance its payments into this Fund using donor resources
that provide BOP and fiscal support, including the TAC, until such time as the tax base has



Page 14
sufficiently expanded to cover the funding of the first tier. The combined funds from both sources
would be divided on a per capita basis and returned to the cantons, to be used to finance basic health
care services under Tier 1. This scheme would have two advantages. First, a Federation-wide
funding scheme would avoid the inherent fragility of canton-based finance for the first tier. Second,
it would reduce the administrative cost associated with a canton-based administration for the
financing of the first tier, and would broaden the risk pool."
While the technical basis for this scheme was conceptually sound, its implementation was constrained
by the political complexities of post-war BiH. Health sector financing was being driven by a broader
political agenda. This included responding to the extensive pressure from both domestic and international
sources to create rapidly a governance structure in which the various levels of government were not
internally in discord over policies. By implication, the only way to address divisive health policy issues
was to devolve responsibility for them to the cantonal level, where equity issues could be finessed and
postponed rather than addressed. Partly as a result of these political constraints, the TAC recorded
minimal achievements in the health sector.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
a) Absence of a sustainable health finance regime.
This affects the entire health system and is being addressed through the health finance reform
component of the EHS Project. In each Entity, work is in progress on a health sector revenue and
expenditure review, projections of sector revenues and expenditures using various assumptions, and
definition of health services to be covered by health insurance. The proposed Project will focus on
implementing key recommendations expected from ongoing studies and policy discussions identified in
Section B2 (Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy). The operational focus of the Project will
include a carefully planned and phased introduction, in each Entity, of health services management
informed by considerations of health gains, cost-effectiveness and improved efficiency. Much of this
requires introducing incentives and new reimbursement mechanisms to improve performance at the
service delivery level, contracting of services, expanding the role of the private sector in service delivery,
greater autonomy (and bearing of financial risks) for the cantons and health care facilities, and increased
responsiveness to the clients' needs. It must be noted that the BHP is concerned with developing a
cost-effective primary health care system. It is not intended to be the vehicle for resolving issues of
revenue generation and public finance per se.
b) A mismatch between health needs and the health service delivery system.
This will be resolved through the development of an efficient system for delivering the most cost-
effective interventions. It will include: primary health care (development of family medicine, upgrading
and rationalization of infrastructure and equipment, management training and capacity building,
management and performance incentives to increase productivity); public health and disease control
(institutional support, public health innovation grants); and a quality assurance initiative.
c) Fragmentation of international donor activity in primary health care and public health.
At the initiative of the World Bank, an International Facilitators Group was established in December
1997 to help the MOHs develop a Basic Health Program for both Entities. The Group has had some
success but needs to be strengthened. Equally important is the effort being made by each Entity MOH to



Page 15
improve its formal donor coordination mechanisms. The proposed Project interfaces, but does not
overlap with several ongoing activities in primary health care and public health.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The Project was derived from a broader program of each Entity (see Table 3 below). Program
preparation is a joint responsibility of each Entity MOH, with support from partner institutions,NGOs
and major international agencies, including the UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, ICRC, EU, the Government of
Italy, CIDA through the Queen's University, MSF-Belgium and the IOM. Representatives of and/or
consultants to these organizations participated, to varying degrees, in consultations on project design held
in Sarajevo in September 1997, and in various consultations since them. The following project
description reflects broad agreements reached during those consultations, and specific agreements with
the Entity MOHs. They are informed by the need for selectivity in the face of multiple and urgent needs.
IDA financing will cover top priority components of this Project. If the needed co-financing were not
available for any reason, the Project scope would be reduced to fit within the available funds, with
priority given to those components to be financed through IDA. Such a reduction will not in any case
reduce the viability of the Project, since its design was based on functional sub-units within the Project.
Other modules of the Program are being prepared but will be implemented through parallel financing.
These would consist mainly of those aspects in which specialized agencies have a comparative advantage,
or in which activities are already underway. For example, vertical programs focusing on child nutrition,
family planning, control of sexually transmitted diseases, as well as detailed technical assistance for
pharmaceutical sector reform would be implemented with the assistance of agencies such as UNICEF,
WHO, MSF, IJNDP and EU-PHARE. As much as possible, activities will be undertaken in synergy or
in geographically separate areas to avoid wasteful gaps and overlaps.

The Project is a single operation with two parts, one for each Entity - the Federation and the RS,
respectively. This section presents the overall project design for both Entities by component and sub-
component. For each Entity, detailed descriptions, estimated costs and procurement arrangements are
presented in the Annexes.

country. In order to develop and test the
full range of activities requiredfor
effectiveness, implementation under the
project will concentrate on selected pilot
sites (cantons in the Federation, regions in
the RS), rather than try to cover the entire
country. The pilots will be evaluated.
Extension of activities will be guided by the
findings of the evaluation. (See Annex 2a
and Annex 2b for details of pilot sites)
This component will include four sub-

3. Benefits and target population:
The proposed Project will help to implement, in the areas of primary health care and public health,
priority components of the larger Entity programs. It will help to introduce rigorous standards and
professionalism into the management of the health system, and foster a coordinated approach to
investments at the primary care level. By constraining planned investments to those required to deliver
affordable health services, it will limit the recurrent cost consequences of short-term investments. It will
focus attention on efficiency, and de-emphasize investments in civil works and equipment alone.
Primary health care will focus on the most essential health services at the level of the individual and
the family. It will address an effective range of care for the most economically and epidemiologically
vulnerable. More specifically, the Project will have the following benefits:
a) improve health and reduced human suffering, by reducing epidemiological risks of avoidable
illnesses and premature deaths;
b) prevent the BiH health system from getting on to a high-cost trajectory in which enormous
resources would be required for treating preventable illnesses;
c) alleviate poverty, by minimizing lost production due to avoidable illnesses and premature deaths;
and
d) strengthen management capacity for a more cost-effective health system than the pre-war
situation.
The target groups are the most vulnerable in terms of risks of diseases and premature deaths, as
indicated in Section B2. Estimates of attributable health benefits are shown in Annex 4.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project Management and Coordination. The proposed Project is a single operation with two parts,
one in each Entity, as in the ongoing EHS Project. The MOH of each Entity will be the implementing
agency for the Project In the RS, the Project will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) covering all IDA-supported activities in the health sector, with TORs satisfactory to IDA. In the
Federation, it will be implemented by a Project Management Unit (PMU), including a Director for the
Basic Health Project and with TORs satisfactory to IDA. (See Annexes 2a and 2b for detailed project
description). In view of the emphasis on management system development and professional training, in
addition to core requirements for effective financial management and procurement support, the PCU and
the PMU will each have three full-time equivalent health professionals with a minimum of M.D., M.P.H
or its equivalent. All PCU and PMU appointments will be based on Terms of Reference satisfactory to
IDA.
Project Operational Manual (POM). A POM, one for each Entity, is being prepared to facilitate the
management and implementation of the project. The POM includes: (i) detailed project objectives and
description; (ii) key implementation issues, and strategies; (iii) summary of procedures for monitoring
project implementation; (iv) guidelines for processing withdrawal applications under the Credit;
(v) methods of procurement to be followed as per the Procurement Schedule in the Credit Agreement;
(vi) guidelines for the use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) and overall project funds; (vii) procedures
for using the Special Account, including those for replenishment; and (viii) sample bidding documents
and contract for national shopping of civil works. The POMs are being prepared by both the Entities with
technical assistance from IDA. Both the Entities will be required to organize training for the project staff
in order to ensure an understanding of the procedures specified in the POMs. Assurances were received
at Negotiations that the POM would be completed and maintained in a form satisfactory to IDA.

5. Disbursement Mechanisms:
The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years. The disbursement
profile for the Project has been based on experience gained during the previous two Bank-funded projects
within the health sector in BiH. The Project has been designed within the capacity of the Federation-
MOH and RS-MOH to execute over a three-year period. The Closing Date will be August 30, 2002. A
summary of the disbursement plan is shown on page 1 of this document.
By effectiveness, an acceptable financial management system (FMS) will have been put in place.
Disbursements will start using traditional disbursement methods - Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
reimbursements, direct payment, etc. After the PCU/PMU has gained experience with the FMS and
reporting under project management reports (PMRs), and provided that an improved FMS is reviewed
and found satisfactory by the Bank, the Project will move to PMR-based disbursements.  All
disbursements against contracts for goods exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, and services and training
for consulting firms and for individual consultants will be fully documented. Disbursements will be made
against SOEs for contracts for: goods less than US$50,000 equivalent, except for the first five contracts
in each entity; works less than US$50,000 equivalent, except for the first five contracts in each pilot
canton (Federation) or region (RS); and all incremental operating expenditures. This documentation will
be made available for the required audit as well as to the Bank supervision mission, and will be retained
by the PCU or PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which
the last disbursement was made. The processing, disbursement and monitoring of the allocations of the
proceeds of the IDA Credit and Borrower counterpart financing will be managed by both the PCU or
PMU in each Entity, in coordination and consultation with the Entity Ministry of Finance.
Special Accounts. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish,
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, two separate Special Accounts,
A and B, denominated in Deustche Marks for the Federation-PMU and the RS-PCU, respectively. The
authorized allocation for Special Account A (for Federation-PMU) will be DEM1,100,000 and for Special
Account B (RS-PCU) will be DEM550,000.
6. ProjectAudi Reporting and Evaluation:
Finance, Accounting and AuditingArrangements.
Each entity will be responsible for its own financial management of the project (see Annex 7 for
detailedfinancial management arrangements). The Financial and Accounting Officer in the PMU and
PCU will design a Project and Financial Management Information System (MIS) which will include,
inter alia, an accounting and control module with the capability to record and retrieve, in a timely
manner, all financial transactions under the project. The MIS will comply with internationally accepted
standards and will: (i) reliably record and report all assets, liabilities, and financial transactions of the
project; and (ii) provide reliable financial information for managing and monitoring project activities.
The accounting module will have a Chart of Accounts, which will reflect the sources of funds; it will be
broken down into different types of expenditures by type and component. Furthermore, it will provide
information on the receipt and use of funds and will be able to produce financial reports comparing
budget with actual expenditures at any given time. The system will be capable of providing financial data
to measure performance when linked to the outputs of the project. Both the PMU and the PCU will
maintain separate consolidated accounts for their respective parts and will ensure appropriate accounting
of the funds provided. Each entity will prepare PMRs on a quarterly basis. These reports will include
financial statements, project progress reports and procurement management reports. The PMR will be in
a format discussed during negotiations and will follow examples given in the Bank's LACI
Implementation Handbook. The Special Accounts will be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for



Page 21
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982) and the
Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook, 1995. The audit reports will be of such scope
and details as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor,
acceptable to the Bank, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made
from the credit, and SOEs which will be included in the audit reports accompanying the financial
statements. The audited financial statements of the Special Accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal
year, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified SOEs, will be
sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
Mid-Term Review.
At the time of the estimated mid-point of the project -April 2001, the Borrower will be required to
undertake a mid-term review of the implementation of the project. This review will be undertaken in
consultation with, and in a manner satisfactory to, the Bank. ByJuly 31, 2001, the Borrower will prepare
and furnish to the Bank a report regarding the results of the mid-term review, including progress achieved
in the implementation of the project and measures recommended to ensure the achievement of the
project's operation and development objectives during the remaining of the project period.
Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
Both Entities (PMU/PCU) will prepare in collaboration with the Bank, an ICR upon Project
completion, and in any event, not later than six months after final disbursement of the Credit proceeds.
The ICR will include an assessment of the execution of the project, costs and benefits derived or to be
derived, the performance of the Borrower, the Bank and other agencies involved in project
implementation, regarding their respective obligations and accomplishments, and including lessons
learned. The ICR will also include plans for the future operation of the facilities which had been financed
under the project, including proposed indicators to monitor and evaluate future operations.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
Project monitoring and evaluation will be carried out in five main areas: (a) procurement and physical
delivery of goods; (b) physical implementation of project activities; (c) impact on service delivery;
(d) financial management and control of project funds; and (e) capacity building under the project.
As noted in Annex 1, the final set of objectively verifiable (quantitative) indicators were agreed upon
during Negotiations.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Several alternatives were considered during project design and preparation. The considerations
related not only to overall structure, but also to individual components and implementation arrangements.
a) No project (a cessation of IDA support to the health sector in BiH) or a non-lending operation only.
There is no persuasive evidence to support this approach. At the inception of Bank support for the
health sector, it was determined that the post-war reconstruction and reform work would be done through
three operations, each of which would be a part of a larger program. The Memoranda of the President (of
IDA) for each of the first two projects (WVR Project and EHS Project) were explicit about the Bank's
health sector support strategy.  Overall, after slow starts, the first two projects are progressing
satisfactorily, despite the well-known challenges of implementation in BiH. By helping to define the



Page 22
post-war program, and supporting its implementation, IDA has earned credibility with the health sector in
each Entity, and leverage among partner agencies beyond its total financial commitments of US$25
million for the on-going projects. It should be noted that this amount is a small fraction of the estimated
total commitments to the health sector. It has helped bring about convergence of approaches in the first
two programs. A similar level of coherence is being established for the Basic Health Program. This is a
justification for the proposed Project, which is a part of a broader Program.
When policy dialogue began on this operation in the spring of 1997, it was understood by IDA and
the MOHs that it could be a non-lending operation. The Federation MOH invited IDA technical support
(letter of April 1997) regardless of the prospects for IDA financing. At the same time, it is clear that
partner agencies/NGOs are unlikely to give much credence to an IDA-supported framework unless it is
accompanied by IDA financing. There would be a perception that IDA had no business trying to
influence a sector to which it was not committing funds. In sum, while intellectual discourse and
persuasion have been valuable tools in BiH, financial leverage is required for full effect on policy.
b) A smaller project, with either public health or primary health care alone.
This was rejected because it would fail to develop a systemic approach to health sector development.
All the components of the proposed Project are necessary in an effective system.
c) A comprehensive project embracing all needs identified in Section B2.
This would be impossible to manage effectively, given the modest implementation capacity. It is
tempting to include more components in this Project, e.g., (i) pharmaceuticals - policy, regulation,
quality assurance, rational use of drugs, and (ii) nursing - curriculum development, training, deployment,
integration (as professionals) into family medicine and nursing practices.  Experience from  other
countries, the sheer complexity of the BiH environment, as well experiences from the first two health
sector operations in BiH, led to a more selective approach. IDA will use this Project to leverage inputs
from  other donors in support of such  activities, but will not be directly responsible for their
implementation.
d) A reconstruction of the pre-war health centers and polyclinics, delivery the same services in thesame
way:
This would be the easiest approach from a political perspective. It would avoid the pains that come
with the re-orientation towards a more efficient system for delivering cost-effective services,
professionalization of primary care specialty (Family Doctors) and a more disciplined approach to
resource management. It was rejected because of the potential for continued inefficiencies.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design:
a) An emphasis on investment criteria and ownership by the sub-Entity level.
The WVYR Project emphasized the criteria for investment and left the responsibility for selecting the
sites of community-based rehabilitation centers to the cantons. This worked quite well.
b) A needfor effective implementation units and supportfrom IDA during implementation.
The PIUs for the ongoing projects started out as weak units and now have competencies for managing
projects, as well as a greater familiarity with IDA. IDA has learned that close support is a key to
successful implementation, especially in a context where the need for coordination is strong and the
Government is not able to fulfill the required functions by itself. As a result, the BHP is fairly simple;
experienced PIU personnel will be retained, and the Bank will promote the continuation of technical
assistance from partner agencies of demonstrable competence. The Resident Mission in Sarajevo will
include a full-time equivalent of locally recruited health specialist. This is in addition to a project officer
whose main responsibilities will be in the area of procurement support and operations management.



Page 24
Effective consultations with NGOs and partner agencies.
The approach helped to establish broad acceptance for the first two operations. It will be continued
during the proposed Project. For example, the International Facilitators Group will: (i) provide a
professional reference point for donors and NGOs; (ii) help to coordinate proposed activities in primary
health care and public health to achieve a coherent vision; ( iii) brief potential donors on health systems
issues and priorities; (iv) seek opportunities for co-ordination, collaboration and complementarily
between projects involved in basic health care; and (v) assist donors in presenting their proposals to the
MOHs.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
* Both MOHs have prepared post-war development plans emphasizing primary health care.
* The Federation MOH has passed a "Law on Ban on Use of Tobacco Products".
* Both Entities have established committees to oversee primary health care development.
* Both Entities are seeking donor financing from other sources for primary health care.
S. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank will: (i) provide and/or facilitate access to, and encourage the adaptation of, relevant
international experiences from within and outside the other transition economies, based partly on lessons
from Bank-supported initiatives; (ii) facilitate a coalition of domestic and external stakeholders in support
of the goals of the BHP - and the broader Program of which it is a part; and (iii) help mobilize funds from
other agencies for the Program.
E: Summary Project Analyses
(Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 9)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
(See Annex 4 for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)
Primary health care is aimed at providing the most cost-effective health interventions to treat and/or
prevent health problems. Based on regional trends, the professional literature and local evidence on the
cost-effectiveness of health interventions, the proposed interventions are among the most cost-effective.
More detailed quantitative estimates of project costs and effectiveness are contained in Annex 4.

3. Technical:
See Annex 4: Project Justification and Summary Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.



Page 25
4. Institutional:
Executing agencies: The Executing agency in each Entity is the MOH. Project management:
Project management will be the responsibility of the PCU (in RS) or PMU (in the Federation). The
institutional context varies markedly between the two Entities.
* The RS has a simpler institutional framework: central government institutions, with branches at the
regional and/or municipal levels. Hence, the principal needs are to reinforce community-level
involvement (as recognized in Section E5), ensure local ownership (recognized in the design of the
Public Health Innovation Grants, Sub-Component 2.2) and develop effective management capacity
in addition to the strong central leadership. The RS Government has selected the Banja Luka and
Zvornik regions as pilot sites, based on criteria summarized in Annex 2B.
* The Federation has a more complex Federal structure of ten cantons. As a result, in addition to the
needs recognized for the RS, explicit agreements are required between the Governments at the
cantonal and Federal levels in terms of the sites of pilots. The Federal Government has made a
preliminary selection of three pilot cantons: Tuzla, Neretva and West Herzegovina. Conditions for
effective implementation of pilots have been developed and are summarized in Annex 2A. The
Federal Government has agreed that if these three pilot cantons do not meet these conditions,
alternative cantons will be used as pilot sites.
5. Social:
According to the interim findings of a Social Assessment undertaken in BiH in 1998, the real costs of
health care in BiH need to be explored further to uncover the extra hidden costs that people pay for
treatment. There are indications of resistance to user fees, and a limited understanding of value obtained
for money. Re-educating the population may increase understanding that it is necessary to pay for
services to ensure adequate quality and accessibility. Health care reform is necessary, together with a
shift in the public's attitude to payment for and accessing of services. [Source: Bosnia and Herzegovina
Countiy Unit. Social Assessment of the Impact of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Focus Group
Discussion Report. July 30, 1998]. These qualitative findings are in line with the international literature.
In addition, they support anecdotal information on "under-the-table payments".
The proposed Basic Health Project would focus on the most essential health services at the level of
the individual and the family. It would address a cost-effective range of care for the most economically
and epidemiologically vulnerable, to be delivered through a responsive system of family medicine and
nursing.
During appraisal, both Entity MOHs made commitments to undertake, no later than September 1999,
a more detailed study of the public perceptions, expectations, willingness and ability to pay for health
services (See Annex 2c for Draft TORs). The findings will be useful for more specific planning and
management of the health sector in a client-responsive manner as envisaged under the proposed BHP.
They will also serve as tools for information and advocacy in support of a reform of the health sector.

6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category []A  []B  [X] C
Justification/Rationale for category rating. No adverse environmental effects are anticipated. The
Project will follow accepted IDA procedures. All project activities will incorporate appropriate and safe
disposal of wastes.
7. Participatory approach.
Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups: The Project was prepared over a period of more than
one year, in consultation with stakeholders at the Entity, sub-Entity and service delivery levels. It reflects
the real health needs. It also takes into account the need for local initiatives and a participatory approach
to health care delivery; hence the emphasis on family medicine, the provision for community surveys of
risk factors and youths, as well as the Public Health Innovation Grants (see Annex 2a and 2b). Entity-
level MOHs and sub-Entity level managers and workers are members of Working Groups. NGOs and
international agencies contributed to the ideas in this Project during consultative sessions.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The following factors will influence the sustainability of the BHP:
(a) macroeconomic growth;
(b) political stability;
(c) Government willingness to implement a disciplined approach to health sector development based
on considerations of efficiency and cost-effectiveness;
(d) local capacity for effective implementation; and
(e) Bank willingness to engage in a near-term, iterative process of capacity building in the sector.

Annex 2a
Bosnia and Herzegovina: Basic Health Project
Project Description
Federation of BiH
Project Component 1 - Primary Health Care (US$6.7 million).
Strategic plans, curriculum development and implementation guidelines will be prepared for
use in the whole country. In order to develop and test the full range of activities required for
effectiveness, implementation under the project will concentrate on selected pilot sites
(cantons in the Federation), rather than try to cover the entire Entity.
The component will aim to establish a framework for primary care within a global referral
system, which will have the following attributes:
*  The Family Doctor as the Gatekeeper or point of first contact with the health care
system: To ensure accessibility to the system for patients, efficient use of resources and
the coordination of care or case management. It will help to develop regulations and
legislation to ensure accessibility to, and enforcement of, the gatekeeper function.
*  Longitudinal care and continuity of care: This is an essential feature of a well-developed
system in family medicine. It requires a patient appointment system that provides access
and availability. Benefits are gained through the development of a personal relationship
between doctor and patient over time regardless of the type of the problem or whether a
problem exists. It requires physical changes to work environment to allow privacy and
building of confidential relationships.  Hence, any civil works reconstruction or
rehabilitation will focus on the practicalities of the activities to be undertaken, not merely
on normative standards for the sizes of rooms, etc.
*  Comprehensiveness of care: The family doctor, together with other members of the
family medicine team, will be specifically educated to manage undifferentiated patient
problems and to provide a broad range of services regardless of age, sex or problem type.
This includes the traditional spectrum of prevention, health promotion and education,
diagnosis and management, and rehabilitative and counseling services. It also implies the
ability to recognize a problem beyond one's scope and the knowledge of how to arrange
for further care. The family doctor requires not only education but also appropriate
equipment and supplies to provide the services expected of him by the local health care
system. As part of a health team, the family doctor organizes patient care to make
optimum use of team members. There is a need for a standardized curriculum, currently
being developed with support from Queen's University in Canada, for all projects that
speak to a realistic target of functions for the general practitioners (GPs) undergoing
training. This is not the specialization program per se, but the training program for GPs,
leading to specialization.
*  Coordination of care: The essence of coordinating care of a patient is the availability of
accurate information about prior problems and services. That information is taken into
account when deciding the most effective current care needs. The use of problem-
oriented medical records is essential to this activity (simple and effective, not necessarily



Page 37
computerized). There must also be a system for the effective referral of patients to
consultants. This avoids duplication and unnecessary procedures while at the same time
permitting patient advocacy and effective case management. The effective family doctor:
(a) uses evidence from medical research to decide on the provision of laboratory,
investigative and consultant services; (b) reduces the need for hospital beds;
(c) prescribes pharmaceuticals wisely and only when necessary; and (d) makes maximum
use of community-based services, nurses and allied health staff.
Selection of Pilot Sites
Sub-Components 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 will be carried out in three pilot Cantons. The Federation
MOH, in consultation with cantonal officials, has selected Tuzla, West Herzegovina, and
Neretva cantons as pilot sites. A total of 30 ambulantas from these Cantons are expected to
participate, covering 60 family medicine teams. In order to ensure effective implementation, it
will be important for these cantons to meet a number of conditions before pilot activities begin.
1. A reasonably integrated, functional health system exists within the canton. (With
sufficient number of existing ambulantas/DZs to accommodate the planned family
medicine teams under the project in the canton, a Cantonal Hospital for referrals in the
canton, or if outside the canton, with existing referral functions and a formal agreement to
continue providing the same referral services throughout the duration of the project.
2. The canton has sufficient population size and number of GPs and other primary care staff
to achieve benefits from investment in canton/ region institutional capacity (minimum
population 100,000).
3. Participating ambulanta, DZs and Fund offices have adequate infrastructure and staff to
capture, communicate and analyze data, and base-line data to enable evaluation of the
effects of the pilot (existence of baseline population data by municipality and
demographics, trained staff to maintain database).
4. The Health Insurance Fund in the canton has adequate financial management and
administrative systems, including validated register of patient registration with family
medicine teams linked to payment system; and has implemented contracts between the
Fund and family medicine providers.
5. The cantonal Governor, Minister of Health and Director of Health Insurance Fund agree
(formally) to objectives and conditions of pilot, are willing to work with and share
information with the Federation MOH and Fund and PMU on the activities and results of
the pilot, and are willing to make changes to organization of primary care and to provider
payment systems as envisaged in the project.
6. Staff in participating ambulanta and DZs have sufficient education, experience and
motivation already to benefit from additional training and work with new payment
system.
7. In each cantonal MOH and Fund, someone is designated as the person responsible for
local implementation of the pilot activities, who will act as a liaison point with the
Federation Fund and the PMU.
8. The canton passes the necessary legislation and regulations to support changes to family
medicine and provider payment.
9. A local implementation plan is prepared for local activities under Sub-Components 1.1,
1.2 and 1.3 of the project within 3 months of the project becoming effective
If the conditions listed above are not met by the cantons within three (3) months of the
Project becoming effective, alternative pilot sites will be considered.

Sub-Component 1.1. Development of Family Medicine (US$1.1 million).
This Sub-Component will support minor civil works and equipment for Family Medicine
Departments in the Universities of Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar. It will also support planning,
curriculum development (for training of nurses and other non-doctor members of the family
medicine team), review of legislation and regulation concerning qualifications of primary health
care staff, provision of learning materials for training for all members of the family medicine
team in the pilot sites, incremental operating costs for trainees (travel, accommodation, per diem,
excluding salaries) and implementation of training programs in family medicine. Much of the
conceptual basis for this Sub-Component is derived from the Queen's University Family
Medicine Development Program in BiH, funded by the CIDA, which is already assisting the
Entities to develop a curriculum for family doctor training. It will also take into account, but not
replicate, the collective experience on a range of training programs of varying definition and
quality. The objective is to help develop a system that is locally relevant, effective and
affordable. The pre-war health care system in BiH was relatively centralized, open-ended and
less cost-effective. It featured: (a) a reliance on specialists in large institutions, (b) use of
technology often without reference to evidence for effectiveness, and ( c) high referral rates from
general practitioners who neither had nor were required to possess special training for this task.
Activities to be supported and inputs to be provided  under this Sub-Component are the
following:
*  Technical assistance for regulations and legislation of specialization programs in Family
Medicine: This will be undertaken with technical assistance by a Ministerial Committee
on Family Medicine in collaboration with the Faculties Medicine in Sarajevo, Mostar
and Tuzla.
*  Technical assistance for curriculum  development for nurses and other non-doctor
members of the family medicine team. Training is likely to be a 6-9 month part time
program. (Queens University is already developing a two-stream, single-track
specialization program, including standards, benchmarks and certification procedures, in
which the two groups can apply for specialization: those with work experience and
completion of approved training program, or those with existing specialization in another
field of primary health care. This group can complete specialization in 2 years. All other
doctors must complete the 3-year program.)
* Learning materials: books, library resources translation.
* Civil works: refurbishment of premises for Family Medicine Departments.
* Equipment: office and classroom furniture: audio-visual equipment, basic laboratory
materials.
* Workshops, per diem, travel and accommodation costs (excluding salaries) for the first
cohort of trainees.
Sub-Component 1.2. Infrastructure and Equipment (US$4.0 million).
This Sub-Component will provide, on the basis of rational needs, limited civil works, medical
equipment (laboratory and other diagnostic) and incremental operating costs (excluding
salaries) to enable effective functions of about 60 (sixty) Family Medicine Teams in the pilot
Cantons of the Federation.



Page 39
Sub-Component 1.3. Management Training and Capacity Building (US$ 1.0 million).
This Sub-Component will provide technical assistance, equipment, limited civil works and
incremental operating costs for:
(a) formulation of regulations and legislation to establish accredited health management
training programs and professionalize the management of health services,
(b) institutional support for curriculum development and training of faculty for short-term
management training programs and a Masters degree program in health services
management; and
(c) the actual training of current health service managers in short courses. Short course
training will be designed to form modules that could later be recognized as a course
credit in the Masters degree. It is beyond the scope of this project to meet all of the costs
of establishing the full Masters degree program, so the project will concentrate on
regulation, curriculum development, and agreement among participating universities on
standards and accreditation.
The Sub-Component will seek to address the inadequacies of health management and
administration being undertaken almost exclusively by doctors and nurses, and lay foundations
for future strengthening of the skill base in management and finance.
It is expected that three sites will participate in the program for management training: the
Universities of Sarajevo, Mostar and Tuzla. Provision of short-course training will be by the
Management and Information Technologies Center, Sarajevo (MIT Center), under contract to the
MOH. The contract will be managed by the PMU. The PMU will identify, in consultation with
the MOH, regional and non-governmental agencies, and potential candidates for training.
Candidates will be required to meet admission standards established by the training institutions.
The following is an estimate of the overall implementation plan during the 3-year life of the
Project:
Year 1. Enabling regulations and legislation. Curriculum development. Preparation of a
Strategic and Business Plan (for Masters degree program), civil works and
equipment for Center for Health Management. Provision of short-course training
to current managers.
Year 2. Establishment of institutional relationships. Further curriculum development and
training of faculty for the Masters degree program.
Year 3.  Implementation of first graduate-level training programs.  Assessment of
implementation status.
Sub-Component 1.4. Management and Performance Incentives (US$0.6 million).
This Sub-Component will build on the development of contracting, patient registration and
capitation payment which are being developed by the MOH with the support of the PHARE
program and the IDA-supported EHS Project. Current Federation MOH policy papers plan to
introduce capitation contracts for family medicine from January 2000. If this occurs, the Project
will support the refinement and further development of new systems for remuneration of
primary care physicians, including but not limited to weighted capitation within a global budget
cap for defined pilot areas. If Federation plans are delayed, the Project may instead pilot first-
phase implementation of capitation contracts. The weighted formula will include population of



Page 40
registered clients, simplified needs index, geographic variations (urban , rural, under-served
areas) and professional qualifications of providers. Subject to evaluation, the new methods and
tools could be adapted for wider geographical use and for a wider range of health sector workers.
Effective changes in the system for remunerating doctors require effective contracting with
minimal increases in administrative complexity. Contracting will be developed not as an end in
itself, but as a means by which the parties can make clear expectations, rights and responsibilities,
and formalize the agreement.
Technical assistance, equipment, workshops and incremental operating costs, (excluding
funds for remuneration) will be provided for:
a. Developing, implementing and evaluating a payment formula combining capitation with
incentives for appropriate prescription and referral, using actual Federation cost and
activity data;
b. Piloting computerization of family practitioner patient registers, and Fund records and
payment systems to support robust financial control and audit;
c. Development of a series of minimum quality standards to be contained in contracts;
d. Testing to ensure that adequate monitoring systems are in place such that contract
variations can be resolved;
e. Workshops and an information campaign for family medicine staff to explain the
changes, and seek feedback and support;
f. Training Federation Fund staff to further develop and update the payment formulae; and
g. Training Cantonal Fund staff to administer robust systems of monitoring, control and
audit of payment methods and contract performance.
Project Component 2 - Public Health and Disease Control (US$1. 6 million).
This Component will support capacity building, planning and implementation of
interventions for the prevention and control of diseases with significant impact on the burden of
disease (Sub-Component 2.1). It will be implemented, on behalf of the MOH of each Entity, by
the Institute of Public Health (IPH) of each Entity. The Public Health Innovation Grants (Sub-
Component 2.2) will be implemented jointly by the IPH and the PMU, under terms of reference
and management procedures acceptable to IDA.
Sub-Component 2.1. Institutional Support (US$ 1.4 million).
This Sub-Component will support:
* technical and management training in the IPH;
* Surveillance and Monitoring System (mortality data, NCD risk factor survey, children and
youth survey);
* upgrading of the information system for mortality data by International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) codes; and
* Tobacco Control Strategy.
2.1.1. Surveillance and Monitoring System:
a. Mortality Data. The aim is to develop an information system for mortality data by ICD
codes. It will include technical assistance, supplies and incremental operating costs for:
* Workgroups and workshops to develop consensus on objectives, specifications and
organizational provisions;



Page 41
* Design of the system;
* Piloting the system;
* Training in processing of all aspects and report generation;
* Provision of computer system and telecommunications equipment of limited scope; and
* Production and distribution of the first generation of statistical reports.
b. Surveys of risk (i) riskfactors for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and (ii) health status,
service utilization and needs.. NCD accounts for a significant proportion of the disease burden
(Cowley, 1998). Their treatments consume significant resources. The aim is to establish a
baseline for planning, targeting and (outcome) evaluation of integrated risk factor interventions at
a population level.  This requires the implementation population surveys in statistically
representative samples, of about 2,000 to 3,000 individuals for each entity. (Caveat: the sample
sizes assume that estimates of prevalence are required at the Federation or at the RS levels. The
sample size suggested is not large enough to allow breakdowns by regions in RS and by cantons
in the Federation. If breakdowns by regions or cantons are required the survey can become
prohibitively expensive, since essentially a sample size of about 2,000 to 3,000 will be required
for each such jurisdictional breakdown - regardless of the population size of the cantons).
Sampling issues - including sampling frame and size - are to be further examined and detailed in
the Project Operations Manual.
The results of the survey will support directly the planning and evaluation the following
projects: Tobacco Control Strategy; Hypertension Prevention and Control; Diabetes Prevention
and Control; Countrywide Integrated Non-communicable Disease Program (CINDI). In addition,
the information that will be gathered health status, service utilization, needs, and public
awareness will be useful to design various aspects of health services, health promotion and public
health communication
Specific activities to be supported include:
* Technical working group meetings;.
. Surveys- design and execution;
* Training;
* Equipment acquisition (which may later be used in the public health units or Ambulantas);
* Design of the database;
* Field operations and laboratory analysis (including blood lipid analyses);
* Statistical data processing; and
* Report publication and dissemination.
c. Children and Youth Survey. The onset of risk factors starts early in life and there is a dearth
of information on lifestyle habits of children and youth. The aim of this Sub-Component is to
develop a database for planning and evaluation, by surveying children and teenagers (ages 12-
18) with respect to lifestyle habits, including substance use, dietary and exercise habits, peer
relations and relations with parents, mental health issues and self-esteem and resilience related
issues. Schools may constitute efficient clusters to design the probability sample. It may be
appropriate to adapt the WHO protocol for School Health Surveys (12 countries have
participated). The planning and the involvement of a number of schools in the implementation of
the survey constitutes the beginning of a "buy in" by the education system to support healthy
lifestyles programming.



Page 42
Specific activities to be supported include:
* Development or adaptation of a protocol;
* Sample design, manual specs;
* Training;
* Equipment acquisition (which may later be used in the public health units or Ambulantas);
* Design of the database;
* Field operations and laboratory analysis (including blood lipid analyses);
* Statistical data processing; and
* Report publication (in an attractive format, it may constitute an interesting deliverable for
the WB).
2.1.2. Tobacco Control Strategy:
The aim is to lay the foundations and begin the implementation of a comprehensive Tobacco
Control Strategy encompassing the following tools and approaches: legislation and regulation,
taxation, advocacy, public and professional education, social marketing and raising of public
awareness of the health effects of tobacco.
Specific activities to be supported include:
3 Development of an infrastructure for tobacco control in each Entity;
* Establishment of a coalition to support policy and program  development and
implementation;
 Development of a strategy for tobacco control;
* Establishment of a coalition to further the strategy and find partners;
 Legislation and support for enforcement of Tobacco Control;
 Deployment of smoking cessation programs in a number of localities;
 Social marketing studies and awareness campaign;
D Awareness campaign aimed at health professionals through their associations;
Development of educational materials for relevant target groups and for health
professionals;
 Surveys of smoking control policies in institutions (e.g., schools, health care centers); and
* Policy research studies to support advocacy for tobacco taxation and restrictive legislation.
Sub-Component 2.2. Public Health Innovation Grants (US$0.2 million).
This Sub-Component will support, through competitive processes, local initiatives and
approaches to health promotion and disease control. Emphasis will be placed on risk factor
control, tobacco control, prevention and control of hypertension, prevention and control of
diabetes, adaptation and use of clinical prevention guidelines, youth health, occupational health,
tuberculosis prevention and control, and HIV/AIDS prevention.
Under agreed Terms of Reference (Technical and Managerial), the IPH and the PMU will
issue requests for proposals addressing the subjects noted above.  Public and private
organizations, local health departments (excluding direct supervises of the IPH), institutes,
educational institutions and community groups may be eligible for support under this Sub-
Component. International organizations will not be eligible. The IPH itself will not be eligible.
Request for application and the results of competitions will be published (in the Entity
concerned), in at least one newspaper with credible circulation throughout the Entity.



Page 43
An explicit agenda of this Sub-Component is to harness the extensive body of knowledge and
implementation capacity beyond the public sector of BiH.
Project Component 3 - Accreditation and Quality Assurance (US$0.8 million).
This Component will support the early stage of strategic planning and program development
for quality improvement. The project will provide technical assistance, equipment and
incremental operating costs in a two-phased process.
Project Phase 1: Preparations and Establishment of Agency for Accreditation and Quality
Improvement.
This Phase will last for the first year of the project. By then end of that year, the Strategic
and Business Plan will be completed and the Agency established. The following are the main
activities in this phase:
a. Formulation of a policy on health care quality. This will include the rationale; principles
and methods; regulations and legal basis; the need for quality assurance support;
financing quality assurance; and the institutional basis for actions.
b. An institution for quality improvement actions - an Agency for Accreditation and Quality
Improvement. The Agency will serve as a Resource Center and provide support for the
training program on quality and quality assurance. A Strategic and Business Plan will be
developed during the first year of the Project, using similar criteria and benchmarks in
both Entities.
c. Regulations and a program for developing accreditation standards and clinical practice
guidelines. Technical working groups will work with external advisers to develop
guidelines for primary health care. They will also develop a plan of action for producing,
using and evaluating the use of these clinical guidelines.
Project Phase 2: Support for early stage of implementation:
This will be done in the second and third years of the Project, with the following main
activities:
d. A Health Care Accreditation Program. This will include development of criteria for
healthcare facilities accreditation, specification of requirements for a national
accreditation program, and piloting of the accreditation system.
e. A training program for quality and quality assurance. This will include the adaptation of
modern methods of instruction in quality assurance, using a multi-disciplinary approach
and an adult learning mode.
f. A system for supporting quality improvement at the Entity and sub-Entity levels (cantons
in the Federation).
Project Component 4 - Project Management (US$0.7 million).
The Federation MOH will be the implementing agency, through a PMU. The PMU will be
based in Sarajevo. The existing Project Implementation Units (PIUs) of the WVR and the EHS
Projects will be consolidated and strengthened with more technical staff, as necessary, into an
overall PMU. Each of the three Projects (WVR, EHS and BHP) will have a project director. The
consolidation is intended to result in economies of scale and enable the third operation (BBP) to



Page 44
benefit from the implementation experiences of the first two. All TORs and appointments are
subject to agreement with IDA. The minimum complement of core project staff will be the
following:
* A Project Director (with day-to-day management responsibility for the BHP);
* Public Health Specialist;
* Primary Health Care Specialist;
* Health Finance Specialist;
* Procurement/Information Technology Specialist;
* Accountant;
* Architect;
* Translators (2); and
* Administrative Assistant.
Procurement function for BHP will be the responsibility of the Procurement Specialist,
selected competitively. Additional support will be available from the procurement specialists of
WVR and EHS projects, as under the new PMU arrangement, all technical staff will be working
together and providing mutual support. The procurement specialist for BHP will receive training
in World Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, through the International Procurement
course in Turin, Italy, as well as through periodic workshops held by the World Bank in the ECA
Region. It should be noted as well that additional procurement guidance is being provided on a
regular basis through the World Bank Resident Mission staff in Sarajevo.

Bosnia and Herzegovina: Basic Health Project
Project Description
Republika Srpska
Project Component 1 - Primary Health Care (US$2.9 million).
Strategic plans, curriculum development and implementation guidelines will be prepared for use
in the whole country. In order to develop and test the full range of activities required for
effectiveness, implementation under the project will concentrate on selected pilot sites
(regions in the RS), rather than try to cover the entire Entity.
The component will aim to establish a framework for primary care within a global referral
system, which will have the following attributes:
*  The Family Doctor as the Gatekeeper or point of first contact with the health care
system: To ensure accessibility to the system for patients, efficient use of resources and
the coordination of care or case management. It will help to develop regulations and
legislation to ensure accessibility to, and enforcement of, the gatekeeper function.
*  Longitudinal care and continuity of care: This is an essential feature of a well-developed
system in family medicine. It requires a patient appointment system that provides access
and availability. Benefits are gained through the development of a personal relationship
between doctor and patient over time regardless of the type of the problem or whether a
problem exists. It requires physical changes to work environment to allow privacy and
building of confidential relationships.  Hence, any civil works reconstruction or
rehabilitation will focus on the practicalities of the activities to be undertaken, not merely
on normative standards for the sizes of rooms, etc.
*  Comprehensiveness of care: The family doctor, together with other members of the
family medicine team, will be specifically educated to manage undifferentiated patient
problems and to provide a broad range of services regardless of age, sex or problem type.
This includes the traditional spectrum of prevention, health promotion and education,
diagnosis and management, and rehabilitative and counseling services. It also implies the
ability to recognize a problem beyond one's scope and the knowledge of how to arrange
for further care. The family doctor requires not only education but also appropriate
equipment and supplies to provide the services expected of him by the local health care
system. As part of a health team, the family doctor organizes patient care to make
optimum use of team members. There is a need for a standardized curriculum, currently
being developed with support from Queen's University in Canada, for all projects that
speak to a realistic target of functions for the general practitioners (GPs) undergoing
training. This is not the specialization program per se, but the training program for GPs,
leading to specialization.
*  Coordination of care: The essence of coordinating care of a patient is the availability of
accurate information about prior problems and services. That information is taken into
account when deciding the most effective current care needs. The use of problem-
oriented medical records is essential to this activity (simple and effective, not necessarily
computerized). There must also be a system for the effective referral of patients to



Page 46
consultants. This avoids duplication and unnecessary procedures while at the same time
permitting patient advocacy and effective case management. The effective family doctor:
(a) uses evidence from medical research to decide on the provision of laboratory,
investigative and consultant services; (b) reduces the need for hospital beds;
(c) prescribes pharmaceuticals wisely and only when necessary; and (d) makes maximum
use of community-based services, nurses and allied health staff.
Selection of Pilot Sites
Sub-Components 1. 1, 1.2 and 1.3 will be carried out in two pilot regions. The MOH has selected
Banja Luka and Zvornik regions as pilot sites. A total of 40 ambulantas from these regions are
expected to participate, covering 50 family medicine teams. In order to ensure effective
implementation, it will be important for these regions to meet a number of conditions before pilot
activities begin.
1. A reasonably integrated, functional health system exists within the region. (With
sufficient number of existing ambulantas or DZs to accommodate the planned family
medicine teams under the project in the region, a Secondary Hospital for referrals - with
existing referral functions and a formal agreement to continue providing the same referral
services throughout the duration of the project).
2. The region has sufficient population size and number of GPs and other primary care staff
to achieve benefits from investment in region institutional capacity (Minimum
population 100,000).
3. Participating ambulanta, DZs and Fund offices have adequate infrastructure and staff to
capture, communicate and analyze data, and base-line data to enable evaluation of the
effects of the pilot. (Existence of baseline population data by municipality and
demographics, trained staff to maintain databases).
4. The Health Insurance Fund branch offices in the region have adequate financial
management and administrative systems, including validated register of patient
registration with family medicine teams linked to payment system; and has implemented
contracts between the Fund and family medicine providers.
5. Staff in participating regional funds, ambulanta and DZs have sufficient education,
experience and motivation already to benefit from additional training and work with new
payment system.
6. In each Fund regional branch, someone is designated as the person responsible for local
implementation of the pilot activities, who will act as a liaison point with the RS Fund
and the PCU.
7. A local implementation plan is prepared for local activities under Sub-Components 1.1,
1.2 and 1.3 of the project within 3 (three)months of the project becoming effective.
If the conditions listed above are not met by the regions within 3 (three) months of the
Project becoming effective, alternative pilot sites will be considered.
Sub-Component 1.1. Development of Family Medicine (US$ 0.6 million).
This Sub-Component will support minor civil works and equipment for the Family Medicine
Department in the University of Banja Luka. It will also support planning, curriculum
development (for training of nurses and other non-doctor members of the family medicine team),
review of legislation and regulation concerning qualifications of primary health care staff,
provision of learning materials for training for all members of the family medicine team in the
pilot sites, incremental operating costs for trainees (travel, accommodation, per diem, excluding



Page 47
salaries) and implementation of training programs in family medicine. Much of the conceptual
basis for this Sub-Component is derived from the Queen's University Family Medicine
Development Program in BiH, funded by the CIDA, which is already assisting the Entities to
develop a curriculum for family doctor training.. It will also take into account, but not replicate,
the collective experience on a range of training programs of varying definition and quality. The
objective is to help develop a system that is locally relevant, effective and affordable. The pre-
war health care system in BiH was relatively centralized, open-ended and less cost-effective. It
featured: (a) a reliance on specialists in large institutions, (b) use of technology often without
reference to evidence for effectiveness, and (c) high referral rates from general practitioners who
neither had nor were required to possess special training for this task.
Activities to be supported and inputs to be provided under this Sub-Component are the
following:
* Technical assistance for regulations and legislation of specialization programs in Family
Medicine: This will be undertaken with technical assistance by a Ministerial Committee
on Family Medicine in collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine in Banja Luka.
*  Technical assistance for curriculum development for nurses and other non-doctor
members of the family medicine team. Training is likely to be a 6-9 month part time
program.. (Queens University is already developing   a two-stream, single-track
specialization program, including standards, benchmarks and certification procedures, in
which two groups can apply for specialization: those with work experience and
completion of approved training program, or those with existing specialization in another
field of primary health care. This group can complete specialization in 2 years. All other
doctors must complete the 3-year program.)
*  Learning materials: books, library resources, translation
*  Civil works: refurbishment of premises for Family Medicine Department
* Equipment: office and classroom furniture, audio-visual equipment, and basic laboratory
materials.
*  Workshops, per diem, travel costs and accommodation costs (excluding salaries) for the
first cohort of trainees.
Sub-Component 1.2. Infrastructure and Equipment (US$ 1.4 million).
This Sub-Component will provide, on the basis of rational needs, limited civil works, medical
equipment (laboratory and other diagnostic) and incremental operating costs (excluding
salaries) to enable effective functions of an estimated 50 (fifty) Family Medicine teams in the
pilot Regions of RS.
Sub-Component 1.3. Management Training and Capacity Building (US$0.5 million).
This Sub-Component will provide technical assistance, equipment, limited civil works and
incremental operating costs for:
(a) formulation of regulations and legislation to establish accredited health management
training programs and professionalize the management of health services;
(b) institutional support for curriculum development and training of faculty for short-term
management training programs and a Masters degree program in health services
management; and
(c) the actual training of current health service managers in short courses. Short course
training will be designed to form modules that could later be recognized as a course



Page 48
credit in the Masters degree. It is beyond the scope of this project to meet all of the costs
of establishing the full Masters degree program, so the project will concentrate on
regulation, curriculum development, and agreement among participating universities on
standards and accreditation.
The Sub-Component will seek to address the inadequacies of health management and
administration being undertaken almost exclusively by doctors and nurses, and lay foundations
for future strengthening of the skill base in management and finance.
Support will be provided for short-course training to be provided by the Republic IPH under
contract to the Ministry of Health. The contract will be managed by the PCU. The PCU will
identify, in consultation with the MOH, regional and non-governmental agencies, and potential
candidates for training. Candidates will be required to meet admission standards established by
the training institutions.
The following is an estimate of the overall implementation plan during the 3-year life of the
Project:
Year 1. Enabling regulations and legislation. Curriculum development. Preparation of a
Strategic and Business Plan (for Masters degree program), civil works and equipment
for Center for Health Management. Provision of short-course training to current
managers.
Year 2. Establishment of institutional relationships. Further curriculum development and
training of faculty for the Masters degree program
Year 3. Implementation of first graduate-level training programs. Assessment of
implementation status.
Sub-Component 1.4. Management and Performance Incentives (US$0.4 million).
This Sub-Component will build on the development of contracting, patient registration and
capitation payment which are being developed by the Ministry of Health with the support of the
PHARE program and the World Bank EHS Project. Current RS-MOH policy papers plan to
introduce capitation contracts for family medicine in some regions by the end of February 1999,
and to pilot alternative forms of provider payment in primary care in four sites by mid-1999. If
this occurs, the Project will support the refinement and further development of new systems for
remuneration of primary care physicians, including but not limited to weighted capitation within a
global budget cap for defined pilot areas. If RS plans are delayed, the Project may instead pilot
first-phase implementation of capitation contracts. The weighted formula will include population
of registered clients, simplified needs index, geographic variations (urban, rural, under-served
areas) and professional qualifications of providers. Subject to evaluation, the new methods and
tools could be adapted for wider geographical use and for a wider range of health sector workers.
Effective changes in the system for remunerating doctors require effective contracting with
minimal increases in administrative complexity. Contracting will be developed not as an end in
itself, but as a means by which the parties can make clear expectations, rights and responsibilities,
and formalize the agreement.



Page 49
Technical assistance, equipment, workshops and incremental operating costs, (excluding
funds for remuneration) will be provided for:
a. Developing, implementing and evaluating a payment formula combining capitation with
incentives for appropriate prescription and referral, using actual Republic cost and
activity data
b. Piloting computerization of family practitioner patient registers, and Fund records and
payment systems to support robust financial control and audit
c. Development of a series of minimum quality standards to be contained in contracts.
d. Testing to ensure that adequate monitoring systems are in place such that contract
variations can be resolved.
e. Workshops and an information campaign for family medicine staff to explain the
changes, and seek feedback and support.
f. Training Republic Fund staff to further develop and update the payment formulae
g. Training Regional Fund staff to administer robust systems of monitoring, control and
audit of payment methods and contract performance.
Project Component 2 - Public Health and Disease Control (US$0.8 million).
This Component will support capacity building, planning and implementation of
interventions for the prevention and control of diseases with significant impact on the burden of
disease (Sub-Component 2.1). It will be implemented, on behalf of the MOH (of each Entity), by
the IPH of each Entity. The Public Health Innovation Grants (Sub-Component 2.2) will be
implemented jointly by the IPH and the PCU, under terms of reference and management
procedures acceptable to IDA.
Sub-Component 2.1. Institutional Support (US$ 0.6 million).
This Sub-Component will support:
* technical and management training in the IPH;
* Surveillance and Monitoring System (mortality data, NCD risk factor survey, children and
youth survey);
* upgrading of the information system for mortality data by ICD codes; and Tobacco Control
Strategy.
2.1.1. Surveillance and Monitoring System:
a. Mortality Data. The aim is to develop an information system for mortality data by
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. It will include technical assistance, supplies
and incremental operating costs for:
*  Workgroups and workshops to develop consensus on objectives, specifications and
organizational provisions;
*  Design of the system;
*  Piloting the system;
*  Training in processing of all aspects and report generation;
*  Provision of computer system and telecommunications equipment of limited scope; and
*  Production and distribution of the first generation of statistical reports.



Page 50
b. Surveys of risk (i) riskfactors for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and (ii) health status,
service utilization and needs.. NCD accounts for a significant proportion of the disease burden
(Cowley, 1998). Their treatments consume significant resources. The aim is to establish a
baseline for planning, targeting and (outcome) evaluation of integrated risk factor interventions at
a population level. This requires the implementation population surveys in statistically
representative samples, of about 2,000 to 3,000 individuals for each entity. (Caveat: the sample
sizes assume that estimates of prevalence are required at the Federation or at the RS levels. The
sample size suggested is not large enough to allow breakdowns by regions in RS and by cantons
in the Federation. If breakdowns by regions or cantons are required the survey can become
prohibitively expensive, since essentially a sample size of about 2,000 to 3,000 will be required
for each such jurisdictional breakdown - regardless of the population size of the cantons).
Sampling issues - including sampling frame and size - are to be further examined and detailed in
the Project Operations Manual.
The results of the survey will support directly the planning and evaluation the following
projects: Tobacco Control Strategy; Hypertension Prevention and Control; Diabetes Prevention
and Control; Countrywide Integrated Non-communicable Disease Program (CINDI). In addition,
the information that will be gathered health status, service utilization, needs, and public
awareness will be useful to design various aspects of health services, health promotion and public
health communication.
Specific activities to be supported include:
a Technical working group meetings;
* Surveys- design and execution;
 Training;
* Equipment acquisition (which may later be used in the public health units or Ambulantas);
* Design of the database;
, Field operations and laboratory analysis (including blood lipid analyses);
* Statistical data processing; and
* Report publication and dissemination.
c. Children and Youth Survey. The onset of risk factors starts early in life and there is a dearth
of information on lifestyle habits of children and youth. The aim of this Sub-Component is to
develop a database for planning and evaluation, by surveying children and teenagers, ages 12-18
with respect to lifestyle habits, including substance use, dietary and exercise habits, peer relations
and relations with parents, mental health issues and self-esteem and resilience related issues.
Schools may constitute efficient clusters to design the probability sample. It may be appropriate
to adapt the WHO protocol for School Health Surveys (12 countries have participated). The
planning and the involvement of a number of schools in the implementation of the survey
constitutes the beginning of a "buy in" by the education system to support healthy lifestyles
programming.
Specific activities to be supported include:
* Development or adaptation of a protocol;
* Sample design, manual specifications;
* Training;
* Equipment acquisition (which may later be used in the public health units or ambulantas);
* Design of the database;



Page 51
* Field operations and laboratory analysis (including blood lipid analyses);
* Statistical data processing; and
* Report publication (in an attractive format, it may constitute an interesting deliverable for
the WB).
2.1.2. Tobacco Control Strategy:
The aim is to lay the foundations and begin the implementation of a comprehensive Tobacco
Control Strategy encompassing the following tools and approaches: legislation and regulation,
taxation, advocacy, public and professional education, social marketing and raising of public
awareness of the health effects of tobacco.
Specific activities to be supported include:
* Development of an infrastructure for tobacco control in each Entity;
* Establishment of a coalition to support policy and program development and
implementation;
* Development of a strategy for tobacco control;
* Establishment of a coalition to further the strategy and find partners;
* Legislation and support for enforcement of Tobacco Control;
* Deployment of smoking cessation programs in a number of localities;
* Social marketing studies and awareness campaign;
* Awareness campaign aimed at health professionals through their associations;
* Development of educational materials for relevant target groups and for health
professionals;
* Surveys of smoking control policies in institutions (e.g., schools, health care centers); and
* Policy research studies to support advocacy for tobacco taxation and restrictive legislation.
Sub-Component 2.2. Public Health Innovation Grants (US$0.1 million).
This Sub-Component will support, through competitive processes, local initiatives and
approaches to health promotion and disease control. Emphasis will be placed on risk factor
control, tobacco control, prevention and control of hypertension, prevention and control of
diabetes, adaptation and use of clinical prevention guidelines, youth health, occupational health,
tuberculosis prevention and control, and HIV/AIDS prevention.
Under agreed Terms of Reference (Technical and Managerial), the IPH and the PCU will
issue requests for proposals addressing the subjects noted above.  Public and private
organizations, local health departments (excluding direct supervises of the IPH), institutes,
educational institutions and community groups may be eligible for support under this Sub-
Component. International organizations will not be eligible. The IPH itself will not be eligible.
Request for application and the results of competitions will be published (in the Entity
concerned), in at least one newspaper with credible circulation throughout the Entity.
An explicit agenda of this Sub-Component is to harness the extensive body of knowledge and
implementation capacity beyond the public sector of BiH.



Page 52
Project Component 3 - Accreditation and Quality Assurance (US$0.5 million).
This Component will support the early stage of strategic planning and program development
for quality improvement. The project will provide technical assistance, equipment and
incremental operating costs in a two-phased process.
Project Phase 1. Preparations and Establishment of Agency for Accreditation and Quality
Improvement.
This Phase will last for the first year of the project. By then end of that year, the Strategic
and Business Plan will be completed and the Agency established. The following are the main
activities in this phase:
a. Formulation of a policy on health care quality. This will include the rationale; principles
and methods; regulations and legal basis; the need for quality assurance support;
financing quality assurance; and the institutional basis for actions.
b. An institution for quality improvement actions - an Agency for Accreditation and Quality
Improvement. The Agency will serve as a Resource Center and provide support for the
training program on quality and quality assurance. A Strategic and Business Plan will be
developed during the first year of the Project, using similar criteria and benchmarks in
both Entities.
c. Regulations and a program for developing accreditation standards and clinical practice
guidelines. Technical working groups, based in the IPH and drawn from the Faculty of
the University of Banja Luka, as well as other qualified personnel, will work with
external advisers to develop guidelines for primary health care. They will also develop a
plan of action for producing, using and evaluating the use of these clinical guidelines.
Project Phase 2: Support for early stage of implementation:
This will be done in the second and third years of the Project, with the following main
activities:
d. A Health Care Accreditation Program. This will include development of criteria for
healthcare facilities accreditation, specification of requirements for a national
accreditation program, and piloting of the accreditation system.
e. A training program for quality and quality assurance. This will include the adaptation of
modern methods of instruction in quality assurance, using a multi-disciplinary approach
and an adult learning mode.
f. A system for supporting quality improvement at the Entity and sub-Entity levels (regions
in the RS).
Project Component 4 - Project Management (US$0.7 million).
The RS-MOH will be the implementing agency, through a PCU based in Banja Luka. The
existing PIU of the EHS will be expanded and strengthened with more technical staff as
necessary, and will evolve into an overall PCU. The Project Director for EHS will become PCU
Director, with responsibility for both projects. The consolidation of project management is
intended to result in economies of scale and enable the second operation (BHP) to benefit from
the implementation experience of the first. All TORs and appointments will be subject to
agreement with IDA. The minimum complement of core project staff will be the following:



Page 53
*  PCU Coordinator (for the PCU, donor coordination and liaison functions for both IDA-
supported projects);
*  Public Health Specialist
*  Primary Health Care Specialist;
*  Health Finance Specialist;
* Procurement/Information Technology Specialist;
*  Accountant;
*  Translators (2); and
*  Administrative Assistant.
Procurement function for BHP will be the responsibility of the procurement Specialist,
selected competitively. Additional support will be available from the procurement specialist of
EHS, as under the new PCU arrangement, all technical staff will be working together and
providing mutual support. The procurement specialist for BHP will receive training in World
Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, through the International Procurement course in
Turin, Italy, as well as through periodic workshops offered by World Bank staff in the ECA
Region. It should be noted as well that additional procurement guidance is being provided on a
regular basis through the World Bank Resident Mission in Sarajevo and its branch office inBanja
Luka.

Draft TORs for Public Information and Advocacy
(Study, Strategy and Workplan)
a) In order to make the health system more responsive to the needs of the population, it is
necessary to gain a better understanding of public knowledge, perceptions, expectations and
attitudes towards the health sector - its mission, responsibilities, service delivery capacity,
quality, financing and problems. This exercise will help to develop an effective communication
strategy in support of planned changes in the health sector of BiH, including access to services,
quality of care, infrastructure, personnel, relationships between service providers and the public
and relationships between the Government and health care professionals. A two-phase research
program is envisaged, plus the design of a follow-up module. The steps will be the following:
*  Phase 1: Approximately 20 in-depth Interviews (general public, health care personnel,
managers and journalists) and carefully defined Focus Groups.
*  Phase 2: National Planning Survey - Interviews (general public). To include questions
on out-of-pocket payments for health services.
b) Overall project management, including questionnaire design, analysis, and strategic
development, will be supported by of local and international consultants. Fieldwork will be
conducted in cooperation with the MOH and appropriate NGOs. A possible research design and
timeline are elaborated below.
c) Phase 1: Exploratory In-Depth Interviews (20)
This qualitative project is intended to give the MOH a sense of consideration of the public,
health professionals, and the press when they think about the health sector and planned reforms,
particularly at the interface between health care providers and the clients.
The questionnaire itself will examine both the existing state of public opinion and how people
will respond to various messages concerning changes in the health sector, both pro and con, using
open-ended questions to draw the maximum of infornation rather than the closed-ended
questions used in polls. While this research obviously will not obtain results which can be
statistically projected to the national population with just 20 interviews, it will highlight the range
of ideas and concerns which people bring to bear when they are asked their opinions about the
health reform and hear various arguments about it. This will give the MOH an initial
understanding of attitudes and reactions to messages, which can begin to feed into
communications strategy.
This phase will take approximately 8 weeks from the start-up date:
* Two weeks for questionnaire development;



Page 55
* Four weeks for interviewing and translation of the interviews, with the exact timing
depending on how difficult they are to schedule, public holidays, etc; and
* Two weeks for analysis of the results.
Deliverables from Phase 1:
The expected outputs are:
* Two copies of the transcripts of the 20 interviews, translated into English.
* A strategic paper analyzing the data and their implications for communications on the
project. (This is a brief preliminary document, since the survey data will be needed for a
fully elaborated strategy).
* The first draft of the questionnaire for a National Planning Survey.
Phase 2: National Planning Survey (Entity Level)
The National Planning Survey will serve two purposes: generating baseline data on public
attitudes related to the health reform and providing the information needed for the development of
a full communications strategy for health sector reform. This will include a national survey of the
general public, a national sample with a margin of error of +/- 4 percent, and statistically robust
sub-samples of populations in specific social categories and regions.
The survey will generate quantitative data on the initial state of national public opinion
concerning health reform issues, and then will simulate what public responses might be to
different messages about the reform. This can be done by presenting a variety of arguments
concerning the reform and determine how people respond. With this large sample, they may also
split it into two sub-samples for a few questions and expose each to a different message about the
reform, in order to see which moves public opinion most effectively. As with the in-depth
interviews, arguments both for and against the reform will be presented in order to provide a
realistic test of public reaction. The survey will include a module on willingness to pay for
outpatient and in-patient services. The consultants will also address issues regarding media
usage. The survey will enable the MOH to: know where the BiH public currently stands on
various issues; follow changes in the future; determine who the target groups uncertain about or
opposed to the planned reforms are; determine which messages about the reforms are most
persuasive; and determine which media could be used most effectively.
Drawing on the findings of the in-depth interviews, the consultants will develop the
questionnaire, monitor the fieldwork, process the data into tabular form, analyze them, develop
concepts for a communications strategy and prepare a report with the results and the strategic
concepts.
The survey will take approximately 8 weeks from the completion of Phase 1. The time-line
for the survey will be the following:
* One week for questionnaire development;
* Two weeks for questionnaire translation, pre-tests, and revision;
* Three weeks for field work, data checking, and entry; and
* Two weeks for data processing, analysis, and report preparation.



Page 56
Outputs:
The expected outputs from this study are:
* The data in the form of tables;
* The data-set in a database format (e.g., EPI-INFO); and
* A final report including actionable communications strategy messages and targeting
recommendations, which can be used by advertising agencies or communications
consultants in formulating a campaign.
The consultants will work, as appropriate, with representatives of the MOH and its agencies,
the PIU of the ongoing EHS Project, Health Insurance Institutes/Funds at the Entity and sub-
Entity levels, the IPHs, Statistical Offices, administrators of health facilities and community
organizations.

Annex 4
Bosnia and Herzegovina: Basic Health Project
Project Justification and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Summar}5
1. INTRODUCTION.
1.1.   This section presents a conceptual basis for key interventions in the proposed project. It
also presents estimates indicating potential benefits of the proposed project. It is based on
unifying themes from epidemiology, health economics, quality assurance management methods,
current thinking in primary health care and public health, all grounded in the context of BiH.
Certain cautionary notes are in order:
*  First, the presentation here is a work-in progress, and subject to refinement upon
availability of more complete databases. It is not presented as the definitive work on
epidemiology and cost-effectiveness of health services in BiH. Rather, it was developed
as a tool to facilitate policy and strategic discussions within BiH and between BiH and
partner agencies. It provides a basis for examining issues, challenging assumptions and
evaluating options for the future. It also demonstrates the need for a systematic
development of epidemiological and cost databases in BiH.
*  Second, cost estimates vary significantly between and within Entities. Cost data used in
this section are from a convenience sample of health facilities and personnel. They are
not representative of the whole country.
*  Finally, this section is best considered in the context of the main document, including the
following: Project Development Objective (Section A); Strategic Context (Section B);
Project Description Summary (Section C); and Summary Project Analyses (Section E).
1.2. This Annex is divided into six sections. Following the introduction, Section 2 presents the
burden of disease in BiH. This is followed in Section 3 with a review of the most demanded
health services. Section 4 is on cost-effective interventions. Section 5 is on ideas for defining
and delivering priority health services, followed by a conclusion in Section 6.
1.3. Summary of the methods. Among the innovations to be introduced on a pilot basis in
BiH is the use of explicit criteria and tools to guide the management of health services. One of
these is an adaptation of epidemiological techniques and cost-effectiveness measures. The
potential uses of the exercise underway in BiH include the following:
(i) Explicit recognition of health problems: occurrence, magnitude, pattern and distribution.
(ii) Recognition of social reluctance to give up previous entitlement to all services - even if
this was a theoretical entitlement.
(iii)Use of epidemiological and cost data to inform decisions on what health service costs
could be fully, partially or not reimbursed - and therefore implicitly or explicitly
discouraged. (This is to be distinguished from a binary approach of inclusion or
exclusion in a basic package of health services). Variations among cantons - in health

status, services, and basic indicators of efficiency - provide tools for more efficient
allocation and management of resources.
Step 1: Thefollowing types of interventions will be identified:
-  most demanded health services;
-  high cost interventions; and
-  highly cost effective interventions.
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Cost-effectiveness analysis differs from cost-benefit analysis in
that costs are calculated and alternative ways are compared for achieving a specific set of results.
Cost-effectiveness concerns not only how to use funds most efficiently, but also includes a
constraint that a specified output must be attained. That output is the gain in health, i.e., the gain
or losses averted in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Cost-benefit studies typically
expedite comparisons among several programs with differing objectives, whereas cost-
effectiveness analysis compares different ways of reaching the same objective. As such, cost-
effectiveness analysis is a way of summarizing the health benefits and resources used by health
interventions so that policymakers can choose among them - or subsidize the supply of some in
preference to others. It summarizes all program costs into one number, all program benefits (i.e.,
effectiveness) into a second number, and it defines criteria for making decisions based on the
relation between the two. It does not assign monetary values to health outcomes of benefits and
in this regard differs from cost-benefit analysis.
Step 2: For each of these three types of selected diagnoses or target diseases, the analysis will
include:
-  where the intervention takes place;
-  number of associated Disability Adjusted Life Years lost;
-  cost of treatment per episode (including drugs and medical supplies);
-  frequency of intervention (yearly or not);
-  need for complementary interventions;
-  effectiveness of intervention; and
-  whether or not the intervention interrupts the dynamic transmission of the disease.
Step 3: Combining these two sets of data, a series of tables will be developed, identifying:
-  relatively high consumer demand interventions that are or are not cost effective;
-  potential high consumer demand interventions with high costs, but target a high burden of
disease and are effective;
-  low demand and cost effective interventions; and
-  estimated costs and savings from selected interventions.
Step 4. Use of information for health policy and management:
The information will provide managers (at the Entity and sub-Entity levels) with criteria for
structuring a set of incentives and disincentives that will affect the behaviors of health care
providers and of patients in the selection and utilization of services. Positive incentives will be
developed for health services that: are cost effective; address conditions which account for a large
share of the burden of disease; and have low consumer demand (e.g., incentive payments to
physicians, reduced cost sharing). Negative incentives will target interventions that have: a high



Page 86
consumer demand, but low cost-effectiveness; and high cost, and address a low share of the
burden of disease (e.g., cost sharing, waiting lists, holding constant spending on certain
specialist/tertiary care services and clinical departments). A range of management tools and
incentives to encourage the delivery and use of more cost-effective health services will be
introduced (a functional approach to the "basic package of health services" concept), including
epidemiological information, cost-effectiveness, health technology assessment and business
planning, the refinement and use of essential drug lists, rational use of drugs, targeted
interventions, as well a careful introduction offormal co-payment where appropriate.
2. THIE BURDEN OF DISEASE: WHAT ARE THE MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS?
2.1.    A frequently used measure of the burden of disease is the disability adjusted life year
(DALY) concept: a composite measure of both death and disability. The DALY is an indicator of
the time lived with the disability and the time due to premature mortality. Years of life lost from
premature mortality are estimated with respect to a standard expectation of life at each age.
Years lived with a disability are translated into an equivalent time loss through multiplication by
a set of weights that reflect reduction in functional capacity. As such, the DALY represents an
attempt to combine in a single indicator the impact of disease on mortality, morbidity and
disability.16
2.2. As shown in the Table 1 below, circulatory and mental disorders are prominent in BiH as
causes of death and disability. DALYs were calculated using mortality data from 1991, the most
recent year for which an adequate database was available. Disability calculations apply a "ratio
method" of total DALYs to mortality DALYs from the Former Socialist Economies (FSE) as a
whole.

2.3.  Risk factors and the tobacco problem:    Smoking is highly prevalent in BiH.
According to information from the IPH, about 70 percent of adults smoke, and smoking is
increasing among women and particularly among young children. Ten percent of adolescents
smoke, as do about 3-5 percent of 10 year-old children. Smokers and children whose parents
smoke experience more respiratory symptoms (ARI) and have an increased frequency of
bronchitis and pneumonia.  Smokers also have higher risk of hypertensive heart disease.
Premature death from tobacco has already become substantial in BiH. It is estimated that 18.6
percent of all deaths are due to smoking and 10.5 percent of all DALYs are due to smoking
(Table 2).

burden of preventable chronic illnesses in the medium and long term, pushing the development of
its health sector to a higher cost trajectory, with a decreasing social return to expenditure over
time. Overall, removal of the effects of tobacco from the 1990 data would remove completely the
anomalous excess of male deaths in the formerly socialist economies (Peto et al., 1994). A more
detailed account of the impact of tobacco on health status is beyond the scope of this document.

3.   MOST DEMANDED SERVICES.
3.1. A list of health services with high levels of consumer demand, corresponding to 10 target
diseases or conditions, is presented in Table 3. According to data provided by the Institute of
Public Health the 11 most demanded services at ambulatory services in 1997 were treatment for:
acute respiratory infections, hypertensive diseases, bronchitis, influenza, cystitis, anemia caused
by iron deficiency, eye infections, pneumonia, otitis, skin infections and mental disorders.
Treatments for mental disorders - including stress-related disorders which are a direct
consequence of the war - are among the eleven most demanded ambulatory services.
3.2.  On the basis of high demand alone, all such services could be justified as priority services.
However, other factors (e.g., medical effectiveness, cost effectiveness, the BOD associated with
individual target diseases) must be taken into consideration. Among the most demanded services,
there is a wide range of DALYs lost to target diseases: from 55,000 for hypertension, to
negligible values for ARI, cystitis, eye infection and otitis. (Table 3 shows the percentage of
DALYs lost for each condition.)

DEMANDED HEALTH SERVICES (1997) AND DALYs LOST IN BiH, (1991)

3.3. Cost per Episode for Outpatient Services. There is some variation in treatment costs per
case of these most demanded outpatient services, from $67 for hypertension treatment and US$35
for PTSD, US$5 for outpatient treatment of ARI, chronic bronchitis, cystitis andotitis to US$ 2-3
for eye infection, and influenza. In assessing costs, however, it is important to note the possible
need for complementary interventions.
3.4. Cost of inpatient care. Cost per hospital-day was calculated dividing the percentage of
the total recurrent budget dedicated to inpatient care (75 percent) by the total number of hospital-
days. The three leading services provided in this general hospital with emphasis on surgery were
cholecystectomy, inguinal hernioraphy and appendectomy. The cost per inpatient day is US$147,
including salaries, drugs and maintenance. The length of stay (LOS) for a cholecystectomy was
eight days costing US$1,082 and for inguinal hernioraphy was six days amounting to US$812.
3.5. Sources of data. Cost per outpatient treatment for the leading diseases was derived from
actual practice. Actual practice was extracted from interviews with a convenience sample of
general practitioners (GPs) at the health center Dom Zdravla Vrazova in Sarajevo.17 Outpatient
care costs were calculated using the latest official salary. The most prescribed drugs by treatment
are based on interviews with GPs and in the positive drug list (PDL). Physicians prescribe drugs
mostly from the PDL because they are fully reimbursable by the insurance funds. Sarajevo PDL
includes 120. Prices of drugs were extracted from two main sources: selected private pharmacies
in Sarajevo and the PDL. Information on the leading causes of hospitalization and the costs of
treatments were extracted from the budget of the State Hospital, Sarajevo (a "Cantonal Hospital).
17    The documentation of actual (current) practice does not imply an endorsement of such as the
appropriate practice. Instead, it provides a baseline for estimating gains to be realized through the
implementation of alternative practices based on current scientific thinking and clinical protocols.

4.  COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS.
4.1. Cost-effective interventions are defined as those that can provide more health gains at the least
cost, relative to other interventions. Some of these are based on widely recommended interventions
proposed in the literature, like immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases and directly observed
therapy for tuberculosis (DOTS). However, others are based on the specific conditions of BiH This
does not imply an assumption of maximum efficiency and community effectiveness?8 in the delivery
of these services in BiEI. Indeed, the recognition of inefficiencies in current practices and potential
efficiency is one of the main justifications for the Basic Health Project (See Section 5 and Table 6,
Cost and Savings from Most Cost-Effective Interventions). The costs are based on local prices and the
effectiveness or health gains based on findings from the international scientific literature.
4.2. The emphasis on cost-effective interventions is about what to subsidize with public money, rather
than about what to provide, or require, or prohibit. However, minimizing the cost per health gain would
mean excluding some people from the benefits of the intervention. There is no ready-made answer to the
apparent tension between considerations of equity and efficiency: each society or health care system must
calibrate its own balance between these two. Besides, the "dichotomy" is often overstated, and it could be
argued that efficiency and equity are inseparable at the level of the population'9.
4.3. Interventions with high cost effectiveness are presented in Table 5. Since associated costs of
treatment are relatively low, even if medical effectiveness is moderate and current demand is low,
significant health gains may be obtained by including these interventions within priorities for health
services and stimulating appropriate demand for such services. Treatment of most target diseases in
Table 5 is readily justifiable given the extensive DALY loss associated with smoking and poor diets.
18 Reaching maximum community effectiveness, that is, how well an intervention works in actual field circumstances for a
particular population, depends critically on the quality of the intervention in question. The following factors determine
community effectiveness: efficacy of the intervention (in an ideal setting such as a laboratory or a clinical trial), diagnostic
accuracy, provider compliance, patient compliance and population coverage. (Source: Tugwell, P. et al., "Relative risks,

5.  DEFINING PRIORITY AREAS.
5.1.  The prevalent burden of disease in BiH and an analysis of the demand for services underscore the
need to coordinate clinical preventive services with health promotion activities, in order to reduce risk-
taking behavior, such as smoking and poor-diet and to contain the related costs of medical care. Health
policy and resource allocation in BiH should target programs that help the population control smoking,
avoid excessive alcohol consumption, and develop better dietary habits. The family doctor or the general
practitioner would play a key role in implementing such programs, and their remuneration could include
bonuses for counseling patients to stop smoking and improve their eating habitso0.
5.2. The implications of applying BOD and cost-effectiveness analysis for definition of priority areas
for a sample of interventions are discussed below. This is to be distinguished from a traditional
specification of a package of essential health services. From a social and political perspective, the public
is highly unlikely to give up what it has theoretically been entitled to free of charge. Therefore, the
implementation of a system emphasizing health gains through cost-effective services would not be
enabled by a mechanistic definition of positive and negative lists. It would be enabled by the use of
management tools and incentives to influence the behaviors of service providers and consumers. Such
tools and incentives would encourage the delivery and use of more cost-effective services through the use
of epidemiological information, cost-effectiveness, health technology assessment and business planning,
the refinement and use of essential drug lists, rational use of drugs, targeted interventions, as well as a
careful introduction of formal co-payments where appropriate.
Costs and Savings from Most Cost-Effective Interventions.
5.3. Table 6 is based on an estimated project cost of US$14.7 million. The stream of savings would
provide a return on investment in 8.1 years (at 5 percent discount rate) or 11.2 years (at 10 percent
discount rate).

Potential Efficiency Gains in the System.
5.4. In order to increase the cost-efficiency of the health care system in BiH, the role of the family
physician needs to be expanded (ref. Project Component 1, Primary Health Care). One possible scenario
would making the family practitioner the "gatekeeper" into the formal health care system, controlling
access to specialists and to hospitalization. In an incentive-driven model, the family practitioner would
benefit financially and professionally from keeping patients out of the hospital and by working with other
professionals such as nurses and midwives.
5.5. The same holds true for hospital and regional/cantonal health authorities. Hospitals, as well as
cantonal and federal health insurance authorities, need to be in control of their own budgets but cannot do
so until they have adequately trained managers and have developed basic tools for outcome- or output-
based management systems. A health care system can become more efficient, but it needs the tools to do
such. It is estimated that if family practitioners were given a greater role as envisaged under the project,
in addition to hospital managers having better control over their own budgets, one could expect that the
decline in either the cost per outpatient visit or the numbers of needed visits per disease would result in a
2.5 percent reduction in costs.
6.   CONCLUSIONS.
6.1. The burden of disease and analysis of service utilization point to a vital need for clinical preventive
services. Clinical services such as counseling on avoidance of risk behavior, e.g., tobacco and excessive
alcohol consumption, could contribute significantly to reductions in hypertension, ARI and chronic
bronchitis. For example, smoking cessation counseling should be included in primary health care
services. Moreover, providers need to be motivated to promote outpatient care, and an incentive system
should encourage providers to take cost into consideration when making clinical decisions.
6.2. It is important to note that knowledge of the magnitude and distribution of the burden of certain
diseases is useful but not sufficient for prioritizing health services. There are conditions with a high
BOD, such as ischemic heart diseases, which, unfortunately, are difficult to alter. For this reason, much
depends on the availability of an effective intervention at an acceptable cost. Within the context of health
sector reform and of the new insurance-based health services delivery system in BiH, the foregoing
decision-making methodology could provide a basis for determining what health interventions should be
fully, partially, or not reimbursed by health insurance. Curative interventions can reduce the case fatality
of diseases or prevent complications of chronic diseases; preventive interventions, on the other hand, can
reduce the incidence of disease. Both types of interventions have an important role to play inBiH's future
health policies and services.
6.3.  Positive incentives should be developed for health services that are cost effective, that address
conditions which account for a large share of the BOD in BiH, that have low consumer demand (e.g.,
incentive payments to physicians, reduced cost sharing). Negative incentives should target interventions
that have a high consumer demand but low cost-effectiveness, high cost, and address a low share of the
BOD (e.g., cost sharing, waiting lists, holding constant spending on certain specialist/tertiary care services
and clinical departments).

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Tables A, AI and A2):
Procurement under the Credit will follow the Bank's Guidelines in all respects: Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, Revised January 1996 and August 1996, and January 1999,
for Goods and Works, and the Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World
Bank as Executing Agency, January 1997, revised January 1999. For procurement under the Credit, the
Borrower would use: (i) the Bank's standard bidding documents for ICB procurement; and (ii) the Bank's
standard request for proposal for selection of consultants.
Advertisement:
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the April 1999 issue of Development
Business announcing goods and consultants services to be procured and inviting interested eligible
suppliers, contractors and consultants to express interest and to request any complementary information
from the PCU/PMUs. The Specific Procurement Notice will be published at a later date.
Goods.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Medical and related equipment, and specialized services
which are estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent per contract will be procured using
International Competitive Bidding (ICB)procedures in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995, amended in September 1997 and
January 1997). In the Federation, medical equipment procured through ICB will account for about 84
percent (US$ 2.1 million) of the total goods value, consisting of two tenders. Included in the ICB will be
medical equipment for family medicine physicians and clinics. In theRS, medical equipment procured
through ICB will account for about 81 percent (US$ 0.8 million) of the total goods value, consisting of
one tender. In the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB, no domestic preference
would apply. A detailed list of equipment is attached. The Bank's latest Standard Bidding Documents,
Standard Form of Consulting Contracts and Requests for Proposals, and Standard Bid Evaluation Report
Forms will be used for procurement of Bank financed works, goods and services.
International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for contracts for equipment estimated
to cost less than US$100,000 (i.e., first batch of computer equipment, laptops, audio visual and office
equipment and medical equipment) where the cost of ICB will clearly outweigh possible price
advantages. The aggregate value of IS is estimated at US$540,000 equivalent in the Federation and US$
280,000 in the RS. International shopping procedures will be based on comparing price quotations
obtained from at least three suppliers from two different countries in accordance with Bank Guidelines.



Page 97
National Shopping (NS). Minor sundry items not exceeding US$50,000 per contract may be
purchased on the basis of prudent national shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from at
least three local suppliers, in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Aggregate amount of national shopping
is estimated at US$70,000 equivalent in the Federation and US$50,000 in the RS. NS accounts for one
percent of the project procurement in the Federation and 3 percent of the project procurement in the RS.
Direct Contracting (DC). Direct contracting (aggregate US$180,000 in Federation and US$50,000
in RS) will be used for proprietary items for reasons of compatibility and standardization, and in any
other justified case such as library materials, and textbooks. Any direct contracting during project
implementation will need prior Bank approval. DC accounts for one percent of project procurement in
the Federation and one percent in the RS.
Civil Works.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Procedures for NCB will be used for contracts for civil
works estimated to cost less than US$ 200,000 (i.e., renovations of DZ and other such works)where the
advantages of NCB are clearly outweighed by the administrative or financial burden involved. For the
Federation, NCB aggregate is estimated at US$700,000. For RS, NCB aggregate is US$300,000. ECA
sample bidding documents shall be acceptable to the Bank. Bids will be advertised in the national press
and/or official gazette, opened publicly, and awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder.
Minor Works (MW). MW will involve contracts for less than US$50,000 (for the Federation,
aggregate is US$950,000; for RS, aggregate is US$120,000). Due to: (i) the small contract values
(US$10,000 - US$50,000 equivalent); (ii) works that are geographically scattered and spread over time,
due to, in part, climatic conditions; and (iii) labor-intensive techniques, procurement of small-scale civil
works would be procured under lump sum fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations
obtained by at least 3 qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation and according to
Bank guidelines. The PCU/PMU would advertise to solicit expressions of interest from contractors and
maintain a register of qualified firms. The register would be updated every 6 months and new contractors
would be added. Contractors and firms would be required to have experience in similar works in the last
two years. The PCU/PMU would use sample bidding documents developed in the ECA Region. The
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required
completion date, and relevant drawings where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who
offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to
complete the contract.
Consulting Services.
Eighty five percent of the consultants (firms and individual) required by the project shall be engaged
on Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS), and 15 percent of the consultants (firms and
individuals) shall be engaged by other procedures. Total consulting services shall account for 42 percent
of project procurement in the Federation and 35 percent of project procurement in the RS. Consulting
contracts exceeding US$50,000 shall be advertised in the local press. Individuals consultants shall be
selected in accordance with paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Guidelines: Selections and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers dated January 1997 and revised in January 1999. The selection
will be on the basis of comparison of qualifications among those expressing interest.
Consultant services would be procured for studies in the areas of accreditation, regulations, public
health, training and support. The PCU/PMU will use Bank standard contracts for all consultant services
contracts. The following procurement procedures will be used:



Page 98
1. Quality Cost Based Selection (QCBS) procedures would be used for contracting firms for studies
in development accreditation standards and criteria, development of regulations, family medicine
development, training and capacity building (MOHs), management and performance incentives,
and management of related training. All consulting assignments above the value of US$200,000
will be advertised in the Development Business publication. For Federation, estimated total
value is US$3.5 million. For RS, estimated total value is US$2.3 million.
2. Least Cost Selection (LCS) procedure would be used for selection of an auditor to carry out audit
of the Project (Federation: US$30,000; RS: US$30,000).
3. Individual Consultancies would be used for assignments related to project management
(PCU/PMU), as well as assignments requiring specialized expertise, to support the activities
detailed in paragraph 1 above. Estimated total value is US$500,000 for Federation, and
US$400,000 for RS. The PCU/PMU technical staff will be hired as individual consultants to
ensure continuity of technical expertise obtained through previous work on IDA-financed projects
and related training. They will be selected based on comparison of qualifications. There are no
project management firms as such in BiH with experience in carrying out the project management
functions for World Bank-financed projects. Expenses for PCU/PMU staff training would be
disbursed with prior approval of the Bank (Federation: US$60,000; RS: US$60,000).
Recurrent Costs.
Project-related travel and subsistence, vehicle insurance, operation and maintenance costs for
equipment, office maintenance and supplies will be on the basis of annual budgets, subject to IDA
approval. They will total US$800,000 for Federation, and US$400,000 for RS. The financing of these
costs by IDA is on declining basis.
Grants.
Under agreed Terms of Reference (technical and managerial), the Institute of Public Health (IPH) and
the PCU/PMU in each Entity would issue requests for proposals addressing the following subjects: local
initiatives on health promotion and disease control, with emphasis on tobacco control, prevention and
control of hypertension, tuberculosis and diabetes, adaptation and use of clinical prevention guidelines,
youth health, occupational health, and HIV. Through a competitive process, public and private
organizations, local health departments (excluding direct sub-units of the IPHs), institutes, educational
institutions and community groups may be eligible for support under this component. The IPH itself
would not be eligible. Requests for applications and results of competitions would be published in the
Entity concerned in at least one newspaper with credible circulation throughout the country. Criteria for
payment, acceptable to the Bank, would be established by the IPHs and the PCU/PMU. Payment would
be on a fixed basis, through contracting procedure between the IPHs and the winning groups. The Fund
in each Entity would be managed by a Board comprising representatives of the IPH and the PCU/PMU,
whose responsibility would be to review proposals and award grants, based on established criteria. All
proposals would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Aggregate amount available for grant funds in
Federation is estimated at US$200,000, and in RS at US$120,000.
Prior review thresholds (Table B):
The Bank's prior review of procurement will cover all IS and the first five NS packages, and all ICB,
NCB, and DC packages for the Federation-MOH, RS-MOH and at the cantonal/regional levels, and in
particular, the following: a) master lists of equipment, packaging of bids and updated cost estimates; b) all
ICB contracts for goods; c) all NCB contracts for civil works and the first five contracts for minor works



Page 99
in each pilot canton (Federation) or region (RS); d) terms of reference for all consulting assignments;
e) all direct contracting; and f) all consulting contracts with firms and with individual consultants. With
respect to prior review, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines
shall apply. It is estimated that this prior review will cover about 80 percent of the value of all contracts
combined for civil works, equipment and technical assistance financed by the Bank. One in five contracts
will be subject to selective post award reviews. Progress of procurement activities will be monitored by
the PCU in RS, and the PMU in the Federation. Periodic reports on procurement progress, including
variations in schedule, will be submitted to the Bank on a regular basis. Details of the procurement plan
will be discussed during the Project Launch Workshop scheduled for September 1999.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C):
The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three and a half years. The
disbursement profile of the Project has been based on experience gained during the previous two Bank-
funded projects within the health sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Project has been designed
within the capacity of the Federation MOH and RS MOH to execute over a three year period, and loan
funds are expected to be fully disbursed within three and a half years of Effectiveness.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
While acceptable disbursement mechanism based on PMRs is not in place, disbursements will take
place using the traditional disbursement mechanism based on SOEs. Disbursements will be made against
SOEs for contracts for: goods less than US$50,000 equivalent, except for the first five contracts in each
entity; works less than US$50,000 equivalent, except for the first five contracts in each pilot canton
(Federation) or region (RS); and all incremental operating expenditures. This documentation will be
made available for the required audit as well as to the Bank supervision mission, and will be retained by
the PCU/PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the
last disbursement was made. The processing, disbursement and monitoring of the allocations of the
proceeds of the Credit and Borrower counterpart financing would be managed by the PCU/PMU in
coordination and consultation with the Ministry of Finance.
Special account:
To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish, maintain and operate,
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, two separate Special Accounts, A and B, denominated
in Deustche Marks for the Federation-PMU and the RS-PCU, respectively. The authorized allocation for
Special Account A (Federation-PMU) will be DEM 1,100,000 and for Special Account B (RS-PCU)
DEM550,000.

Brief statement
Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into two separate Entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS). Each Entity has established its own
government which is governed by separate regulations and includes a Ministry of Health. Neither Ministry of Health has central procurement organization. For the most part, the
procurement activities are carried out at the Canton/Regional levels or by clinical centers/hospitals directly. The World Bank has funded two health sector projects (War Victims
Rehabilitation Project (WVR) in FBiH and the Essential Hospital Services Project (EHS) in both FBiH and RS.
EXISTING PIU CAPACITY
Two separate PIUs have been established in the Federation to implement and monitor EHS and WVR. Each PIU prepared procurement plans, financial reports, and purchased
goods, minor works and services under the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. An independent Procurement Monitoring and Auditing Unit (PMAU) has been established by the
Bank and monitors all major procurements to ensure conformity with World Bank Procurement Guidelines. The two Federation PlUs have extensive experience in the procurement
of civil works. However, additional training is required for the purchase of goods and consulting services via ICB procedures. Each PIU has 6 full time positions which are funded
by the ESH and WVR projects.
PROPOSED PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT.
Where possible, the MOH will be encouraged to hire nine experienced full time staff from the existing PIUs to support the PMU. The PMU will have an annual budget approved by
the Bank. Due to lack of procurement experience in the country, the MOI I has little capacity to carry out procurement activities, in accordance with World Bank procedures or
international commercial practices. The legislative framework in the Federation to support commercial procurement practices has yet to be developed. Due to the fact that some
procurement capacity exists in other PlUs supported by the Bank, there is capacity to procure goods and services according to WB guidelines. It is therefore recommended that the
PMU advertise for an individual with the appropriate skills and background. The PMAU will also monitor the procurement activities.

EXISTING PIU CAPACITY.
In the RS, a PIU has been established to implement and monitor EHS. The PIU prepared procurement plans, financial reports, and purchased goods, minor works and services under
the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. An independent Procurement Monitoring and Auditing Unit (PMAU) has been established by the Bank and monitors all major
procurements to ensure conformity with World Bank Procurement Guidelines. Due to changes in government and PIU staff, additional TA is required to work with the current staff
requires in the procurement goods, minor works and services is needed. The PIU has 6 full time positions which are funded by the EHS project.

Annex 6 - Capacity Assessment
Assessment of the Capacity of the
Project Management Unit (Federation of Bih)
and the
Project Coordination Unit (Republika Srpska)
General Information and Summary:
Date of Reports: March 24, 1999
Basis of the Reports
1.   This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Procurement Policy and
Services Group (OCSPR) memorandum dated August 11, 1998, on the assessment of the capacity of the
Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Federation of BiH (Federation) and the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) of the Republika Srpska (RS) which will be responsible for implementing the proposed Basic
Health Project (BHP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The report makes an assessment of the PMU and PCU,
taking into account their experiences with the implementation of the procurement under the ongoing IDA-
financed Essential Hospital Services (EHS) Project and the War Victims Rehabilitation (WVR) Project
(in the Federation) and the EHS Project (in RS), as well as the procurement environment in the country
and Entity in which the PMU/PCU will operate.
Scope of Review
2.   This review covers the assessment of the PCU/PMU's capacity to conduct the different phases of
the procurement cycle. It addresses the following: legal aspects; procurement cycle management;
organization and functions; support and control systems; record keeping; staffing; general procurement
environment; and general risk assessment. This summary also includes an action plan to further build the
PCU/PMU's capacity and the recommended thresholds under the proposed Project.
Project Description
3.    The proposed Project is the third in a planned series of three operations in support of the
Government's health sector recovery and development program.  Its objective is to support the
development of a viable Basic Health System of primary health care, public health and disease control.
More specifically, the Project will support the following:
(a) development of a primary health care system based on cost-effective interventions;
(b) reduction of lost productivity due to preventable illnesses, disabilities and premature deaths;
and
(c) improvement of national capacity for managing the health sector.
4.    In each Entity of BiH (Federation and RS), these objectives will be achieved through:
(a) training and deployment of family doctors, nurses and allied professionals;
(b) development of an environment that is supportive of family medicine and nursing practices;
(c) incentives and innovative techniques to increase the productivity of health service managers,
family doctors, nurses and allied professionals;
(d) rehabilitation and equipping of primary care facilities;



Page 114
(e) development of regulations, institutions and competencies for accreditation and quality
assurance; and
(f) policies and interventions for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,
accidents and injuries.
5. In order to achieve the project objectives, the Project will have to purchase goods, works, and
consulting services.
Procurement Implementation:
6.   The PCU in RS and the PMU in the Federation will have overall responsibility for procurement
under the Project. The PIUs established to implement the WVR Project and the EHS Projects in the
Federation will be consolidated to fortn the PMU to implement the project inthe Federation. In the RS,
the PIU established to implement the EHS Project will be strengthened and designated a PCU with TORs
satisfactory to IDA, to implement the BHP.
Existing Procurement Capacity
7. In the Federation, there are currently two PIUs, one to implement the EHS and one to implement the
WVR. The EHS PIU is more technically competent from a procurement standpoint than the WVR. The
EHS PIU includes one procurement officer who has been trained in IDA procurement procedures (ILO
course in Turin) and an architect who is responsible for procurement of civil works. The WVR PIU
includes one procurement officer, who has not received training in IDA procurement procedures, a
consultant who is hired as needed, a translator who also performs the procurement functions, and an
architect who is responsible for the procurement of civil works. Neither PIU includes an information
technology specialist who is familiar with the WB procurement procedures. Both PIUs maintain up-to-
date records. The procurement officers from the existing PIUs or new staff will be appointed by the
Project Director with the IDA approval to carry out the procurement functions under the Project. The
procurement capacity will be strengthened as funds for additional training (ILO Turin and Crown Agents)
is included in the Project.
8.  In the RS, the EHS PIU procurement capacity is limited. The PIU includes one procurement
officer who is responsible for the procurement of goods and services and one architect who is responsible
for the procurement of civil works. The procurement officer has not received formal training in WB
procurement procedures. An experienced procurement officer will be employed. Funds for procurement
training are included in the project to strengthen the procurement capacity of the PCU.
9.   For Grants, the Institute of Public Health (IPH) and the PCU/PMU in each Entity will issue
requests for proposals addressing the following subjects: local initiatives on health promotion and disease
control, with emphasis on tobacco control, prevention and control of hypertension, tuberculosis and
diabetes, adaptation and use of clinical prevention guidelines, youth health, occupational health, and HIV.
Through a competitive process, public and private organizations, local health departments (excluding
direct sub-units of the IPHs), institutes, educational institutions and community groups may be eligible
for support under this component. The IPH itself will not be eligible. Requests for applications and
results of competitions will be published in the Entity concerned in at least one newspaper with credible
circulation throughout the country. Criteria for payment, acceptable to the Bank, will be established by
the IPHs and the PCU/PMU. Payment will be on a fixed basis, through contracting procedure between
the IPHs and the winning groups. The Fund in each Entity will be managed by a Board comprising of
representatives of the IPH and the PCU/PMU, whose responsibility will be to review proposals and award
grants, based on established criteria. All proposals will be subject to prior review by the Bank.
Aggregate amount available for grant funds in Federation is estimated at US$200,000, and in RS at



Page 115
US$120,000. The procurement officers in the PMU/PCU will review the process to ensure that the
procedures being followed are in accordance with the WB procedures. IPH staff will receive basic
training in handling procurement matters.
Action Plan
10.  The following action plan will be implemented to strengthen the procurement capacity of the
PMU/PCU, as well as to provide information and support to all concerned for implementing procurement.
For the Federation:
*  The PMU should appoint the procurement officer and the assistant procurement officer before
the effectiveness of the credit or the project launch workshop, whichever is earlier.
*  The PMU should prepare and implement a training program (training in Turin or elsewhere)
for the procurement and assistant procurement officers which should begin with training
through the project launch workshop and should be completed within six months of the credit
effectiveness.
*  The PMU  should develop a computerized procurement monitoring system  to track
procurement actions as well as to produce up-to-date periodic reports for itself and the Bank.
*  Schedule a procurement seminar to familiarize the PMU and appropriate IPH staff with IDA
procurement procedures and the competitive bidding procedures to be followed for issuing
grants. The seminar should be held within six months of the credit effectiveness.
*  Assist the MOH in preparation of a proposal for an International Development Fund (IDF)
Grant to set up central procurement unit in MOH. The proposal should include but not be
limited to: the preparation of procurement procedures, standard bidding documents, design of
an asset management system for the hospitals, etc.. The proposal should be completed within
one year of the credit effectiveness.
For RS:
*  The PCU should appoint a procurement officer before the effectiveness of the Credit or the
project launch workshop, whichever is earlier.
*  The PCU should prepare and implement a training program (training in Turin or elsewhere) for
the procurement and assistant procurement officers which should begin with training through
the project launch workshop and should be completed within six months of the Credit
effectiveness.
*  The PCU should develop a computerized procurement monitoring system to track procurement
actions as well as to produce up-to-date periodic reports for itself and the Bank.
*  Schedule a procurement seminar to familiarize the PMU and appropriate IPH with IDA
procurement procedures and competitive bidding procedures to be followed for issuing grants.
The seminar should be held within six months of the Credit effectiveness.
*  Assist the MOH in preparation of a proposal for an IDF Grant to set up central procurement
unit in MOH. The proposal should include but not be limited to: the preparation of
procurement procedures, standard bidding documents, design of an asset management system
for the hospitals, etc. The proposal should be completed within one year of the Credit
effectiveness.

Suggested Thresholds
11.  The PMU and the PCU do not have extensive experience in Bank-financed projects; legislation
governing conflict of interest, corruption, and transparency has not been passed; and standards for
procurement which comply with IDA procurement guidelines have not been developed. For these
reasons, both the PMU and PCU have been rated high risk. It is, therefore recommended that the
following thresholds be used:
*  US$100,000 or more for each goods contract to be purchased using International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures.
* Less than US$100,000 for each goods contract to be purchased using International Shopping
(IS) procedures.
* Less than US$50,000 for each goods contract to be purchased using National Shopping (NS)
procedures. The first five contracts in each Entity will be subject to the World Bank's prior
review.
* Less than US$200,000 for each civil works contract to be purchased using National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures.
* Less than US$50,000 for each civil works contract to be purchased using Minor Works (MW)
procedures.
* For Grants, all proposals will be subject to the World Bank's prior review.
Review Thresholds
12.  The following prior review thresholds are recommended:
* All ICB contracts
* All NCB contracts
* All IS contracts
* All Consulting Services contracts
* All direct contracts
* First 5 NS contracts for each Entity
* First 5 MW contracts from each pilot canton/region
Assessment of the Public Procurement System
13.  As is evident from Attachments I and 2 [Summary of Findings and Actions (Federation) and
Summary of Findings and Actions (RS)], explicit policies and procedures have not been developed to
promote accountability, and establish internal controls, ethical standards, and anti-corruption measures.
As a result, the country does not have any legislation to ensure a transparent and fair procurement
process. In addition, there is a heavy presence of donors in BiH who have provided all of the equipment
and services required to expedite the transition from an emergency situation into sustainable development
efforts. Due to the war and shortage of local funds, the country has had little procurement experience and
has relied on the donor community to procure goods and services. Therefore, from a procurement point
of view, the country is a high risk.



Page 117
14.  It is recommended that a country procurement assessment (CPAR) of Bosnia and Herzegovina be
conducted as soon as possible. The CPAR will identify the weaknesses of the public procurement system
and will stimulate the dialogue on strengthening the procurement and related systems in the country as a
whole, and within each Entity. It is also recommended that an IDF Grant be made available to assist the
State of BiH and the two Entities to develop standard procurement procedures, anti-corruption legislation,
and a code of ethics. In addition, the IDF Grant could be used to assist the MOH in each Entity to
establish central procurement units to purchase pharmaceuticals, capital equipment, standard
consumables, etc. and an asset management system throughout the health sectors.
15.  The specific and most immediate actions that should be taken by the Government pending the
CPAR are as follows:
*  Develop anti-corruption and conflict of interest legislation.
*  Develop and legislate standard procurement procedures to ensure an open, transparent, and
fair procurement process.
*  Provide initial training to public officials in procurement.

procurement specialist will not only conduct ex-post reviews but will also continue providing guidance
and support to the procurement specialist in the PMU. The Beneficiary shall be required to establish a  Signature:
computerized project procurement system.
Comments: There is very little capacity to procure goods and works in accordance with international
commercial practices within the MOH, the Cantons, and Clinical Centers. Due to lack of procurement
experience in the country, other than the existing PIUs, the MOH has little capacity in carrying out
procurement activities in accordance with World Bank procedures or international commercial practices.
The legislative framework in the Federation to support commercial procurement practices has yet to be
developed. Due to the fact that some procurement capacity exists in the EHS PIU, and the World Bank
has established a PMAU to monitor and audit procurement, it is recommended that procurement advice be
provided by the Resident Mission's Procurement Advisor, on an as-needed basis. Additional advice will
be provided on supervision missions.
In the Federation, since the start of the conflict, the MOH has relied on foreign donors to provide
equipment, consumables, etc. necessary to operate its medical facilities. There is a need and an expressed
desire by senior MOH officials to organize a central procurement unit within the MOH to purchase and
reduce the price of standard items such as pharmaceuticals, hemodialysis consumables, surgical gowns,
etc. as these items are purchased, if and when funds are available, at canton level and/or by each clinical
center. However, before a central procurement unit can be established, the procurement capacity of the
MOH must be strengthened.
Also at the Federation Level, anti corruption and conflict of interest legislation needs to be adapted. The
fact that the legislation does not exist, affects the transparency of the entire procurement process. It is
suggested that an IDG be considered to assist the Federation draft such legislation, an internationally
acceptable procurement law, and standard bidding documents.

Comments: There is very little capacity to procure goods and works in accordance with international
commercial practices within the MOH, including Regional Hospitals, and Clinical Centers. Due to lack of
procurement experience in the country, the MOH has little capacity to carry out procurement activities, in
accordance with World Bank procedures or international commercial practices. The legislative framework
in RS to support commercial procurement practices has yet to be developed. Due to the fact that some
procurement capacity exists in other PIUs supported by the Bank, there is capacity to procure goods
according to WB guidelines. It is therefore recommended that the PCU advertise for and employ an
individual with the appropriate skills and background. The PMAU will also monitor the procurement
activities.
There is a need and an expressed desire by senior MOH officials to organize a central procurement unit
within the MOH to purchase, when local funds become available, and reduce the price of standard items
such as pharmaceuticals, hemodialysis consumables, surgical gowns, etc. as these items are purchased at
regional level and/or by the clinical center. However, before such a unit can be established, the
procurement capacity of the MOH has to be strengthened.
Also on the global level with in the RS, anti corruption and conflict of interest legislation needs to be
adapted. The fact that the legislation does not exist, affects the transparency of the entire procurement
process. It is suggested that an IDG be considered to assist the RS draft such legislation, an internationally
acceptable procurement law, and standard bidding documents.
NOTE: The questionnaire supporting above findings is available upon request.

Annex 7
Bosnia and Herzegovina: Basic Health Project
Financial Management
General:
A review of the Financial Management System was undertaken as a result of a recent mission to
(a) assess the project's capacity and readiness for the implementation of LACI; (b) review the
presence of the necessary elements for sound project financial management system such as internal
controls, project accounting, project staffing and audit arrangements; and (c) prepare a time-bound
action plan for strengthening the financial management system to achieve Project Management
Report (PMR)-based disbursement that would assist the project to move towards LACI. (Review of
Financial Management System in project files).
Project Management and Coordination:
The proposed Project is a single operation with two parts, one in each Entity (one in Republika
Srpska and the other in Federation of BiH). The Ministry of Health of each Entity will be the
implementing agency for the Project. In the Republika Srpska, it would be implemented by the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) covering all IDA-supported activities in the health sector, and in the
Federation, it would be implemented by a Project Management Unit (PMU).
Staff ng
Each Entity would have, at the least, one full time position for an accountant with sound
credentials and experience in accounting to make good judgements on the maintenance of the books
of accounts and on the production of financial information. This will be carried out prior to
effectiveness of the Project.
Disbursements:
It is expected that the proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed over a period of three years, which
includes six months for completion of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications. As there
is no standard disbursement profile for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the disbursement forecast is based
on the Bank's experience in financing similar projects in other ECA countries, and other projects in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Project's Closing Date is estimated to be August 30, 2002.
SpecialAccount.
To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish, maintain and operate,
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, two separate Special Accounts, A and B,
denominated in Deutsche Marks for the Federation-PMU and the RS-PCU, respectively. The
authorized allocation for Special Account A (for Federation-PMU) will be DEM 1,100,000 and for
Special Account B (RS-PCU) will be DEM550,000. The minimum amount of each application
should be 20% of the authorized allocation. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least
every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate
supporting documents.



Page 135
The Government will be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided by IDA
under the Credit, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits of the financial
statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. A computerized accounting system is envisaged to
be established at both, PCU and the PMU. Independently, the accountants at the PCU and the PMU
would maintain consolidated accounts (for their part of the project) each preparing quarterly financial
reports as part of Project Management Reports.
Accounting:
Both Entities will design a Project and Financial Management Information System (MIS) during the
course of Project preparation and prior to effectiveness. The system will be designed keeping in mind,
inter alia, an accounting and internal control system with the capacity to record and retrieve in a timely
manner, all financial transactions under the project. The system will comply with internationally accepted
standards and will (a) reliably record and report all assets, liabilities, and financial transactions of the
project; and (b) provide reliable financial information for managing and monitoring project activities.
The accounting system will be classified by component; it will reflect the sources of funds and will be
broken down into different types of expenditures for the project. Further, it will provide information on
the receipt and use of funds and will be able to produce financial reports comparing budget with actual
expenditures at any given time. The system will be capable of providing financial data to measure
performance when linked to the outputs of the project.
Financial Reporting:
Both Entities will independently maintain accounts for their part of the Project and will ensure
appropriate accounting of the funds provided. Each Entity will be responsible for preparing Project
Management Reports (PMR) on a quarterly basis, and will furnish the PMRs for such period to the Bank
not later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter, which:
(a) (i) sets forth actual sources and application of funds for the project, both cumulatively and for the
period covered by said report, and projected sources and applications of funds for the project for the six-
month period following the period covered by said report; and (ii) shows separately expenditures financed
out of the proceeds of the Credit during the period covered by said report and expenditures proposed to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Credit during the six-month period following the period covered by
said report;
(b) (i) describes physical progress in project implementation, both cumulatively and for the period
covered by said report; and (ii) explains variances between the actual and previously forecast
implementation targets; and
(c) sets forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures under contracts financed
out of the proceeds of the Credit, as at the end of the period covered by said report.
Project Operational Manual (POM):
The POM, which is being prepared by each Entity, will describe, among other information: (a) the
financial management system proposed under the project, with special emphasis on accounting and
auditing policies, standards and internal controls; (b) the role of the financial management systems in
project management and implementation; (c) the accounting arrangements required for project manage-
ment, the format for and content of project financial reporting; and (d) the auditing arrangements that will
be used during project implementation.



Page 136
Auditing:
Both Entities will be responsible for ensuring that the financial statements, special account, andSOEs
are audited by an independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with standards on auditing
that are acceptable to the Bank. The annual audit will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines
for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The audit
report shall be in a format in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing promulgated by the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The audit report will include a separate opinion for
SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from the Credit and SOEs
which will be included in the audit report accompanying the financial statements.
The audited financial statements of the special accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year,
including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statement of
expenditures, will be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year.
The audit of the financial statement will include: (a) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and
internal control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and ensure safe custody
of project-financed assets; (b) a deternination as to whether the project implementing entities have
maintained adequate documentation on all relevant transactions; and (c) verification that expenditures
submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing, and identification of any ineligible expenditures.
Conclusion
In my opinion, the project does not currently satisfy the Bank's minimum financial management
requirements. However, an Action Plan is being presented below which requires the PMU and the PCU
to design and implement satisfactory financial management systems to address the above issues. Once
this time-bound Action Plan is carried out successfully, it is believed that the project will, by then, have
developed an accounting system that will be able to produce the required level of financial management
reports in a timely fashion.
Action Plan:
In order to ensure that the project will have a sound financial management system in place, the
following time-bound Action Plan is presented:
1 .  Recruit Project Accountants (for both Entities)                March 31, 1999
(accomplished)
2.  Submit a written notification to the Bank by the Ministry of    April 30, 1999
Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of BiH that the Basic
Health Project has been included among other projects to be
audited by the Auditor acceptable to the Bank.
3.  Select and Purchase Accounting Software                         May 15,1999
This will include:
Defining the requirements of an accounting software, e.g.,
* Multi-currency capability (transactions and reporting);
* Language capability (e.g., Bosnian, English);
* Accounting policies;
* Reports required;
* Contract monitoring and control; and



Page 137
* Compatibility with other project hardware and software (e.g.,
hardware IBM-compatible, software Windows-compatible,
etc.)
4.  Install, Design Accounting System, and Trial-Run Software        July 30, 1999
This will include:
* Designing accounting flows and controls;
* Flow of information/documents;
* Flow of money;
* Internal controls; and
* Frequency of transaction and controls.
Design requiredfinancial reports, e.g:
* Local accounting requirements;
* Local tax requirements;
* World Bank requirements;
* Other donor requirements;
* Trust fund requirements;
* Reporting currencies; and
* Accounting policies.
5.  Visit by Financial Specialist to confirm adequacy of Project     August 31, 1999

Bosnia and Herzegovina: Basic Health Proiect
Proiect-ID: BA-PE 44523
Inadequate Financial and/or Procurement Management Svstem
Clearance for Negotiations
Financial Manazement Svstem:
I have reviewed the financial management systems relating to this project. The objective of the
revIew was to determine whether the project has in place adequate financial management
systems as required by the Bank/IDA under OP/BP 10.02.
Mv review was based on the review work performed by the project team's financial analyst,
NMr. Richard James, which included visits to the Project Management Unit (PMU) and Project
Co-ordination Unit (PCLD, was based on the Bank's guidelines for "Review of Financial
MVanaaement Svstem', and focused on the assessment of the project's accountinm svstems,
in-ernal controls, planning, budgeting and financial reporting systems, selection of auditors as
well as .he format and contents of the Project MNanagement Reports (P'vRs) to be submitted
by the borrower or duly authorised PNE and PCU; in support of Withdrawal Applications.
In mry opinion, the project does not currently sazisfv the Bank's minimum financial
management requirements.
There is however an 'Action Plan", a copy of which is attached to Appendix 7 of the Project
Appraisal Document, which requires the PMU and PCU to design and implement satisfactory
financial management systems to address the above issues. Work in this respect is already
undervav and is expected to be completed before effectiveness, being September 1999. I am
therefore satisfied that the financial management arrangements of the project are being
appropriately addressed on condition that this financial management assessment be revisited
prior to effectiveness and the financial management systems be deemed adequate.
