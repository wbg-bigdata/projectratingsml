MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Rwanda
Gitarama Agricultural Production and MINAGRI
Institutional Development Project (Credit 1669-RW)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Rwanda
Gitarama Agricultural Production and MINAGRI Institutional Development Project (Credit
1669-RW)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did not contribute comments
on Parts I and IH.
The T&V extension system was modified during implementation because of scarce
extension staff and absence of "whole farm" adapted research results. Instead, project staff took
on the task of multiplying and distributing seedlings, the main achievement of the project. No
applied research took place and the institution building component of the Ministry of Agriculture
was not implemented. The project is rated as unsatisfactory, its sustainability as unlikely and its
institutional development as partial.
The Project Completion Report is comprehensive and informative, but the
reestimated rate of return is not meaningful since it is based on a small sample and on a small
share of investment costs of the overall project.
The project will be audited once the follow-up project is completed.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA
GITARAMA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
AND MINAGRI INSTIlTUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1669-RW)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Gitarama Agricultural Production and
MINAGRI Institutional Development Project, for which Credit 1669-RW in the amount of SDR 11.7
million (US$12.7 million) was approved on March 28, 1986. The credit was declared effective on
February 27, 1987, a delay of eight months. The Credit was closed on September 30, 1991, on the
originally scheduled date. The last disbursement took place on January 31, 1992; the undisbursed
balance of SDR 2.75 million (US$2.99 million) was canceled on March 25, 1992.
The Project Completion Report was prepared jointly by the Agriculture Operations Division
of the South-Central and Indian Ocean Department of the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Summary,
Parts I and III). The Borrower was sent a request to prepare Part II, but no comments were received.
Tle preparation of the report is based on the findings of missions that made on-site visits in
1991 and project documentation, in particular the Staff Appraisal Report; Credit Agreement 1669-
RW; supervision reports; consultant reports; correspondence between the World Bank and the
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA
GITARAMA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
AND MINAGRI INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1669-RW)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Background. Rwanda is facing formidable constraints: rapid population increase, declining
soil fertility, lack of natural resources and a landlocked location. Agriculture, the main economic
activity, employs 80% of the country's manpower and will be the main source of any increase in
production, employment or income in the short term. Rwanda's Third Plan (1982-86) sought to focus
on agricultural operations. First and foremost, it called for a refocusing of agronomic research on
traditional farming systems; strengthening of linkages between research and agricultural extension;
and making extension services more rational.
2.    Objectives. The project had two main objectives: to test a new agricultural services model
in Gitaramna prefecture, as a low-cost and effective alternative to the dispersed regional development
projects approach followed so far by Government; and to improve the sectoral planning, monitoring
and evaluation capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture. If successful, the project was to establish the
basis for a unified national agricultural extension system. The project included four components:
the reorganization and strengthening of extension services in Gitarama prefecture; assistance to non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) active in the agricultural sector in that area (cooperatives; rural
credit; NGOs in the artisanal sector); strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI); and a
study on the development of marshlands in the Nyabarongo and Akanyaru valleys. All of these
components were fully or substantially completed, utilizing most of the Credit agreement, with the
exception of the MINAGRI strengthening component.
3.    Implementation Experience. All of the components, with the exception of the MINAGRI
strengthening component, were fully or substantially completed. The agricultural extension system
was significantly modified during implementation. On-farm research was carried out but by project
staff only as it suffered from insufficient participation from the National Agricultural Research
Institute (ISAR). The Nyabarongo Valley Study was completed after a long delay. The MINAGRI
Institutional Development component was not implemented due to the Government's refusal to finance
Technical Assistance with other than grant money. Grant monies were eventually obtained from
UNDP but proved ineffective.
4.    Results.  Project results have been mixed. While the agricultural extension system in
Gitarama prefecture was substantially modified, it did not sufficiently strengthen its operational
effectiveness in the desired direction: as linkages with research remained weak, and the training
program was only very partially implemented, the top-down approach to extension continued, and
extension messages were limited to the propagation of improved seed varieties and the use of inputs,
instead of encompassing improved cultivation practices as well. Also, the MINAGRI strengthening
component failed as the much delayed UNDP financed technical assistance was unable to achieve



lasting results. However, the extension service was able to disseminate improved cassava and sweet
potato varieties which were widely adopted by farmers (three times the original estimate of
beneficiaries from extension); the incremental production thus achieved using conservative estimates,
as measured against the cost of extension, yielded a rate of return of 21 % (against an expected 27 %
at appraisal) for this component. The support to non-governmental organizations did yield important
and sustainable results, and the marshlands development study (Nyabarongo), despite considerable
delays, did come to significant conclusions, the most important ones being that much fewer
marshlands were uncultivated than originally thought, and that of the remaining uncultivated
marshlands, the development cost would be high.
5.     Lessons Leargnd. While the project's overall results have been mixed, it has yielded a wealth
of experience and lessons that are now being applied to follow-up operations. The main lessons and
conclusions are the following:
(a)    widespread farmer adoption of just a small number of solid research results can be
enough to achieve a large production response. In Gitarama, important production
increases were achieved with the introduction of two basic foodcrops, cassava and
sweet potatoes. These production increases relieved the famine threat in an area of
high population density and impoverished soils;
(b)   the basis of sustained  capacity-building in agricultural extension should rest on
thorough understanding of farm practices and of evolving constraints in the cropping
season.  In this sense, capacity-building requires more support in extension
methodology than either the Government or the Bank provided in this project. In
particular, training of extension workers, regular farm visits and research-extension
linkages should be closely supervised. Partially because of the lessons learned under
this project, the support in extension methodology has now become available, and is
being provided under the Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2026-RW);
(c)   it also became apparent that the extension service in Gitarama prefecture was
overmanned and that streamlining of field services, by eliminating duplications and
providing better expertise, could result in personnel savings of up to 30%. These
lessons are now implemented nationwide in the reorganization of the service under
the Agricultural Services Project;
(d)   the operational deficiencies of the research establishment, which also became more
readily apparent under the project, will be addressed through a reorganization of
ISAR under a Phase II Agricultural Research project (under preparation); and finally,
(e)   the project demonstrated that assistance to non-governmental organizations can yield
satisfactory results at low cost, and is sustainable beyond project closure. Rural
credit was expanded, with good repayment rates; cooperative personnel has been
trained; although cooperative activities and cottage food-processing industries
remained constrained by the limited increase in commercial production and
agricultural income.



iv
6.     It was the specific objective of this project to test a new model of agricultural extension and,
if successful, to apply it nationwide. As it turned out, the new model was not well applied in
Gitarama prefecture, but its lessons have been taken to heart and are now successfully applied
nationwide. It is therefore our opinion that the impact of the project (although not its execution) has
been largely positive and is leading to sustainable results. Moreover, as the extension service was
able to achieve a measurable and durable increase in agricultural production in a very difficult
environment, we regard the overall results as satisfactory, especially in the wider context.

2. Backargund
2.1    Rwanda is facing formidable constraints: rapid population increase, declining soil fertility,
lack of natural resources and a landlocked location. Agriculture, the main economic activity,
employs 80% of the country's manpower and will be the main source of any increase in production,
employment or income in the short term. Rwanda's Third Plan (1982-86) sought to focus on
agricultural operations. First and foremost, it called for a refocusing of agronomic research on
traditional farming systems; strengthening of linkages between research and agricultural extension;
and making extension services more rational.
2.2   The project was designed during a time when the Bank wanted to reform integrated rural
development projects, after concluding that their limited impact on agricultural production, high costs
and complexity were making them unsustainable. Together with the Agricultural Research Project
(Credit 15466-RW), the Gitarama project reflected this change in approach. The Gitarama prefecture
was to serve as the site of a pilot agricultural services operation serving more than 700,000 people,
i.e. 130,000 farm families, or 12% of the national population, over an area of 2,188 Ikm2 (density
of 320 inhabitants/kin), distributed among four subprefectures and 17 communes.
3. Objectives and Description
3.1    Objectives. The project was to test an agricultural services model in the Gitarama prefecture
that would be replicable at the national level and increase the income of some 50,000 smallholders,
i.e. 40% of the prefecture's population (Table 3, Part IE). The project also included an institutional
development component, aimed at strengthening sectoral management by improving financial,
monitoring and evaluation systems within the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI).



2
3.2    Description. The Gitarama project included:
(1)    reorganizing and training agricultural extension personnel, as well as providing
logistical support, including equipment and construction;
(2)    a  research/development  program  to  refine  on-farm   adaptive  research
recommendations in conjunction with the National Agricultural Research Institute
(ISAR);
(3)    related activities, in particular to support training and research institutions,
agricultural credit, supply, processing and marketing;
(4)    a study on the development of Nyabarongo and Akanyaru Valleys;
(5)    a program  to improve sectoral planning; project preparation, monitorir.g and
evaluation; accounting and financial control; and administrative and budgetary
management in MINAGRI; and
(6)    a training program for personnel of MINAGRI.
4. Design
4.1    The project was designed following preparation by a team of expatriate consultants closely
involving MINAGRI staff. There was also heavy involvement of Bank personnel (Table 7.A). The
Bank was satisfied with the participatory approach used in Gitarama, which was deemed conducive
to develop the national capacity for project preparation.
4.2   In 1984, a seminar on agricultural extension had stressed the limited relevance of technical
recommendations in relation to smallholder needs. It was found that one of the main causes of the
failure of previous projects was the minor role allotted small farmers in project preparation and
implementation. The seminar had also criticized the confusion and poor administration resulting from
a profusion of integrated rural development projects. The Bank was particularly interested in
reforming the integrated rural development system that it had helped introduce (Table 1, Part IHo),
but which had not yielded the expected results.
4.3    Based on a general desire to establish a standard agricultural extension system at the national
level, the project was to apply the well-known "training and visit' principles (T & V), which involved
the optimal deployment of field extension agents to serve the agricultural population in the area (i.e.
on average 750 rural families for each of the 171 extension agents). The agents had wide-ranging
duties and predetermined itineraries for farm visits. They were to receive training in two-week
cycles, and monthly workshops were to be given for the technical specialists.
4.4    The T & V system could be readily incorporated into the local administrative organization;
each field extension agent was responsible for a "sector" (some 10 sectors making up a commune);
the sectors were divided into five to six cells, consisting of 50 to 200 families and extending over an
area that could be covered in one day by an agent, who would visit every two weeks. The agents
were to be supervised by communal extension officers.  Under the project, they were to provide



3
training for the field agents with occasional support from technicians in operational units. These
newly created operational units, corresponding to the subprefectural level of government, were to
play an important role in decision-making concerning extension themes, programming of activities
and administration of funds. From the start, the subprefectural agricultural personnel were thus
strengthened. Though at the prefecture level, the prefectural coordinator maintained authority over
the various services of the Ministry, the Gitarama Agricultural Project (GAP) was established as a
traditional legal and accounting entity, overseen by a MINAGRI representative (fonctionnaire-
dirigeant), in this case the Director of Agricultural Promotion.
4.5    Adaptive research was to be contractually designed and supervised by ISAR and carried out
by project agents. Although the conclusion of a contract between ISAR and the GAP was a condition
of effectiveness for the Credit, the real effort as regards the design of on-farm research began only
after it became effective.
4.6   In order to facilitate the development of improved techniques, input supply to farmers and
marketing of their surpluses, the project included related activities managed by the Project Promotion
Office and subcontracted to specialized institutions, such as agricultural credit to the Banques
Populaires, management training for cooperatives to the Center for Cooperative Training and
Research (IWACU), and subsequently to the Gitarama Cooperative Services Center, and promotion
of artisanal activities (in particular the manufacture of agricultural tools) to KORA, a local association
of artisans.
4.7    The study of the Nyabarongo and Akanyaru Valleys was to assess the development potential
of an expanse of marshlands, which the Government saw as one of the last reserves of arable land
not yet in use. The cost of the studies was estimated at US$1.2 million.
4.8    The MINAGRI institutional development component was conceived as a complement to the
Gitarama agricultural production component, in the sense that it was to enable MINAGRI to supervise
and evaluate its projects, services and policies.  Thus, through the MINAGRI institutional
development component, evaluation of projects such as the Gitarama agricultural component would
make it possible to formulate strategies on which national agricultural policies could be based. In
addition to Bank financing, the component was to receive United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) support in accordance with an agreement signed August 2, 1986 that made the Bank the
implementing agency.
5. Implementation
5.1    Agricultural extension. The agricultural extension system, initially planned along T & V
lines, was significantly modified during implementation. With the idea of quickly reachbng a large
share of the population, project officials made the farmers who were team leaders at the Community
Development and Training Centers (Centres Communaux de Developpement et de Formation
Permanente - CCDFP) responsible for training their teams of farmers, on the basis of 'development
contracts." From the start, the collective contracting system effectively dampened the self-interest
and individual freedom of the smallholder farmer. Moreover, the training of extension agents in two-
week cycles, and the monthly workshops for technical specialists were gradually abandoned and
replaced by training sessions not linked to the regular monitoring of the cropping season. This was
caused by a lack of field observations and of practical exercises which kept the information on



4
farming methods and food crops to a superficial level and which, in turn, led to a relative ignorance
of farming practices, and made the extension training cycle and monthly workshops void of content.
Rather than breaking down the themes to facilitate their spontaneous adoption, albeit partially and
gradually, the extension services sought to speed up the adoption of poorly accepted themes by
concentrating on a more limited area. Two of the four subprefectures were thus reorganized in 1989
into 'collines-pilotes' and 'cellules-pilotes." For the former, the extension agents concentrated on
one "colline-pilote" per year, whereas for the latter, the field agents assisted only some 30 farms.
With this system, two or three thousand farmers could benefit from agricultural extension in each
operational unit, i.e. about 10,000 prefecture-wide, an objective that was markedly below the 50,000
smallholders initially targeted. Fortunately, however, in response to the threat of famine in 1989,
the project achieved one of its key successes by organizing the multiplication and widespread
dissemination of improved cassava and sweet potato varieties (beyond the 10,000 farmers benefitting
from extension, see para 6.1).
5.2    On-farm Research.  Project implementation achieved insufficient participation of ISAR,
reflecting over-optimistic expectations on ISAR's output. Because ISAR researchers were few and
young, and did not have the ability to rapidly produce practical solutions, the contract between ISAR
and the project unit (which provided for ISAR to make three visits per cropping season in the project
area-i.e. six per year, to supply genetic material and to train project agents) should have been used
mainly to develop researchers' field exposure. In practice, on-farm research was carried out almost
unilaterally by the project itself, and as it was not supported from the outside, it eventually ran out
of steam. At the start (19861987), the project was able to formulate the details of on-farm research
and overcome the inexperience of its agronomist in charge, by recruiting a seasoned expatriate expert
for six months. The latter's recommendations for 1987, reflecting a knowledge of farming systems
that he deemed insufficient (particularly as regards crop rotation and associations), were limited to
varietal trials on two crops, beans and cassava. However, his recommended focus of adaptive
research on farm-ng practices and smallholder seed production and distribution systems was
increasingly negle..Led for want of professional support. Available techniques (apical cuttings of
sweet potatoes, various pruning techniques of coffee trees, seed treatment) therefore remained poorly
understood. The expatriate expert also recommended training of project personnel in on-farm
research activities, which was neglected.
5.3    The on-farm research activities were therefore characterized by insufficient proximity to the
smallholder milieu. Also, the expatriate expert expected the trials in each commune (7,000 farmers)
to be done with only 10 farmers, over an area of 1 are (10 m x 10 m). In 1990, those activities
primarily involved multi-location varietal improvement, fertilization and demonstration trials
(soybeans and pineapple). Instead of testing a large number of inexpensive techniques centered on
improving farming practices with the means available, the adaptive research activities remained
focused on the distribution of inputs (including genetical plant material), which were often subsidized.
5.4    Related  activities. The project's Agricultural Promotion Office subcontracted the bulk of
related activities to non-government organizations. These consisted of (i) support to groups and
cooperatives; (ii) rural credit; (iii) support for artisanal activities; (iv) dissemination of inputs; and
(v) seed production (cuttings and seedlings); as summarized below.
(a)    A non-governmental organization under contract (Center for Cooperative Training
and Research, IWACU) trained the officials of some 15 commercial cooperatives
(marketing coffee, beans and sorghum, each in a different commune) in financial



5
management and assisted some six 'intergroupements" (small local smallholder
associations) in planning their activities.
(b)    As regards rural credit, the project provided means to the existing network of
Banques Populaires (receiving support from the Swiss Government) to set up a
branch in Gitarama and grant pre-harvest credit in the prefecture, a form of consumer
credit to ease the cash flow constraints of households during the lean times preceding
harvest. This initiative involved some 5,000 smallholder families. The Gitarama
Banque Populaire also financed working capital for marketing coffee, sorghum and
beans. In contrast, agricultural production credit was relatively limited for lack of
demand.
(c)    Support to artisanal activities was constrained by KORA's implementation capacity,
and had to be interrupted in 1989, at which point the Government contracted
IWACU, a stronger institution, to research and develop cottage food-processing
industries.
(d)   Input distribution (kitchen garden seed, agricultural tools and equipment, plant
treatment products and fertilizer) was assigned to cooperatives and farmer groups and
handled through some 30 sales points throughout the prefecture. The Promotion
Office served as wholesaler. In 1988, the cooperatives and farmer groups sold
US$35,000 in inputs, representing a small share of demand (which could be
estimated at equivalent to several dollars per farm household, primarily for tools and
kitchen garden seed). The lack of training on the part of sales personnel in using the
products, the high cost of certain products in relation to market prices, and the low
demand for plant treatment products and fertilizers limited the impact of this activity.
(e)    Seed production was first handled through three government-operated seed farms
(totaling 60 ha), but has been since 1989 subcontracted to smallholders in order to
reduce costs and inefficiency.
5.5    Management. Management of the Gitarama component was affected by poor internal control
within the Ministry of Agriculture. Absorbed by other responsibilities, thefonctionnaire-dirigeant
could not supervise the project properly. However, with expatriate technical assistance, project
finances were well managed up to 1990, despite some friction between the prefectural coordinator
and thefonctionnaire-dirigeant, the former resenting centralized control of expenditures. In 1990,
the audit mission found deficiencies in the accounting records, though of minor significance compared
to overall project expenditures. These deficiencies, which had not been resolved by the time of credit
closing, led to the replacement of the prefectural coordinator in 1991.
5.6   Study on the development of Nyabarongo Valley. Despite several delays, the study of
Nyabarongo and Akanyaru Valleys was completed under the project. It was overseen by the Rural
Engineering Department in the Ministry of Agriculture and prepared with the assistance of
consultants. Competitive bidding was opened on April 10, 1986 among five consulting firms and the
bids submitted on July 22, 1986. The contract, awarded to SOGREAH, a French consulting firm,
after a long procedural process, was signed on October 2, 1987. In 1987, the World Bank allocated
special resources from its Africa Region Technical Department for supervision of the study, which
was submitted to and approved by the Government in 1989. However, the Bank was not satisfied



6
and requested additional information on institutional, land tenure and environmental aspects. After
revision, the study was accepted by the Bank in 1991. The main findings of the study were that,
contrary to general opinion, few marshlands still existed that had not already been put under
cultivation and could profitably be reclaimed. The study only identified some 15,000 ha (or less than
10% of the studied area) for further feasibility study preparation, and even in this area of
reclamation, unit costs would be high. As a result, the World Bank indicated in its review of
Rwanda's public expenditures, (Report No. 7717-RW of October 19, 1989) that swamp reclamation
works were to be considered much less of a priority for Rwanda.
5.7    MINAGRI institutional development. This component was modified during execution. In
1987, the Minister had already requested the World Bank to postpone the component, feeling it was
preferable to use available grants (UNDP, bilateral aid) rather than the IDA credit.  After
considerable delays, the Government and UNDP concluded a new project agreement in 1990,
("Management Support to the Ministry of Agriculture"), making FAO the executing agency and
covering accounting, management, monitoring and evaluation, but no longer encompassing sectoral
planning, which was to be handled by an ad hoc commission (the National Agriculture Commission).
While this commission has produced a commendable report, no in-house strengthening of the
monitoring and evaluation capacities of MINAGRI has been achieved.
6. Results
6.1    Agricultural extension and adaptive research. Project results have been mixed. Compared
to appraisal expectations, whereby the intensification rate was to reach 25%, i.e. 33,000 farms in
year 5 (Appraisal Report, Annex 6), field observations in 1991 did not confirm such a high level,
particularly as regards the adoption of improved cultivation practices. However, some specific
themes, (rapid multiplication of sweet potato and cassava, erosion control), have been widely
disseminated; the 1990 activity report indicates that some 50% of farms had received cassava and
sweet potato cuttings. Adoption rates for other themes are summarized in Tables D and E of the
Annex and show that in 1990 (year 5 of the project) value added reached 60% of the target of model
N2 for small farms and 53% of the target for medium-size farms. Such benefits are sufficient to
produce a rate of return of 21 % for the extension component, using conservative estimates as shown
in the appended economic analysis, compared to 27% at appraisal.
6.2   In relation to the main objective of the project, which was to establish a viable agricultural
extension model, results have been less convincing. Ultimately, the project involved only a small
percentage of the 130,000 farmers in the prefecture in 1985 (Table 3); it successfully disseminated
only a few themes; it did not sufficiently mobilize research, and it responded insufficiently to
farmers' demands, particularly regarding improved farming practices. Because implementation was
not systematic or rigorous, the implementation of extension methodology has remained problematic.
Against the objectives of increasing the relevance of extension messages and strengthening linkages
between research and extension, progress in the organization and management of agricultural
extension overall was disappointing. It also became apparent that the extension service in Gitarama
prefecture was overmanned and that streamlining of field services, by eliminating duplications and
providing better expertise, could result in personnel savings of up to 30%.
6.3    The related activities also had mixed results. Results were positive in the assistance to NGOs
whose activities will survive the project (in particular the Banques Populaires and IWACU) and



7
whose specific experience, implementation and coordination capability benefitted from involvement
in the project. Rural credit was expanded with good repayment rates. Results are uncertain in the
development of farmer associations, failing a substantial increase in commercial production and
agricultural income. Finally, the project's assistance to input distribution (kitchen garden seed, tools
and chemicals) had a limited impact (para 5.4 (d)).
6.4    Despite its high cost, the Nyabarongo feasibility study was a clear achievement of the project
and showed the benefits of good supervision. The study made an important contribution to the
formulation of a national swamp reclamation policy, showing the limited potential for reclamation
and the high cost of such investment. The least costly option recommended would still cost
US$17 million for the reclamation of 8,000 ha, i.e. more than US$2,000 per ha. One of the
questions raised by the study was the social equity of the operations which, even on a modest scale
and at the rate of 0.25 ha per smallholder, would still have cost US$500 per farmer.
6.5    The tardy and partial execution of the MINAGRI institutional development component
undoubtedly hindered supervision of the Gitarama component. Conversely, the mediocre results of
the Gitarama component as regards the organization and management of agricultural extension and
adaptive research delayed the expected improvement in MINAGRI's institutional ability to influence
general growth in agricultural production in Rwanda.
7. Sustainabilitv
7.1    At project completion, its sustainability was uncertain: in spite of the good results achieved
with the propagation of cassava and sweet potato varieties, the changes introduced to reinforce the
extension service had not really taken hold, thus limiting its ultimate effectiveness close to pre-project
levels. Since, however, its lessons have been taken to heart: the Bank agreed to locate an extension
specialist in Rwanda to advise the Government on improved extension methodologies and help to set
up and implement training programs under the follow-up Agricultural Services project which extends
nationwide; and the Government agreed to reorganize the extension service along the lines of the
Gitarama model, but covering the entire country, and to improve extension-research linkages under
the follow-up Agricultural Research II project.  These changes have now been successfully
implemented nationwide. The impact of the project (although not its execution) has thus been largely
positive and is leading to sustainable results.
8. Performance of the Bank
8.1          Despite continuous supervision (Table 6.B, Part III), the Bank failed to mobilize the
necessary combination of expertise in agricultural extension, including at least three elements: (i) a
thorough understanding of the management system to be introduced; (ii) the training capability for
holding induction seminars; and (iii) solid qualifications in agronomy. Although the third element,
agronomic expertise, was indisputably available, the other elements of expertise in agricultural
extension were lacking; not one supervision mission included an extension management specialist.
Thus, although the first supervision mission highlighted the need to develop low-cost husbandry
messages as a priority, the extension services failed to heed this advice, largely because the
institutional pressure towards this goal was relaxed. Unfortunately, extension specialists were in short



8
supply in the World Bank. On the other hand, supervision helped produce a good quality product
in the Nyabarongo study.
9. Performance of the Borrower
9.1   Inadequate Borrower performance in project execution was attributable to the Borrower's
insufficient supervision and practical familiarity with organization and management of agricultural
extension. In addition, the delay in executing the institutional development component and the
overload of responsibilities on the fonctionnaire-dirigeant hindered administration and made it
impossible to resolve the irregularities observed in the 1990 and 1991 audits. Lastly, budget
constraints that began with the general economic decline starting in 1989 caused problems for the
programming of public expenditures. Estimated project cost (US$10 million over five years),
representing about US$15 per year and per farm household, was in excess of the reasonable cost of
agricultural extension and adaptive research Oess than US$5). In addition, the establishment of a
unified agricultural extension policy was hindered by the large number of projects (over eighty
overseen by MINAGRI), which were competing for public funds. This constraint was acknowledged
from the start, but the project failed to resolve it by demonstrating an alternative, low-cost and
effective extension strategy.
10. Performance of Consultants
10.1  In the context of project design and execution, the performance of consultants was deemed
good in the preparation and start-up of the project.  In project implementation, consultant
performance was constrained by a lack of familiarity with organization principles of agricultural
extension. In addition, the financial expert (who developed the system that delivered financial
statements within a few days of the end of the fiscal year) also faced external constraints, such as
delays in the institutional development component, poor relations between the prefectural coordinator
and the fonctionnaire-dirigeant, and a lack of guidelines on the management of agricultural extension.
A better administrative environment would have markedly simplified the management and monitoring
of project finances. Lastly, the consulting firm responsible for the Nyabarongo study ultimately
delivered satisfactory results, but required close supervision.
11. Project Documentation and Data
11.1         Project documentation and data were generally adequate, including the legal
agreement and the staff appraisal report which provided the necessary framework for guiding
implementation. Most data needed for preparing the PCR were readily available in supervision
reports, project activity reports and related documents.

APPENDIX
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Modology
The ex-post economic evaluation using a somewhat simplified version of the appraisal methodology
shows a robust rate of return (21%, see Table A). The simplification consisted in using only the two most
representative farm models: N2 and N4. They provide a sufficient approximation of the real situation.
Only the without-fertilizer scenario was used because fertilizer had minimal success.
Taking account of the experience under the project, Table B shows more cautious assumptions than
the Appraisal Report regarding the number of farms under intensification. Their numbers are the same
for the fifth year of the project (33,000) but for the first year, they are reduced to one-fifth of that number
(by linear interpolation) and they remain constant after the fifth year instead of continuing to increase
(reflecting a more realistic assumption of prospects at the completion of the project).
Tables D and E show the methodology used to calculate project impact on income from N2 and
N4 farms based on the adoption rates shown in Table 3, Part Im of the Project Completion Report.
Agricultural extension costs were based on the Appraisal Report, with several adjustments, given
in Table C.
