EMPRESA NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (TELECOM)
APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project comprising part of the works of the
Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM) 1977-82 development program
scheduled to be started and completed during the six-year period 1977-82.
ii.       TELECOM operates national telegraph, telex and long distance serv-
ices, and all international telecommunication services. Local services are
fragmented among TELECOM and 47 other poorly coordinated entities, many of
them very small in size and lacking in managerial and technical skills. The
institutional consolidation of the fragmented local entities is essential if
efficient planning, financing and project implementation are to be achieved.
iii.      The project would:
(a) help consolidate into TELECOM a significant proportion of
the small municipal and state government-operated local
telephone entities, and rationalize and improve service
in the small towns and rural communities they now serve;
(b) greatly expand access to telephone service in rural areas by
providing long distance call offices to 2,200, out of about
4,000 rural communities now without telephone facilities;
(c) upgrade service in 150 rural areas currently using call
offices, by installing manual exchanges;
(d) upgrade and expand the long distance network to cater to
the additional traffic generated over the network (including
rural call offices); and
(e) significantly develop local networks in small towns to meet
part of the demand for local connections.
At the end of the project, TELECOM will have absorbed 32 of the 47 other
entities currently responsible for telephone services in Colombia, paving
the way to better services particularly in small towns and rural areas.
iv.       The project will largely meet the objectives set by Government who
consider the extension of telephone services to all rural communities essen-
tial in the provision of health-and agricultural extension services, effi-
cient regional transport and proper marketing of rural agricultural output.



- ii -
v.        The project is estimated to cost Col$ 7,937 (US$167.7) million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$101.3 million equivalent. The pro-
posed Bank loan of US$60 million would partially cover the foreign costs;
the balance of US$41.3 million would be covered by an Inter-American Devel-
opment Bank loan of US$16 million (plus an additional US$13 million in
Colombian pesos for financing local currency expenditures), and by TELECOM's
own resources. TELECOM would also provide the balance (US$53.4 million equiva-
lent) of local costs.
vi.       TELECOM has the managerial and technical capabilities -- achieved
with Bank assistance during the past decade -- and will be able to effectively
undertake the new responsibilities. In addition, the internal organization of
TELECOM is being strengthened during the proposed project.
vii.      All Bank-financed equipment would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
viii.     TELECOM plans to make annual tariff revisions during the project
period. With these tariff increases, the project would be financially sound.
The internal rate of return is estimated at 19%.  Internally generated funds
during the project period would provide 62% of the financing requirements
after servicing all debt.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$60 million equivalent
for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of three and one-half years.
The Republic of Colombia would be guarantor of the loan.



1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has requested Bank assistance in fi-
nancing the 1977-82 development program of Empresa Nacional de Telecomu-
nicaciones (TELECOM). The proposed borrower and beneficiary of the loan
would be TELECOM.
1.02      TELECOM's development program is estimated to cost Col$ 16,177
(US$345.9) million including a foreign exchange cost of about US$222.4 mil-
lion equivalent. The project, which would comprise part of TELECOM's develop-
ment program, is expected to be started and completed during 1977-82. The
project provides for: the installation of additional local exchange lines
mainly in provincial and rural communities; provision of rural telephone
call offices; and the extension of long distance facilities to handle traffic
from those lines, from the rural call offices and from existing connections.
The cost of the project is estimated at Col$ 7,937 (US$167.7) million, includ-
ing a foreign exchange component of US$101.3 million equivalent. The proposed
Bank loan would provide US$60 million equivalent, and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) would provide US$16 million (plus an additional US$13
million equivalent in Colombian pesos to cover local costs). The balance of
foreign costs (US$25.3 million) and of local costs (US$53.4 million equivalent)
would be provided by TELECOM.
1.03      The Bank has been continuously associated with the telecommunica-
tions sector in Colombia since 1967. In June 1967 the Bank approved a US$16
million loan (499-CO) to TELECOM to help finance a project to establish a
modern long distance network and to expand and improve the national and
international services. The project has been completed. In May 1971, a
second loan (740-CO) for US$15 million was approved to help finance a proj-
ect for the installation of new local networks and for the extension of long
distance telecommunications facilities. This project is expected to be
completed by June 1977, about 30 months behind schedule. A third Bank loan
(1073-CO) for US$15 million approved in January 1975, is financing a further
extension of local and long distance services within the country, an increase
in telex services, and an extension of telephone services to about 200 rural
towns. This third project is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to
be completed on schedule in December 1978.
1.04      In May 1975 the Bank undertook a telecommunications sector study
at the request of the Government of Colombia. This study (Report No. 663-CO)
recommended that the sector be integrated by progressively consolidating all
the various entities into a single entity. The Government has agreed to the
need for such consolidation. The study also recommended that, as a first
step, TELECOM takes over the smaller entities to remove the existing con-
straints to planning and financing the required improvement and expansion
of their facilities. One of the proposed project's aims is to assist TELECOM
in this initial step toward consolidation.
1.05      This report is based on information obtained from TELECOM and on
the findings of a mission composed of Messrs. M. DeLima and R. Mitchell which
visited Colombia in October 1976.

2. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Role of Telecommunications in the Economy
2.01      Colombia has a population of about 24 million people distributed
over a number of distinct regions divided principally by mountain ridges.
High mountain chains isolate the densely populated districts from each other
and the coast; the sparsely populated districts over a large part of the
country and extend into the Amazon forests. About half the population is
urban; more than a quarter live in the four main cities of Bogota, Medellin,
Cali and Barranquilla, all of which are important administrative and manu-
facturing centers. Annual population growth has averaged 2.8%; GDP growth
at 6.7%. In 1975 the value of exports of agricultural products (including
coffee) comprised over 70% of the country's total value of export; industrial
products about 24%.
2.02      Agricultural production for export requires adequate and reliable
telecommunications to coordinate transport, sales, fertilizer and pest con-
trol supplies, and to facilitate timely deliveries of the products. 1Manu-
facturing requires coordination of a series of operations which are dependent
on adequate communications. The provision of reliable telecommunications
services is an obvious requirement for an expanding economy which needs such
services to operate effectively. Additionally, Government considers the
extension of telephone services to all rural communities essential in the
provision of health and agricultural extension services.
Sector Organization
2.03      TELECOM, the proposed Borrower, operates all long distance, inter-
national telephone, telex and telegraph services. Local services are frag-
mented among TELECOM and 47 other poorly coordinated entities.
2.04      TELECOM has been required by Government to provide local telephone
services in rural areas and communities where the other entities are not
willing or able to provide these services due to the small size of the com-
munities and to the remoteness of the locations. On this basis, TELECOM
provides local services at six large towns, several small towns and in rural
areas; TELECOM thus functions in all areas of the country. The existing
facilities provided by TELECOM are set out in Annex I and in the maps.
2.05      Currently, about 95% of the total local telephone services are
operated by 47 other telephone entities. Many of the entities are small --
24 of these local companies each operate from 200 to 1,400 lines. Only eight
local companies operate more than 10,000 lines. Annex 2 sets out the list of
operating companies.
Sector Constraints
2.06      While TELECOM and the two largest entities at Bogota and Medellin
are able to prepare their plans, they do so independently of each other.



-3 -
Most of the smaller ones do not possess the managerial and technical competence
to plan and implement expansion. They are in financial difficulties due to
excessive short-term financing, reluctance to introduce adequate tariffs and
poor organization. Procurement practices are unsatisfactory, and service is
poor. In the absence of in-house facilities in the majority of entities,
Government has undertaken a number of detailed functions, e.g. detailed reviews
of expansion plans of the municipal entites, of procurement, etc., which should
normally be undertaken by the operating entities, thus leading to considerable
increase of avoidable processing and delays. The consequence has been a stag-
nation in provision of facilities, and the generally poor service in the sector
and particularly so in the small towns and rural areas.
2.07      Government decided in 1971 that TELECOM should set aside a part of
the gross national long distance revenues for the acquisition and expansion
of local entities. The progress of acquisition was relatively slow because
TELECOM (a) had not gained sufficient experience in local services operations
and wanted to gain some more before embarking on further acquisition; and
(b) had to utilize all available financial resources to extend long distance
services, its primary responsibility.
2.08      Following a Government request, the Bank carried out a sector study
in May 1975. The Bank recommended gradual consolidation of the sector into a
single entity. Two alternative courses of action were considered. The first,
through compulsory acquisition of local entities, would entail changes in
Colombia's legislation and could give rise to political problems as well as
delays. The second was to supplement the present practice of purchasing local
entities by TELECOM, by channeling investment for the entities' development
through TELECOM in exchange for TELECOM's equity participation in the entity.
The Government of Colombia endorsed this approach, and the proposed fourth
project has been designed to support this objective. The sector strategy is
to work within the present legislative framework and develop and improve the
services to the small towns and rural areas.
Access to Service
2.09      Starting with a density of 2.4 telephones per 100 population at
the time of the Bank's first loan, the density has risen at end-1975 to 5.45
telephones per 100 population which is slightly above average among Latin
American countries at similar development stages. Service, however, is con-
centrated in eight large cities with about 85% of the total telephones in
the country. Out of about 4,500 rural communities, only about 500 have access
to telephones. Annex 3 sets out international telephone statistics.
2.10      As of December 31, 1975, the local telephone system in Colombia had
about 1,285,000 telephones, of which TELECOM provided 58,000 telephones in
provincial and rural areas. The unfilled demand was about 250,000. In addi-
tion, the lack of adequate expansion has resulted in a heavy overload of the
call-handling equipment, network congestion and subscriber dissatisfaction.
Despite considerable improvement in long distance communications which
expanded at an annual rate of about 20%, quality of service remains deficient.
Congestion continued as the surge of traffic kept exceeding forecasts.



-4-
Sector Objectives
2.11      The strategy followed during the last decade of Bank participation
through two projects nearly completed has been to:
(a)  establish a modern long distance network with associated
long distance exchanges to link together the principal areas
of the country and provide a nationwide high quality sub-
scriber dialing network covering nearly all automatic ex-
changes in the country;
(b)  expand local telephone services in areas which were or
became TELECOM's responsibility;
(c)  establish an institutional framework for sector development;
(d)  develop a financial basis for future expansion; and
(e)  initiate sector consolidation.
2.12      During Bank's involvement in two projects, TELECOM increased the
number of exchanges from 376 to 430; the total capacity of those exchanges
from about 12,000 lines to about 70,000 lines; and the total number of con-
nections from about 11,000 to about 53,000. At the completion of the third
project in 1978, TELECOM would operate 476 exchanges with a total capacity
of about 101,000 lines and about 80,000 connections. In addition, TELECOM
has also achieved considerable expansion of long distance facilities and
has established facilities for subscriber dialing of long distance calls
for about 95% of the total subscribers in Colombia.
2.13      The sector objectives to be accomplished under the proposed proj-
ect are to:
(a)  help consolidate into TELECOM a significant proportion of
the small municipal and state government-operated local
telephone entities, and to rationalize and improve service
in the small towns and rural communities they now serve;
(b)  greatly expand access to telephone service in rural areas
by providing long distance call offices to 2,200, out of
about 4,000, rural communities now without telephone facil-
ities;
(c)  upgrade service in 150 rural areas currently using call
offices, by installing manual exchanges;
(d)  upgrade and expand the long distance network to cater to
the additional traffic generated over the network (in-
cluding rural call offices); and



- 5 -
(e) significantly develop local networks in small towns to
meet part of the demand for local connections.
An additional objective is to consolidate and improve the internal organiza-
tion of TELECOM particularly to cope with the expansion of its responsibil-
ities. At the completion of the project in 1982, TELECOM will have absorbed
32 (including the six associated entities) of the 47 other entities currently
responsible for telecommunications in Colombia. TELECOM would then operate
about 190,000 exchange lines with about 158,000 connections as well as serve
2,700 rural communities through call telephones.
Sector Organization
2.14      As a result of the sector changes planned during the project period,
TELECOM will be vested with most of the responsibility for telecommunications
services in the provincial and rural areas, paving the way to better services
and thus to contribute significantly to the effective functioning of the dif-
ferent economic and extension services in these areas. The long-term effects
of this integration would be (a) standardization of equipment with attendant
large-scale procurement resulting in at least 20-30% lower costs; (b) strength-
ening of the institutional framework for sector development; (c) elimination
of duplication of services in many towns; (d) rationalization of staff with
improvement of training, improving service standards and efficiency; and
(e) developing a financial basis for further consolidation and future expan-
sion.
2.15      With the new added responsibilities of TELECOM at the completion of
the project, a comprehensive knowledge of the benefits in providing service
in different areas is useful to achieve maximum effectiveness in future plan-
ning and in deciding on the size of future investments, pattern of development
and priorities. During negotiations, TELECOM has agreed to take up studies of
qualitative and quantitative benefits as part of their normal planning work
and to furnish not later than July 1978, a plan for undertaking such studies
with the assistance, if necessary, of economists from Colombian universities
or Government.
Audit Report Findings
2.16      The Audit Report on the first project financed under Bank Loan
499-CO and executed between 1967-74, while holding an overall positive view of
the Bank's achievements, points out the large delays in project implementation
caused by poor planning and project management. Another comment relates to
the continuing unsatisfactory position of the accounts receivable pertaining
to the local entities and the Government.
2.17      The delays in project implementation were mainly due to slow pro-
curement and problems encountered in building construction, which mostly
occurred in the early stages of the first Bank-financed project. Since then,
TELECOM has improved its managerial and technical competence and has now good



experience in all aspects of project implementation as is shown by the pro-
gress currently being made in the execution of the third project. While the
status of accounts receivable shows improvement, there are still residual
problems in the collection of a portion of past arrears. From 1976, TELECOM
has been able to collect on a current basis dues from services rendered to
the major connecting local entities who were the principal defaulters in the
past. The position is similar in respect of dues from Government and Govern-
ment Agencies. The current status of pre-1976 arrears and the action proposed
to liquidate them have been set out in paragraphs 5.12 to 5.14.
3.  THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The Program
3.01      TELECOM has drawn up a six-year (1977-82) telecommunications devel-
opment program which comprises the following main items:
(a)  completion of ongoing works, principally the project
financed by Bank Loan 1073-CO -- and the expansion of
the local automatic exchange equipment by a total of
5,000 lines;
(b)  installation of a satellite earth station at San Andres
Island;
(c)  extension of telex equipment at Cali, Barranquilla and
Medellin by a total of 3,300 lines;
(d)  installation of (i) a second satellite earth station with
153 circuits, and (ii) an international automatic telephone
exchanae with 530 circuits; and
(e)  the project proposed for Bank financing.
3.02      Preliminary plans for items (b) and (d) have been completed, and
construction is scheduled for 1978 and for 1979. Item (c) is in the planning
stage and is scheduled for construction during 1980. The estimated cost of
the six-year program is US$345.9 million equivalent, including a foreign
exchange expenditure of US$222.4 million equivalent. The program costs
year-by-year are summarized in Annexes 6 and 7.
The Project
3.03      The project proposed for Bank financing is a self-contained part
of the program and would be carried out between 1977 and 1982. It consists
of the following:
(a) the addition of 64,000 lines of local automatic equipment
of which 31,000 will be installed in 26 exchanges currently



operated by municipal entities to be purchased by TELECOM
raising their total capacity to about 52,000 lines, and
33,000 will be installed in six exchanges currently oper-
ated by municipal entities raising their capacity to about
64,000 lines;
(b)  the addition of 31,000 lines in local automatic exchanges
operated by TELECOM; and of about 6,000 lines in 150
manual exchanges to serve rural areas currently without
exchange facilities;
(c)  the connection of about 75,000 additional subscribers;
(d)  the installation of microwave radio equipment on nine
new routes;
(e)  the installation of about 8,800 additional long distance
circuits on existing and new routes, and of the corres-
ponding long distance exchange termination equipment;
(f)  the provision of long distance services to 2,200 communities;
and
(g)  the construction of buildings to house equipment.
The Inter-American Development Bank loan will essentially cover the costs of
extension of facilities at item (f) above, while Bank financing will cover
the corresponding additions to the network to handle traffic from these

3.05      The project costs reflect estimated December 1976 prices based on
TELECOM's experience with recent contracts related to ongoing works and those
being carried out under Loan 1073-CO with adjustments to bring them up to date.
The project estimates are reasonable. TELECOM is exempt from payment of cus-
toms duties on imported goods.
Contingencies
3.06      Price contingencies for project costs amount to 23% of total base
and physical costs. They result from the year-by-year estimated local cost
increases of: 1977-20%; 1978-18%; 1979-15%; and 1980 through 1982-12% annual-
ly; and the year-by-year estimated foreign cost increases of: 1977 through
1979-7.5% annually; and 1980-7%. The foreign cost increases are applied to
the contract date since contracts in this sector are on a fixed price basis.
The annual percentage cost increases assumed above are consistent with current
Bank Group Guidelines.
3.07      Provision of local and long distance exchange lines, telephones,
radio equipment terminals and multiplex channels to be procured and installed
under the project are based on detailed forecasts and detailed engineering.
In view of this, quantities are not expected to change significantly and
according to experience unexpected increases in some routes would usually be
compensated by decreases in other routes. In the case of cable networks, the
dispersion of these networks throughout the country permits flexibility and
adjustment to keep total costs within the estimates. No physical contingencies
are considered necessary for the above work items. Variations in quantities,
however, could occur in buildings and civil works; a physical contingency
amounting to 5% of local costs has been provided for this purpose.
Items for Bank Financing
3.08      Of the project's US$101.3 million foreign costs, the Bank loan would
finance US$60 million; the Inter-American Development Bank would provide US$16
million (plus an additional US$13 million in Colombian pesos for financing local
currency expenditures) for rural service equipment; and TELECOM's own resources
would provide the balance of US$25.3 million for (a) rural services equipment
(US$16.3 million); (b) long distance equipment (US$6.5 million); and (c) local
service equipment (US$2.5 million). The items to be financed by the Bank are
given below:
Local Exchanges                         US$ million
Subscribers' plant (new area)           17.8
Exchange equipment (existing area)       6.3
Subscribers' plant (existing area)       0.7   24.8
Long Distance Equipment
Microwave radio                          5.4

Switching                                4.9   24.5
Contingencies                                   10.7
Total                                       60.0

Procurement
3.09      All goods provided under the project for Bank financing would be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. Other imported goods outside of Bank financing would be
procured:  (a) through negotiations with existing equipment suppliers in
case of additions to existing equipment for reasons of standardization,
(b) through competitive bidding for other new equipment; and (c) through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDB Guidelines. Goods
such as cables, cable ducts, poles and fittings, all of which are manufactured
locally, would be procured through competitive bids from domestic suppliers
and financed with TELECOM's funds.
3.10      None of the Bank-financed project goods are currently manufactured
in Colombia; hence the matter of price preference for locally manufactured
goods does not arise.
Project Implementation
3.11      The proposed schedule for execution of the project is set out in
Annexes 8 and 9 and is realistic. TELECOM's staff would prepare engineering
designs and bid documents; would evaluate bids; and would draw up equipment
contracts. TELECOM would lay, joint and commission all distribution cables,
and would supervise construction of cable ducts by local contractors. All
installation and maintenance of telecommunications equipment would be carried
out or coordinated by TELECOM's technical staff, and, where new technologies
are involved, TELECOM would install equipment with the support of the manu-
facturer's specialist staff. TELECOM would carry out acceptance tests of
all installed equipment. TELECOM's management is experienced and is capable
of handling the above items of work satisfactorily.
Disbursement
3.12      The estimated loan disbursements are set out in Annex 10.  Disburse-
ment would be for the FOB costs of imported equipment and the foreign costs of
its installation. TELECOM is required by Government regulations to utilize
Colombian ships for transport of goods imported for its operations and to
insure those goods with Colombian insurance companies and, therefore, pays for
insurance and freight with local currency. However, any indemnity for such
insurance would be payable in a currency fully usable to replace or repair
such goods. Because the project as designed does not meet all of the esti-
mated demand for service, any unused balance of the loan should be used to
finance additional equipment similar to that already procured under the loan,
in agreement with the Bank.

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      This project represents a significant step forward in assisting
the Government of Colombia to rationalize and improve the efficiency of
operation of the telecommunications sector; to increase development of
services in its rural areas; and to provide employment opportunities in
smaller urban centers.
Sector Reorganization
4.02      An important aspect of this project is to facilitate the institu-
tional consolidation of the sector, thereby moving toward the elimination
of the major constraints to provision and operation of an efficient nation-
wide telephone system. The institutional consolidation of the fragmented
local entities in the sector is essential if efficient planning, financing,
and project implementation are to be achieved. Currently, there is no ef-
fective national plan for total telecommunications development, no emphasis
on standardization of procedures and equipment, and many of the potential
economies inherent in international bidding and bulk purchasing are not
realized. This proposed project which reinforces and speeds up the process
of consolidation of local telephone entities through TELECOM is a major step
toward the attainment of the desired sector objectives.
Rural and Urban Development
4.03      Government considers the extension of telephone services to all
rural communities essential in the provision of health and agricultural
extension services, efficient regional transport, and proper marketing of
rural agricultural output. The project will expand service into 2,200
smaller hitherto unserved rural communities, and by installing 8,800 long
distance circuits, it will facilitate better rural-to-urban an inter-urban
communications which complement national priority programs in agricultural
development, rural and regional transport improvement, and the integration
of rural dwellers into modern sectors of the economy.
Urban Efficiency
4.04      Telephones in the smaller urban areas in Colombia tend to be used
as intermediate inputs in the production of goods and services. This proj-
ect, by expanding exchange capacity and upgrading the quality of telephone
service in selected small urban centers will (a) help slow the growth of
telephone waiting lists, (b) reduce wastage of time caused by having to make
repeated call attempts, and (c) improve urban transport and delivery service.
Furthermore, to the extent a more efficient and wider access to telephone
service for Government and business results in the substitution of telephone
communication for face-to-face communication, the growth in transport and
energy costs will be slowed, as well as traffic congestion and resulting
air pollution.

Demand Forecast
4.05      Forecasts of local telephone demand were prepared for all TELECOM
exchanges in early 1976 in collaboration with TELECONSULT of USA, a tele-
communications consulting firm retained by TELECOM under Bank Loan 740-CO.
These demand forecasts were utilized in the preparation of TELECOM's 1977-82
development program. On this basis TELECOM forecasts a total additional
exchange equipment requirement of about 30,990 lines and an average overall
growth rate of 10% which is considered reasonable.
4.06      The capacities of practically all the lo5cal telephone exchanges
which are planned to be acquired by TELECOM by purchase, or by association
through majority equity participation, have not been increased during the
past five years; quality of service has deteriorated, and waiting lists have
not been maintained. TELECOM has assumed a conservative annual growth rate
of from 8 to 12% for each of these exchanges based on experience in similar
population and economic activity areas and has decided to extend all 32 ex-
changes on this basis. Any variations resulting from this assumption will
be accommodated in the subsequent phase of the exchanges' development.
4.07      With regard to long distance services, TELECOM, with the assistance
of its consultants, has made a study of circuit requirements (route-by-route)
for the whole country to remove existing congestion and to provide for the
additional traffic expected as a result of additional utilization by existing
and new subscribers. In accordance with the above, the project aims at pro-
viding an additional 8,800 long distance circuits which will reduce the
likelihood that major bottlenecks will form during the 1977-82 development
program period.
Least-Cost Solution
4.08      The least-cost solution to the provision of telecommunications
depends on (a) having made the correct technological and economic decisions
initially when the networks were planned, and (b) following the optimum
path in the design, dimensioning and timing of the many installations which
comprise the continuous development process. Despite the constraints on
total telecommunications development planning as set out in paragraph 4.02,
certain fundamental decisions establishing the national numbering, switching
and transmission plans, the use of common control switching equipment and
the use of microwave and other radio systems have been made. These decisions,
verified and updated by the consultants in early 1976, are designed to pro-
vide least-cost additions over the long term.
Return on Investment
4.09      The internal rate of return on the project defined as the discounted
rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the proj-
ect with capital and operating cost is 19% (Annex 11). This rate of return
reflects a foreign exchange shadow price of 120%. Sensitivity analysis shows



- 13 -
that under the most unfavorable combination of main parameters (increase of
10% each in capital and operating costs; 10% decrease in revenue; and two-year
delay in project completion) the rate of return would not be less than 11%.
4.10      The above calculation of the internal rate of return is a signifi-
cant underestimate of total project benefits since it is based only on the
measurable willingness of subscribers to pay for telecommunications services.
As such, it does not include estimates of the consumer surplus which callers
receive, or estimates of benefits received by non-callers; benefits incurred
by receivers of calls, by all other subscribers when additional subscribers
pay to join the system, and by all those who benefit indirectly through the
better administration of rural development, health, transport, and agriculture
programs, increased urban and rural business and Government efficiency.
4.11      The calculated rate of return is also an underestimate of total
project benefits because, while the costs included in calculating the 19%
internal rate of return are those for extending the network and providing
facilities in the newly served rural areas now, the full benefits are not
included because the available capacity of various components of equipment
will only be fully utilized when additional marginal investment is made in
the future. Thus, benefits will be incurred in future projects which will
be primarily attributable to costs incurred in this project.
5. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
5.01      TELECOM was established in 1947 as a government-owned autonomous
entity and is managed by a Board of Directors appointed by the President of
the Republic with the Minister of Communications as the ex-officio Chairman
of the Board. An organization chart is shown in Annex 12. Day-to-day man-
agement of the entity is the responsibility of TELECOM's President, also
appointed by the President of the Republic. TELECOM's President is assisted
by five vice presidents, each one in charge of technical (engineering), opera-
tions, integration, industrial relations, and finance. Additionally, the
legal adviser, organizational development chief, public relations adviser and
secretary general -- who is responsible for board matters, project coordina-
tion and general services -- report directly to the president.
5.02      TELECOM retained technical and financial consultants under Loan
740-CO to develop the optimum management organization which will be required
to administer its rapidly growing operations. The recommendations of the
consultant are being implemented. TELECOM has also, with the Bank's encour-
agement, decentralized maintenance, planning and operational work to the seven
regional managers. However, with the completion of the proposed project,
local exchange operations will have grown significantly to about 190,000
lines, largely administered by the several regions. Under these conditions,
responsible and efficient administration of the system as a whole becomes



- 14 -
increasingly dependent on effective reporting by the regions and coordination
and timely control by headquarters. Timely regional management reporting
to cover all areas of importance for proper coordination and control should
be designed and instituted. TELECOM has initiated a reporting system in one
region as a pilot installation in consultation with the Bank. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that TELECOM would establish a suitable reporting
system in all regions by January 1, 1979.
5.03      TELECOM has decided to use its own funds to continue the employment
of the financial consultants obtained under Loan 740-CO through the year 1977.
TELECOM intends to utilize their services to develop a completely integrated
financial system which would more fully utilize computer applications and
improve TELECOM's ability to monitor operating performance.
5.04      TELECOM's senior engineering and financial staff are well qualified
and experienced and are capable of managing the present operations as well as
those proposed for the project period. Junior management have been trained
by consultants engaged under Loan 740-CO and are competent to meet the chal-
lenges of the expanding operations.
Management of Acquired Systems
5.05      In the case of the entities which are purchased by TELECOM, TELE-
COM's managers in regions within which the entities are located will take
over responsibility for the operations. TELECOM would supplement the entity's
existing staff by its own experienced staff. In the case of entities with
which TELECOM would be associated, TELECOM would become the majority share-
holder and have appropriate representation on each Board of Directors. TELECOM
would second suitable experienced technical, planning and financial personnel
to improve the management, the operations of the entity, and make possible
profitable operation.
Staff and Training
5.06      As of December 31, 1976, TELECOM had a total of about 13,400 staff,
of which about 9,300 were being used in telephone operations and about 4,100
in telegraph and telex operations. The existing staff level is considered
reasonable considering that it is largely related to long distance facilities
and local facilities in rural areas. TELECOM proposes to add about 3,100
staff to operate the additional long distance, rural facilities, and about
75,000 additional subscriber connections planned to be provided during the
period 1977-82. The staff level at the project's completion date is also
considered reasonable. Annex 13 gives details of the number of employees in
each department for the years 1976-82 as well as staff pay scales and ser-
vice conditions. The pay scales are generally commensurate with the duties,
and the salaries are comparable with, or, in some cases, slightly higher
than those paid by other telecommunications organizations for similar duties
and qualifications. Turnover of staff is reported to be negligible.



- 15 -
5.07      TELECOM has no difficulty recruiting qualified professional engineer-
ing and managerial staff from graduates of local institutes and universities.
It is similarly able to recruit, without any difficulty, technicians and
other operating and administrative staff. During the project period, TELECOM
would recruit a total of about 4,200 staff, of which 1,200 would be technical
and financial staff, about 2,000 operational and administrative staff, and
about 1,000 telegraph operating staff.
5.08      Graduate engineers are generally given on-the-job training, and, in
some instances, are sent abroad for specialized training under arrangements
made with suppliers and under bilateral government-level technical assistance
programs. TELECOM operates a training institute at Bogota -- Technical
Institute of Electronics and Communications (ITEC) and regional training
centers in Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cali, Ibague, Manizales and Medellin.
ITEC provides basic and refresher training for up to 2,000 technicians and
other operational and administrative staff. The regional training centers
provide concurrently some operational courses for up to 1,000 personnel.
TELECOM's training facilities are adequate for meeting its staff needs during
the project period.
Accounting and Audit
5.09      TELECOMl's accounting system has steadily improved with Bank assistance
under the previous loans and is now at a generally satisfactory level. Further
improvements are planned utilizing the services of consultants to introduce a
fully integrated financial system to provide additional management information
through additional use of computers. The only significant accounting problem
which is being experienced is the failure of TELECOM to be able to produce
annual financial statements for submission to the Bank within four months of
the end of the fiscal year. This failure has been attributed to TELECOM's in-
ability to obtain source data from remote field locations. The consultants,
as part of the integrated system work, will review data flow and correct this
problem. Until the consultants have completed their work, TELECOM believes
they will have difficulty complying with the four-month requirement but never-
theless believe the schedule remains a worthwhile goal which should be achiev-
able after 1977.
5.10      The existing external audit arrangements are satisfactory and meet
the requirements of loans 740-CO and 1073-CO. During negotiations, agreement
was reached that the Bank would repeat the existing covenant for the appoint-
ment of external auditors and for the submission of financial statements in
the new loan agreement.
Billing and Collection
5.11      TELECOM's billing and collection arrangements depend on whether the
subscribers using TELECOM's facilities are connected to exchange systems
operated by TELECOM or by others. TELECOM bills the subscriber and makes
collection where it operates the.exchange. Similarly, TELECOM bills the
subscribers directly for all telex and telegraph services. In respect of



- 16 -
subscribers not connected to TELECOM-operated exchanges, TELECOM normally
bills the local telecommunications enterprises for all long distance traffic
originated in these exchanges providing supporting data to enable the local
enterprise to bill the individual subscribers. Collections for these ser-
vices are the responsibility of the local enterprise. However, in partial
modification of the above, TELECOM bills and collects separately for
operator-handled long distance traffic in Bogota and Calarca.
5.12      TELECOM has faced continuing problems with accounts receivable,
which as of August 31, 1976, amounted to a total of Col$ 700.5 million
(excluding those from international connecting companies) and made up of
the following: (a) national government - Col$ 97.7 million; (b) intercon-
necting local exchange operating entities - Col$ 357.9 million; (c) private
customers - Col$ 82.7 million; and (d) all other - Col$ 162.2 million.
5.13      TELECOM has made some improvements in its collection performance
during 1976. Current accounts of Government and local connecting companies
are being collected on a timely basis but the collection of old balances
continues to be a problem. Of these old balances:
(a) the account of Bogota (ETB), which amounted to Col$ 108.4
million at August 31, 1976, is substantially the result of
previous erroneous billing and is being corrected to give
ETB full credit for its share of international billings.
TELECOM's deficiencies in billing resulted from an inter-
national billing problem (see para. 5.14);
(b) the account of Cali (EMCALI), Col$ 81.2 million at August 31,
1976, has been converted to promissory notes which in turn
have not been paid in accordance with their amortization
schedules. TELECOM has failed to obtain settlement of this
large debt.
(c) the account of Barranquilla (Col$ 66.7 million) is also
being converted to a promissory note supported by a
stronger agreement relating to the sharing of long
distance revenues.
The remainder of the old balances in local connecting company accounts,
although of substantially lesser individual value, will be very difficult to
collect as the funds required are not available. These balances should, how-
ever, be applied against the purchase price of these entities when they are
eventually integrated into TELECOM.
5.14      The International Connecting Company accounts receivable amounted
to Col$ 142.8 million as of December 31, 1975, due principally to the failure
of TELECOM to provide required settlement data. During 1976 TELECOM has
strengthened the organization responsible for international toll settlement
and had collected Col$ 60 million of the balances by September 30, 1976.
TELECOM must continue to emphasize the importance of this function so that
settlements are continuously made with all international connecting companies
on a current basis.



- 17 -
5.15      The financing plan (see para. 6.06) is based on the assumption of
continued improvement in TELECOM's collection performance reducing accounts
receivable balances of 33% of annual billings in 1976 to 16% in 1982. These
improved collections are necessary if TELECOM's cash position is to be main-
tained during the project period. Therefore, during negotiations TELECOM
agreed to furnish the Government and the Bank by October 31, 1977, a draft
plan for obtaining prompt payment of all outstanding debts and by February
28, 1978, obtain the agreement of the Government and the Bank on the final
plan for immediate implementation.
Tariffs
5.16      TELECOM's principal tariffs are given in Annex 14 and comprise of
monthly telephone rentals of about US$1 for business subscribers and US$0.75
for residential subscribers with a call charge of USg0.5 per three minutes
for all subscribers. Subscribers also pay a one-time installation charge of
about US$10.50; a guarantee deposit of about US$22; and a noninterest-bearing
deposit which varies from about US$19 to US$33 equivalent per line. The two
deposits are returned to the subscriber, or adjusted against pending accounts,
if service is discontinued.
5.17      The level of TELECOM's tariff has been satisfactory in the past.  It
has produced rates of return which have exceeded the 11% required by previous
Bank loans and has provided adequate funds to support TELECOM's development
program. The existing level of tariffs will not, however, be adequate during.
the project period and TELECOM has agreed to make annual revisions and has
suggested the following telephone tariff revision program:
1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982

TELECOM has given effect to a tariff increase from March 1977.  This approach
to tariff revision proposing progressive increases of the local call charges
can be justified as local charges are presently very low. However, during the
project period, TELECOM should review their tariff philosophy to make sure
that a reasonably balanced tariff structure continues to exist.

5.18      TELECOM tariffs, although comparable with those of other telephone
entities in Colombia, are low by international standards. Even after imple-
menting the full tariff revision program suggested in paragraph 5.17,
TELECOM's tariffs will not be excessive when compared with other developing
countries throughout the world.
5.19      TELECOM has executed a contract with each local telephone entity
for sharing of long distance call revenues. The percentage share of revenues
for each outgoing call accruing to the local connecting entities varies from
22.5% to 33% for manual and semi-automatic service (decreasing with increasing
size of the exchange area) and from 24.5% to 35% for automatic service. For
international traffic, these percentages apply to Colombia's net share of such
revenues.
5.20      Local and long distance national tariffs are set by TELECOM's Board
of Directors, and approved by the National Tariff Board comprising representa-
tives of the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Department. This
arrangement has worked very effectively in the past and has provided Govern-
ment with an adequate control over the level of telecommunications tariffs
while not delaying justified increases in TELECOM's tariff.
Insurance
5.21      TELECOM carries fire and related perils insurance coverage for the
properties which house technical installations valued at Col$ 5 million
(US150,000) or more and for stores inventories. In addition, TELECOM carries
business interruption (loss of profits) coverage for its earth satellite
ground station. These insurance practices are acceptable.
6.  FINANCES
Background
6.01      TELECOM's past operating results have been satisfactory and its
financial position is reasonably sound. In 1974 and 1975 it was able to
generate 67% of its fund requirement, which is excellent. In the future
this pattern of heavy internal generation is expected to continue but will
be associated with a greater amount of debt in order to make necessary funds
available to support the expanded development program.
Present Financial Position
6.02      Balance sheets for 1974-75 are shown in Annex 15.  TELECOM's present
financial position at December 31, 1975 was satisfactory with a debt-equity
ratio of 60/40 and a current ratio of 2.2. TELECOM, however, does have a
large liability for pensions and severance pay which will eventually have to
be met. A summary of this balance sheet follows:

Past Financial Performance
6.03      Financial statements for the 1974-76 period are shown in Annexes 15,
16 and 17. The results of the period are summarized as follows:
1974      1975       1976*

and severance liability)               64/36      60/40      53/47

Debt service coverage                      2.0        2.7       3.6
* Provisional
6.04      Loan 1073-CO requires TELECOM to achieve an annual rate of return
of at least 11% on the value of net fixed assets in service calculated on the
current peso equivalent of the dollar value of the assets. Rates of return of
11.6% and 13.6% were recorded in 1974 and 1975, respectively, and based on
provisional results a return of 18.4% is anticipated for the year 1976.
TELECOM's revenues increased 37% in 1975, partially due to a tariff increase



- 20 -
effective July 23, 1975, more than offsetting an operating expense increase of
31%. Revenues increased 34% in 1976 again partially due to the 1975 tariff
increase, while operating expenses increased 28%. The financial performance
is considered to be satisfactory.
6.05      TELECOM's debt service coverage has also been acceptable at 2.0
times in 1974, 2.7 times in 1975 and an estimated 3.6 times in 1976.

6.07      TELECOM would provide from internal cash generation 62% of the
required funds including part of the foreign exchange requirements, and the
balance of 38% would be obtained through debt financing.
6.08      Planned borrowings consist of the proposed US$60 million Bank loan
(assumed to be for a 17-year term including a three and one-half year grace
period), US$8 million to be drawn down under previous Bank Loans 740-CO and
1073-CO, a US$29 million IDB loan for rural telephone development, US$2 mil-
lion of national loans primarily relating to the purchase of other telecommu-
nications entities and US$66 million of international bank loans or suppliers'
credits. The Bank project is self-contained and supported by necessary addi-
tional foreign exchange financing. TELECOM will have no difficulty generating
the required local funds to insure successful completion of the project works.
Financing for the remainder of the program, while not fully assured, is ex-
pected to become available. US$20 million has presently been approved by the
Finance Ministry for the purchase of switching centers, antennas and tele-
printers, leaving US$46 million to be obtained during the project period. If
the necessary funds cannot be obtained, the program would have to be reduced.
This reduction would not affect TELECOM's earning ability during the project
period as it relates to plant which will be put into service after the project
period.
6.09      TELECOM makes an annual provision for its severance pay liability
and makes payment from its funds directly to employees who are terminating
their services with TELECOM. It originally was planned, as of January 1,
1972, to replace this practice by a payment to the Fondo Nacional de Ahorro
(FNA), who would then take the responsibility for making these severance
payments. However, TELECOM has been allowed by Government and FNA to con-
tinue the existing practice and plans to follow this course throughout the
project period and has requested the extension of the arrangement with FNA.
The financing plan assumes the retention of these funds by TELECOM and the
use of these funds to finance the 1977-82 development program. This practice,
although it has helped TELECOM obtain financing for its development programs
and forms an essential part of the financing for the present overall program,
should not continue indefinitely and future development plans should not rely
on use of these sources of funds. However, since part of these funds are
utilized to provide employee housing at a low interest rate, the immediate
discontinuation of the practice was not considered advisable as it would
increase the financing cost to the employees and could lead to labor problems.
6.10      TELECOM has a non-contributory pension scheme for its employees.
In accordance with the requirements of Loans 740-CO and 1073-CO, TELECOM
has carried out an actuarial evaluation of the requirements for its pension
contribution and has brought into its accounts the liabilities as evaluated.
The financing plan assumes a continuation of this arrangement. However,
during negotiations, TELECOM and Government: (1) confirmed that the present
arrangements will continue during the project construction period; and
(2) agreed to review before end-1978 the adequacy of this arrangement for
ensuring security of future pension payments to TELECOM's employees, prepare a
plan needed to implement the decision, and inform the Bank of the decision.



- 22 -
6.11      TELECOM's capital investment program is large and a limitation is
necessary on new investments outside the proposed program. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that TELECOM would obtain Bank agreement before
committing itself during the project period to any capital expenditure not
required for the program, if the aggregate of such capital expenditure made or
to be made in any one fiscal year should exceed an amount equivalent to US$1.0
million, or an amount equivalent to 10% of the aggregate amount of all its
capital expenditures made during the previous fiscal year, whichever amount is
greater.
6.12      During the project period funds made available by internal generation
through operations are estimated to amount to at least 2.1 times debt service
requirements. This performance is acceptable and reflects a satisfactory
financing plan. However, during negotiations agreement was reached to continue
the covenant in the previous Loan Agreement requiring Bank agreement before
contracting new debt unless the net revenues of TELECOM in the preceding
12 months cover the maximum debt service at least 1.5 times. Agreement was
also obtained that TELECOM will not acquire any short-term debt in excess
of US$500,000 equivalent without promptly informing the Bank.
Future Operating Results
6.13      The forecast Income Statement and Financial Position Statement for
the project period (1977-82) are given in Annexes 15 and 16. A summary of
the expected financial results follows:
1977    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982
Total revenues        (Col$  )    3,738   4,969   6,349   8,126  10,167  12,570

6.14      Revenue and operating expenses have been projected in accordance
with past experience and projected increases in telephone connections and
other facilities. Operating expenses include an inflation factor of 10%.
Details of the projection methods are given in Annexes 18 and 19.
6.15      Based on the forecast the rates of return on net fixed assets will
vary from 18.5% in 1977 to 13.0% in 1982. The operating ratio during the
period will be between 79 and 83. Both of these results would be satis-
factory.



- 23 -
6.16      TELECOM's debt-equity ratio will increase from 53/47 at December
31, 1976 to 70/30 in 1980 but will return to 64/36 by the end of the project
in 1982. This high debt-equity ratio is the result of TELECOM's required
accounting practices which stipulate that the value of fixed assets be
maintained at original cost and long-term debt at the parity of the Colombian
peso. The Bank has required that, for the computation of the rate of return
for loan purposes, the assets be revalued. To meet this requirement, TELECOM
maintains memo records reflecting this revaluation and, hence, the measurement
of the adequacy of earnings is not affected by TELECOM's accounting practices.
There is, however, an understatement of equity resulting in a debt-equity
ratio higher than would exist if the fixed assets had been suitably revalued
in TELECOM's accounts.
6.17      TELECOM correctly plans to turn to tariff revision to obtain a
substantial portion of this fund requirement during the project period. The
tariff revision program suggested by TELECOM (see para. 5.17) will produce
the required funds without being unduly burdensome to the subscriber and the
economy, but will temporarily produce rates of return substantially above
the 11% required in Loan 1073-CO. Therefore, during negotiations, agreement
was obtained that TELECOM will maintain at least a 16% rate of return cal-
culated on the peso equivalent of the US dollar value of net plant in service
for the years 1977-80 and will review its rate of return requirements with
the Bank in 1980. However, in no case will the rate of return after 1980 be
less than 11%.
Acquisition of Other Entities
6.18      TELECOM has initiated the process of acquiring on a full ownership
basis 26 of the operating entities, which are shown in Annex 2. The discus-
sions for the takeover are in an advanced stage and will be completed pro-
gressively before the end of 1980. TELECOM will negotiate and arrive at the
amounts payable based on the book value of the assets and liabilities. During
negotiations, TELECOM provided assurances that these acquisitions will be
completed before the end of 1980 and will consult with the Bank on the purchase
contracts' terms before finalizing and signing the contracts.
6.19      During the project period, TELECOM intends to progressively acquire
equity interests in six local service telephone companies in accordance with
Colombia's program for integration of the sector. TELECOM proposes to use
funds obtained from the proposed Bank loan to provide necessary equipment to
extend and improve the facilities of these companies. In exchange for this
equipment they will obtain the majority equity interest in the new companies
formed from the assets of the old companies and the new equipment additions
provided by TELECOM. Each new company will have the authority to revise
its tariffs as required subject to the approval of the National Tariff Board.
TELECOM has the right to appoint the majority of the members of the Boards
of Directors and will be able to influence operations. During negotiations it
was agreed that TELECOM would present draft agreements setting out the terms
of association with each of the s,ix operating entities to serve as a basis for



- 24 -
investing in these companies. The draft agreements will include satisfactory
arrangements for TELECOM in matters relating to, inter alia, capitalization,
organization, management, financing, accounting, auditing and tariff policy
for each of the six new companies.
6.20      Indicators which will help monitor TELECOM's performance are given
in Annex 20.
7. AGIEEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) TELECOM would take up economic studies as part of its normal
planning and would furnish to the Bank not later than July
1978, a plan for undertaking the studies (para. 2.15);
(b) the system of reporting operational information is extended
to all regions by January 1, 1979 (para. 5.02);
(c) TELECOM would (i) have its accounts and financial statements
(balance sheets, statements of income and expenses and
related statements including cash flow statement) for each
fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank, and (ii) furnish to the Bank as soon as possible,
but in any case, not later than four months after the end
of each such year, (A) certified copies of its financial
statements for such year, and (B) the report of the auditors
(para. 5.09);
(d) TELECOM will, by October 31, 1977, furnish a draft plan to
Government and the Bank for obtaining prompt payment of
outstanding debts and by February 28, 1978 agree on a final
plan for immediate implementation (para. 5.15);
(e) Government and TELECOM would (i) confirm that the present
arrangements for pension contribution will continue during
the project period, and (ii) by end-1978 agreed to review the
adequacy of the present practices and inform the Bank of the
results of the review (para. 6.10);
(f) TELECOM would obtain Bank agreement before committing itself
during the project period to any capital expenditure exceeding
certain limits not required for the program (para. 6.11);



- 25 -
(g) Bank approval would be obtained before TELECOM incurs long-
term debt unless its maximum debt service in any future year
is covered 1.5 times by the net revenues of the preceding
fiscal year or of a later 12-month period prior to the
incurrence of the debt (para. 6.12);
(h) TELECOM will not acquire short-term debt in excess of
US$500,000 equivalent without promptly informing the Bank
(para. 6.12);
(i) TELECOM would maintain adequate tariff levels to enable the
maintenance of at least a 16% rate of return calculated on
the peso equivalent of the US dollar value of net plant in
service for the years 1977-80 and will review its rate of
return requirements in 1980, subject to it not being less
than 11% (para. 6.17);
(j) TELECOM would acquire about 26 local entities before end-1980,
and will consult with the Bank on purchase contract and terms
before finalization (para. 6.18); and
(k) TELECOM would present draft agreements setting out association
terms satisfactory to the Bank which would include capitaliza-
tion, organization, management, financing, accounting, auditing
and tariff policies, with each of the six local entities (para.
6.19).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$60 million for a term of 17 years including a grace period of three
and one-half years.

Return on Investment
Benefit Period
1.        The period of benefits of the project extends from 1977, when
the first expenditure is scheduled, to 2002 when, on average, the plant
provided under the project will have completed its useful life in accord-
ance with the present composite depreciable life of 22 years.
Capital Expenditures
2.        The estimated project capital expenditures have been adjusted
to reflect a 120% shadow price for foreign exchange expenditures.
Operations
3.        Revenues and operating costs have been assigned to the project
primarily based on additional DEL's provided under the project. Long
distance revenue has been allocated based on percentages where it is
associated with other local telecommunication entities.
4.        The capital expenditures stream has been discounted based on
the International Price Index which anticipates inflation rates of 8%
for 1978, 71% for 1979 and 7% for all subsequent years. Operating costs
and revenues streams have been discounted utilizing these inflation rates
only thmugh 1982 when the last tariff increase during the project period
is expected. Beyond 1982 these streams reflect only additional expenses
and revenues associated with the project at constant prices for the
remainder of the benefit period.
Net Benefits
