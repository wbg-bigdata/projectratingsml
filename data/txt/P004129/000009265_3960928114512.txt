MEMORANDUM ANID RECOMMENDATION OF THE !'RESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.
FOR A UNIVERSITIES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Korea for US$45.0 million squivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years including 5 years of grace at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a
universities science and technology research project.
2.       Background.  Underlying the restructuring of Korean industry towards
technology-intensive production over the past two decades has been a strong
commitment to investment in research and development (R&D). This restructur-
ing has also moved Korea from a stage characterized by the local assimilation
and improvement of imported technology to one which is emphasizing increas-
ingly the pursuit of indigenous technological innovation. During the period
of technology assimilation, Korea concentrated on mastering production tech-
nologies and the need for technological innovation was modest. But as Korea
continues its industrial development towards technologically sophisticated,
higher value-added production this trend must be accompanied by a strong com-
mitment to create the capacity for technological innovation and to support the
programs in basic research which underlie it.
3.       Under the Government's research policy, the universities have prime
responsibility for basic research programs while the public sector research
institutes and industry focus ca applied and developmental research. In the
past, the universities have played an important, if subsidiary, role in the
growth of R&D activities. While the universities have a preponderance of
graduate R&D personnel, limited research funds in the past kept per capita
research spending at only about one-quarter that of industry and the research
institutes.  Financial constraints have also led to shortages of research
equipment which have hampered both the quantity and quality of research. The
result of resource constraints in the universities, compared with the more
generous endowments in industry and in the research institutes, has been a
bias in favor of applied rather than basic research.  This has clearly had
short-term benefits for industry, especially in the export sectors and has led
to a high local level of competence in basic production technologies. How-
ever, the pursuit of technological innovation must be accompanied by an
enhanced role for the universities in basic research. This is already
evident. In recent years, greatly increased public and private support fo.
the universities has led to a seven-fold increase in research expenditures iii
1981-87, with expenditure per researcher more than tripling in the same
period. The Bank played an important role in this improvement under the
second education sector loan (2427-KO) which assisted in strengthening
research and graduate program in science and technology in the universities.

4.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been assisting
technology development in Korea during the last decade focussing mainly on
financinig R&D projects through financial intermediaries and the development of
technical and scientific education. More recently the Bank has started to
assist R&D activities in the universities under Loan 2427-KO and in the
national research institutes under the Second Technology Advancement Project
(Loan 3037-KO).  The proposed project continues this assistance by
strengthening the capacity of the universities to undertake basic research in
science and technology. The project is being designed within a sound policy
environment, which has developed with considerable assistance from the Bank's
two education sector loans (1800-KO and 2427-KO) which addressed policy issues
in research and in education for science and technology. The project would
continue the assistance to graduate programs and research in science and
Lechnology started under Loan 2427-KO and the assistance to strengthening
science education also included in that loan.
5.       Project Objectives.  The overall objective of the project is to
assist selected universities in broadening and deepening their basic research
programs in priority tields in science and technology in order to strengthen
their capacity to support technological innovation. The project would also
assist in strengthening research capacity in science education in order to
improve the quality of science teacher training which in turn would strengthen
.l;e base of science education in the secondary schools.
u.       Project Description.  The proposed project would finance specialized
equipment which would be concentrated in three areas: (a) equipment for
graduate schools to assist in strengthening the research capacity of
individual departments of science and engineering; (b) equipment for use in
joint research projects involving more than one university to increase the
scope for research cooperation among institutions; and (c) equipment for
departments of science education to strengthen research in areas of pedagogy
and in particular science subjects. The Government would finance
complementary inputs related to making the equipment operational and
maintaining it thereafter, namely transportation and installation costs, O&M
and consumables. Equipment lists would be formulated as part of research
projects which would be proposed by participating institutions and selected
according to specific criteria. Institutions would also be selected to
participate in the project according to objective criteria. Participation
would be on the basis of about 80X, public universities and 20X, private.
Loan ftnds for the private universities would be allocated on the basis of
subloans with terms the same as those for the Bank loan except that the
Government would subsidize half the Bank's interest rate. This subsidy is
justified on the basis of the benefits gained from improving basic research
programs which would accrue to society in general. The above terms were
applied successfully under Loan 2427-KO. Loan funds for the public
universities would be passed on as budget transfers by MOE. The loan would
finance about 97X of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project or 75%
of total project costs.
7.       Overall responsibility for project implementation would lie with the
Ministry of Education with its Education Facilities Bureau (EFB) handling the
detailed activities. A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) consisting of



senior MOE officials would provide policy advice and coordination and also
play a major role in selecting project institutions and in the review of
research proposals. Equipment procurement would be undertaken by the Office
of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK) in conjunction with MOE and the project
inistitutions. It is estimated that about 85Z of equipment to be financed
under the project would be procured under ICB. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8205-KO dated April 23, 1990 is
being distributed separately.
8.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that:  (a) the Korea
Research Foundation would be utilized for evaluating the results of research
projects included under the project; and (b) project institutions and research
projects would be selected and loan proceeds allocated between institutions
according to criteria and guidelines acceptable to the Banl.
9.       Benefits.  The project would strengthen the capacity of the
universities to support technological innovation in prior -y fields by
enhancing their ability to undertake basic research. This in turn would
reduce Korea's dependence on imported technology and in the longer run
strengthen its ability to maintain the pace of industrial development and
remain competitive in export markets. The project would also assist in
raising the quality of science teacher education, which in turn would
strengthen the base of science education in the secondary schools.
10.      Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the proposed
project.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
