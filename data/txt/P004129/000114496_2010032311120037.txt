deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of
this Schedule.
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule.
3.   After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or
deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized
Allocation.  On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and
deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as the
Borrower shall have requested.
            (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account,
                        the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank
                        requests for deposits  into  the  Special
Page  9
                        Account at  such intervals as the Bank
                        shall specify.
            (ii)        Prior to or at the time of each such
                        request, the Borrower shall furnish to the
                        Bank the documents and other evidence
                        required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
                        Schedule for the payment or payments  in
                        respect of which replenishment is
                        requested. On the basis of each such
                        request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                        Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
                        and deposit into the Special Account such
                        amount as the Borrower shall have requested
                        and as shall have been shown by said
                        documents and other evidence to have been
                        made out of the Special Account for
                        eligible expenditures. All such deposits
                        shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
                        Loan Account under the respective eligible
                        Category, and in the respective equivalent
                        amounts, as shall have been justified by
                        said documents and other evidence.
4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account,
the Borrower shall,  at such time as the Bank shall reasonably
request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence
showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3  of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Category for the Project, less the amount of any
outstanding special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Category
for the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be
made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the  Special Account:  (i) was made for a expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule;  or  (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to
the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:
(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures,  the Borrower
Page  10
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
      (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
