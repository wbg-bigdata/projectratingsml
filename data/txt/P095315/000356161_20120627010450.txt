During the past three decades, China has undergone rapid urbanization, as the urban
population soared from 172.5 million to 621.9 million and its share in total population
(the urbanization rate) rose from 18% in 1978 to 47% in 2009. Urbanization has
been driven mainly by migration from rural to urban areas, and was accompanied
by remarkably fast economic growth. Urbanization has produced definite benefits
for China’s population: GDP per capita is higher in provinces that have a higher
urbanization rate. Yet it has also led to increasing inequality, which has become a
major social problem. China’s Gini coefficient steadily climbed from 0.30 in 1978
and it is now approaching 0.50 – the level of “high? income inequality. Disparity in
real urban-rural incomes per capita increased over the past three decades from 1.53
in 1985 to 2.67 in 2009. While nationally urban-rural income inequality has been
increasing over time, the income inequality is smaller in provinces with a higher
urbanization rate and thus a higher GDP per capita. This implies that the rural
population is better off in relation to the urban population in regions that are richer
and more urbanized: economic development and urbanization benefit both the
urban and the rural population in the same province.

China’s urban population resides primarily in city districts (shiqu) and town districts
(zhenqu), which constitute the urban core of much larger administrative-territorial
units called cities (shi) and respectively towns (zhen). Investments and public
resources have been mostly directed to the highly urbanized big cities, leaving
the less urbanized towns with much less funds for development: the annual fiscal
expenditure per capita in 2006 was 4,000 yuan in cities and just 500 yuan in towns.
Public services and utilities in towns accordingly lag behind those in cities (this
is particularly noticeable for gas supply and wastewater treatment facilities). The
development of infrastructure for basic urban services in towns has been listed as
a critical target in the country’s 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015). Town districts – the
urbanized core of towns – have been identified as the next frontier for extending
urban infrastructure services.

Executive Summary




       The basic objective of this study is to examine the development and features of town
       districts (zhenqu) using statistical data from three official sources: the Urban-Rural
       Construction Yearbook (2009, 2010), China Township Statistics (2008, 2009, 2010), and
       China Statistical Yearbook (2010). Unfortunately the statistical data for town districts
       are at best fragmentary and a more complete picture is constructed by looking at
       town districts in the broader context of the entire urban system, which includes
       towns (zhen) in the wide sense of the term as well as cities (shi) with their urbanized
       city districts (shiqu). For purposes of this study, towns are subdivided into county
       towns – the seat of county government and regular (non-county) towns. Among
       regular towns there is a subset of “separate? towns, i.e., towns that are not connected
       to the municipal and public utilities of either county towns or cities. In general, county
       towns are observed to be larger, wealthier, and more developed than regular or
       separate towns.

       Of China’s 621 million urban residents, 60% reside in urban cores of 654 cities (including
       provincial-level municipalities, prefecture-level municipalities, and county-level cities)
       and the remaining 40% are in 19,322 town districts. There is accordingly a huge size
       disparity between cities and towns: the average population in a city district is 520,000
       compared with 10,000 in a town district. Towns have a much smaller scale than cities
       also by various economic measures. The average number of industrial enterprises in
       towns is roughly one-quarter of the number in prefecture-level municipalities (146 and
       526, respectively) and they employ less than one-tenth of the enterprise labor force
       in cities (23 employees per enterprise in towns compared with 282 in cities). Small
       population and small size of enterprises make it difficult for towns to absorb large
       numbers of migrant labor without fiscal support. On the other hand, the smaller scale
       of towns highlights their potential for future growth and development.

       The number of towns increased rapidly from about 2,000 in the late 1970s to 20,000
       in 1999. After that the numerical growth has slowed down and some consolidation
       set in, so that today there are 19,322 towns in China. The slowdown in the growth
       of the number of towns did not arrest the development of town urban cores: the
       growth of the built-up area in towns accelerated after 2002, outstripping the growth
       of urban population in town districts. As a result the population density in town
       districts dropped from 7,500 per sq. km in 1990 to 4,500 per sq. km in 2009 (numbers
       for separate towns). The population density in city districts decreased even to a
       greater extent in the same period: slowdown in the numerical growth of cities and
       continued growth of their built-up area brought the population density in city
       districts down from 25,000 per sq. km in 1990 to less than 10,000 per sq. km in 2009.
       Despite the sharp decline, the population density in city districts remains more than
       double the population density in separate town districts. The population density is

highest in city districts, intermediate in town districts of county towns, and lowest in
town districts of regular towns. Since land in China is inherently limited and must be
utilized intensively, the next phase of small and medium town development should
probably emphasize county towns, where population density is higher than in regular
or separate towns and there are more opportunities for absorbing migrant labor.

Agglomeration as measured by the number of towns or cities per sq. km in a province
also has a positive effect on per capita GDP. Provinces with greater agglomeration,
i.e., with more cities and more towns per sq. km, are generally more affluent. This is
another manifestation of higher urbanization rate leading to higher GDP per capita.
Furthermore, provinces with larger towns attract more investment per capita.

Disparities in incomes, per capita investments, and level of public services create strong
incentives for migration from rural to urban areas. Rural-to-urban migration was the
driving force for China’s rapid urbanization during the last three decades. The natural
increase of urban population (the balance of births and deaths) was substantially
less than the observed increase in actual urban population each year since 1978. The
shortfall was made up by migration from rural to urban areas, which averaged 78%
of total annual population increase between 1978 and 2009. Recent media reports
seem to indicate a shift to a new trend, with some migrants returning to work in their
hometowns. Towns will be able to realize their potential to absorb a new wave of rural
migrants if they can offer adequate job opportunities and well-developed infrastructure
to support a better living standard.

Disparities in urban infrastructure
Skewed allocation of fixed asset investments that favors cities over towns has led
to striking disparities in the level of public infrastructure and quality of municipal
services. Towns receive much less in fiscal transfers from higher level of government
than their proportional share in the population and city expenditures are in fact
subsidized at the expense of towns. Economic disparity is observed not only between
cities and towns, but also between county towns and regular towns.

With the launch of market reforms in 1978, government policies began to emphasize
residential and environmental infrastructure, while moving away from the traditional
preference for industrial production (a shift from “producing cities? to “living cities?).
These developments resulted in a substantial increase in urban infrastructure
investments, providing a powerful impetus for urban development and improvement
in the standard of living. Investments in consumer-oriented water supply and sewage
infrastructure soared by two orders of magnitude after 1978. A change of policy
in the electric power sector in 1991 assured power for lighting to the population,


                                                                                   iii

       eliminating the absolute priority of industrial production as the main user of the
       limited electricity supply. However, because all levels of government had focused
       for so long on productive infrastructure, infrastructure related to households’ living
       conditions and environmental protection still requires massive investments. The
       major indicators of urban infrastructure increased over time in both cities and towns,
       but the level of urban infrastructure has been generally higher in cities.

       The investment per capita in urban service facilities in cities and county towns
       increased sharply in nominal terms between 2001 and 2009, but its level in cities is
       typically double the level in county towns. Cities get more investment (per sq. km)
       than towns. In 2009, the investment density (in yuan per sq. km of built-up area) in
       county towns was less than one-half of that in cities, while the investment density in
       separate towns was less than one-tenth of that in cities. Overall, investment density
       reveals a strong size bias, with the four super-large provincial-level municipalities –
       Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing – achieving levels much higher than other
       cities (between 40 and 80 million yuan per sq. km in the provincial-level municipalities
       compared with less than 30 million yuan per sq. km in prefecture-level and county-
       level cities combined).

       Financing urban infrastructure development
       All financing for urban infrastructure projects is managed through the Urban
       Maintenance and Construction Fund (UMCF), which finances both maintenance of
       existing urban public facilities and investment in construction of new infrastructure.
       UMCF derives its revenues from budgetary allocations of central and local governments
       (the “fiscal fund?) and from financial market sources (the “social fund?). The share of the
       fiscal fund in UMCF has declined sharply since 1986, reflecting the decreasing support
       from central and provincial government to infrastructure development as part of the
       policy of fiscal decentralization. In 2009, over 80% of annual investment financed from
       the fiscal fund (i.e., government budgets – excluding loans and securities issues) was
       from local sources (county, city, and town governments), with allocations from central
       and provincial government budgets providing a minor share.

       The share of investment financed by central and provincial government budget is
       lowest in cities (around 4%), because the fiscal revenue generated at the local level in
       cities is regarded as sufficient for financing public infrastructure investment. County
       towns and separate towns enjoy a higher level of support from central and provincial
       budget (12% in county towns, 16% in separate towns), as their locally generated fiscal
       revenues are presumably less sufficient than those of cities. For all settlement types
       (cities, county towns, separate towns), financing from local sources is highest in the
       affluent East, where reliance on central and provincial budgets is correspondingly

lowest. In the poorer Western Region, towns rely to a greater extent on allocation from
higher-level governments than on own fiscal revenue.

local governments are thus under pressure to mobilize extra-budget resources for the
delivery of infrastructure investments and public services. Revenue from land transfer
transactions with developers is an important component of the UMCF fiscal fund. In
2009, land transfer revenue accounted for 29% of total fiscal revenue allocated to UMCF
in county towns (39% in cities). City and town governments have further broadened
their capital mobilization options through the establishment of urban development
investment companies (UDIC) -- municipal corporations that, in addition to facilitating
land transfer revenues for local government, also mobilize domestic loans and self-
raised funds for infrastructure investment and maintenance. UDIC also issue bonds
and stocks, which are backed by their land use rights and future revenue from land
development projects. UDIC may even attract foreign investments. land revenue thus
has a dual function in city and town financing: it directly supplements the local fiscal
revenues in the form of land transfer fees (fiscal fund) and it also provides the security
for financial market operations that enable UDIC to raise loans and equity (social fund).

Shortage of capital has become the biggest challenge in infrastructure development in
towns. Towns are not fiscally independent, because local taxes are collected by county
government and only a certain proportion is surrendered to town government. Due
to the allocation formula used, town governments seldom have sufficient funds to
invest in infrastructure. Furthermore, town governments are not legally qualified to act
as borrowers and take loans from financial institutions. Banks are reluctant to finance
infrastructure projects in towns, because the ability of town government to service a
loan is lower than that of city government and the risk of default is correspondingly
higher. This explains the increasing role of market financing mobilized by UDIC.

The data used in this study is solely based on official figures. The team is aware of the
limitations as well as advantages associated with such a decision.

1. CONTExT

During the past three decades, China has undergone rapid urbanization, as the share
of urban population rose from 18% in 1978 to 47% in 2009, with urban population
growing from 172.5 million to 621.9 million (StatYB 2010, T.3.1).1 Urbanization has
been driven mainly by migration from rural to urban areas, which contributed around
80% of urban population increase each year since 1978 (Zhang and Song 2003,
as updated in this study). The urbanization was accompanied by remarkably fast
economic growth. China’s GDP in current prices increased more than a hundred-fold
from 364.5 billion yuan in 1980 to 34,050.7 billion yuan in 2009 (StatYB 2010, T.2.1).
Real GDP (in constant prices) had grown by 2009 to 1,862% of the 1978 level (StatYB
2010, T.2.5) – an average growth rate of nearly 10% annually over three decades. The

1. Context




         GDP growth rate substantially exceeded China’s population growth, which averaged
         1.4% annually between 1978 and 2009 (StatYB 2010, T.3.1), and real GDP per capita
         accordingly grew at 8.6% annually during this period.

         Urbanization has produced definite benefits for China’s population: GDP per
         capita is higher in provinces that have a higher urbanization rate (Figure 1.1). This
         phenomenon may be regarded as a manifestation of Deng xiaoping’s strategy from
         the beginning of the reform era in 1978 (Zhang 1996): “People who become rich
                                                        .
         help the poor, and eventually all become rich? Yet this strategy has led to increasing
         inequality, which has become a major social problem. China’s Gini coefficient – a
         standard measure of income inequality – has gone up from 0.30 in 1978 to 0.46 in
         2006 (Chen et al. 2010) and continued rising to 0.47 in 2010 (China Daily 2010). The
         Gini coefficient overtook the universally recognized warning level of 0.40 back in
         1993 and is now approaching the “high income inequality? level of 0.50 (lampton
         2008).3 Disparity in real urban-rural incomes per capita increased over the past three
         decades from 1.53 in 1985 to 2.67 in 2009 (StatYB 2010, T.10.2). In terms of public
         services and public infrastructure, the resources have been mostly poured into big
         cities and coastal areas, leaving inland and rural areas with much less investment
         and development: the urban-rural ratio of annual fixed asset investment (FAI) flows4
         increased from about 3:1 in 1995 to more than 5:1 in 2009 (StatYB 2010, T.5.2).

China’s urban population resides primarily in city districts (shiqu) and town districts
(zhenqu), which constitute the urban core of larger administrative units called
cities (shi) and respectively towns (zhen). Cities and towns in China are expansive
regions, with administrative territories much larger than in the rest of the world
(Chan 2007). Cities are conceptually equivalent to counties in the U.S. and thus the
whole of China’s territory is basically covered by 287 prefecture and provincial-
level municipalities, which within their area include 654 city districts – the cities
proper in the conventional sense of this word – and 19,322 towns. Each town in
turn includes a town district – an urban core that occupies a fraction of the town’s
area but accounts for most of the town’s urban population. While cities and towns
as a whole overlap in their administrative boundaries, with multiple towns nested
within each city, city districts and town districts are disjoint structures, being
urban embryos within the administrative boundaries of territorially larger cities
and towns. Figure 1.2 schematically illustrates the nesting of towns in cities and
the disjointedness of town districts from the city district. The main purpose of this
study is to examine the development and features of town districts (zhenqu) – the
urbanized core of China’s towns.

China’s mainland administrative divisions are

township level (Figure 2.1). The structures of
each level are nested within the structures                                                                  Municipality

Below the provincial-level divisions come the prefecture-level divisions: these
consist primarily of prefecture-level municipalities, which between 1983 and
1990 replaced most of the older prefectures and autonomous prefectures.7 Most
provinces (excluding the four provincial-level municipalities) are completely covered
by prefecture-level municipalities, which in a sense are equivalent to U.S. counties
completely covering the states. The total population in China’s 283 prefecture-level

    In addition to the 31 mainland provinces and municipalities, two Special Administrative Regions (Hong kong and
    Macao) and Taiwan are also counted as provincial-level divisions, bringing the total to 34.

    The four provincial-level municipalities are accordingly called “cities under central administration? emphasizing
    that they are higher than the prefecture-level municipalities in the administrative-divisions hierarchy.

The prefecture-level municipalities (as well as the remaining prefectures) are in
turn subdivided into county-level divisions, which primarily consist of counties,
county-level cities, and districts. Districts enjoy county-level status and they typically
constitute the urban core of a city (so-called “city districts? – shiqu in Chinese or
“districts under city administration? – shixiaqu ). Provincial-level municipalities are
similarly divided into counties and districts, but they do not include any county-
level cities (nor do they include any prefecture-level municipalities): the “city districts?
are the only “cities? within the municipalities, while the counties comprise the rural
surrounding. Counties and districts are in turn subdivided into townships (xiang )
and towns (zhen ), which constitute the third (lowest) level of China’s administrative-
division system – the township level. Similarly to cities, towns are a mixture of urban
and rural areas, with the urban communities concentrated in so called “town districts?
(zhenqu ). Administrative divisions of the three levels (below the provincial level) are
governed by People’s Congresses and People’s Governments.

Urban population comes mainly from cities and towns. Both cities and towns may
also contain rural population, and only the so-called “city districts? and “town districts?
are predominantly urban: they constitute the “urban areas? or “urban districts?
(chengqu), where the population is statistically defined as urban.8 Townships, on the
other hand, are mostly rural (except townships included within the urban district of a
prefecture-level city).9 Of China’s 621 million urban population, 60% reside in urban
cores of cities (the “city districts? of prefecture-level and county-level cities) and the
remaining 40% are in town districts (Table 2.2).10




8
     China’s National Bureau of Statistics defines urban areas according to criteria principally reflecting physical
     features and de facto population density (specifically, an average population density of at least 1,500 per sq.
     km). Other criteria include contiguity of the built-up area, location of the local government, being a “street? or
     “residents? committee. For a summary in English, see Chan and Hu (2003), Appendix 1. The NBS-defined urban
     areas are rarely in total congruence with the administratively defined urban areas (city or town districts).
9
     There is no information on urban population in townships. In 2005, the latest year when data are available, the
      non-agricultural population in townships – a proxy for urban population – was 14 million (Construction YB
      2009, table 3-1-3), which is consistent with 16 million urban population in townships according to Rural and
      Agricultural Census 2006. These numbers for townships represent about 2.5% of total urban population of
      562.12 million in that year (StatYB 2006, table 4-1).
10
     The actual share of towns in urban population is somewhat higher, because the share estimated in Table 2.1
     is based on 18,517 county and separate towns out of the total of 19,322 town districts: it does not include 805
     towns that are directly connected to the public facilities of cities and are part of city statistics in the available
     statistical system (see Table 2.5).

        villages constitute an informal fourth level of administrative divisions, which is not
        explicitly recognized in the Constitution. They are administratively embedded in the
        higher township level (i.e., in townships and towns. Table 2.3 shows that of China’
        s 640,000 villages 400,000 are included in towns, 200,000 in townships, and 30,000
        in city districts (Rural and Agricultural Census 2006). villages do not have formal
        government organs, and they are effectively governed by villagers committees, which
        are autonomous grassroots organizations. For purposes of statistics, a village is “a
        collection of houses and other buildings in the countryside where rural residents
        live and produce? (China Urban-Rural Construction Yearbook). villages are thus the
        fundamental organizational units for the rural population. The rural component
        of cities and towns is also organized in villages that are nested within the larger

Regional division
China’s 31 mainland provinces are conventionally grouped in four regions: North-
Eastern, Eastern, Central, and Western (see map in Appendix 1). The Eastern and the
Central regions combined have 64% of China’s population on 20% of land area. At
the other extreme, the huge Western region commands 71% of China’s land area
with less than 30% of the population (Table 2.4). The Eastern region has the highest
population density (549 persons per sq. km) compared with as low as 52 persons per
sq. km in the West. The disparity in population and population density across regions
is related to the topography: vast territories in Western China are unsuitable for
human habitation because of harsh climate and difficult topographic conditions. The
“livable? regions, with milder climate and more welcoming terrain, account for merely
19% of China’s land area (Cities 2010). They are mainly located in the eastern plains, in
the Sichuan Basin, and similar zones. Agglomerations and cities accordingly develop
primarily in eastern and coastal regions, e.g., the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River
Delta, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region.

         Cities (shi)
         Chinese cities fall into three broad categories corresponding to different
         administrative-division levels: the provincial-level municipalities (just four such cities)
         are part of the top provincial level and fall directly under the central government;
         prefecture-level municipalities (283); and county-level cities (367). Cities of all three
         types are not “cities? in the strict sense of the word: they are essentially administrative
         units, not urban entities. Chinese cities usually consist of an urban core or a group of
         city districts (the city proper) surrounded by rural areas.11

         The city districts are formally called “districts under city jurisdiction? (shiqu or
         shixiaqu). They are subdivided into so-called street communities, which are
         administrative divisions representing agencies of the city government and their
         population is statistically classified as 100% urban; in addition city districts may
         include towns, townships, and even villages, so that they have some rural population
         within their predominantly urban profile (Chan 2007).

         A prefecture-level municipality thus typically consists of a central core city
         surrounded by county-level cities, as well as towns, townships, and villages spanning
         a large area. The four provincial-level municipalities are similarly organized, except
         that they contain only one central city (without county-level cities), which is again
         surrounded by towns, townships, and villages. Generally, the city district corresponds


         11
              Before 1949, the administrative boundaries of Chinese cities were basically confined to the urbanized, built-up
              areas. Since the early 1950s, the city unit has increasingly, through successive changes, included rural counties
              within its administrative boundary and become essentially an administrative unit rather than an urban entity. By
              the 1990s, many cities already had an administrative area far larger than the urbanized area per se (Chan 2007).

very loosely to the “city proper? concept as understood in the United States, or the
“urban administrative area? used in United Nations publications. Yet even this “city
proper? typically has a very large area compared to most large Western or Japanese
cities. For example, in 2000 the area of Shanghai city proper was larger than New York,
Chicago, and los Angeles “cities proper? combined (Chan 2007). A county-level city is
much more compact in area than a provincial or a prefecture-level municipality, but it
also consists of an urban core surrounded by towns, townships, and villages.

Towns and townships
The differences between a township and a town were defined by the standards
announced by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1984, which set guidelines for conversion
from townships to towns.12 A town has a total population of more than 20,000 with
non-farming population exceeding 10% of the total; alternatively, a town may have a
total population of less than 20,000 if its non-farming population is more than 2,000
people. From these definitions it follows that townships have a larger component of
farming (i.e., rural) population than towns of comparable size. In this sense, towns are
more urbanized than townships: according to the Rural and Agricultural Census 2006,
the share of urban population in towns was 19% in 2005, compared with just 6% in
townships. The county seat is automatically declared a town regardless of its population.

Towns are thus classified into county towns – the seat of county government –
and regular (non-county) towns (Table 2.5). A subset of regular towns are the so-
called “separate? towns, in which public, residential, and municipal facilities are not
connected to those of nearby cities or county towns (of the 17,686 non-county towns,
16,881 are separate towns). County towns where the county government is located
are usually more urbanized and thus more affluent than other towns. In county
towns, 59% of total population resides in urban districts, compared with only 21% for
regular towns;13 65% of employed work in the higher paying secondary and tertiary
industries, compared with 52% in regular towns (see Table 5.2).

     http://www.zj.gov.cn/gb/zjnew/node3/node22/node166/node232/node1533/userobject9ai80120.html. The
     standard was abrogated in 2002 (http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2002/content_61721.htm) and since
     then the number of towns remained relatively constant in the absence of guidelines for transformation of town-
     ships into towns (see Figure 3.2).
13
     This number can be approximately compared to the urbanization rate of 19% for towns mentioned above, bear-
     ing in mind the difference in statistical sources (China Township Statistics 2010 and Rural and Agricultural Census
     2006), the difference in definitions (town district population may contain some rural population), and the differ-
     ence in time (2009 and 2005).

        Town and township governments have the lowest administrative level in the
        People’s Congress and among the People’s Governments (Constitution, Article
        95): they are subordinate to higher-level governments, i.e., governments of
        counties, county-level cities, and districts (qu)14, which provide policy directions
        and guidance. The People’s Government of a town or a to wnship is responsible
        for economic and social development, budget and finance, education, science,
        culture, public health, civil affairs, public security, judicial administration and
        family planning15. However, town or township governments are not independent
        fiscally: the local taxes are collected by the county-level government and the
        township-level governments are allocated a fixed share of the tax receipts.

        In order to be able to absorb migrants from local rural areas, the 12th Five Year Plan
        (2011-2015) sets the target to develop infrastructure and increase basic service
        provision in towns, especially in towns’ urban core areas. A town’s urban core area
        is designated by the term “town district? (zhengqu), while “town? refers to the entire
        administrative area under the town’s jurisdiction, which may also include villages.

        Towns, especially those in inland regions, are largely rural: only about 20% of the
        population in towns is urban, most land within the administrative boundaries of
        towns is farmland, and 46% of employment is in primary industry (see Table 5.4).
        Town districts are the true urban centers of towns. Positioned at the lowest level
        of China’s urban system, closest to the rural population, town districts serve as
        bridges linking urban and rural areas: they provide primary distribution centers
        for agricultural products from the villages, they are the locus of processing and
        manufacturing industries in largely agricultural areas, and their urban facilities

(schools, hospitals, libraries, community centers) serve not only the urban population
in the town district, but also a significant number of rural people in surrounding areas.
Further development of town districts would help to fill the gap between cities and
villages, thus promoting the integration of the urban and rural sector.

Average size of settlements
There are huge differences in size between settlements of different types. The
population in provincial-level municipalities averages 19 million, in prefecture-level
municipalities 4 million, and in county-level cities less than 700,000 (Table 2.6). The
average town has 42,000 people and the average township 18,000. County towns
are larger than regular towns (73,000 and 39,000, respectively). In the average town
of 42,000, the population in the urban core (the town district) is 11,000, but even this
includes a rural component (because town districts are defined within administrative
boundaries and not along statistical urban/rural divisions; see Chan 2007). village
population averages 1,100.

The average population numbers for towns and town districts hide left-skewed
distributions with a long right tail of relatively large towns. Town populations range
from around 4,000 in the smallest town to 555,000 in the largest. Fully 40% of towns
have populations between 15,000 and 35,000 and one-quarter fall below the 1984
threshold of 20,000 for conversion from a township to a town (Figure 2.2). At the
other extreme, 25% have populations greater than 50,000, with the largest town
reaching 555,000. The median population is 35,000, less than the mean population of
42,000, which is biased upward by the long right tail.

        The population in the towns’ urban core (town district) is much smaller than the
        town-wide population: one quarter of town districts have population not exceeding
        2,500 and the median town-district population is less than 5,000 (Figure 2.3).
        Here also the mean population of 11,000 is upward biased by the long right-hand
        tail of the population distribution that extends to 553,000. On average, the town-
        district population is 23% of the total population within the town’s administrative

Table 2.7 clearly demonstrates the distributional difference between towns and
town districts: the proportion of town districts is much higher in the lower population
ranges (up to 15,000); in the higher population ranges, on the other hand, the
proportion of towns is consistently greater than the proportion of town districts. Not
surprisingly, town districts are overall substantially smaller than whole towns.

3. URBANIZATION

Since the launch of the reform and the opening-up campaign in 1978, China has
experienced a remarkable period of rapid urbanization. The number of people
living in urban areas increased from 172.5 million in 1978 to 665.6 million in 2010,
while the rural population decreased from 790.14 million to 674.15 million during
the same period.16 As a result the urbanization rate – the share of urban population
in total population – grew steadily from 18% in 1978 to 49.7% in 2010 (Figure 3.1).
The urbanization pattern was less stable prior to 1978: rapid urbanization which
was naturally triggered by the emphasis on industrialization in the new People’s
Republic after 1949 came to a stop and changed to decline after 1960. The declining
urbanization rate between 1960 and 1978 can be attributed to two factors: first
was the failure of the Great leap Forward and the resulting famine of 1960-1963,
when food shortages in the cities forced the government to restrict rural-to-urban
migration and move urban residents closer to food sources in the villages (veek et
al. 2007); the second was the severe deurbanization measures practiced during the
cultural revolution of 1966-1976, when millions of urban young people were sent
“down to the countryside? for reeducation (Feiner et al. 2001).

3. Urbanization




        The national average urbanization rate hides considerable regional differences. The
        most urbanized regions are the East and the North-East, with urbanization rates of
        57% – ten percentage points above the national average in 2009. The Central and
        Western regions are less urbanized, with urban population accounting for about 40%
        of the total (Figure 3.2). The four regions have retained this ranking since 1982, but
        the changes in the urbanization rate over time show that the urban population grew
        at different rates in different regions. The growth of urban population was slowest
        in the North-East and fastest in the East. As a result, the industrial North-East lost
        its initial position as the most urbanized region during the 2000s and the East had
        caught up with it by 2009 (see Figure 3.2). The urban population in the North-East
        grew at an average annual rate of 1.9% between 1982 and 2009, compared with 4.9%
        in the East (Table 3.1). In the other two regions the annual growth rate averaged 4.2%
        in the West and 4.5% in the Central Region. Since 2000, however, the urban population
        growth in these two less urbanized regions has been faster than in the East: 4%-4.1%
        annuallycompared with 3.4% in the East. Congestion apparently began to take its
        toll after years of super-fast growth in the East and the focus of urbanization growth
        shifted to the relatively under-urbanized Central and Western regions.

Urbanization has produced definite benefits for China’s population: GDP per capita
is higher in provinces that have a higher urbanization rate (see Figure 1.1). Yet rapid
urbanization has led to increasing inequality – both across the entire population, as
measured by the Gini coefficient (Chen et al. 2010) and most significantly between urban
and rural segments of the population (see the next section on urban-rural inequality).

Growth in number of cities and towns
The increasing urbanization has manifested itself in a marked increase in the number
of cities and towns during the last three decades. The number of cities (prefecture-
level and county-level combined) rose from 193 in 1978 to 666 in 1996, mainly
through transformation of counties into county-level cities. The number of county-
level cities more than quadrupled during this period, rising from 92 in 1978 to 445
in 1996 (Figure 3.3). The process stopped after the central government issued new
instructions preventing further transformations of this kind (October 1994), and the
number of cities has stabilized at around 660. The urban population of the average
city decreased from about 600,000 in 1994-1995 to 500,000 in 2009.

The number of towns also increased dramatically in the past three decades, rising
from 2,173 in 1978 to 19,322 in 2009 (Figure 3.4). The numerical growth accelerated
dramatically in 1984, when the Ministry of Civil Affairs relaxed the criteria for the
establishment of towns and spurred large-scale transformation of townships into
towns. In just one year the number of towns rose from less than 3,000 in 1983 to
7,186 in 1984. The number of towns continued to increase at a fairly steady rate, as
government policies encouraged continued agglomeration of smaller townships
into towns (especially after 1992) and the 3rd Plenary Session of the 15th Central
Committee (1998) proposed a strategy of development for town districts (Zhang
2006). The growth continued until 2002, when the number of towns peaked at
20,601. After 2002, the numerical growth stopped and the number of towns began
to decline slightly as the goals of town development shifted from quantity to quality
(Zhang 2006) and the 1984 guidelines for transformation of townships into towns
were abrogated.17 Small towns began to merge with the objective of increasing the
population in the urban core and improving the delivery of urban services through
economies of size. Responding to this trend, the average population in the urban
core of separate towns began to increase, rising from about 6,000 in the 1990s to
more than 8,000 since 2004 (Table 3.2). This is contrary to the trend in average city
size, which decreased from nearly 700,000 in 1990 to 500,000 in 2009. By 2009, the

        population living in the town districts of all towns had reached 211.87 million, which
        is 34% of China’s urban population or nearly 15% of national total population. This
        should be compared to total town population of 803 million, which constitutes 60%
        of the national total population.

Urbanization density
With cities and towns constituting the foci of urban population in China,
urbanization density can be assessed by two indicators: the density of cities and
towns per sq. km in regions and provinces and the density of urban population per
sq. km in towns and cities.

Density of towns and cities
The Eastern region that has the highest density of towns per 1,000 sq. km, while the
Western region with its huge territorial expanses has the lowest density of towns –
although their absolute number is even greater than in the Eastern region (Figure 3.5).

3. Urbanization




        In general, the density of towns (i.e., the number of towns per sq. km) in a region or
        a province is positively associated with economic performance as measured by GDP
        per capita. On the regional level, the Eastern region, with its highest density of towns,
        also has the highest per capita GDP (41,000 yuan), while the lowest per capita GDP
        (18,000 yuan) is attained in the Western region, where the density of towns is lowest
        (see Table 4.1). The positive association between the density of towns and per capita
        GDP across provinces and municipalities at provincial level is demonstrated in Figure
        3.6. A similar relationship is observed between GDP per capita and the density of
        cities (i.e., the number of cities per sq. km) across provinces. Provinces with greater
        agglomeration, i.e., with more cities and more towns per sq. km, are generally more
        affluent. This is probably another facet of the observation in Figure 1.1, where higher
        urbanization rate is seen to lead to higher GDP per capita.

        Population density
        The population density in cities and towns is usually calculated as the ratio of the
        urban-core population to the built-up area (BUA) or the area of the built-up district
        (Development Report 2010). China Urban-Rural Construction Statistical Yearbook
        defines BUA as the large-scale developed quarters within the city or town jurisdiction
        connected to basic public facilities and utilities. BUA is thus typically smaller than the
        administrative area of the urban district. The average BUA in both cities and separate

             The three major provincial-level municipalities – Shangai, Beijing, and Tianjin – have the highest levels of GDP
             per capita in all of China and are also characterized the highest density of towns per sq. km. Yet the positive as-
             sociation between density of towns and GDP per capita in Figure 3.6 is not attributable entirely to the effect of
             the three largest cities. Exclusion of the towns in the four municipalities reduces the regression fit from R2 = 0.56
             to R2 = 0.19 while the slope coefficient drops from b=354.7 to b=195.8. Despite the poorer fit, the positive coef-
             ficient of correlation between GDP per capita and density of towns remains statistically significant at p=0.05.

towns grew rapidly after 1999-2000 (Figures 3.7, 3.8). BUA growth in cities proceeded
simultaneously with a general decline of city-district population, whereas in separate
towns BUA growth was faster than population growth in town districts. As a result,
the population density in both city districts and town districts declined over time.
The decline was particularly spectacular in city districts, where the population density
dropped from 25,000 per sq. km in 1990 to less than 10,000 in 2009, a decrease of 60%.
In separate towns, the population density decreased from 7,400 per sq. km to 4,400
during the same period – a drop of 40%.19 Despite its sharp decline the population
density in city districts remains more than double the population density in separate
town districts. For county towns, population and BUA data are available only since
2000. Calculations show that the population density for the urban core of county
towns also declines (from 10,800 per sq. km in 2000 to 8,600 per sq. km in 2009), while
the absolute levels fall between city districts and separate town districts.

Based on 2009 estimates, the population density is highest in city districts,
intermediate in town districts of county towns, and lowest in town districts of regular
towns (Table 3.3). The relatively low population density in town districts has been
used to argue that towns are wasteful of land and thus a less efficient urban form
than cities (Development Report 2010). Urbanization focusing on town districts may
be unsustainable in China, where land is limited and must be utilized intensively.


19
      The population density in 2009 is based on permanent population only to ensure comparability with 1990. Using
      both permanent and temporary population we obtain a density of 5,214 persons per sq. km (see Table 3.3).

        Development Report (2010) produces an overestimate, as the area of the city/town district where the population
        resides is larger than the BUA and the actual population in BUA is not available in statistical sources. An attempt
        to correct this distortion by calculating the population density in relation to the urban area produces basically the
        same ranking: city districts have a higher population density than town districts of county towns (no urban area is
        available for non-county towns).

        The reported permanent population in urban districts of all towns almost trebled between
        1996 and 2009, increasing from 73 million to 212 million.20 The increase mainly comes from
        transformation of townships into towns, as well as migration from rural areas (see next
        section). After 2000, some counties were transformed into cities (at county or prefecture
        level), causing a decline in number and population of county towns.

        The average population per town district is largest by far in Eastern China, where
        it is nearly double the town district population in Western China (Table 3.4). The
        population density in town districts is higher in Central and Eastern regions (around
        3,000 persons per sq. km, compared with 2,000 in North-Eastern and Western regions).

Rural-urban migration as an engine of urban population growth
The significant disparity between urban and rural China (as highlighted in the
introduction and discussed in more detail in the next section) creates strong stimuli
for migration from rural to urban areas. Urban population grew at an average annual
rate of 4.0% long term, between 1949 and 2009. Total population grew during the
same period at an average annual rate of 1.5%. The disparity in population growth
rates led to the observed rise in urbanization, with the share of urban population
increasing from 11% in 1949 to 46% in 2009. Observed population increase is usually
the result of two components: natural population growth (the difference between
births and deaths each year) and migration – in or out. Fragmentary data available
in China’s statistics on natural increase of the urban population since 1978 enabled
us to calculate the natural urban growth component for each year. The natural urban
population increase each year since 1978 was substantially less than the observed
increase in actual urban population. The shortfall had to be made up by migration
from rural to urban areas. Appendix 2 shows the detailed year-by-year calculations
of the actual increase, the natural increase, and the net in-migration component that
brought the actual population increase up to the observed increase level.21

The share of net migration in total annual population increase averaged 78%
between 1978 and 2009 (Figure 3.9). This justifies the statement that rural-to-urban
migration was the driving force for China’s rapid urbanization during the last three
decades. The dominance of rural-urban migration in urban population increase
became particularly pronounced since 1996, when it averaged 84% of annual urban
population increase.

     The table updates the data and the calculations from Zhang and Song (2003). These authors obtained 75% for the
     average share of net migration in total urban population increase between 1978-1999, which is consistent with
     our average of 78% for the period 1978-2009.

        Cumulating the annual population increases since 1978, we obtain the picture of
        urban population growth split into its two components – natural increase and net
        migration. Figure 3.10 shows how the cumulative migration component (top layer)
        rapidly exceeds the population attained through natural increase only (bottom layer).
        Starting from the base urban population in 1977, the net migration component
        reaches 59% of urban population in 2009, while the natural growth component is just
        41% of the total.

                           assumption underlying the construction of this diagram is that rural-urban
                           migration started in 1977.


        In recent years, a new trend is taking hold, where some migrant workers are choosing
        to find employment in their hometowns. In the past, mobility decisions were much
        more responsive to economic factors (World Bank 2009). Migrants travelled long
        distances and concentrated in the coastal big cities, due to the better wage; but
        recently some migrant workers returned to work nearby22. Compared to their
        previous jobs in the city, their new jobs are less demanding, thus they can enjoy more
        quality time with families, and they can have more saving even with lower salaries.
        Furthermore, because it is more expensive to live in cities than in towns, they do not
        have to spend money on transportation between families and working cities. With
        prospect economy to offer more employment and well-developed infrastructure to
        support a better living standard, SMT should do better to absorb new wave of rural
        migrants.

4. URBAN-RURAl INCOME INEQUAlITY

Urban-rural inequality in China is manifested in different indicators. The most obvious
indicator is the disparity in urban and rural incomes (measured by the urban-rural per
capita income ratio). Income inequality may be related to differences in the structure
of employment: the rural labor market is dominated by low-return primary industry
(basically agriculture), while urban workers enjoy higher earnings in secondary and
tertiary industries. Other indicators include the skewed allocation of annual fixed
asset investments (FAI), which favors urban over rural areas. This in turn leads to
striking disparities in the level of public infrastructure and quality of services between
urban and rural areas. The present chapter discusses income inequalities; gaps in FAI
and public services are dealt with in Chapters 5 and 6.

Figure 4.1 shows the increasing disparity in urban-rural per capita income since
1985.23 This constitutes a reversal of the trend that was observed between 1978 and
1985, when the urban-rural inequality decreased noticeably due to the beneficial
effect of the 1978 reforms on rural incomes. In 1984-1985 the focus of economic
reforms shifted from rural to urban areas. Urban incomes started growing much faster
than rural incomes. Between 1985 and 2009 urban per capita incomes (in constant
prices) grew at an average annual rate of 7.4%, while rural incomes grew at a much
slower rate of 5.0% annually. This disparity in income growth led to increasing urban-
rural inequality as the urban-rural income ratio (in current prices) rose from 1.86 in
1985 to 3.33 in 2009 (after going through a short-lived dip between 1995 and 1997,
when the government temporarily raised the price of agricultural products to spur
grain production) (lu and Chen 2006).

23
     In China, urban disposable income and rural net income are the most common income measures for urban and
     rural households, respectively. Urban disposable income reflects monetary transactions only and does not include
     in-kind income. It is cash income less borrowing less personal income tax less expenditures for household sideline
     production. Rural net income is rural households’ total income less expenses incurred in the operation of produc-
     tive and non-productive businesses, taxes, contracting and other fees payable to the collective, and depreciation
     of fixed assets. It contains cash net income and goods net income, such as the part of grain which is not sold in
     the market and is used within the household (see Carsten Holz, ihome.ust.hk/~socholz/SpatialDeflators/Income-
     data-26Nov05.pdf) .

        Several factors have been identified in the literature as contributing to the rise
        of urban-rural income inequality since 1984 (xue 1997): (1) relatively low farm-
        gate prices and relatively slow growth in agriculture; (2) faster wage increases for
        urban workers; (3) decline in non-farming rural incomes due to reduced capacity of
        Township and village Enterprises (TvEs) to absorb surplus rural labor in a changing
        market environment;24 (4) decline of government investment in agriculture, as priority
        shifted to coastal and urban areas (xue 2007). The short-lived reduction of income
        inequality after 1994 was attributed to a temporary increase of farm-product prices,
        which was intended to spur lagging production and automatically improved farming
        incomes (Wang and Duncan 2008).

             TvEs, which employed more than half the rural non-farm population in the early 1990s, began to lose their impor-
             tance in the rural economy after 1994 as government policies encouraged competition from private enterprises
             and reduced credit availability. In 2004 TvEs employed about 10% of the rural non-farm population (kung and lin
             2007).

             Exclusion of the four municipalities reduces the fit from R2 = 0.45 to R2 = 0.36 while making the slope coefficient
             more negative: it changed from -234*10-7 for 31 provinces and the provincial-level municipalities to -335*10-7 for
             27 provinces without the provincial-level municipalities. In both cases the coefficient of correlation is statistically
             significant.

Yet the urban-rural income ratio is smaller in provinces with a higher GDP per capita
(Figure 4.2) and thus a higher urbanization rate (because of the positive correlation
between GDP per capita and urbanization, see Figure 1.1). In fact, the urban-rural
income disparity is lowest in the richest and most highly urbanized municipalities –
Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. The pattern demonstrated in Figure 4.2 clearly implies
that the rural population is better off in relation to the urban population in regions
that are richer and more urbanized: economic development and urbanization benefit
both the urban and the rural population in the same province.

5. THE ECONOMY IN CITIES AND TOWNS

City-town disparities
Being urban and economic centers in rural China, towns in general and town districts
in particular play an important role as the connecting point of China’s urban-rural dual
economy. They absorb local rural surplus labor and mitigate the migration pressure on
large cities. However, the economy in towns is still small compared to the large cities.
Although most of China’s industrial enterprises (nearly 3 million) are in towns, the
average prefecture-level municipality has three times as many industrial enterprises
as the average town (Table 5.1). Furthermore, the industrial enterprises in towns are
much smaller in size. In 2006, the average industrial enterprise in towns employed only
8% of the employees in the average enterprise in prefecture-level municipalities.

        level cities). Statistics for towns reflect the town’s entire administrative area within the town boundary.


        Towns receive much less investment and have less fiscal resources compared to the
        large cities. While towns have 60% of China’s total population, they receive a mere 9%
        of total fixed asset investment. Prefecture-level municipalities get 6 times as much
        total FAI as towns; the disparity in per capita FAI is by a factor of 13. The average large
        city gets 22 billion yuan in FAI, while the average town gets 52 million – less by a factor
        of 500. Public spending in towns also lags far behind cities. In 2006, towns generated
        28% of fiscal revenue through taxes and other budgetary items at the local level in
        2006, but were allocated only 13% of fiscal expenditure from the budget at the local
        level.26 In the average large city, the annual fiscal expenditure exceeded the annual
        fiscal revenue by a hefty 30%, whereas in the average town annual fiscal expenditure
        was 20% below the level of annual fiscal revenue. These facts indicate that towns
        receive much less fiscal transfers than large cities from higher levels of government
        and that city expenditures are actually subsidized at the expense of towns.

             Fiscal revenue basically consists of taxes and fees collected by the local government. For the detailed composi-

Table 5.1 shows that economic disparity is observed not only between cities and
towns, but also between county towns and regular towns. County towns are usually
larger than regular towns both by population and by their built-up (urbanized) area
(Table 5.2). Being administrative centers of their counties, county towns attract more
talent, as is evident from their higher floating population (number of migrants or
temporary residents). In addition to attracting more FAI per town (Table 5.1), county
towns also attract more investments per town in agriculture, in infrastructure, and in
public welfare than regular towns (Table 5.2). The higher levels of investments per
town ensure that overall county towns are more economically developed than regular
towns. The higher economic development and greater economic strength of county
towns is evident from the appreciably larger number of industrial enterprises in the
average county town (Table 5.1). It is also evident from the higher share of the labor
force employed in the secondary and tertiary sectors (manufacturing and services)
compared with the primary sector (agriculture) (Table 5.2). In general, provinces
with a higher share of employment in secondary and tertiary sectors achieve higher
wealth (as measured by GDP per capita and income per capita),27 which by extension
suggests that county towns are wealthier than regular towns.

The level of economic development of towns varies across China’s four regions.
Measuring economic development and strength by the number of enterprises per
town and their average size, we see that the East is economically the strongest while
the West and the North-East are the weakest. In the East, there are on average 691
enterprises per town, whereas in the West and the North-East the corresponding
number is around 200 (Table 5.3). Moreover, the enterprises in the East are larger (by
the number of workers) than in other regions.

5. The economy in cities and towns




        Employment patterns
        Reflecting the increase in national urbanization levels, the primary industry (i.e.,
        agriculture) is no longer the main employer even when we ignore the highly
        urbanized cities and focus only on the towns. In 2009, town-wide employment (i.e.,
        employment among both rural and urban population in the towns’ administrative
        area) was 46% in the primary industry, with the remaining 54% divided evenly
        between secondary and tertiary industries (28% in the secondary manufacturing
        sector and 25% in the tertiary service sector). The industry structure of employment
        shows considerable regional variation, depending primarily on the urbanization rate.
        The share of employment in the primary industry is lowest in the highly urbanized
        East and highest in the least urbanized West (Table 5.4). The greater reliance on
        employment in secondary and tertiary industries in the East is consistent with the
        fact that this region has the highest regional GDP and the highest level of economic
        development in all of China.

        At the provincial level (Figure 5.1), employment structure varies with the size of
        the town’s urban core. Provinces and provincial-level municipalities with larger
        town districts (i.e., relatively more urbanized towns) tend to have a smaller share of
        employment in the primary sector (i.e., agriculture) and a correspondingly higher
        share in secondary and tertiary sectors (manufacturing and services). Urbanized town
        districts provide a more conducive environment for the development of upstream
        industries and thus facilitate exit from agriculture. This effect is strongly pronounced
        for employment in primary and secondary sectors (the first two panels in Figure 5.1)
        and also for secondary and tertiary sectors combined.

Employment in the tertiary sector on its own (third panel in Figure 5.1) does not
show statistically significant correlation with town district size, possibly because
towns overall are characterized by a relatively primitive economic environment
and a generally low level of human capital, none of which is advantageous for the
development of the service sector. In support of this conjecture we can note that the
share of tertiary industry is exceptionally high in Beijing (third panel in Figure 5.1),
which as the nation’s capital has a large pool of highly educated and administratively
skilled human capital conducive for the development of the service sector.28

      Three provinces – Shanghai, Jangsu, and Shandong – are characterized by town districts that are much larger on
      average than the town districts in the remaining 28 provinces and provincial-level municipalities (see Figure 5.1).
      Regression analysis of the 28 provinces and provincial-level municipalities without the three exceptional cases
      produces basically the same results as for all 31 provinces: statistically significant negative correlation between
      town district population and primary sector employment; statistically significant positive correlation for second-
      ary sector employment; no statistically significant correlation for tertiary sector employment.

5. The economy in cities and towns




        During the 1980s and the early 1990s, non-agricultural employment in rural areas
        was driven mainly by so-called Township and village Enterprises (TvE). TvEs were
        industrial enterprises owned by township and village communities with a governance
        structure in which the community government has control (Che and Qian 1998;
        Putterman 1997). Real gross output of the TvE sector grew at an annual rate of 22%
        between 1978 and 1992, outperforming agriculture and state owned enterprises.
        TvEs had an important influence on the rural economy. During the 1980s and the
        early 1990s, TvE accounted for more than 50% of rural non-farm employment (kung
        and lin 2007). They also contributed appreciably to rural income growth: in 1992,
        TvEs accounted for about 40% of per capita rural income, up from less than 8% in
        1978 (Yao 1997). The expansion of TvE benefited greatly from a favorable political and
        institutional environment, including broad local government support and massive
        loans from the state banking system. After the mid-1990s, however, the support of
        TvEs began to diminish due to increased competition from private economic entities
        and tightened credit policy. This adversely affected the profit returns of TvEs. Many
        TvEs were transformed into private entities and the significance of TvEs in the rural
        non-farm economy declined. By 2004, less than 10% of non-farming employment was
        in TvEs (kung and lin 2007).

        Fixed asset investment (FAI)
        Fixed asset investment (FAI) includes annual investments in capital construction,
        investment in real estate development, and investments in national and civil defense
        projects. It aggregates investment in fixed assets in all sectors of the economy, e.g.,
        agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, real estate, environment, and public service
        facilities.29

        FAI represents a large portion of China’s economy. In 2009, FAI accounted for 66% of
        China’s GDP (StatYB 2009), which is a large proportion in international perspective
        (li 2006). FAI is mostly poured into large cities and towns receive much less FAI than
        higher administrative-division levels. The gap in FAI between towns and prefecture-
        level municipalities is huge. In 2006, aggregated total FAI in towns was 9% of total
        national FAI while municipalities at prefecture level accounted for 56% of the
        national total. Per capita FAI in towns was only about 8% of that in prefecture-level
        municipalities (see Table 5.1).

             Investment in public service facilities is discussed separately in the next chapter on infrastructure.

Figure 5.2 plots the disparity in FAI between rural and urban China (there is no
information on total FAI over time by cities and towns separately). The urban-rural FAI
ratio increased from about 3:1 in 1995 to more than 5:1 in 2009. The level of disparity
also varies across China’s four regions. In the heavily industrialized North-East, with its
tradition of massive industrial investments in the cities, the urban-rural FAI ratio is the
highest (more than 12:1). In the East, where the GDP per capita is the highest among
all regions, the disparity ratio is the lowest (around 3:1, Table 5.5) This is consistent
with the general observation that the urban-rural income ratio declines as GDP per
capita increases (Figure 4.2).

5. The economy in cities and towns




        On the provincial level, provinces with larger population in the urbanized town
        districts tend to attract more FAI per urban resident (Figure 5.2; here FAI excludes
        agricultural investment). The coefficient of correlation between FAI per person and
        average town district population is statistically significant at p<0.05 despite the wide
        scatter of data points and the relatively low goodness of fit (R2 = 0.19).30

        Generally speaking, towns are still at the bottom of Chinese economy. They have
        much smaller scales compared to cities. The average size of enterprises in towns is
        just 15 people/enterprise. Even in towns in the East, average size of enterprises is
        only 18 people/enterprise. Small size of enterprises and small size of towns makes
        it difficult for towns to absorb large amount of migrant labor. However, there are
        many towns which already have good economic conditions. For the next phase of
        development in small and medium sized towns, probably China should focus on
        county towns.

             Elimination of the five outliers – Tiajin, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Shandong – in various combinations im-
             proves the goodness of fit and increases to slope coefficient, but the positive correlation between FAI per person
             and average town district population always remains statistically significant at better than 5%.

6. URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE

Infrastructure is characterized as public overhead capital and it consists of two main
components: social infrastructure and economic infrastructure (Hansen 1965). Social
infrastructure involves overhead capital invested in human beings, such as health
and education. Economic infrastructure is overhead capital that supports economic
production and general economic activity. It mainly includes public utilities (power,
piped gas, telecommunications, water supply, sewerage, waste collection and
disposal), public works (roads, major dams and irrigation canals), and transportation
(railways, ports, waterways, and airports, urban transportation networks) (World Bank
1994). Thus, economic infrastructure broadly defined is not restricted to production:
it also includes infrastructure components that support living conditions (e.g., water
supply) and protect the environment (solid waste disposal, wastewater treatment).

This report focuses on selected components of economic infrastructure in urban
areas. Due to the limited availability of statistical data, we consider four urban
infrastructure indicators:

   • Roads as representing urban economic infrastructure supporting production;
   • Water supply and piped gas as representing urban residential infrastructure
     serving households;
   • Wastewater treatment as urban environmental infrastructure protecting the
     environment.

To neutralize the effect of scale differences across urban structures, the indicators are
expressed in relative units: coverage rate in percent of the population with access to
water and gas supply (allowing for both permanent and temporary population since
2006), wastewater treatment rate in percent of total quantity discharged, and road
surface area in square meters per person.



                                                                                  39
6. Urban infrastructure




         The development of urban infrastructure in China has not been even. Initially,
         from 1949 to 1978, policies emphasized the need to “turn consumption cities into
         production cities? in order to achieve industrial recovery (Central Party Committee
         decisions, 1949; 2nd Five-Year Plan, 1958-1962). Priority was given to infrastructure
         related to industrial development, while residential and environmental infrastructure
         was neglected as “non-productive? (li and xu 2001). During the Cultural Revolution
         (1966-1976), some cities canceled all investment in basic urban infrastructure, such as
         water supply and housing.
         With the launch of market reforms in 1978, the policy began to shift from “producing
         cities? to “living cities? (li and xu 2001), emphasizing residential and environmental
         infrastructure. In the 1980s, new laws put a strong emphasis on urban infrastructure
         development and defined the construction of municipal and public facilities as the
         principal function of local government. The Urban Maintenance and Construction
         Tax was introduced in 1985 to help finance urban development, a portion of the
         land transfer revenue was earmarked for local infrastructure development, and all
         new construction projects were required to establish supporting municipal services
         and facilities. This has resulted in a substantial increase in urban infrastructure
         investments, providing a powerful impetus for urban development and improvement
         of the people’s standard of living. Investments in consumer-oriented water supply
         and sewage infrastructure soared by two orders of magnitude after 1978 (Table 6.1).
         A change of policy in the electric power sector in 1991 assured power for lighting
         to the population, eliminating the absolute priority of industrial production as the
         main user of the limited electricity supply. However, because all levels of government
         – both central and provincial – had focused for so long on production infrastructure,
         infrastructure related to households’ living conditions and environmental protection
         requires further efforts and massive investments.

City-town gap in urban public facilities
We have previously seen that large cities receive much more fixed asset investment
(FAI) than the smaller towns both in absolute terms and per capita (see Table 5.1).
Infrastructure levels also exhibit disparities between cities and towns, but appreciable
city-town gaps in infrastructure are observed only by some indicators. Thus, gas
coverage rates and wastewater treatment rates, as instances of relatively advanced
public services, were substantially higher in large cities than in towns (Figure 6.1,
2009 data); on the other hand, the disparities in more basic public services, such as
water coverage rate and road surface area per capita, were not pronounced.

The disparity observed in 2009 is the outcome of a long process of continuous
improvement in urban infrastructure over time (see, e.g., the steady growth of
infrastructure investments in Table 6.1). All four indicators of urban infrastructure
increased over time in both cities and county towns (no data are available for regular
non-county towns). The level of urban infrastructure, however, has been generally
higher in cities than in county towns. This is evident from Figure 6.2, which plots the
development of urban infrastructure between 2001 and 2009 (the period for which
comparable data are available for cities and county towns).

The level of wastewater treatment facilities shows exceptional growth since 2001
in cities and especially in county towns (Figure 6.2, bottom right-hand panel).
This strong growth in environmental infrastructure is a reflection of increasing
environmental consciousness that has recently focused more attention on sewage

The development of infrastructure for basic urban services in towns has been listed
as a critical target in the country’s 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015). Town districts
have been identified as the next frontier for extending urban infrastructure services.
Government policies would aim to improve public service provision in town districts
and thus strengthen their role as residential urban settlements. key towns in the
Eastern Region, county towns in the Central and Western regions, and major border-
crossing towns are designated as the “focal development points? to be developed
into small and medium cities.

Investment in urban public facilities
Urban public service facilities – urban infrastructure – include public utilities, such
as water, gas, sanitation, sewage and wastewater treatment, as well as public works,
such as roads, bridges, rail transit systems, flood control, etc.33 Infrastructure projects
in towns are financed primarily by the government budget, as well as loans from
financial institutions (Figure 6.3). The budget receives tax revenue from profit-making
commercial projects (water supply systems, toll roads, etc.) and disburses funds for
loan repayment.

6. Urban infrastructure




         All financing for urban infrastructure projects is managed through the Urban Maintenance
         and Construction Fund (UMCF), which finances both maintenance of existing urban
         public facilities and investment in construction of new infrastructure. As suggested by the
         diagram in Figure 6.3, UMCF derives its revenues from budgetary allocations of central and
         local governments (the so-called “fiscal fund? that consists of various taxes and fees) and
         from financial market sources (the so-called “social fund? that consists of domestic loans,
         securities issues, etc.). The proportions of the two UMCF components changed dramatically
         over time: in cities, the share of the fiscal fund dropped from 98% of UMCF in 1986 to 50%
         in 2005, while the social fund correspondingly increased its share from 2% to 50% (Table
         6.2). Data for county towns are available only since 2000, but a similar trend is observed,
         with the social fund gaining in importance. Still, county towns are more dependent on the
         budget than cities: the share of the fiscal fund in 2005 was 62% for county towns compared
         with 50% for cities.

         Source: Construction YB 2010, tables 1-1-3, 2-1-3. Data since 2006 show only the fiscal fund components.


         The declining share of the fiscal fund in UMCF is in part a reflection of the decreasing
         support from central and provincial government to infrastructure development.
         Government support has been shrinking since 1980 due to the policy of economic
         transition and decentralization. Prior to 1979, the central government had direct
         control over provincial and municipal governments in allocation of resources,
         production planning for key industries, and budgetary control of revenue and
         expenditure. The new system of fiscal contract introduced in 1980 allowed many
         cities to retain a higher share of revenues and allocate funding more freely (Wu
         1999). The fiscal reform in 1994 further strengthened fiscal decentralization with
         taxes reassigned between the central and local governments based on a mechanism
         combining tax assignment and tax sharing (Wong and Bird 2005). Prior to 1990,
         more than 50% of projects were financed with central government investment; the
         proportion dropped to 33% in 1999 as a result of decentralization policies (Wei 2001).
         Today, investment in public service facilities is funded mainly from the fiscal revenue
         of local budgets. In 2009, over 80% of annual investment financed from the fiscal
         fund (i.e., from government budgets – excluding loans and securities issues) was from
         local sources (county, city, and town governments), with allocations from central and
         provincial government budgets providing a minor share (Table 6.3).

The share of investment financed by central and provincial government budget is
lowest in cities (around 4%): the fiscal revenue generated at the local level in cities
is apparently regarded as sufficient for financing public infrastructure investment.
County towns and separate towns enjoy a higher level of support from central and
provincial budget (12% in county towns, 16% in separate towns), as their locally
generated fiscal revenue is presumably less sufficient than in cities.

The structure of fiscal revenue allocated for the construction of urban service facilities
differs across regions (Table 6.4). For all settlement types (cities, county towns,
separate towns), financing from local sources is highest in the affluent East, where
reliance on central and provincial budgets is correspondingly lowest. For separate
towns, local sources consist of two components: allocations from county government
and town fiscal revenues. Towns in the affluent Eastern China have higher fiscal
revenue, both in absolute amounts and per capita, and town governments in the
East are better able to support infrastructure development: here 62% of investment
in urban service facilities financed by fiscal revenue comes from town government
(another 29% from county government and the remaining 9% from central and
provincial government). In the poorer Western Region, on the other hand, towns rely
to a greater extent on allocation from higher-level governments than on own fiscal
revenue: only 24% of investment financed by fiscal revenue is contributed by town
government, while 45% if from county government, and the remaining 31% from
central and provincial government.

         local governments are under pressure to mobilize extra resources for the delivery
         of infrastructure and services (liu 2004). One of the ways to increase local fiscal
         revenues for infrastructure financing is by greater reliance on land transfer revenue
         (Development Report 2010). According to the land Administration law, local
         governments have the power to expropriate for “public interests? land that is owned
         by rural collectives thus converting it to urban land. local governments routinely take
         advantage of their monopolistic power, expropriate rural land cultivated by farmers
         in collectives, pay compensation based on an underestimated assessment value, and
         then lease out the land to so-called urban development investment companies (UDIC)
         for commercial development. The new land users (UDIC) pay the expropriation fee,
         various stipulated land fees incurred in the transaction, and a conveyance charge.
         The last item is the net land transfer revenue that the local government retains from
         these transactions (Fubing 2008). In 2009, land transfer revenue accounted for 29% of
         total fiscal revenue allocated to UMCF in county towns (39% in cities) (Construction
         YB 2009, tables 2-2-3, 1-2-3). This land transfer revenue is part of the large share of
         financing for investment in public service infrastructure that comes from city (county)
         government and is thus part of the fiscal fund component of UMCF (see Table 6.3).

          Box 6.1. The common functions of UDICs
             • Financing platform. UDICs raise funds for urban infrastructure development from multiple
                channels. They provide borrowed money to infrastructure projects through on-lending or direct
                investments.
             • Public sector investor. UDICs operate as authorized investment agents of the municipal
                government or state-owned asset administration authorities. UDICs operate and manage the
                assets within their authorized scope and are responsible for maintaining the value of the asset
                and protecting the interests of the government.
             • Land development agent. Many UDICs conduct up-front development and management of land
                allocated by local government in urban planning areas.
             • Project sponsor/owner. UDICs sponsor and own priority urban infrastructure projects. In this
                respect, UDICs are responsible for investment, construction, management, and operation of
                projects.
                                                                                       From World Bank (2010)

The establishment of UDIC has enabled city and town governments to broaden their
capital mobilization options beyond reliance on budgetary allocations and land
transfer revenue. UDIC are municipal corporations that, in addition to providing a
channel for local governments to generate land revenue, are allowed to raise funds
by borrowing or issuing securities in the capital market (see Box 6.1 for the common
functions of UDICs).

In addition to land transfer revenue, local government also significantly relies on
UDIC to mobilize domestic loans and self-raised funds. local governments are
not allowed to engage in direct market borrowing, and the UDIC model provides
the local governments with a government-owned corporate structure to borrow
from the market for infrastructure development. UDIC can also issue bonds and
stocks, which are backed by their land use rights and future revenue from land
development projects. UDIC may even attract foreign investments. As noted
previously, these UDIC-raised sources constitute the social fund component of UMCF
that complements the budgetary fiscal fund. Figure 6.4 illustrates the central role
that land revenue plays in financing urban infrastructure investment. First, it directly
supplements the local fiscal revenues in the form of land transfer fees (fiscal fund).
Second, it provides the security for financial market operations that enable UDIC to
raise loans and equity (social fund).

6. Urban infrastructure




         Data up to 2005 make it possible to determine the proportions of fiscal and social
         funds in total UMCF available for both investment and maintenance of municipal
         infrastructure (see Table 6.2). After 2005 we only have the shares of fiscal and social
         funds in the investment component of UMCF, i.e., the financing structure of fixed
         asset investment in urban infrastructure. Further, data are available only for cities and
         county towns, but not for regular or separate towns. Thus, in cities and county towns,
         the investment in urban public facilities has been mainly financed from two sources:
         allocations from local government (including land transfer revenue) plus domestic
         loans and other funds mobilized by UDIC in the financial market (Table 6.5). The
         specific financing mix differs between cities and county towns: county towns rely
         less on allocation from central and local government, more on domestic loans (no
         comparable information is available for regular towns).

         The investment per capita in urban service facilities in cities and county towns
         increased sharply in nominal terms between 2001 and 2009, but its level in cities is
         typically double the level in county towns (Table 6.6). There are no comparable data
         for infrastructure investment in towns over time. Yet 2009 data reveal an obvious
         urban-rural gap in rate of investment in urban service facilities (Figure 6.5). Cities get
         more investment (per sq. km) than towns and townships. The investment density (in
         yuan per sq. km of built-up area) in county towns was less than one-half of that in
         cities, while the investment density in separate towns was less than one-tenth of that
         in cities. Overall, investment density reveals a strong size bias, with the four provincial-
         level municipalities achieving levels much higher than other cities (between 40 and
         80 million yuan per sq. km in the municipalities compared with less than 30 million
         yuan per sq. km in prefecture-level and county-level cities combined).

6. Urban infrastructure




         Shortage of capital has become the biggest challenge in infrastructure development
         in towns. Towns are not independent in fiscal terms: the local taxes are collected by
         county government and only a certain proportion of tax revenue is surrendered
         to town government. The proportion is determined by the county government
         based on actual administrative expenses, including officials’ salaries and daily office
         expenses (Ma 2008). Due to the allocation formula used, town governments seldom
         have sufficient funds to invest in infrastructure. Furthermore, the town governments
         are not legally qualified to act as borrowers and take loans from financial institutions.
         Banks are reluctant to finance infrastructure projects in towns, because the ability
         of town government to service a loan is lower than that of city government and the
         risk of default is correspondingly higher. This explains the increasing role of market
         financing mobilized by UDIC.
