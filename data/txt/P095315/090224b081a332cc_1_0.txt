                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the withdrawal of financing of the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development in 2010, the project was restructured in May 2012 to reduce its scope in line
                         with available funding from the Bank loan and counterpart funding and to extend the Loan closing date by six months. Project implementation, which had stagnated for two years,
                         resumed in June 2012 with procurement of the remaining works, goods and services needed to achieve the revised indicators. All remaining water and sanitation works should be

                         completed by end March 2013. At this time, the number of additional people with access to safe water supply has increased to about 565,774 or 97% of the revised project target of
                         584,716. The number of people who have access to improved sanitation is about 185,535 or 93% of the revised project target of 200,505. An end-of-project survey, carried out in
                         late 2012, indicated that the rates of hand-washing with soap after contact with fecal matter and before food preparation are higher than the baseline in the project villages/schools,
                         and higher than in non-project villages/schools, strengthening the conclusion drawn at the mid-term survey on the impact of project interventions in improving hygiene behaviors in

                         repairs. Many have not been operating long enough to meet design capacity.
