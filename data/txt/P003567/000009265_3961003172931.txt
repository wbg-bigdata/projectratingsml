MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPNENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR AN EFFECTIVE TEACHING SERVICES PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of China for
SDR 72.1 million ($100 million equivalent) to help finance an effective teach-
ing services project. The proposed credit will be on standard IDA terms, with
a maturity of 35 years. About $93 million of the proceeds of the development
credit will be made available to the 15 provinces participating in the proj-
ect, to be repaid over 10 years with a service charge of 1.5 percent per
annum, following a 5-year period.
2.       Sector Background.  Education plays a central role in China's devel-
opment and modernization. The education sector is currently characterized by
changes that reflect decentralization and increased responsiveness to labor
markets. With variations due to provincial diversity, decentralization is
taking place in curricula, examinations and operational control of all aspects
of education. One major goal is nine years of universal basic education (UBE)
as soon as is practical. Compared with many developing countries, China haa
been very successful in providing schooling for its people, with more than
95 percent of those aged 6 to 11 years enrolled in primary school and 60 per-
cent of those aged 12 to 15 years in secondary school. Teachers, as managers
of the inputs to education, are the pivotal element in its success. The dra-
matic increase in enrollments at all levels of Chinese education over the past
few decades has been reflected in a corresponding growth in the number of
teachers. The sources of trained teachers for primary schools (grades 1-6)
are already prepared to meet aggregate quantitative and qualitative require-
ments. The Government now plans to address teacher development for lower
middle schools (LMS, grades 7-9), a level of education that is increasingly
essential economically because it is required by employers for all but the
simplest jobs.
3.       Though there is an oversupply of teachers in certain subject matters
and locations, especially in some urban areas, there is a growing demand for
qualified teachers in rural, remote and otherwise disadvantaged places. This
is met by recruitment of candidates originating from such areas, and by prom-
ises of favorable terms of service in return for the obligation to teach in
those same disadvantaged locations. For long-standing social reasons, each
province is responsible for the supply of its own teachers, and there is no
significant interprovincial movement. Transfer from urban to rural locations
is also not comon. Estimates of required teacher training capacity, there-
fore, need to be geared to projections of enrollment, teacher loading and
class size at relatively local levels, and also to expected rates of entry
into and attrition from teaching. There is thus a need for responsive and
accurate locally based, but centrally coordinated, information systems regard-
ing teachers.
4.       Many working teachers at the LMS level lack adequate academic and
pedagogical preparation. In 1985 almost 79 percent were professionally
unqualified. Presently, some 90 percent of LMS teacher trainees come from
disadvantaged areas, and they are increasingly being trained to work in more



-2-
than one subject to facilitate deployment to smaller schools. Most teacher
training is done in specialized institutions, though comprehensive universi-
ties also train teachers. Those training institutions that are too small to
be efficient are being converted to other purposes or combined with colleges
of different specialties for efficiency and for effective response to labor
force needs. It is important to improve the quality of instruction available
at teacher training institutions, both through provision of facilities and
equipment of appropriate quality and by introduction of new and innovative
practices to meet evolving needs.
5.       Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Onerations.  Three recent projects
have addressed teacher training. The Provincial Uni. ersities Development
Project (Credit 1671-CHA, FY86) assisted selected programs in 28 normal (i.e.,
teacher training) universities among its 60 project institutions. The Teacher
Training Project (Credit 1908-CHA, FY89) supports in-service t-aining for LMS
teachers. The Education Development in Poor Provinces Project (Credit
2339-CIA, FY92), in the course of generally upgrading educational services in
selected locations, also gives attention to teacher preparation. These proj-
ects have, inter alia, demonstrated the contributions of instructional equip-
ment of an appropriate level, of equipment spares and maintenance, of
increased library utilization, of better institutional management, of indepen-
dent learning methods, of strengthened capacity to plan for teacher demand,
and of continuing development of implementation capabilities. The present
project incorporates these lessons. Past experience has also alerted provin-
cial governments to the importance of issues such as class size and teacher
loading, which now need to be dealt with on a local basis using information
handling capacity to be provided under the project. University capabilities
strengthened under past projects have provided the means to deliver extensive
in-country training under this project.
6.       Ra_onale for IDA Involvement.  The Government has requested the
Association's support to develop teaching resources for its LMSs. The Bank
Group is familiar with the issues of teacher training from its previous proj-
ects and from sector work. There is concurrence on the major issues to be
addressed, and counterpart resources are ready for mobilization. The project
supports the strategic goals of building an education system appropriate to
modern needs, introducing initiatives aimed at improved teaching quality,
training teachers for rural areas, and developing necessary management capa-
bilities. It builds on the experience of past projects, with a focus on the
1MS level. It is made timely by recent Government policy directions and will
provide support to initiatives aimed at improved teaching quality, decentral-
ized control of teaching services, training of teachers for rural areas and
improved management capacity. Given the expected national impact through
replication of its basic features, the project will be a strategic vehicle for
achieving IDA's objective of human resource development in poor regio"'. The
Government has, furthermore, provided assurances that it intends to 8 iport
with its own resources the strengthening of LMS teacher training in provinces
not covered by the project but in parallel with its objectives.
7.       Prolect Objectives.  The project, in combination with other Govern-
ment and past IDA activities, will bring pre-service LMS teacher training up
to prescribed quality standards nationwide. Its central aim is to contribute
to improved learning at the LMS level by providing for better teaching ser-
vices, including instructional methodology, teacher training and better man-
agement of teacher training and assignment. In assisting a range of teacher



-3-
services, the project has three functional objectives: (a) enhance quality of
LMS teacher training through better physical inputs, management and staff
training; (b) improve management and planning capabilities for teacher selec-
tion, training and assignment at provincial and county levels; and (c) facili-
tate innovative activities in teaching and teacher training.
8.       Proiect Description.  The project will, over five years, assist in
the provision of civil works, equipment, materials, specialist services and
training to support LMS teaching, providing for development of teaching ser-
vices in 15 provinces and autonomous regions (Sichuan, Shandong, Jilin,
* uangdong, Jiangsu, Ji -gxi, Liaoning, Anhui, Hebei, Heilongjiangt Henan#
Guangxi, Fujian, Haine i and Nei Mongol).  Eight of these, vith a total popula-
tion of some 420 million persons, are below the national average in per capita
Income. In addition, each project province has disadvantaged areas for which
teachers will be explicitly recruited and trained. The project directly sup-
ports 124 teacher training institutions, in addition to provincial and county
education bureaus, and thereby covers virtually all LMS teacher training and
teacher management activities in the participating provinces. A critical
segment of the education system, LMS teaching services, is thereby addressed
through the three major project elements: lnstitutional, manaxement and aual-
itY enhancement.
9.       The institutional element ($240.5 million) addresses operational
needs at teacher training institutions through facilities upgrading, provision
of instructional equipment, spares and consumables, library development
(books, materials and equipment), and staff upgrading, mainly in-country. The
facilities will be financed wholly from local sources. The equipment will be
entirely for iastructional purposes. It will be selected from a list, com-
piled by Chinese specialists and reviewed by the Bank, based on current course
materials and on new study areas to be introduced. Equipment procurement will
be phased throughout the life of the project to accomm4odate future needs.
Staff upgrading will include a range of training activities, including
courses, on-the-job training, management training, and shorter-term courses
covering, inter alia, equipment utilization and library operations.
10.            The manaaement element ($9.6 million) will develop general
teaching system management capabilities at the central, provincial and insti-
tutional levels through staff training and specialist services. The selection
and assignment of teachers will be aided by a teacher information system (TIS)
to be developed under the project, and by training for its use.  The TIS, once
operational, will be applied to quantitative monitoring of teacher stock, to
prediction of needs by location and field of competence, and to planning of
future teacher supply.
11.            The quality enhancement element ($6.2 million) will include
teaching methodology core seminars, pilot programs and innovation programs.
Chinese education and teacher training presently lack sufficient attention to
teacher/student Interactions, group work, creativity, and higher order concept
development. The core seminars will aim to present best international prac-
tice in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology teaching, ini-
tially at the national level and later cascaded down to the local level by
means of provincial seminars. The primary objective will be to expose teacher
trainers to new ideas, after which they will be responsible to apply them
within the Chinese context. This will be further facilitated by pilot pro-
grams in 10 teacher training institutions to test the applicability of those



-4-
ideas. The innovation program will permit provinces, institutions and indi-
viduals to propose projects of an experiaental, innovative or developmental
n&ture, to be supported by funds provided under the project. An Innovation
Assessment Group (IAG), made up of teacher training faculty and Gover Dent
officials, has been set up to evaluate proposals, to manage the funds and to
monitor implementation.
12.            ?_oiiitorina of project execution will be done by the partici-
pating institutions and agencies according to agreed formats and using agreed
indicators, and coordinated by the State Education Commission (SEdC), succes-
sor agency to the 14inistry of Education. Longer-term evaluation of teaching
practices and training will be undertaken by the SEdC as a part of its regular
work.
13.            Proiect Implementation.  The qualitative and professional
decisions related to the project will be made by officials of the participat-
ing teacher training institutions and provinces, by technical departments of
the SEdC and by the IAG. Arrangements for these functions have been discussed
and agreed, and are in place. The technical aspects of project execution and
coordination, including procurement, will be carried out by the SEdC through
its Foreign Investment and Loan Office (PILO), using technical and administra-
tive resources which are familiar with the Association and have proved satis-
factory in the past. A mid-term review of project progress will be held
using, inter alia, information provided through the TIS to support project
monitoring. The project will be financed by the SEdC, the provinces and the
Association. Of expenditure categories, about 39 percent goes to facilities
(all from in-country funding), about 56 percent to equipment and materials
(including library stock and information systems), and about 5 percent to
technical assistance and innovations. The last item includes 5,500 person-
years of training for 11,000 participants, mainly in-country. In order to
finance rapid start-up of key technical assistance and quality enhancement
activities of the project, retroactive financing of $5 million is provided for
expenditures incurred after December 31, 1992. A breakdown of project costs
and the fine-ncing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of pro-
curement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are presented in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11273-CHA,
dated February 10, 1993, is being distributed separately.
14.            Project Sustainabilitv.  There are no significant increases in
the operational costs of teacher training institutions arising from the proj-
ect, except for the requirement that adequate provision be made for operation,
spares and maintenance for the equipment supplied under it. This will con-
tribute a very low and easily absorbed incremental cost. The project works
within and makes use of existing institutional arrangements, which gives
assurance to its sustainability in that regard.
15.            Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached
with the Government on:  (a) a strategy statement for LMS teaching and teach-
ers; (b) procedures and criteria for TIS and IAG operation; (c) programs for
project implementation and monitoring, including quantitative measures of
project performance; (d) provision of spares and operating supplies for proj-
ect-supplied equipment; and (e) utilization and diffusion of significant proj-
ect results in teacher training methodology.



16.            Environmental Aspects and Proargm Obiective Cateaories.  No
negative environmental impact from the project is foreseen. By strengthening
capacity for training teachers for disadvantaged areas, the projiect contrib-
utes to reduction of poverty. Improved teacher training Vill also increase
opportunities for women in the teaching profession. The project, through one
of its stated quantitative targets, wvill raise the numbers of women engaged in
LMS teaching and thus encourage enrollment and retention of girls in schools.
It has also been shown that improved quality of education in general also
increases the retention of girls, with resultant economic and social benefits.
17.            Proiect Benefits.  The project builds on the oxisting
strengths in Chinese education and assists in providing teaching services of
higher quality, primarily through improved teacher training and strengthened
management. It provides opportunities for essential laboratory work, books
and reading places in libraries, more effective language training, and exten-
sive staff development at teacher training institutions. Other training
activities under the project will also improve teacher college management. At
the provincial and county levels, selection, assignAent and utilizationi of
teachers will be assisted by programs for management development, particularly
through the TIS. Finally, programs for improvement of teaching will be intro-
duced and tested, providing exposure to new approaches and opportunities to
experiment with innovations. These bonefits are expected to affect virtually
all teacher trainers and trainees in the participating provinces.
18.            Risks.  There are operational risks inherent in the implemen-
tation of a project reaching 124 teacher training institutions and 15 provin-
cial offices. There are also questions whether the capacity building aimed at
improved management of teaching and teacher training systems will fully
achieve its targets, and whether the teacher information systems will be uti-
lized as envisaged. These risks will be addressed by a structure of project
management that combines the varied administrative and professional require-
ments of the end-users of project inputs with the proven strong project lmple-
mentation capabilities of the SEdC. The participating institutions, provinces
and SEdC have, furthermore, been continuously involved in discussions during
project development. Finally, the effective introduction of new methods and
independently conceived innovations will require careful oversight and moni-
toring. The IAG has been formed for that purpose.
19.            Recommenda,.ion.  I am satisfied that the proposed development
credit will comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and rec-
ommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
