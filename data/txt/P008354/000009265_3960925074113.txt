PROJECT ConLTroU UPOR
CYPRUS
YRUIT AND VEGITABLE EXPORT PROJECT
(Loun 1988-CT)
EFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fruit and
Vegetable Project in Cyprus, for which Loan 1988-CY in the amount of US14.0
million was approved on May 12, 1981. The project was restructured, and US$7.5
million of the loan amount was c-ncelled in July 1986. The loan was closed on
December 31, 1988, 2 1/2 years after the original closing date. An additional
amount of US$3.7 million was cancelled at closing, resulting in a total amount
utilized of US$2.8 million. The last disbursement was on October 2, 1987.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the
Europe. Middle East, and North Africa Regional Office. Part II is a summary of
the Borrower's completion report.
The PCR is based, inter alI-^, on the Borrower's Completion Report;
the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision
reports; correspondence between the nank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECT CooHLETION REPORT
CYPRUS
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE RXPORT PROJECT
(Loan 1988-CY)
EVALUATION SR
Background
1.          At the time of appraisal, agriculture provided 402 of the total
exports of Cyprus, but they were highly concentrated in the UK, and there was a
need to diversify by expanding exports to continental EEC countries, CMEA
countries,  and the Middle East.   However, the export industry was largely
fragmented, and large exporters were needed to meet the heavy competition in
continental EEC countries snd utndertake the sizeable initial investments required
for market penetration.
Obiectives and DescriDtion
2.          The main objectives of the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (FVEP)
were to 1) strengthen and reorganize the horticultural export production and
marketing system, 2) increase production of out-of-season vegetables and
seasonally-shifted fruit for export, and 3) upgrade wine production to meet
changed consumer preferences in export markets.  These objectives were to be
achieved through on-farm investments in greenhouses, fruit tree plantations, vine
replanting, and water use improvement; investments in processing and marketing
facilities (including two central grading and packing facilities, and three
vintage wineries); strengthening of horticultural research and extension; and
reorganization of export marketing through establishment of a coordinating
committee, formation of trade partnerships, and export promotion.
Design and Organization
3.          The design of the project seems generally appropriate in the context
of the preparation/appraisal perspective. However, project credit had to compete
with other credit programs with easier terms, and problems were encountered on
the marketing side. The fruit and vegetable export trade was to be restructured
through the consolidation of the large number of small exporters into a few trade
partnerships. While there was apparently support for this approach in Government
and among exporters, and two trade partnerships were reported to be in the
process of formation at the time of appraisal, previous efforts of exporters to
join forces had not been successful.  The project attempts also proved to be
unsuccessful, and it may have been unrealistic to expect that the many small
exporters would form trade partnerships on a voluntary basis.



- iw -
Implementation
4.          The project was implemented in a changing environment which caused
problems of adjustment, and it faced competition from other sources of financing.
Hcwever, vhen it was recognized that the project could not be implemented as
designed. the Government and the Bank cooperated in restructuring the project to
focus on those elements which remained viable. In this manner, partial success
of the project was achieved.
5.          The production component of the project met uith some success, in
spite of competition from Government credit programs with lower interest rates
and easier collateral requirements. The greenhouse and water use improvement
investments reached 882 and 75Z of physical appraisal targets, although vine
replanting achieved only 362 and fruit tree plantations 22.
6.          The processing and marketing component was not very successful.
Neither of the trade partnerships reported to be in formation at the time of
appraisal in fact emerged, and the export business continued to evolve on the
basis of natural attrition.   Therefore, the two central grading and packing
facilities to be constructed by these partnerships were not established.
Precooling at harvest was identified as a constraint during project
implementation, and action to address the problem may have been taken following
the project period.  Only one of the three vintage wineries was established,
although five others were constructed outside the project. Transport equipment
for export of produce to Arab countries was not purchased.
7.          Implementation of the support services component was mixed. Only one
of the six research/extension specialists was recruited, although the research
and extension activities were incorporated in the Agricultural Research and
Extension Project, which began in 1986. The model winery was expanded as planned
and apparently had a substantial demonstration effect.   The coordinating
committee contemplated under the project was established but was unable to exert
much influence and eventually stopped functioning. An export marketing strategy
was designed by consultants but was not implemented. However, it did seem to
have been considered in subsequent Government actions. As noted above, the trade
partnerships were not formed.
8.          The actual cost of the project as estimated by the borrower was about
CL 5.7 million (US$11.3 million), or only half of the CL 11.4 million (US$32.9
million) estimated at appraisal.   Bank financing of only US$2.8 million was
utilized, in comparison with the original loan amount of US$14.0 million and the
revised loan amount of US$6.5 million.
Results
9.          The overall project objective to strengthen and reorganize the
horticultural export production and marketing system was achieved to some extent
on the produccion side but to little extent on the marketing side.  As noted
above, the flexible approach to implementation and restructuring of the project
contributed to this partial success. The project did contribute to the expansion
and restructuring of production, although its effect was constrained by the
competition from other credit programs.   However, the growth in domestic demand



v  -
(resulting in particular from the expansion of tourism) absorbed the additional
output, and the project had little impact on exports.  For the sector as a whole,
the supply of exportable horticultural produce seems to have been constrained by
farm labor shortages. and inadequate air freight capacity contributed to poor
export performance. The vegetable export marketing industry remained fragmented.
Quality wine production increased as a result of the winery established under the
project and the additional five wineries which were establisned outside the
project but which received technical assistance from the project model winery.
Financial rates of return were re-estimated by the borrower for three of the
components and ranged from 11% to 36%. The current estimate of the economic rate
of return is about 21% for the investments which were undertaken, the same as the
appraisal estimate.
Lessons
10.         Experience with the project suggests that restructuring of the export
trade in fruit and vegetables is likely to occur as a result of natural evoJution
in the private sector, and the public sector is not likely to have much influence
over its development. Bank support might be provided through credit programs,
but only on terms which are similar to those of other credit programs.   In
general, projects must be implemented in a policy framework which is conducive
to their success. Finally, a flexible approach to implementation of a project
is of great importance in achieving the maximum success possible, given the
environment.

Name:       Fruit and Vegetable Export Project
Loan:       1988-CY of $14 million
RVP Unit:   Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region
Country:    Cyprus
Sector:     Agriculture
Subsectors: Production, Marketing
Background
1.          The Government's primary objectives in the agricultur? sector were
to raise farm incomes and employment (agriculture accounted for 22% of total
employment), reduce migration to cities, and increase exports (agriculture
provided 402 of total exports). These objectives were to be achieved through
increasing the output, and improving the quality, of commodities and processed
products, particularly those for export, by optimizing use of limited natural
resources (especially water) and introducing improved technology. The efficiency
of marketing alsc was to be raised, in both domestic and export markets.
Agricultural exports were highly concentrated in the UK (which absorbed
proportions of exports ranging from 1002 of carrots to 85% of potatoes, 65% of
citrus and 50% of wine), and there was a need to diversify by expanding exports
to continental EEC countries, CMEA countries. and the Middle East. However, the
export industry was geaerally fragmented, anL arge exporters were needed to meet
the heavy competition in continental EEC coun-.ries and undertake the sizable
initial investments required for market pene:ration.
2.          The Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (FVFP) was to heln meet these
objectives by raistng the output and quality of exportable produce, in part
through more efficient use of water resources. In addition, exports would be
increased through changing the timing of production in order i:o exploit seasonal
supply shortages in export markets, and through reorganization of the
horticultural export industry.

Qbjectivee and DescriRtion
3.          The main objectives of the project were  to  I) strengthen and
reorganize the horticultural export production and marketing system, 2) increase
production of out-of-season vegetables and seasonally-shifted fruit for export,
and 3) upgrade wine production to meet changed consumer preferences in export
markets. These objectives were to be achieved through investments in on-farm
development, processing and marketing facilities. and support services, and
through reorganization of the export marketing industry. The content of these
componente is summarized below.
a) On-farm development was to consist of approximately 600 greexoiouses
and "walk-in" tunnels for out-of-season vegetables and flowers,   225
greenhouces for early table grapes, 6000 donums1 of fruit tree plantations
(mainly citrus with some avocadoes and deciduous fruit), 15,000 donums of
vine replanting (bulldozers and vehicles would be provided for land
development), and 9000 donums of water use improvement (mini-sprinklers,
etc.).
b) Processing and marketing facilities would include tswo central grading
and packing facilities plus some small rural packing stations and a small
auction/packing iacility near Larnaca airport, road transport equipment
for exporting to Arab countries, and three vintage wineries (to be built
in the vine replanting areas).
c)   Support  services would  involve project  administration  and  the
strengthening of horticultural research and extension through the
recruitment of additional staff, provision of training, and acquisition of
equipment.
d) Reorganization of export marketing would include the formation of a
Horticultural Export Development Advisory and Coordinating Committee
(HEDACC), consolidation of small exporters into trade partnerships, %nd
export promotion (involving the development of a generic brand, marketing
trials, etc.).
Des ian and Organizat ion
4.          The design of the project seems generally appropriate in the context
of the preparation/appraisal perspective, although difficulties were encountered
with the credit program and the export marketing component.  The Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) was redponsible for the technical
aspects of on-farm development, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry was
responsible for the marketing component, and credit funds were channeled through
the Cooperative Central Bank (CCB).   Project credit, which was to carry an
interest rate of at least 7Z, had to compete with other credit programs with
easier terms.   On the marketing side, the coordination functions within and
between the public and private sectors assigned to HEDACC may not have been
feasible to implement, particularly assigning the committee to coordinate the
' 7.5 donums - 1 ha.

actions of many small exporters and their interactions with the public sector.
Apparently the restructuring of the fruit and vegetable export trade through the
consolidation of the large number of small exporters into a few trade
partnerships was generally supported within the Government and among the
exporters, and two trade partnerships were reported to be in the process of
formation at the time of appraisal. However, previous efforts of exporters to
join forces had not been successful, and the project's reliance on voluntary
collaboration among exporters also foundered.
Imiplementatiun
5.          The project was implemented in a changing environment which caused
problems of adjustment, and it faced competition from other sources of financing.
At the production level, credit was available to farmers through other Government
programs at lower interest rates and through local cooperatives in larger
amounts, at substantially lruer transaction costs, and with easier security
requirements (no mortgage needed) than the credit provided under the project.
In addition, some of the project investments were financed under bilateral
programs. The growth of tourism (which was recognized at appraisal but which
accelerated subsequently) raised domestic demand and resulted in prices which
competed with those available in foreign markets. It also drained human and
financial resources from primary production.   Exports also were affected by
constraints in air freight capacity. Finally, the project was implemented during
a time of increasing budget constraints.
6.          In light of these factors, it was agreed at the beginning of 1985
that the Bank would work with the Government in restructuring the project to
accommodate the changed environment and focus on those elements of the project
which had good prospects for success. A bank mission was mounted in mid-1985 to
participate in the restructuring exercise.  Recommendations were prepared which
were reviewed and adopted by Government and subsequently agreed with the Bank.
The modifications involved a substantial reduction in the size of the project
(particularly in the on-farm development component), expansion of the project
area, inclusion of cooperative loans, and alteration of the marketing component
(refrigeration systems replaced packing ficilities). Because of the reduced size
of the project, US$7.5 million (54%) of the loan was cancelled in July 1986.
This flexible approach to implementaition of tbe project contributed substantially
to the partial success of the project as finally implemented.
7.          The production component of the project met with some success, in
spite of the difficulties with the credit arrangements. Most of the effective
project demand was for vegetable and flower greenhouses and water use
improvement, while some was for vineyard replanting and little was for table
grape greenhouses and fruit tree establishment.   Some 527 greenhouses for
vegetables/flowers were constructed under the project, or 88% of the 600 foreseen
at appraisal. A total of 6742 donums benefitted from water use improvement, or
752 of the appraisal estimate of 9000 donums. Vineyard replanting was undertaken
on 5354 donums, amounting to 36% of the 15,000 donums expected at appraisal.
Only 9 table grape greenhouses were established, or 4% of the 225 estimated at
appraisal, and 106 donums of fruit trees were established, or 2% of the 6000
donums expected at appraisal.



- 4 -
8.          All production categories were affected by the czedit available from
other sources at more favorable terms, but the demand for some types of
investment was high enough that the other funds were not adequate and a
substantial amount of investment was implemented under the project. In the case
of table grape greenhouses, total demand may have been affected by the
restriction of shipments by exporters in 1983, in an attempt to maintain high
prices, and the resulting substitution of suppliers from other countries in
ixport markets. The demand for financing of fruit tree establishment appears to
have been particularly affected by the availability of credit from other sources.
In 1983, for example, 1200 donums were reported to have been planted in the
districts of Paphos and Limassol, while only 59 donums were established under the
project. The replanting of vineyards was affected by the slow implementation of
the vintage wineries  (see below).   (The replanting was to be in improved
varieties for supply to the vintage wineries.)
9.          The processing and marketing facilities component met with limited
success. Since neither of the trade partnerships was established (see below),
the two central grading and packing facilities were not constructed under the
project.   However, one of the large exporters did establish a large packing
facility with  other  financing.    When  it was  decided  that  refrigeration
(precooling) systems were needed to preserve produce at harvest, a consultant was
retained to prepare recommendations. This report was not completed until the end
of 1988. Of the three vintage wineries to be constructed under the project, only
one was eventually implemented and was to start operations during 1989 (although
five others were established outside the project). One of the problems with the
wineries was that attempts were made to allow all farmers in a village to
participate by supplying grapes to the winery. In this case, the winery would
not be able to select only high quality grapes and produce a high grade wine.
The transport 2quipment for export of produce to the Arab countries was not
purchased.
10.         Implementation of the support aervices component was mixed, and was
affected by the Agricultural Research and Extension Project (AREP), which began
in 1986 and incorporated the remaining research and extension activities of FVEP.
Of the 4 research specialists and 2 extension officers which were proposed for
FVEP, only one extension officer was recruited.   Delavs were encountered in
obtaining approval for the remainder, and overall staffing requirements for
extension were considered under the subsequent project. Training exceeded the
target but was financed with bilateral funds.   The planned vehicles were
purchased. In the case of research, training was also funded through bilateral
sources. The model winery at Limassol was expanded as planned.
11.         Reorganization of export marketing did not occur to any appreciable
extent. HEDACC was established and met frequently during the initial project
period, but it was not able to exert much influence on private exporters and
eventually stopped functioning. Although two trade partnerships reportedly were
being formed at the time of appraisal, neither was actually established. The
concultants retained to prepare an export marketing strategy recommended in mid-
1984 that a producer marketing board be established for table grapes, that
vegetable exports to Europe become the responsibility of the existing Potato
Marketing Board, and that an export marketing company be formed for citrus, but
these recommendations were not accepted by Government at the time. There was



disagreement among exporters about whether a national brand name should be
introduced, and what it should be, and it was not until the end of 1988 that such
a brand name was adopted.
12.         The actual cost of the project as estimated by the borrower was about
CL 5.7 million (US$11.3 million), or only half of the CL 11.4 million (US$32.9
million) estimated at appraisal. The lower cost reflects the reduction in the
on-farm development component as a result of the impact of competing credit
programs, the financing of some equipment for vine replanting and of training
with bilateral funds and the consequent exclusion from the borrower's estimate
of project cost, and the financing of village wineries with other sources of
funds and their exclusion from the project cost estimate.   The structure of
financing was considerably different from that expected at appraisal.   Bank
financing of only US$2.8 million was utilized, in comparison with the original
loan amount of US$14.0 million and the revised loan amount of US$6.5 million, as
a result of the factors mentioned above.
Results
13.         The overall objective of the project to strengthen and reorganize the
horticultural export production and marketing system was achieved to some extent
on the production side but to little extent on the marketing side. As noted
above, the flexible approach to implementation, resulting in the restructuring
of the project, contributed to this partial success. The project did promote the
expansion and restructuring of production, although its effect was constrained
by the competition from other credit programs and the restrictions on the
capacity of the extension service.  However, the growth in domestic demand
(resulting in particular from the expansion of tourism) absorbed the additional
output, and the project had little impact on direct exports. For the sector as
a whole, the supply of exportable horticultural produce seems to have been
constrained by farm labor shortages, and inadequate air freight capacity
contributed to poor export performance. The consultant recommendations on export
marketing seem to have been taken into consideration by MCI in subsequent
actions.   (For example,  in mid-1989, the Government was in the process of
preparing legislation for table grapes that would result, inter alia, in the
formation of a marketing board.) Citrus production and marketing continued to
be dominated by large, vertically-integrated firms.   The vegetable export
industry remained fragmented for the most part, perhaps affected by the low
volume of exports.
14.         The objective of upgrading the country's wine production to meet
changed consumer preferences seems to have been achieved to some extent, although
the indirect impact of the project may have been greater than the direct effect.
Only one village winery was established under the project, but the example of
this winery and the support provided by the model winery may have influenced the
establishment of the five additional village wineries during the project period.
15.         Financial rates of return (FRRs) have been re-estimated by the
borrower for three ot the cr-mponents. The current and appraisal estimates are,
respectively, 36% and 22% for greenhouses (vegetables), 11% and 22% for citrus
plantations, and 19% and 25% for the vintage winery. Thus the high demand for
greenhouse financing seems to have been justified by the high return, while the



- 6 -
lw return for citrus perhaps was reflected in the low demand. (The substantial
investments in citrus plantations which were reported to have occurred outaide
the project may have been influenced by the subsidized financing provided under
other credit programs.) The borrower did not re-estimate the economic rate of
return (ERR) for the project, but based on a comparison of the weighted (by
investment cost) average of current estimates of FRRs with the weighted average
of FRRs for the same investments estimated at appraisal, and considering that
current price relationships are approximately the same as at appraisal, it is
likely that the current estimate of the ERR i^ above the 212 estimated at
appraisal for the investments which were undertaken.
Sustainabilitv
16.         The project had an impact on the production side, although not to the
extent anticipated for the reasons explained above. This impact will continue
during the useful life of the investments. On the marketing side, based on the
experience in the citrus industry, it might be expected that export marketing of
fruits and vegetables will sort itself out through the emergence of large
exporters and that Cyprus will continue to export to the extent that supplies are
available. Thus marketing seems to have developed, and is likely to continue to
develop, on the basis of a natural evolution of the private sector.  The six
vintage wineries which have been established are reported to be producing good
quality wines. It is not clear whether the wines will find success in export
markets, but the project seems to have had a significant impact on the
development to date, through the improvement of the model winery and the
establishment of the initial vintage winery.  Thus the shift to high quality
wines may be successful over the longer term.
Bank Performance
17.         The Bank devoted considerable resources to preparation, appraisal,
and supervision of the project.   (Marketing specialists were utilized in all
phases, but probably could have been employed to a greater extent during
supervision.)    The  appraisal  team presumably  could not  have  known  that
substantial amounts of credit would be provided under Government programs at more
favorable terms, although frequent experiences of this type in various countries
should cause the Bank to ensure that there is reasonable consistency among terms
of credit programs for similar purposes, in the case of future operations. The
growth of tourism was recognized at the time of appraisal, but it probably could
not have been foreseen that this growth would accelerate dramatically and have
a major impact on both the demand for fruits/vegetables and on the supply of
labor for farms. The history of failed attempts at cooperation among exporters
suggests that a marketing approach based on trade partnerships was unlikely to
succeed, although the reported movement toward formation of such partnerships at
the t'me of appraisal may have led the Government and the Bank to believe that
this approach was feasible.   However, when it became apparent that various
factors would preNent implementation of the project as originally designed, the
Bank collaborated with the Government to restructure the project and allow it to
succeed in those activities which could be implemented.



7-
Borrower Performance
18.         The Government took responsibility for preparation of the project,
and did so with assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Programme and in close
cooperation with the Bank.   During implementation,  there was some lack of
coordination between MANR and MCI, but it did not seem to have a major
detrimental effect on execution. Of perhaps greater importance, and with wider
implications for agricultural development in Cyprus, was the limited
strengthening of extension.   Although the project effort in extension was
subsumed in AREP, the extension component did not fare well under that project,
either, and the extension service remains understaffed and underfunded.   Of
direct consequence for the project was the Government's support of subsidizeA
credit programs with more favorable terms for borrowers than the project credit
program. This situation reduced the project's impact on production considerably.
At the time of appraisal, some Government officials had misgivings about the
proposed consolidation of exporters into trading partnerships, but all agreed
that the development of larger exporters was necessary, and the decision was to
proceed with the partnership approach.   When implementation of the original
project proved impractical, the Government restructured the project with Bank
assistance, thus allowing it to achieve limited success.
Proiect Relationships
19.         The project was formulated and implemented in a spirit of cooperation
among all the parties involved.
Consulting Services
20.         A specialist was retained to assist HEDACC in developing an export
marketing strategy, but he focussed on the practical aspects of export marketing
and apparently was helpful to HEDACC and exporters in this respect. A consultant
firm was  employed  to prepare  a proposed marketing  strategy.   While  the
recommendations were not accepted at the time, they appear to have been
considered by the Government in developing subsequent measures to promote export
marketing of horticultural Droducts.   Another consultant firm was hired to
prepare proposals for the introduction of precooling systems, but the report was
not completed until 1989 and the quality of the recommendations is not known.
Prolect Documentation and Data
21.         The loan documents for the project were satisfactory.  MCI and MANR
staff were responsive to the Bank's request to prepare a completion report, as
provided for in the Loan Agreement, and were most cooperative in preparing the
report within a reasonable period of time.   Their efforts were particularly
commendable because most project staff were shifted to other duties as the
project period drew to a close, and those who prepared the report did so in
addition to carrying out other pressing responsibilities. Thus the report was
prepared for the Bank, rather than for the use of the Government, and as such is
not as useful to the Government as it might be. The report gave the project
staff an opportunity to make recommendations on the Government's role and future
actions in horticultural export marketing on the basis of the project experience,
but this opportunity was largely missed. The data on project execution were not



- 8 -
complete but were reasonable, considering the circumstances surrounding the
preparation of the borrower's report.

PART II: Proiect Review from Borrower's Persvective2
Desitn
22.         The Borrower Completion Report (BCR) offers little comment on the
design of the production component of the project, except to note that there was
competition from other sources of credit for on-farm investments with easier
terms, with implications described above (para. 5). With regard to the marketing
component, the BCR suggests that the project failed to take into consideration
that previous efforts to consolidate small exporters had not been successful,
although  it  acknowledges  that  the  necessity  for  such  consolidation  was
universally agreed at the time of appraisal.
Imnlementation
23.         The description of project implementation in the BCR is generally in
accord with that given above (paras. 5-11). On the production side, particular
emphasis is placed on the impact of subsidized credit available from other
sources, and the BCR also suggests that the failure of the marketing component
had an adverse effect on farm investment. The training program in horticultural
research and extension was considered a success, although it was not financed
with project loa.a funds. The viniculture element of the project was also judged
to be a success, with the upgrading of the model winery and the establishment of
six village wineries.   The general failure of the marketing component is
acknowledged in the BCR. As indicated above, it suggests that the expectation
on the consolidation of small exporters was unrealistic, in the light of past
experience. The BCR notes that a national brand name was finally adopted in 1988
and that a decision was taken to promote investments in pre-cooling facilities.
Finally, the BCR indicates that the Government decided not to request a further
extension of the closing date because it found the terms of the Bank loan to be
unattractive.   It cites the cross-currency risk resulting from the pooling
system, the high level of the fixed interest rate, and lack of adjustment of the
repayment schedule.
2 The Borrower did not respond to the Bank's request to prepare Part II.
Therefore this section was written by the Bank on the basis of the Borrower
Completion Report, prepared by MCI and MANR. The report is largely descriptive
and focusses on actual implementation in relation to targets.

Develovment Imipact
24.         In terms of the production component, the BCR notes that the number
of beneficiaries and the area developed were below appraisal estimates.   It
provides little comment on the results of the on-farm investments actually
undertaken, but it does give the re-estimates of the farm models, cited above
(para. 14), which indicate that greenhouses for vegetables and flowers are
producing substantial returns to farmers, while citrus plantations are generating
only marginal returns.   The BCR also suggests that the village wineries are
producing good quality wines, and the re-estimate of the winery model indicates
that they are reaping satisfactory returns (para. 14). By implication, the model
winery is expected to continue to have a beneficial effect on wine production.
In the case of marketing, the BCR acknowledges that the impact of the project has
been minimal to date. It does not offer any prognostication on the development
of the strLcture of the vegetable export marketing system, but it implies that
the adoption of a national brand name and the introduction of pre-cooling systems
will have a favorable impact on exports.
Bank and Borrower Performance
25.         The BCR does not make any comment on Bank or Borrower performance,
or on the relationship between Bank and Borrower during the project cycle.
