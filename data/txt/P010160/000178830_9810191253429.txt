PAKISTAN
ON-FARM WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Islamic Republic of Pakistan covers an area of 197 M ac in the
four Provinces of Baluchistan, North West Frontier (NWFP), Punjab and Sind.
The population is estimated at 80 M and growing at a rate of about 3% per
annum. About 74% of the population resides in the rural areas.
1.02      Average per capita income is about US$270 per annum and is growing
at an annual rate of 3%. About 30% of the population is estimated to have
annual income below US$135 per capita, which is the estimated absolute poverty
level for FY1978/79.
1.03      Agriculture is the single largest sector in Pakistan's economy.  It
accounts for about 30% of the GDP, employs about 55% of the 23 M labor force,
and provides about 70% of the nation's export earnings. In FY80, agricultural
exports exceeded by over US$550 M the value of agriculture-related imports for
fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, wheat, edible oil, tea, etc.
Agricultural Performance and Policies
1.04      Agricultural production grew substantially in the late 1960s, averag-
ing about 6% per year. This growth slowed to little over 2% annually in the
early to mid-1970s. A series of adverse developments caused this disappoint-
ing performance: political turmoil in FY71 and FY72, a succession of floods
and droughts during the period 1973-76, and a sharp increase in the price of
imported oil since 1974. Institutional factors also contributed to this poor
showing, mainly, weaknesses in agricultural supporting services, and worsening
terms of trade for agricultural products. A major factor preventing higher
agricultural production has been the uncertainty of irrigation water supplies
coupled with inefficiencies in the irrigation system. Agricultural production,
however, increased from 2.5% in FY78 to 7.3% in FY80. Much of this recovery
could be attributed to favorable weather conditions, however there are signs
that improvements in GOP's price support policies, and increased supply of
fertilizer are beginning to take effect.
1.05      During the last three decades, GOP's agricultural policies stressed:
(a) large water sector projects (Tarbela and Mangla Dams, link canals, and
salinity control and drainage projects); (b) food and input subsidies (wheat,
edible oil, tubewells, water charges, fertilizer and pesticides); and (c)
support pricing policy. However, some essential requirements for agricultural
development such as field oriented research, training and extension programs,
water management, and operation and maintenance of the existing irrigation



-2-
system were severely neglected. This unbalanced approach, even though accom-
panied by substantial investments, was a major factor in retarding agricultural
growth during the late 1960s and through the mid-1970s.
1.06      In recent months, GOP has been modifying its agricultural policies,
which among other things place greater emphasis on water management. On July
24, 1980, the National Board for Irrigated Agriculture Planning and Development
generally adopted the major recommendations given in the draft report "Revised
Action Program (RAP) for Irrigated Agriculture" (May 1979). 1/ RAP proposed
a strategy to increase agricultural production through projects and programs
with high rates of return and quick yielding benefits. It emphasized rehabil-
itation of the existing irrigation system (deferred maintenance), improvement
in water management, the turning over of public tubewell operation to farmers;
elimination of subsidies for fertilizer, pesticides, and tubewells, and the
need to strengthen irrigation and agricultural agencies. Furthermore, it
recommended that investments in large infrastructural water sector improvement
be generally delayed until later in the investment period (1983-90). GOP's
Five Year Plan (1978-83) states, "A substantial beginning will be made on
improved water management in the system as a whole, as well as on the farms."
It allocated Rs 928 M to improve some 8,600 watercourses and undertake land
levelling on about 415,000 ac. Also in correspondence to IDA dated August 23,
1980, GOP's Minister of Finance indicated that water management projects would
have high priority in Pakistan's future investment program.
Physical and Demographic Features
1.07      Climate.  Pakistan is located in the temperature zone.  The climate
is arid to semi-arid and subtropical. The temperature in most cultivable
areas allows for all-year cultivation, with temperatures reaching 450 C
in May and June. Rainfall varies seasonally and annually and is strongly
influenced by monsoon currents (June through September) from tropical depres-
sions originating in the Bay of Bengal. Annual rainfall is less than 150 mm
over much of the Indus Plains, whereas pan evaporation varies from 1,250 mm
to 2,800 mm, making irrigation a requirement for agricultural production in
this area. Even so, heavy rainfall does occur during some monsoon seasons
causing heavy flood damage to property and crops, and loss of human lives.
In recent times, the 1973 and 1976 floods caused damage in excess of US$1,000
M, which resulted in two successful IDA Flood Rehabilitation and Restoration
Projects (Cr. 466-PAK and 683-PAK).
1.08      Water.  Total annual rainfall in the Indus Plain's cultivable com-
manded area is about 25 maf with about 50% effectiveness. The total annual
Indus River inflow is about 150 maf. Quality of this surface water is excel-
lent for irrigation with total dissolved solids (TDS) running between 100 to
200 ppm in the upper basin and 150 to 350 ppm in the lower Indus. There are
vast amounts of groundwater underlying the Indus Plain. To a depth of 40 m,
47% of the Indus Plain has groundwater with TDS of less than 1,000 ppm and
1/   Prepared by the Perspective Planning Division of the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) with financing by UNDP and World Bank as
executing agency.



-3-
69% less than 3,000 ppm. 1/ Groundwater pumpage (160,000 private and 10,000
public tubewells) amounts to about 33 maf annually. Of the approximately 200
maf of water available to the Indus Plain, only about 67 maf is available to
crops because of unavoidable losses and poor water management (see Plate
I-Schematic Drawing of Indus Plain Water Balance).
1.09       Soils.  The soils of the Indus Plain are generally deep river allu-
vium deposits of a calcareous nature. About 85% of the soils' texture is
moderately coarse to moderately fine and are well suited to irrigated agri-
culture. The pH generally runs from 8 to 8.5 with nitrogen, phosphorous and
organic matter being generally low and potassum in ample supply. As shown in
Table 1.1, some 78% of these soils have been classified as having Class I or
II capability.

1.10       A 21.5 M ac soil salinity survey of the Indus Plain, undertaken for
RAP in the late 1970s, found substantial improvement in surface and profile
salinity as compared to information from a similar survey made in the early
1960s. Much of this improvement can be attributed to the leaching effect of
additional water supplies, both surface and groundwater, delivered to the
irrigated areas. The 1970 survey determined that about 60% of the soils were
salt free, 9% saline, 4% sodic and 26% saline sodic. Soil salinity in the
lower basin is more of a problem, where only 31% of the soils in Sind and
Baluchistan are salt free. However, over 80% of the saline sodic soils
contained gypsum in the profile and would be readily reclamable by leaching.
Therefore, much of the soils appearing in Land Class III and IV in Table 1.1
could be upgraded through a program of appropriate management practices.
1.11       Land Use.  Culturable canal commanded area (cca), that can be irri-
gated for at least one full cropping season includes about 34.5 M ac of land
of which 5 M ac is classified as culturable waste. An additional 20 M ac
of cultivated land are watered by other irrigation systems, rain (barani),
flood moisture (sailaba), isolated irrigation systems, and groundwater and
about 28 M ac are in range and forest lands. The remaining 119 M ac are made
up of deserts, mountains and open water (see Table 1.2 for more details on
land-use).
1/   Water with TDS less than 1000 ppm generally considered acceptable quality
for irrigating crops.

1.12      Farm Size.  As shown in Table 1.3, the majority or 68% of the 3.76 M
farms in Pakistan are under 12.5 ac, but they cover only 30% of the total 49 M
ac farmland. Another 29% of the farms of the size of 12.5 to 50 ac hold 46%
of the total farmland, and the remaining 3% of farms over 50 ac in size occupy
24% of the total farmland. The Land Reform Act of 1972 limited holdings of
irrigated land to 150 ac and this was further reduced in 1977 to 100 ac.

1.13      Land Tenure.  Among the 3.76 M farms in Pakistan, 42% or 1.56 M are
owner-operated, 34% or 1.29 M are tenant operated, and 24% or 0.89 M are
mixed owner and tenant operated.  A large portion (63%) of the farms in Sind
are tenant operated (Table 1.4).

Agricultural Production
1.14     Crop Production and Yields.  Wheat, rice, cotton, and sugarcane are
the major crops. Wheat grows in the dry season (rabi, mid-October to mid-April)
in both irrigated and barani areas. Rice and cotton are grown in the wet
season (kharif, mid-April to mid-October). Sugarcane is mainly planted or
ratooned in the spring and harvested 10 to 12 months later. About 74% of the
wheat and sugarcane production and 60% of the cotton comes from Punjab and 47%
of the rice is produced in Punjab and an equal amount of rice in Sind. Table
1.5 gives a summary of FY80 yields and production for the major crops.

1.15      With the large irrigation system, favorable climate for year-round
cropping, and generally good soils, crop yields should be quite high in
Pakistan. However, due mainly to constraints described in para 1.04, crop
yields are far below their potential with wheat yields of 0.5 mt/ac, rice 0.6,
cotton 0.1 and sugarcane 15.0 (Table 1.5). Based upon a 1977 Leading Farm
Survey, RAP estimated the potential national crop yields for wheat at 1.38
mt/ac, rice 1.50, cotton 0.28 and sugarcane 28.0. These potentials are
attainable through improved water management, extension services, and input
supplies of seeds, fertilizer, and pesticide. In most cases, crop yields are
not affected by any single factor, but rather by a combination and interaction
of several factors. However, production constraints are mostly waterlinked.
1.16      Cropping Intensities and Agro-Climatic Zones.  Cropping intensity
and cropping pattern vary with climate, soils, and particularly the availabil-
ity of water. Based on these variables and canal command boundaries, WAPDA
subdivided the irrigated area of the Indus Basin into seven agro-climatic
zones for RAP (para 1.06). Each zone is characterized by a major cropping
pattern as described in Table 1.6. The highest annual cropping intensity
(141%) was in the NWFP's mixed cropping zone and the lowest (65%) was in
Sind's rice-wheat zone reflecting soil salinity and flooding constraints.
In the Indus Plain, a reasonable target for cropping intensities would be
130% to 150%.

Agricultural Inputs and Services
1.17      Fertilizers.  Currently, fertilizer distribution is handled by both
public and private sectors. Recently, fertilizer off-take rates have grown at
about 20% annually and reached about 1,050 M nutrient mt in FY80. However, the
present fertilizer distribution system has inadequate storage below the tehsil
level and involves tedious procedures that are inadequate and eratic at times.
Under the Fertilizer Import Credit (Cr. 1068-PAK) GOP has agreed to: (a)
increase domestic production of nitrogenous and phosphorous fertilizer to
1,050,000 and 178,000 nutrient tons, respectively, by FY84, which would meet
about 75% of the domestic requirement; (b) improve the efficiency of the
distribution system; (c) strengthen the role of the private sector in both
production and distribution; and (d) phase out all fertilizer subsidies by
FY86.



- 8 -
1.18      Seeds.  Both the Federal and Provincial governments are engaged in
seed programs.  During FY79, only about 6% of the required wheat, rice and
cotton seeds was met with certified seeds. To improve the situation, GOP and
GO Provinces have launched a Seed Industry Development Project (Cr. 620-PAK)
with a target to meet 86% of the total certified seed requirement by FY83.
1.19      Plant Protection.  In February 1980, the responsibility for pesti-
cide distribution was transferred from the Extension Service to the private
sector and government subsidy on pesticides in Punjab and Sind was abolished.
Complete withdrawal of pesticide subsidy in Baluchistan and NWFP will be
completed by 1983.
1.20      Extension Service.  Each Province has an agricultural extension
system, although its operation to date has been quite ineffective. Generally,
a Director, reporting to the Provincial Secretary of Agriculture is in charge
of the Extension Service. There are Deputy Directors of Agriculture (DDA) at
Division level, Assistant Director of Agriculture (ADA) at District level and
Agricultural Officer (AO) as well as Field Assistants (FA) at Tehsil level.
Each AO supervises about 10 FAs with each FA programmed to service about 1,000
farm families. Because of a shortage of trained FAs, many FAs are now servic-
ing about 2,000 farm families. To improve the effectiveness of current exten-
sion programs, IDA has recently funded two projects to introduce the Training
and Visits (T&V) System in Punjab (Cr. 813-PAK) and in Sind (Cr.922-PAK).
The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved
these projects on February 10, 1981. The Punjab Project is now effective and,
inter alia, covers three districts (Sargodha, Sheikhupura and Vehari) of the
project appraised in this report. The Sind Project is scheduled to become
effective by June 30, 1981 and covers all of the districts that would be
benefitted by this project.
1.21      Agricultural Credit.  Agricultural credit in Pakistan is provided
from a variety of sources, including the Federal Bank of Cooperatives (FBC),
the four Provincial Cooperative Banks (PCB), the Agricultural Development Bank
of Pakistan (ADBP) and Commercial Banks (CB). The FBC, PCB and CB provide
mainly short-term credit and limited amount of medium-term credit. ADBP
provides mainly medium and long-term credit. Mandatory lending targets for
these institutions are prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and
reviewed by the National Credit Consultive Council. SBP subsequently monitors
the performance of the institutions on achieving these targets. During FY80,
agricultural credit amounted to Rs 2.3 billion of which about 45% was financed
by Commercial Banks, 30% by ADBP and the balance 25% by the Cooperative Banks.
GOP plans to double total agricultural credit during FY81. To cope with
such drastic expansion of agricultural lending targets, CBs and ADBP have
developed a supervised agricultural credit scheme whereby mobile credit units
are stationed at the village level and staffed with trained agriculturalists.
Short and medium-term credit are provided in kind. In 1978, IDA approved the
Fourth Credit for ADBP (Cr. No. 957-PAK) for US$40 M, with the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) financing an additional US$30 M.
These credit would mainly finance investments in minor irrigation, mechaniza-
tion and on-farm development. Beneficiaries of this project would be able to
obtain loans for OFWM practices on their individual farms as well as for
communal on-farm development investments.

II. IRRIGATION AND WATER MANAGEMENT
2.01      Because of low rainfall, and high temperature and evapotranspiration
(para 1.07), irrigation is required for most agricultural production in
Pakistan. Irrigation is undertaken on about 75% of the cropped area (Table
1.2) and contributes about 90% of the Nation's total agricultural production.
Since the Indus Irrigation System makes up about 86% of the irrigated area
in Pakistan, and unless otherwise stated, reference to irrigation in this
report will refer to the Indus System.
Indus Irrigation System
2.02      The Indus Irrigation System (34.5 M ac cca) is the largest conti-
guous irrigation system in the world. It comprises the Indus and its major
tributaries, three major storage reservoirs, 19 barrages/headworks, 43 canal
commands and some 89,000 chaks (para 2.03). The total length of canals is
about 56,000 km, with watercourses, farm channels and ditches running another
1.6 million km in length (see Plate II - Indus System). The first controlled
all-year irrigation began in 1859 with completion of the Upper Bari Doab Canal
from Madhapur Headworks on the Ravi River. The design of the canal system
evolved to fit the availability of water supplies in the river and to meet the
objective of bringing to maturity the largest area of crops with the minimum
consumption of water. Land holdings in the Punjab canal colonies were laid
out on a grid system of 25 ac squares, whereas in the other Provinces land
holdings were of highly irregular shape, which complicated the laying out of
the distribution system.
2.03     In each canal command, the lowest order command is called a chak.
These chaks vary in size from 200 to 700 ac (average about 450 ac), each
covering about 20 to 50 farms (average about 35). Flow in the chak distribu-
tary system which is called a watercourse, is governed by an open outlet or
"mogha" designed to pass a constant discharge that self adjusts in proportion
to flows in the parent canal (see IBRD 15554 - Typical Watercourse Layout).
Planned discharges from moghas vary from one to three cusecs to enable effi-
cient handling by individual farmers. The distribution of water within a
chak is by a time rotation called "warabandi" with each farmer holding a
specific time period in proportion to the size of his holdings. Flow is
diverted to various branches of the watercourse by constructing earth dams at
junctions, and to farm fields by cutting the banks of the watercourse. These
cuts are called "katcha nuccas." The boundaries of the chak and alignment
of the communal watercourse channel or "sarkari khal" are established by the
Provincial Departments of Irrigation. These Departments also establish the
official warabandi schedule.
2.04      The construction, operation,and maintenance of the sarkari khal and
other irrigation channels in the chak are the responsibility of the farmers.
Because of poor farmer cooperation and inadequate technical assistance,
these watercourses have deteriorated, resulting in excessive delivery losses.
Hence, farmers in the mid and tail reaches generally receive considerably
less water than their planned share. The 1863 Canal and Drainage Act provides
sanctions for the Department of Irrigation to assure adequate maintenance of
the watercourses by the farmers, but rarely has it been enforced.

Water Management Research and Investigations
2.05      In 1973, the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) under-
took a water management research project at the Mona Reclamation Experiment
Station (MRES). This project was funded by USAID with expatriate research
staff provided by Colorado State University (CSU). Repeated "inflow-outflow"
loss measurements by MRES determined that watercourse conveyance loss rates
ranged between 31-57%, with the heaviest losses in Salinity Control and
Reclamation Project (SCARP) areas where watercourses had not been adequately
remodelled to carry the additional water provided by publicly financed and
operated tubewells. A field survey of 40 sample chaks in Punjab and Sind
was carried out by MRES in 1976. Results indicated that conveyance losses
in these sample watercourses ranged between 35-67%, with a weighted mean
conveyance losses of about 53%. The average irrigation efficiency in these
chaks was about 42%. 1/
2.06      To further ascertain the irrigation efficiency of chaks in Pakistan,
the Perspective Planning Division of WAPDA, as part of RAP studies, carried
out spot measurements on 61 selected watercourses (Punjab 35, Sind 20, NWFP 5
and Baluchistan 1) during kharif and rabi seasons in FY77. The results
indicated: (a) about 40% of the water entering watercourses was lost before
reaching the field; and (b) Provincial chak irrigation efficiencies were 37%
for Sind, 42% Baluchistan, 46% NWFP, and 51% Punjab, with little variation in
kharif and rabi seasons. Based on 1973/74 irrigation deliveries, RAP studies
found that at the above efficiencies, about 40 maf more water would be required
for delivery at the watercourse inlet (mogha) to meet crop water requirement
than if efficiencies were increased to 65% attainable through watercourse
limited lining and improvements being made in the Pilot OFWM Project (paras
2.07 to 2.10). These same studies indicated that although water deliveries
exceeded crop requirement during some periods, deliveries fell considerably
short during periods of peak requirements. Another RAP study concluded that
the cost per acre foot of water saved through watercourse improvement is about
25% of the cost for developing new water supplies. 2/
Pilot On-Farm Water Management (OFWM) Project
2.07      Based upon the finding of MRES, and encouraged by farmer response
to watercourse improvement technologies developed at MRES, GOP and USAID
agreed to a five-year (1976-80) nationwide OFWM Pilot Project. A USAID
development loan of US$7.5 M was made in FY77. The project was executed
by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives through a Federal Water
Management Cell with implementation by OFWM Directorates within each Provin-
cial Departments of Agriculture. An innovative and successful approach was the
provision that the farmers would supply all unskilled labor for construction
of civil works. In turn, GOP supplied all materials, technical assistance,
and 50% subsidy for precision land levelling (PLL).
1/   Chak irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of water stored in
the plant root zone to water supplied to the chak.

and Perspective Plan," November 1977.



- 11 -
2.08      Field implementation was carried out by field teams assigned to the
Provincial OFWM Directorates. Up to May 1980, a total of 55 Field Teams had
been organized (Punjab 30, Sind 15, Baluchistan 7, and NWFP 3). Three train-
ing institutes were established at Lahore, Hyderabad and Peshawar to give
specialized training to OFWM personnel and officials of cooperating agencies.
The University of Agriculture at Faisalabad offered a special four and one-half
month training program for Agricultural Officers (AO) and for instructors at
each Provincial training institute. ALL OFWM training includes classroom as
well as field work.
2.09      The Pilot Project's five-year physical targets were:
(a) 1,300 Watercourses to be improved with compacted earth
banks and limited (10%) hard material lining, and con-
crete control structures called "pucca nuccas" (Plate IV);
(b) 431,500 ac of land to be precisely levelled (+ 2 cm
deviation from average field elevation); and
(c) 40,000 farms to adopt improved water management practices.
Although there were significant differences between the planned targets and
actual accomplishments, as shown in Table 2.1, GOP officials have been well
satisfied with these achievements because of: (a) pilot nature of the project
and numerous "start up" problems; (b) farmers' enthusiastic acceptance of
project; (c) increased awareness in Pakistan of need for water management; and
(d) accelerated accomplishments of project in latter years, i.e., as many
watercourses were improved (273) and land levelled (20,000 ac) during FY80
as in the first three years of the project.

2.10      The major problems faced by the project included:
(a) Shortage of graduate level personnel;
(b) Inadequate training facilities at the three training insti-
tutes (Punjab is just completing a fine new facility at
Lahore);



- 12 -
(c) Deterioration of improved watercourses due to inadequate
maintenance by farmers;
(d) Shortage of skilled extension workers capable of extending
advisory assistance to farmers;
(e) Inadequate funds for procurement of required materials;
and,
(f) Diversion of Provincial Annual Development Program (ADP)
Funds to other projects.
Accelerated Watercourse Cleaning Program (Punjab)
2.11       Recognizing the time involved to spread benefits from the Pilot
Project to all chaks, the Government of Punjab, in FY80, initiated a "Crash
Program" for heavy cleaning of watercourses. The technology was developed at
MRES and the program, under the direction of the Deputy Commissioners, used
farmer donated labor, existing infrastructure, and personnel from the Depart-
ments of Agriculture, Irrigation, IRDP, Cooperatives, and Martial Law Adminis-
tration. About 9,800 watercourses were cleaned, which was a very impressive
accomplishment. By April 30, 1980, about 7,500 Cooperative Societies were
organized on cleaned watercourses to finance farmers' costs for installing
pucca nuccas. The Bank for Cooperatives provided the Societies with credit
for installing pucca nuccas, about Rs 250 per pucca nucca, however GO Punjab
paid the cost of the pre-cast pucca nuccas (about Rs 60 each) and the interest
charges on the loans. Because the technical responsibility for installing
the pucca nuccas was not assigned, and the lending workload for the Bank for
Cooperatives proved to be excessive, pucca nuccas were installed in only 150
of the heavily cleaned watercourses. Adequate provision was not made for
maintenance. Therefore, the benefits from heavy cleaning would probably be
limited to about two years.
Followup to Pilot Project and "Crash Program"
2.12       The USAID-financed Pilot Project is scheduled to be terminated on
December 31, 1981. Funds for civil works construction were exhausted by April
1981. Future USAID assistance to Pakistan is being reviewed by the new
Administration. In the meantime, because of the strong farmer support and
benefits from continuing such a program, GOP requested assistance from IDA for
an OFWM Project, building upon the experience of the Pilot Project and Punjab's
"Crash Program." Specifically, GOP has requested that such an IDA project be
scheduled to begin about July 1, 1981 so as to maintain the present momentum
of these ongoing projects.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed three-year (FY82 to FY84) OFWM Project would be imple-
mented in all four Provinces. The watercourse renovation program (para 3.05)
would be implemented in eleven irrigated districts in Punjab (Mianwali,
Sargodha, Vehari, Faisalabad, Bahawalnagar, Multan, Kasur, Sahiwal, Jhang,
Shaikhupura and Lahore), four in Sind (Hyderabad, Badin, Nawabshah and Sanghar),
and generally all of the irrigated areas of Baluchistan and NWFP (Maps IBRD
15555 to 15558). Specifically excluded are those areas covered by other
projects with OFWM components, mainly Khairpur II (Cr. 648-PAK), SCARP VI (Cr.
754-PAK) and SCARP Mardan (Cr. 877-PAK), as well as a recently negotiated
Asian Development Bank (ADB) project covering the Thal Command (Punjab) and
Paharpur area (NWFP). Project areas are generally the same as those now
served by field teams associated with the Pilot Project being phased out about
December 31, 1981 (para 2.12). The accelerated watercourse improvement
program (para 3.09) and precision land levelling program (para 3.11) would be
implemented in selected portions of Pakistan's total irrigated area.
Objectives and Approach
3.02      The project would boost agricultural production in Pakistan's four
Provinces through a program to increase the supply of irrigation water by
better water management. Basically, the project is a continuation, with
improvements, of the successful Pilot Project and the Accelerated Watercourse
Cleaning Program inaugurated in Punjab in FY80. The project has been identi-
fied by GOP as a high priority project in the Five Year Plan (FY78-83) (para
1.06).
3.03      The project has the following objectives:
(a) Increasing agricultural production by effective utilization
of irrigation water saved through improved water management
practices within individual chaks;
(b) Strengthening the capability of the On-Farm Water Management
Directorates in the Provincial Departments of Agriculture,
and the Federal Water Management Cell in the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture and Cooperatives to plan and implement an expanded
OFWM program;
(c) Improving water management technologies and institutional
arrangements including organization of formal and effective
Water Users Association (WUA);
(d) Facilitating the coordination and cooperation between the OFWM
Directorates and Extension Services in the Provincial Depart-
ments of Agriculture; and
(e) Serving as a transition model for future OFWM projects that
could be effectively replicated on all 89,000 watercourses
in Pakistan in 10 to 15 years.



- 14 -
3.04      The project is comprised of:  (a) civil works including:  (i) improve-
ments to the watercourse conveyance systems utilizing both a rapid coverage
approach emphasizing heavy cleaning (accelerated improvement) and a more
intense technology level (renovation); (ii) precision land levelling (PLL);
and (iii) demonstration plots; (b) training of OFWM and Extension Service
personnel, and WUA officials; and (c) supervision and administration including
technical assistance in the form of local supervisory consultants, and local
and expatriate experts.
Civil Works (Base Cost US$66.7 M, including US$23.1 M in farmers' donated labor)
3.05      The project would provide required materials, precast structures,
additional personnel, and equipment for construction of required civil works.
All civil works would be carried out in accordance with technical criteria
established in the "On-Farm Water Management National Standards for Practices
and Materials," Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives, GOP, June
1980, which is satisfactory to IDA. Because pucca nucca lids occasionally
chip or break, all manufacturers in each Province would be required to utilize
standard molds as determined by the OFWM Directorate. Each Province would be
encouraged to develop local manufacturers of precast pucca nuccas to reduce
transportation costs.
3.06      Watercourse Renovation (Base Cost US$36.4).  The watercourse renova-
tion program on about 2,000 watercourses would generally follow the technology
applied in the Pilot Project. This technology would result in an estimated
25% savings of water supplied to each chak. The sarkari khal, which has about
20% of the watercourse length, but involves nearly 85% of the channel usage,
would be rebuilt with clean, compacted soil (see Plate III). Pucca nuccas
(see Plate IV) would be installed (about one for each 10 ac) at junctions and
authorized outlets to reduce channel deterioration and water loss, and improve
water control. About four culverts would be installed at major crossings in
each watercourses, and check/drop structures, and a limited number of buffalo
baths would be installed as required. An average of 15% of the sarkari khal
in fresh groundwater (FGW) 1/ zones and 30% in saline groundwater (SGW)
zones would be lined with brick masonry or concrete to reduce water losses
and/or deterioration of the channels. The higher percentage hard lining in
SGW zones recognizes that deep percolated water in such areas is irretrievably
lost, whereas such losses in FGW zones becomes part of groundwater storage
available for subsequent pumpage (see Table 7.1 on economic evaluation of
watercourse models). Estimated lining costs are for double brick walls
(0.24 m thickness) now being installed. Criteria to be used by the field
teams as a guide in selecting reaches of the sarkari khals to be lined would
be sections:
1/   FGW defined as groundwater with TDS less than 1,000 ppm and SGW more
than 1,000 ppm in the upper 40 m of the aquifer. The RAP Main Report,
Chapter V, dated May 1979, would be used to establish fresh and saline
groundwater zones. Groundwater quality zones for Punjab and Sind are
shown in Maps IBRD 15556 and 15555.

(a)  having excessive water losses because of high seep-
age rates (permeable soils) and/or high usage;
(b)  passing through villages or other heavily trafficked
areas;
(c)  determined to be unstable because of elevation or
soil conditions; and
(d)  with severe siltation problems.
These criteria would generally result in head and village sections being lined.
3.07      In selecting watercourses to be renovated, preference would be given
to chaks with high potential for increased land and irrigation water produc-
tivity 1/ (chaks located in saline grotndwater areas or fresh groundwater areas
without access to tubewell water, see para 6.10), and to those chaks being
cultivated by low income farmers. The following criteria would be used as a
guide by field teams in selecting watercourses to be renovated:
(a)  Formally organized and registered Water Users Association
(required prior to installing pucca structures); and,
(c)  Willingness of the water users to improve their own water-
course branches and to maintain improvements. Improvements
on farmer's branches should be initiated prior to any pucca
installation.
Within these criteria, areas would be chosen where groups of 5 to 10 water-
courses could be improved at one time to increase the efficiency of the field
teams and reduce transportation costs.
3.08      The discharge of springs, karezes, and tubewells in Baluchistan is
often small (0.25 cusec or less) which results in high conveyance losses when
applied directly to the fields. Water storage tanks have proven beneficial
in reducing these losses by substantially increasing the flow rates. Hence,
the project provides for constructing 37 such tanks on renovated watercourses
in Baluchistan. These tanks would be of sufficient size to store 8 to 12
hours of inflow. They would be made of brick masonry walls with a low cost
bed such as polyethylene sheets or compacted clay.
3.09      Accelerated Watercourse Improvement (Base Cost US$26.5 M).  This
program would cover about 16,500 watercourses. The project provides for heavy
cleaning of watercourses and installing a limited number of structures. The
objective of this approach is to rapidly spread the benefit of water management
to a maximum number of farms. Estimated water savings would vary from about
6-8% of the water supplied to the watercourse depending upon the quality of
cleaning, follow-up maintenance, and number of pucca nuccas installed. The
improvement would include:
1/   Selection criteria would be revised as appropriate based on the findings
of the project's socio-economic evaluation (para 5.16).



- 16 -
(a)  Desilting the channels;
(b)  Removing brush and vegetation from the banks;
(c)  Strengthening, straightening and raising the banks where
required;
(d)  Restoring a relatively uniform channel cross-section; and
(e)  Restoring deteriorated junction areas.
3.10      To overcome the problem of installing pucca nuccas experienced in
the Punjab "crash program" (para 2.11), the Provincial OFWM Directorates would
be assigned this responsibility. Pucca nuccas would be installed in each
watercourse after the Directorates have approved the quality of completed
earthwork and a Water Users Association has been organized and registered.
The pucca nuccas would be sighted in by the OFWM staff at existing water
flow elevations. It is expected that an average of 12 pucca nuccas would
be installed at major junctions and two culverts at major crossings in each
improved watercourse in Punjab. An average of four pucca nuccas would be
installed in each improved watercourse in Baluchistan Province. No structures
would be installed in NWFP and the Sind.
3.11      Precision Land Levelling (PLL) (Base Cost US$3.6 M).  The technology
to be used for PLL would be the same as used in the Pilot Project. Although
evaluation by MRES has shown that PLL results in significant water savings and
serves as a catalyst for increasing agricultural production through improved
utilization of non-water inputs, it would be de-emphasized in this project
(about 37,000 ac) because of the impracticability of leaving land fallow on
small farms and shortages of GOP and GO Province funds to sustain the subsidy
level provided under the Pilot Project. Project assistance would be limited
to technical assistance, except for Baluchistan where a 50% cost-sharing
subsidy for PLL (maximum Rs 650/ac limited to 5 ac per farm) would be required
to encourage farmers participation. Land levelling equipment, currently owned
and operated by the OFWM Directorates, would be made available on a rental
basis to farmers. Such rental would provide for continued operation of
equipment on a sustaining basis.
3.12      Demonstration Plots.  (Base Cost US$0.2 M 1/).  The project would
provide demonstration plots on renovated watercourses to show farmers effec-
tive use of the increased water supply resulting from project improvements.
Each renovated watercourse would contain a one ac demonstration plot, except
in Sind Province where a plot is planned for about every 20 watercourses. The
plot should have good accessibility and be on a typical farm experiencing
average crop yields or better. The farmer should have the enthusiasm to carry
out required activities and to cooperate with other farmers. Demonstration
activities on each plot would include PLL, proper field layout, land prepara-
tion and irrigation scheduling to better meet crop water requirements. The
project would provide technical assistance and the OFWM Directorates would
supply equipment without charge for PLL of the plot. The Water Management
1/   Limited to equipment cost for trickle irrigation in Baluchistan.



- 17 -
Supervisors in the OFWM Directorates would assist farmers in obtaining credit
for financing the cost of required agricultural supplies for the plots. Sites
should be chosen where the farmer would be willing to level an additional one
ac or more of adjacent land and provide required inputs without subsidy, so
that improved field and delivery channel layout could be better demonstrated.
In Baluchistan, the project would provide about 17 ac of trickle irrigation
in one ac demonstration plots, which would be located on existing irrigated
orchards.
3.13      Targets.  Table 3.1 lists the proposed targets by Province for each
civil works component. Estimated civil works' quantities and costs, as well
as Provincial annual targets by practice are included in Annex I, Tables 7
and 8.

The above targets are based upon recent accomplishments in the Pilot Project
(10 watercourses to be renovated by each field team during FY81, and 20,000 ac
of PLL achieved in FY80) and Punjab "Crash Program" (9,800 watercourse heavily
cleaned in FY80). Because of clustering of watercourses to be renovated
(para 3.07) and improved efficiency of existing and proposed field teams
(55 in FY82 to 70 in FY84), it is estimated that each field team would be
completing approximately 15 watercourses annually by the end of the project
period. Since this project is a continuation of the Pilot Project and Punjab
"Crash Program" (para 3.02), OFWM Directorate field teams are planning and
designing civil works at the present time that would be constructed during
the first several months (FY82) of this project (see Implementation Schedule
Annex 2, Table 1).
Training (Base Cost US$0.67 M)
3.14      The project would provide additional personnel, equipment, and
supplies on OFWM related training for:  (a) the additional Water Management
Officers (WMO) and Subengineers needed for project implementation (paras 5.04
and 5.05); (b) 40 Water Management Supervisors (WMS), including the 30 now
posted, and 100 additional Field Assistants (FA) needed by Punjab O&M Section
(para 5.06); (c) new recruits required for the Field Teams due to attrition;
(d) Agricultural Officers (AOs) and FAs of the Extension Service (para 5.08);
and (e) the chairman or designated member of each participating WUA. Refresher
courses would be held as required. The estimated training needs for the
project period are shown in Annex 2, Table 2.



- 18 -
3.15      Currently, the OFWM Directorates in Punjab, Sind and NWFP, operate
training institutes. The recently completed training institute at Lahore,
Punjab is an excellent facility, however, it need additional staff, equipment,
and supplies. It can accommodate 50 trainees in a session. Each of the
institutes would offer courses in: Precision Land Levelling (6 weeks), Water-
course Design and Improvement (6 weeks), and Water Management Extension (3
weeks). About 40% of the total training time of each course would be devoted
to classroom lectures and 60% to field training. In addition, a curriculum
would be developed for training WMSs, and FAs on organizing and assisting WUAs
(para 5.11), and for WUA officers. Since Baluchistan's does not have an OFWM
training institute, it would send its trainees to Punjab OFWM Training Institute.
These institutes would be responsible for preparing OFWM educational and
informational materials required for the project.
3.16      At the national level, the OFWM training program at the University
of Agriculture at Faisalabad is well organized (supported by USAID) and would
continue to offer a 4-1/2 month course for WMSs and Instructors of In-Service
Agricultural Training Institutes, and a six-week course for AOs of the Agricul-
tural Extension Service. The Provincial OFWM Directorate would pay tuition
(about Rs 4,500) for WMSs attending these courses.
Supervision and Administration (US$7.8 M), and Technical Assistance (US$2.8 M)
3.17      Project Supervision and Administration, and Technical Assistance
and other institutional arrangements are discussed in Chapter V. The project
would finance:
(a) All ongoing administration and coordination staffs associated
with the phased out Pilot Project plus additional staffs
in the Federal Water Management Cell and Punjab OFWM
Directorate to accommodate increased workload associated
with the project;
(b)  Existing field teams (55) plus 10 additional field teams
in Punjab, 2 in NWFP and 3 in Baluchistan;
(c) Technical assistance in form of local supervisory consultants
(about 432 man-months at about US$1,500 per m/m including
all cost for equipment) to assist the Federal Water Management
Cell and Provincial OFWM Directorates in supervising and
monitoring progress and quality of work, preparing reports,
processing of reimbursement applications and general budget
and fiscal control;
(d) One full and five part-time expatriates (about 76 man-months
at about US$11,000 per m/m (includes firm's overhead, sub-
sistance allowance and international travel) specializing
in water management irrigation; irrigation agronomy, train-
ing, trickle irrigation, and evaluation (see para 5.19);
(e) Research to improve technologies and concepts to resolve
problems arising during implementation of the project;



- 19 -
(f) A local qualified research institution to evaluate the
project; and
(g) Additional transport, office and survey equipment, supplies,
and materials.
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND PROCUREMENT
Cost Estimate and Schedule of Expenditures
4.01      Total project costs for the implementation period (July 1981 to June
1984) are estimated at about US$111.6 M equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of about US$13.2 M or 12%. Estimates are based on January 1981
prices and include about US$0.4 M in import taxes and duties. Project cash
cost is estimated at US$79.1 and farmers donated labor for the civil works
at US$32.5 M. The cost of civil works (for the watercourse renovation and
accelerated watercourse improvement) are based on: (a) recent average costs
at field sites; and (b) standard structure designs and material mixes provided
in the recently published reports, "National Standards for Practices and
Materials" and "Pucca Structures for Earthern Improved Technologies." The
costs include recurrent expenditures associated with the project's supervision
and administration. Physical contingencies are assumed to be 10% for civil
works, equipment, technical assistance, and supervision and administration.
Price contingencies (%) are estimated as follows:
FY81    FY82    FY83   FY84   FY85
Foreign Costs    10.75    8.75       8.0    7.5    7.5
Local Costs       12.00   12.00    11.0   10.0    9.0

Financing
4.02      The proposed IDA Credit of SDRs 33.4 M (US$41.0 M) would finance
about 78% of the foreign exchange cost, and about 47% of the local cash cost
or about 52% of the total project cash cost net of taxes and duties. The
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is expected to extend
a loan for US$12 M which would finance the remainder 22% of the foreign
exchange cost and about 14% of the local cash cost or about 15% of the total
cash cost. In the event the IFAD loan should not materialize, GOP would
arrange other financing either from its own resources or from additional
foreign borrowing, in order to carry out the project. The farmers would
contribute US$17.6 M or 23% of the estimated total cash cost. GOP and GO
Provinces would finance the remaining US$8.5 M equivalent from its budgetary
resources. Net of receipt for import taxes and duties on project items, GOP
and GO Provinces' contribution would amount to 10% of the estimated total
project cash cost. Finally, farmers' donated labor would amount to US$32.50 M
or 29% of total project cost. Approval of the project's PC-1 by ECNEC is a
condition of credit effectiveness. The proposed financing plan is summarized
in Table 4.2.

lb   Includes US$0.3 M farmer's 20% repayment for cost of materials in Punjab
and 25% in Sind (para 6.15).
4.03      The project would provide for the establishment of a Civil Works
Imprest Account at the Federal level with sub-accounts (Personal Ledger
Accounts) at Provincial levels, to finance all civil works to be undertaken
under the project (see Annex 3 - Procedures for Operation of Civil Works
Imprest Account). Because GOP is experiencing severe financial constraints,
which results in it having difficulty in prefinancing expenditures, IDA would
make an initial advance to GOP (equivalent to Rs 23.2 M), which would be
limited to the financing of 80% of the cost of civil works to be constructed
during the first-four months of the project. GOP would cause GO Provinces to
advance Rs 5.9 M to the sub-accounts to cover the balance 20% 1/ of the cost
of civil works expenditures for the same period. The level of the Imprest
Account would be adjusted every year based on estimated targets as reflected
in the annual work plan (paras 5.02 and 5.03). A total IDA advance of up to
Rs 50.0 M equivalent is estimated by the beginning of FY85. Advances from the
IDA Credit would be deposited in the Imprest Account within the State Bank of
Pakistan for transfer to the sub-accounts. Disbursements from the sub-accounts
would follow existing Provincial procedures and would be under the control of
the Directors (Director General in Punjab) of the respective Provincial OFWM
Directorates. The Director General of the Federal Water Management Cell would
be responsible for submitting applications for annual advances and reimburse-
ment to IDA; seeing that such IDA funds are properly applied to the sub-
accounts; monitoring sub-account transactions, and maintaining consolidated
accounts for the Imprest Account. GOP would ensure that all IDA's advances
and reimbursements (para 4.08) for civil works would be made to the appropriate
sub-account. Should disbursements be made for expenditure not allowable under
the IDA credit, or for watercourse renovation and accelerated improvements not
meeting agreed selection criteria and standards, GOP through the respective
Provincial Government would cause redeposit of the corresponding amount into
1/   Inclusive of 15% possible IFAD share.

the sub-accounts. Assurances have been obtained from GOP on the operational
procedures for this account that are satisfactory to IDA. The establishment
of the account with a sub-account for each of the four Provinces, and the
deposit of GOP's initial contribution to such sub-accounts are conditions
of credit effectiveness. Assurances have been obtained from GOP that all
advances for this project would be directly applied to the appropriate
provincial sub-accounts.
4.04      Farmers' required repayments for materials and other agreed items
would be collected by the Provincial Revenue Departments from individual
landowners in the form of land arrears. These Departments would also be
authorized to collect fees in a similar manner, for communal watercourse
improvements and for defaulted maintenance required to be undertaken by the
OFWM Directorate (para 5.11).
Procurement
4.05      Project items to be financed by the project include civil works
(mostly earthwork, sand, brick and cement), and equipment (primarily jeeps,
pick-ups, motorcycles, bicycles, furniture, office equipment, and surveying
equipment). Procurement would be carried out by the Provincial OFWM Direc-
torates and by the Federal Water Management Cell (see Annex 4 - Procurement
Schedule).
4.06      Because civil works construction would be in small parcels, seasonal,
scattered over a wide area, and involve farmer donated labor, it would not be
practical to group them into contracts suitable for ICB. Therefore, the proj-
ect's civil works would be carried out in the following manner: (a) watercourse
improvements would be constructed by force account and by farmer donated labor;
and (b) precision land-levelling would be done by the farmers with rented
equipment from the Directorates and/or private contractors. The materials'
cost per watercourse would range from US$300-575 for accelerated improvements
to a US$4,500-20,500 for renovated watercourses, and would include primarily
bricks, cement and pucca nuccas. All civil work materials are available in
Pakistan. Sand, bricks, cement and precast pucca nuccas would be procured by
the Provincial OFWM Directorate following Provincial procedures satisfactory
to IDA. The base civil works cash cost would total US$43.6 M.
4.07      Vehicles would be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA guide-
lines. The Federal Water Management Cell would coordinate the procurement of
vehicles so that all vehicles would be called for under one tender document
with deliveries as agreed with the OFWM Directorates. Vehicles base cost
would be about US$$1.2 M (including taxes and duties and transport). Motor-
cycles and bicycles, however, would be purchased directly by OFWM Directorate
staff who would be provided with a medium term loan for this purpose by their
Governments. Loans would be repaid from allowances for official travel.
Adequacy of these allowances was discussed during negotiations and found to
be satisfactory. Because of the relatively small amount of office and survey
equipment required for each Province, these items would be procured following
Provincial procedures acceptable to IDA. This involves prudent shopping (PS),
whereby the concerned agency would compare the prices from at least three
independent suppliers; the aggregate amount of non-ICB procurement for equip-
ment would not exceed the equivalent of US$1.2 M (inclusive of contingencies).
Consultant services (para 5.19) financed under the project would be obtained
in accordance with IDA guidelines.



- 23 -
Disbursements
4.08      Disbursements of the IDA credit would be made for:
(a) 80% of the cost of civil works;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditure; 100% of local expenditures
ex-factory; or 75% of expenditures for equipment and
vehicles procured locally;
(c) 100% of the cost of foreign technical assistance and
65% of the cost of local consultants; and
(d) 25% of the salaries and allowances of all professional
OFWM field staff and Punjab's O&M section engaged in
project operations.
Disbursements of (a), and (d) would be made against statement of expenditures;
supporting documents would be retained by implementing agencies and retained
for review by IDA. Reimbursement applications in (a) above would also be
accompanied by: (i) a statement of transactions on the Imprest Account since
the previous application, with the balance certified by the State Bank of
Pakistan; (ii) a reconciliation showing that the balance represents the amount
deposited in the account at the beginning of the project (or subsequent years)
less payments awaiting IDA reimbursement; and (iii) a statement indicating that
GOP funds deposited in the account equal or exceed the 20% matching required
for materials for such IDA reimbursement or advance.   Within six months of
each disbursement, GOP would certify to IDA, with verification by the super-
visory consultants, that improvements on the watercourses for which the mate-
rial was procured met agreed standards, specifications and criteria and that
procured material was used on such improvements. Any deviation in quantities
or inadequacies in construction of any completed watercourse would be read-
justed against GOP request for subsequent IDA reimbursement and GOP would need
to redeposit the corresponding amount of such deficiency in the appropriate
Provincial subaccount (para 4.03). Disbursement for (b) and (c) would
be made against full documentation. The Directors of the Provincial OFWM
Directorates, assisted by the supervisory consultants, would be responsible
for the initial preparation of IDA reimbursement applications and these would
be submitted to the Federal Water Management Cell. The Cell would maintain
consolidated budget control for the project, and following review by the
supervisory consultants, the Cell would forward these applications to IDA for
reimbursement (paras 5.02 and 5.09). It is anticipated that final disburse-
ment for the project would be made by December 31, 1984, about six months
after the end of project implementation. Estimated IDA disbursement schedule
is shown in Annex 1, Table 9 and accounts for the experience of the Pilot
Project and the Civil Works Imprest Account.
Accounts and Audits
4.09      Current accounting procedures followed in the four Provincial
OFWM Directorates and in the Federal Water Management Cell are satisfactory.
Project accounts would be maintained separately and in a readily identifiable
form by each Provincial OFWM Directorate. The Federal Water Management Cell



- 24 -
would consolidate the accounts from the various Provinces, and after audit by
independent accountants satisfactory to IDA, the Cell would submit them
to IDA (para 5.02). The Audit Report would include inter alia, a statement
verifying that funds disbursed by IDA in advance for the Imprest Account and
against statement of expenditures had been used for the purpose for which they
were provided. Assurances have been obtained from GOP that: (a) accounts
together with disbursement documents would be audited annually by an indepen-
dent auditor satisfactory to IDA; (b) the use of the funds advanced to the
Provincial OFWM Directorates would be checked semi-annually by the project's
Supervisory Consultants; (c) copies of all the project audit accounts would be
sent to IDA not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Institutional Arrangements
5.01      The project would build upon existing institutional arrangements in
the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives and Provincial Departments
of Agriculture, which were established to implement the Pilot Project. These
arrangements include: (a) Federal Water Management Cell in the Ministry to
coordinate the project and assure consistency with agreed criteria, specifi-
cations and standards; and (b) OFWM Directorate in each of the Provincial
Departments of Agriculture to implement the project and supervise the opera-
tion and maintenance of improved facilities. Implementation of the acce-
lerated watercourse improvement program would follow the institutional model             (
developed for the Punjab "crash" program. Under this arrangement, the Deputy
Commissioner would direct and coordinate the various Provincial agencies
involved in watercourse cleaning, i.e. Department of Irrigation, IRDP,
Cooperatives, Agriculture (OFWM and Extension Service Directorates), and Local
Governments. The Provincial OFWM Directorates would be responsible for
installing the pucca nuccas.
5.02      The Federal Water Management Cell (see Organization Chart, Plate V)
would be headed by a Director General reporting to the Additional Secretary in
the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Cooperatives. This Cell would be the
lead agency for the project and would be responsible for: (a) coordinating
project activities and programs to be implemented in the Provinces; (b) devel-
oping a consolidated annual work plan based upon input from each Provincial
OFWM Directorate and submitting it to IDA by April 1 of each year as well as
updating the project work plan as required; (c) preparing consolidated quar-
terly and annual project progress reports, as well as a project completion
report, and submitting them to IDA within 60 days of the end of the reporting
period; (d) maintaining consolidated project accounts and monitoring Civil
Works Imprest Account and sub-accounts (para 4.03); (e) submitting reimburse-
ment applications to IDA; (f) promulgating appropriate technical standards;
(g) assuring that completed civil works meet agreed criteria and specifica-
tions; (h) arranging for project related research; and (i) providing for
project monitoring and evaluation. To assist the Cell, the project would
provide technical assistance in the form of supervisory consultants and
technical experts (para 5.09).



- 25 -
5.03      The OFWM Directorates would differ slightly to suit the circumstances
in each Province (see Organization Charts, Plates VI to IX). These Directorates
would be headed by a Director, except for Punjab where the workload justifies
the position of Director General. In Baluchistan, the Director would report
to the Director of Extension Service, while, elsewhere they would report
directly to the Secretary of Agriculture. The OFWM Directorate would be
responsible for: (a) implementing the project; (b) supervising operation and
maintenance of improved watercourses; (c) organizing, registering, assisting
and maintaining liaison with the Water Users Associations; (d) preparing an
annual Provincial project work plan by March 1 of each year to be included in
the Provincial ADP and in the Cell's consolidated annual work plan; (e)
submitting quarterly and annual progress reports to the Cell within 30 days of
the end of the reporting period; (f) maintaining separate project accounts and
administering appropriate Civil Works Imprest sub-accounts; (g) initial
preparation of IDA reimbursement application and submittal to the Cell; (h)
verifying to the Cell, the quantity and quality of work completed; and (i)
procurement of equipment and materials. Except for Baluchistan, OFWM Direc-
torate staff have not been regularized in permanent positions. To minimize
staff attrition resulting from job insecurity, the Provinces plan to regularize
these positions over a period of time.
5.04      Field teams, responsible for carrying out engineering works, would
report to the Deputy Director (Field), however, in Pt--Ljab they would report
to the Deputy Director (area coordinator) through an Assistant Director
(Engr.). The recently published "OFWM National Standards of Practices and
Materials" would be field teams' guide for planning designing, laying out
and constructing civil works. The number of field teams would be increased
from the current level of 55 to 70 teams (40 Punjab, 15 Sind, 5 NWFP and
10 Baluchistan) by the end of the project.
5.05      The field teams would have a similar cadre to those presently in
place with these exceptions: (a) because of de-emphasis on precision land
levelling, and common training, the previous Watercourse Engineers and Land
Development Officers would become WMOs; and (b) due to limited availability
of graduates, diploma holders would be recruited and trained to assist in
the supervision of watercourse renovation and PLL. Team composition would
generally consist of eight members; one Team Leader, three WMOs, one Water
Management Supervisor (WMS), and three Subengineers. Because of limited
availability of qualified personnel and widely dispersed project areas,
Baluchistan's field teams would be limited to a team leader, one WMS, one
Subengineer and one WMA. The team leader would be an experienced WMO. WMOs
would be either agricultural engineering or agronomy graduates (BS or MS)
trained at the Provincial OFWM Training Institutes. WMSs would be agronomy
graduates (BS or MS) trained in organizational, extension and water manage-
ment techniques in the 4 1/2 month course at the University at Faisalabad.
Subengineers would be diploma holders from engineering institutes as well
as Provincial OFWM Institutes.
5.06      Punjab Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Section.  Poor O&M of
renovated watercourses has been a continuing problem in the Pilot Project.
This issue is urgent in Punjab where 500 watercourses have already been reno-
vated under the Pilot Project and an additional 1,500 are targeted under this
project. The project would establish an O&M Section in the Punjab OFWM



- 26 -
Directorate. This section would be established in the offices of the six area
Deputy Directors. Reporting to the Area Deputy Director through an Assistant
Director (Agriculture) would be WMS who in turn would supervise five Field
Assistants (FAs) who would be posted by Extension Service. Through the
project period, the Punjab Extension Service would post about 100 FAs, who
would come under the technical direction of the Punjab OFWM Directorate. Each
FA would be assigned to 20 renovated watercourses. The main responsibilities
of the WMSs and FAs would be to: (a) organize formal WUAs; (b) serve as
liaison between OFWM Directorate and WUAs to encourage their effective and
continued operation; (c) monitor watercourse maintenance and take appropriate
action; (d) assist farmers and WUAs in planning, installing and operating
simple irrigation practices; (e) schedule return of OFWM Field Teams to
renovated watercourses to do follow up work on further improvement (lining,
structure installation, PLL, etc.); and (f) promote physical water management
practices on the demonstration plot financed under the project. The project
would provide 10 WMSs in addition to the 30 WMSs currently posted to field
team, who would be reassigned to this task. The Area Deputy Directors of OFWM
would organize a disciplined approach whereby the FA would visit two water-
courses daily, making the rounds in a fortnight. Two days would be for
specialized training, report writing, and leave. In addition, a WMS would
train and supervise each FA for one day during his weekly visits. During
these weekly sessions the WMS would stress water management practices that
should be emphasized by the FA.
5.07      Since Sind, NWFP, and Baluchistan have fewer watercourse to be
renovated, establishment of a separate O&M section would not be justified at
this time. However, the three provincial governments have indicated general
support for such an approach when the magnitude of their OFWM activites would
so justify. In the meantime, the WMS attached to the field teams in these
three Provinces would be responsible for coordinating and implementing the O&M
activities discussed in para 5.06 and would be given appropriate training in
these matters.
5.08      Coordination with Extension Service.  In this project, technical
services to farmers would be in two discrete programs. OFWM would undertake
all engineering and physical tasks within a chak associated with water, whereas
the Agricultural Extension Service would be responsible for combining into the
extension package all the non-structural water inputs together with non-water
inputs. This approach would assure continued and improved operation of irriga-
tion facilities within a chak under the supervision of the OFWM Directorate,
and at the same time farmers would benefit from the program of an integrated
Agricultural Extension Service employing the T&V system. However in Punjab
for an interim period (about three years) following watercourse renovation,
FAs assigned to the OFWM Directorate (para 5.06) would carry out the tradi-
tional extension service program under the direction of the NMSs in the
Directorate. It is assumed that at the end of period that the WUAs (para
5.10) would be operating effectively in maintaining the watercourses, and
unless so ordered by the Provincial Secretary of Agriculture, jurisdiction of
such FAs would revert to the Extension Service. The OFWM Directorate would be
responsible for selecting the demonstration plot area and installing all
structural water management practices. Following completion of such prac-
tices, the Directorates, except for Punjab, would turn over supervision of the
plot to the Extension Service. The project would strengthen the Agricultural



- 27 -
Extension Service by providing: (a) training for its personnel in the Pro-
vincial OFWM institutes (para 3.14); (b) plots on renovated watercourses for
demonstrating techniques to farmer for increasing agricultural production; and
(c) incremental agricultural supplies required for such demonstrations (para
3.12). The Area Deputy Directors OFWM would arrange for monthly meetings at
the following levels with Extension Service officials to encourage coordina-
tion and improve input services to the farmers and WUAs:
OFWM                             Extension
District           Deputy Director, OFWM             Deputy Director Agriculture
Tehsil             Water Management Supervisor       Agricultural Officer
Union Council      Water Management Assistant        Field Assistant
5.09      Supervisory Consultants.  The project would provide about 432 man/
months of local supervisory consultants plus supporting staff as follows:
Profession                          No.            Manmonths
Team Leader (Engr.)                  1                 36
Engineers (Ag. or Civil)             6                216
Accountant                           1                 36
Subengineers                         2                 72
Assistant Accountant                 2                 72
Total                                               432
This team of supervisory consultants would report to the Director General of
the Federal Water Management Cell and would assist the Cell and Provincial
OFWM Directorates. Terms of reference for the supervisory consultants are
included in Annex 5. Services to be performed by these consultants include:
(a) review plans and designs for civil works to assure compliance with agreed
criteria and standards; (b) review revised standards as proposed by the Cell;
(c) check completed works to determine quality and quantity of works; (d)
report to the Directors on compliance of completed works with agreed criteria
and standards; (e) assist the Directorates and Cell in the preparation of
reimbursement applications; (f) verify quantities and acceptable quality of
materials procured and civil works completed; (g) assist the Cell in central-
ized budget control and semi annual review of Civil Works Imprest sub-accounts;
(h) assist in preparation of consolidated annual work plans, progress and
completion reports; and (i) monitor, review and assist in procurement activities.
5.10      Water Users Associations.  Formalized Water User Associations (WUA)
would be organized on all chaks receiving pucca improvements of lining and
structures prior to installing such facilities. This requirement would be
aimed at overcoming the problem of poor maintenance of watercourse improvements
in the Pilot Project (para 2.10). In addition, encouragement would be given
to the organization of formal WUAs on chaks with watercourses renovated in the
Pilot Project. A draft Water Users Association Ordinance was prepared and
presented to GO Provincial officials as a model to be used in drafting such
ordinances for each Province. Punjab and NWFP have already promulgated such
an ordinance, whereas Sind and Baluchistan are in the process of drafting such
an ordinance with promulgation anticipated by August 1, 1981.



- 28 -
5.11      These WUAs Ordinances would enable the establishment of individual
Associations as a corporate body in the Province of origin. Each WUA would be
registered in the Office of the Director of the Provincial OFWM Directorate.
The Ordinance provides for: (a) organizational procedures; (b) membership;
(c) general assembly of users; (d) voting requirements; (e) resolution of
disputes; (f) powers of the Association; and (g) election of a board of
directors along with powers and duties of the board. Provision is also made
for the WUAs to organize into a Federation of Association along a distributary
or canal. In addition, the Ordinance would provide sanctions if an individual
member or Association fails to adequately maintain communal watercourse
improvements. The OFWM Directorates would have the authority to undertake
such maintenance and assess the member or Association for the costs incurred
(para 4.04).
5.12      Farmers within a WUA would be able to obtain loans from the Coopera-
tive Bank for individual improvements such as PLL, structures, additional
lining, and production credit. WUA could seek communal loans from the
Cooperative Bank for tubewells, fertilizer, watercourse improvements, etc.
The WUAs would also be eligible to receive loans from the Agricultural Develop-
ment Bank of Pakistan (para 1.21) and Commercial Banks.
Implementation Schedule
5.13      Project implementation is scheduled for three years (see Annex 2,
Tables 1-4 for Implementation Schedule). Procurement of all equipment would
be substantially completed during the first year. Most of the OFWM staff
is in place. Increased staff for field teams (from 55 to 70) would be com-
pleted during the first two years, whereas the O&M staff in Punjab would be
mobilized throughout the project period. Civil works construction is targeted
as a three year time slice of an envisioned expanding OFWM program leading
to the renovation of Pakistan's 89,000 watercourses in 10 to 15 years. Con-
struction of civil works would begin immediately in FY82, based upon plans
and designs completed in late FY81 by field teams associated with the Pilot
Project and Punjab "Crash Program" (para 3.13).
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14      Two factors highlight the importance of a suitably designed moni-
toring and evaluation system for this project: (a) the limited availability
of systematic, reliable, and evaluated findings regarding the nature and scope
of benefits from OFWM investments; and (b) the substantial investment required
to complete needed watercourse improvements. The Pilot Project has an ongoing
monitoring and evaluation program carried out by the Provincial OFWM Direc-
torates and the Research and Survey Organization of WAPDA's Perspective Plan-
ning Division. The project would improve on this ongoing monitoring and
evaluation system for the purpose of developing an information system of
greater utility to project management, planners, and donor agencies.
5.15      The monitoring activities would review the progress of the project's
implementation. The Federal Water Management Cell and OFWM Directorates would
review the progress of the major tasks required to achieve the project's
physical and financial targets. This review would improve the proformas
already being used to monitor the project's physical and financial progress.



- 29 -
It would provide project management with an early warning signal regarding
current and/or potential implementation problems. Monitoring would be carried
out by Provincial OFWM Directorates. Each Directorate would have a Deputy
Director, Monitoring and Planning, who would be responsible for collecting,
organizing, and analyzing the data and preparing quarterly and annual reports
(para 5.03).
5.16      The project's evaluation would concentrate on assessing the impact
of the major components, particularly regarding the benefits derived from
watercourse improvements. Before and after watercourse improvement data
would be collected for a sample of watercourses (improved and unimproved
watercourses) accounting for farmer location on the watercourse (head, middle
and tail), different improvement technologies (accelerated and renovation),
varying levels of maintenance, and their contribution to the project's
benefits. The analysis of this data would provide guidance for improving the
design of OFWM investments, including the selection criteria for watercourses,
the redesign of technologies, and the organizational and cost recovery levels
and arrangements. This evaluation effort would be designed to build and
expand on the ongoing evaluation of the Pilot Project. The sample design
includes an estimated 100 watercourses. Of this total, 45 are already included
in the Pilot Project and the remaining 55 watercourses would be selected from
this project.
5.17      Evaluation activities would devote significant but secondary impor-
tance to assessing: (a) the impact of the precision land leveling activities;
and (b) short-term studies of selected issues that could affect the project's
eventual impact, including (i) the role and effectiveness of the Water User
Association (WUA); and (ii) the effectiveness of the project's organizational
arrangements, including the role and coordination of the extension and main-
tenance activities.
5.18      The Federal Water Management Cell would contract with WAPDA to
evaluate the project. Specifically, this evaluation would be the responsibi-
lity of the Survey and Research Organization, Perspective Planning Division,
WAPDA. The day-to-day activities would be carried out by the existing Evalua-
tion Unit. The proposed project would strengthen the Unit's existing organi-
zational arrangements and work program. The project would provide additional
staff, and would strengthen the Unit's analytical capacity by providing
consultancy services (para 5.19). Terms of Reference for the monitoring and
evaluation expert and the sociologist required for the project are presented
in Annex 5. Coordination and direction of the evaluation activities would
be provided by the already functioning Special Review Committee, which has
representatives from the various participating groups (including Federal and
Provincial officials from Planning and Agriculture, WAPDA, and concerned
research institutes). The Evaluation Unit would prepare biannual progress
reports and a final Project Evaluation Report to be submitted to the Cell and
to IDA within two and six months respectively of the close of the reporting
period. The Unit's evaluation work program was discussed and agreed during
negotiations. Both monitoring and evaluation activities would be under the
overall supervision of the Federal Water Management Cell. Assurances have
been obtained that the terms and conditions of the Cell's contract with WAPDA
would be satisfactory to IDA.



- 30 -
Technical Assistance
5.19      To strengthen implementation capacity and improve supervision, the
project would provide about 508 man-months of consultancy services to be
appointed by the Federal Water Management Cell on the following fields:
(a) 432 man-months of local engineering and specialists
(supervisory consultants, see para 5.09);
(b) 33 man-months of a water management specialist (engineer)
and nine man-months (three months each year) of an irriga-
tion agronomist to assist the Cell and OFWM Directorates
in implementing the project; improve technologies; and
strengthen standards;
(c) 18 man-months of a training specialist to assist the Cell
and OFWM Directorates, specifically the Provincial Training
Institutes, in developing the OFWM training curriculum;
preparation of training materials; and procurement of
equipment, etc. The specialist would be located in Lahore,
but would serve all Provinces. The initial mission would
be for 12 months followed by a three month mission in each
of the final two years;
(d) four man-months of a trickle irrigation engineer to assist
Baluchistan in procuring materials, planning and designing
the 17 ac of demonstration plots envisioned for trickle
irrigation in established nurseries. An initial mission
of one month would be for selecting several demonstration
areas and ordering required materials and equipment. After
arrival of materials and equipment, a follow-up mission of
about two months would be scheduled to assist the OFWM
Directorate in training its personnel in planning and laying
out the system on demonstration plots. A one-month mission
scheduled about 12 months later would review the operation
of the installed systems, assess the program and prepare a
report on findings to be submitted to GOP and IDA; and
(e) 12 man-months of consultancy services to assist the Cell,
OFWM Directorates and WAPDA's Survey and Research Organiza-
tion Unit in designing and carrying out the monitoring and
evaluation system (paras 5.14 to 5.18). A monitoring and
evaluation expatriate expert would be hired for about
nine months and a sociologist (preferably local expert)
for about three months. The timing of their assistance
would be spread over four years during critical phases
of the work program.
Assurance have been obtained that GOP would employ suitably qualified consul-
tants for the above assignments in accordance with timetables and on terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA. As a condition of effectiveness, GOP
has agreed to enter into an agreement with a local firm for supplying the
supervisory consultants.



- 31 -
Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
5.20      Civil Works.  The WUAs would be responsible for the O&M of the reno-
vated watercourses. Sanctions would be provided in enacted legislation to
assure such maintenance (para 5.11). Individual farmers would be responsible
for the O&M of field channels and other field improvements such as PLL. Pro-
vincial OFWM Directorates would supply the necessary technical services to
assist the WUAs and farmers in carrying out these O&M responsibilities (paras
5.06 and 5.07).
5.21      Vehicles and Equipment Repairs and Services.  The Federal Water
Management Cell and OFWM Directors would be responsible for the repair and
servicing of vehicles and equipment procured under the project. Private
workshops and facilities are adequate in Pakistan for this work.
VI.  PRODUCTION, MIARKETING, AND PRICES, FARI INCOME AND COST RECOVERY
Agricultural Impact
6.01      The project would increase the irrigation water supply on about
7.3 M ac by decreasing water losses along selected watercourses. Of this
benefited area, about 0.8 M ac would be associated with renovated watercourses
and about 6.5 M ac with watercourses receiving accelerated improvement. To
improve on-farm irrigation efficiency, the project would provide PLL on about
36,750 ac and strengthen the extension program by establishing about 1,700
one acre demonstration plots.
6.02      Cropping Intensities.  Current cropping intensities in Pakistan are
generally low (para 1.16), and they vary considerably depending on climate,
soils and availability of water. However, water availability is the main
constraint to increasing cropping intensities. Hence, most project induced
increases in agricultural production are expected to come from increases in
cropped area. It is anticipated that cropping intensities in chaks with
renovated watercourses would increase from 125 to 140% at full development.
Expected increases 1/ in cropped areas to be benefited by the project's water-
courses are shown in Annex 6, Table 1 and summarized in the following table:
1/   Cropping patterns, yields, and levels of input utilization were derived
using Development Research Center's Indus Basin Model. A farm level
agricultural economics survey of 2000 farmers located in 400 chaks
was conducted by WAPDA for RAP and used as basic input for the model
(para 6.10).

6.03      Cropping Patterns.  Based upon prevailing water allocations, and
on the results of the evaluation of the Pilot Project, it is expected that
project water saved would bring about some shifts in the cropping patterns,
mainly toward higher valued crops requiring additional water. Expected
changes in cropping patterns associated with renovated watercourses are
shown in Annex 6, Table 2 and summarized below:

6.04      Crop Yields and Production.  Farmers face severe water constraints
in the Indus Basin (para 2.06).  Hence, they limit their cropped area and
under irrigate their crops. Based on evaluations of the Pilot Project, it is
anticipated that most near-term project benefits would come from increases in
cropping intensities, rather than increases in yields. However, increases in
water supply would bring about improvement in input utilization and hence some
increase in yields. Such yield increases in this project are expected to be
modest (see estimated crop yields in Annex 5, Table 1). Strengthening of
Extension Service programs as provided in this project (para 5.08), along with
IDA funded projects to introduce the T&V system in Punjab and Sind Provinces
(para 1.20), and GOP's effort to expand such system nationwide could result
in additional project benefits.

6.05      With the above assumptions, the expected increases in the main
agricultural products at full development (1987) associated with renovated
watercourses are as follows:

Marketing and Pricing
6.06      Pakistan's marketing arrangements vary by commodities, and to a
lesser extent, by Province. Current marketing and milling facilities are
considered adequate to handle the project's expected incremental inputs
(paras 1.17-1.21) and outputs. GOP has an ongoing program to expand storage
capacity, principally for foodgrains.
6.07      Currently about 60% of Pakistan's wheat production is for on-farm
consumption. The remaining 40% is marketed about equally by the public and
private sectors. The public system, which is carried out by each Provincial
Food Directorate and the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corpora-
tion, buys grain at fixed prices from producers and private traders. Although
grain prices fluctuate seasonally and regionally within the private system,
this variation is narrowed because of GOP's pricing policies. The project is
expected to contribute to GOP's objective of reaching wheat self-sufficiency
in the mid-1980s. Pakistan is expected to be a net exporter of wheat by the
end of this decade. Approximately 40-50% of Pakistan's paddy production is
consumed on-farm, whereas about 85% of the marketable surplus, mainly Basmati
quality, is exported through the State-owned Rice Export Corporation of
Pakistan. Producers sell most of their paddy to husking mills, which are
primarily privately operated. Cotton and sugarcane are sold either directly
or through an intermediary to ginneries and mills. Ginned cotton is partly
consumed domestically with the rest exported by the Pakistan Export Corpora-
tion. In areas where there is no sugar mill, sugarcane is often processed by
the farmer into gur. Other project outputs would be absorbed through farm
family consumption and local and domestic urban markets. With anticipated
increases in real income of about 3% p.a., project induced production not
exported should be absorbed readily by the domestic market.
6.08      Most agricultural prices in Pakistan are influenced by GOP's inter-
vention through import/export controls, taxes, consumer/producer subsidies,
and fixed procurement prices. To encourage use of agricultural inputs,
and to compensate for procurement prices lower than international prices,
GOP has provided heavy subsidies on fertilizer and other agricultural inputs.
However, in the spring of 1980, GOP announced a reorientation of its agricul-
tural price policies. These policies are aimed to reduce input subsidies,



- 34 -
to provide adequate incentives to producers through appropriate output price
adjustments, and to transfer responsibility from the public to the private
sector for appropriate marketing operations. These measures include: (a) 50%
increase in retail prices of fertilizer; (b) 25% increase (from Rs 40 to Rs 50
per ton) in margins allowed to fertilizer dealers other than cooperatives, and
a nearly 50% increase for cooperatives; (c) privatization of the import and
distribution of pesticides and the elimination of the pesticide subsidy in
Punjab and Sind and in the other two Provinces over the next three years; (d)
increases in crop support prices during 1980 ranging from 9% for cotton, 20%
for wheat, 25% for paddy-basmati,and 29% for both IRRI rice and sugarcane.
At the same time, GOP would continue to emphasize its earlier policy of ensur-
ing adequate and timely support of key agricultural inputs and services.
6.09      The prices used for the project's financial analysis were expressed
in January 1981 currency. To account for Pakistan's seasonal and regional
price variations, the project analysis estimated the FY81 average farmgate
prices for the four Provinces based on the following data sources: latest
GOP procurement prices, historical series of the GOP Monthly Statistical
Bulletin, Provincial Department's of Agriculture, WAPDA's Perspective Planning
Division, IDA's latest Economic Mission, and the mission findings from field
visits. The 1990 prices used for the project's financial analysis were based
on the following criteria: (a) GOP's recent pricing policies, whereby: (i)
fertilizer subsidies would be phased out by FY86; (ii) procurement price would
be fixed periodically to provide adequate producer incentives to aid in reach-
ing wheat self-sufficiency by the mid-1980s; and (iii) price of energy- related
inputs would move in line with world market trends; and (b) GOP intention to
periodically adjust prices for tradeable commodities to be generally consistent
with world market price levels and medium-term trends. Annex 6, Table 2
summarizes the projected prices used in the financial analysis.
Farm Models and Farm Incomes
6.10      The impact of improvements to be financed under the project would
vary with individual chaks depending upon: physical condition of the water-
course, availability of canal water, quality of groundwater, climate, soils,
cropping patterns, availability of agricultural inputs and services, and land
tenure. Ten illustrative farm models have been prepared to assess the finan-
cial benefits of renovated watercourses. These models represent the primary
types of watercourse improvements proposed under the project, the major
agro-climatic zones (para 1.16), and the quality of groundwater within such
zones. The farm models were derived from the information generated by the
Bank's Development Research Center's Indus Basin Model. 1/ Each farm model
is a scaled down version of a chosen sub-area (or "polygon"), 2/ which repre-
sent average farm size and other parameters such as water allocation, family

size, farm power availability, etc.  Sub-areas were selected to be representa-
tive of different investment possibilities to be financed by the project.
Although a primary purpose of the model is to analyze water investment oppor-
tunities of basinwide scope, it was adapted to analyze the impact of project
investments on farm incomes. The analysis was done by simulating different
levels of savings in water losses resulting from different proposed water-
course improvements. Estimated water savings were based on studies carried
out at MRES (paras 2.05 and 2.06) and are a function of the amount of hard
lining proposed for each improvement. It was assumed that there would be
about 15% hard lining in FGW areas and about 30% in SGW areas (para 3.06).
The analysis includes three farm models in the same watercourses (Punjab
cotton/wheat area) to assess the range of project impact due to farm location
along the watercourse (head, mid and tail). The main characteristics of the
farm models are shown in Annex 6, Tables 3 to 12.
6.11      Based on the above assumptions, the returns expected to accrue to
project benefited farmers are summarized in Table 6.4.

6.12      In general, the farm models assume that farmers along renovated
watercourses would need to reinvest on the katcha (earthen) works every six
years and that pucca lining (hard) would last for about 18 years. Under
these varied conditions, incremental net farm income would range from 6% to
40%, with the higher ranges for farmers in SGW areas or in FGW areas without
tubewells. Benefits accrued to tail farmers would generally be greater than



- 36 -
that accrued to head farmers (29% down to 6% in the Punjab cotton/wheat area).
This variation points out the need for strong Water Users Association, with
representation of farmers along a watercourse, to properly maintain water-
courses. The above models illustrate the returns expected to accrue to owner/
operators. Project impact on tenants' income would vary depending on tenancy
arrangements but would generally range from one-half to two-thirds of incre-
mental income estimated to accrue to owner/operators. These increments on
income, as evidenced in the Pilot Project, would be adequate to induce farmers
to contribute their labor to improve and maintain the watercourses. The
project's evaluation program (para 5.16) would assess the benefits obtained
and costs incurred by the beneficiaries.
Cost Recovery for Irrigation Works
6.13      Pakistan's Indus irrigation system is the largest contiguous irriga-
tion system in the world. Historically, all improvements to this system and
most of the O&M costs have been financed by GOP. However, inadequate O&M due
to insufficient funding has resulted in a deterioration of the system (para
1.05). This project proposes to improve the lowest order of the distributory
system (watercourse) and hence increase the supply of irrigation water to
farmers' fields, with a large portion of the improvements and all of the
follow-up O&M except for technical assistance being financed by benefiting
farmers.
6.14      The capital cost of watercourse improvements would amount to Rs 622
M in present value (PV) 1/ terms, whereas the incremental O&M costs of these
improvements during the project life is estimated at Rs 148 M in PV. Hence,
the PV of total irrigation capital cost and O&M cost over the 21 years of
of the project's life would amount to Rs 770 M (PV).
6.15      During the project's life, farmers' contributions to the irrigation
investment and reinvestment costs are estimated at Rs 286 M (PV) and O&M costs
at Rs 137 M (PV). Hence, farmer contributions would amount to about 55% of
the total cost related to irrigation. The balance (45%), or Rs 347 M (PV),
would be financed by GOP mainly through the ADP. Part of GO Provinces' cost
would be recovered through farmers repayment of a portion of the cost of con-
struction materials. Punjab farmers would be required to repay a minimum of
20% of the nominal cost of construction materials, and Sind farmers a minimum
of 25%. Such costs would be assessed against the landowners by the OFWM
Directorates. Repayments would be on the basis of ten bi-annual installments
following a two-year grace period for renovated and in three annual install-
ments following a one year grace period for accelerated improvements. Fees
would be collected by the Provincial Revenue Department. These payments in
real terms are estimated to total Rs 14 M (PV). Since the Pilot Project in
NWFP and Baluchistan was just getting a good start, farmers would not repay
any cost of material financed by GO Provinces. However, to maintain at least
the current levels of cost recovery from farm families benefitting from the
project, assurances have been obtained from GO Provinces that they would: (a)

recover from the beneficiaries, a portion of the cost of the project; and (b)
periodically review the trends in cost recovery levels in real terms, and take
the necessary measures to increase if appropriate, the portion of the project
to be recovered from beneficiaries. In addition to these recovery, a portion
of GO Provinces' cost would be recovered through water charges resulting from
increases in cropping intensities. Water charges are levied on a per ac
basis. Current water charges vary among crops and Provinces but are generally
a small portion (about 6%) of the net per ac income of crops. However, as a
result of the continuous dialogue between GOP and IDA, GOP has raised water
charges twice during the past two years and intends to increase water charges
in the future so as to fully finance all O&M costs. Due to the uncertainty of
timing for such increases, analysis for this project assumes water charges
remain unchanged in constant values. Based on present water charges, and
present and future cropping patterns and intensities, incremental water
charges due to the project are estimated at Rs 23 M (PV). Hence, GOP and GO
Provinces' direct contribution to the project would be Rs 310 M (PV). Farm
models show considerable variability for project rents and share of direct
cost recovery. At full development direct cost recovery ranges from 2% to 10%
of respective project rent (see Annex 6, Tables 3 to 12).
6.16      Indirect cost recovery through marketing fees and taxation of
incrementally induced production is estimated at about Rs 287 M (PV); this
revenue would come mainly from excess duty on exported rice and cotton and
implicit taxation on wheat. The Government's net contribution to the cost of
the irrigation works proposed under the project would amount to Rs 23 M (PV),
or about 3% of total project cost. The level of cost recovery is satisfactory
and much higher than for the average irrigation project because of substantial
contributions by farmers. Table 6.5 summarizes the total project costs and
the estimated recoveries in PV terms.

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS
7.01      The project would raise agricultural production and farm incomes by
increasing irrigation water supply on selected watercourses in Pakistan's four
Provinces. These increases in water supply would result in increased cropping
intensities, shifts in cropping patterns, and increased crop yields (paras
6.01-6.05). By reducing imports of wheat and increasing exports of rice and
cotton, the project would improve GOP's balance of payments. The project would
also significantly increase employment opportunities of the rural population.



- 39 -
7.02      The project would promote two types of watercourse improvements--the
more permanent renovated watercourse technology (para 3.06) and the relatively
short-lived accelerated improvement technology (para 3.09), which is mainly
oriented to a heavy cleaning and maintenance operation. Based on studies
carried out at MRES (paras 2.05 and 2.06), it is estimated that the project's
proposed heavy cleaning and maintenance operation could result in savings of up
to 15% of present water losses along the watercourse. Because the incremental
cost per acre is low (estimated to range from Rs 45.00 in Punjab to Rs 27.00
in Baluchistan), even small and short term production increases resulting from
increases in cropping intensities would generate very high returns. For exam-
ple, the accelerated improvement technology could generate economic returns
of more than 50% if water losses along watercourses are reduced only by 10%
(instead of the 15% feasible to achieve) for a period of 2 years. Since
benefits and life expectancy of the accelerated watercourse improvement are
difficult to predict, the economic benefits of this technology to be applied
to about 16,500 watercourses have not been quantified.
7.03      The project would also provide technical assistance to farmers to
precision level about 37,000 ac of land (para 3.11). Evaluation findings under
the Pilot Project showed that levelled fields were able to efficiently respond
to increased fertilizer inputs and improved water management practices. Also,
it was observed that reducing the range between maximum and minimum heights in
the fields resulted in some yield increases. Although attempts have been made
to quantify the benefits of land levelling it remains difficult to separate
the effects of land levelling, increases in farm inputs, and better cultural
practices. The evaluation findings, however, did clearly demonstrate that PPL
increases the efficiency of fertilizer utilization and of irrigation. Due to
limited data and to its small proportion of project costs, the benefits of PLL
were not quantified. Therefore, PLL is justified as a catalyst for increas-
ing agricultural production.
Employment and Income Effects
7.04      Because of increases in cropping intensities, the project is expected
to result in additional direct annual farm employment in the areas associated
with renovated watercourses of about 8.07 X mandays and a significant, but
non-quantified amount for watercourses with accelerated improvement. In addi-
tion, civil works proposed under the project would require farmer labor con-
tribution, of about 15.6 M mandays during the three-year construction period.
As the construction activities would be undertaken during slack labor periods,
it is expected that about 80% of this requirement would be supplied by family
labor. The value added in agriculture, plus the increases in input requirements
should also generate indirect additional employment opportunities for farm
families with excess family labor and for landless families.
7.05      Since all direct benefits of project works would come from increased
farm productivity, the distribution of benefits would largely follow the
existing pattern of land ownership. Thus, two thirds of intended beneficiaries
would be small farmers operating less than 12.5 ac, and with an estimated per
capita income below Pakistan's average per capita income of US$270. It is
estimated that about one third of the direct benefits would accrue to these
small farmers.



- 40 -
Direct Foreign Exchange Effects
7.06      Based on projected annual international prices expressed in January
1981 currency units, the project's annual gross foreign exchange value of
incremental production of tradeables is estimated at about US$64.8 M in PV
terms. Most of this would be derived from the production of wheat, rice
and cotton. After adjusting for foreign exchange costs of traded recurrent
inputs of US$16.2 M (PV), the project's identifiable direct foreign exchange
effect would total approximately US$48.6 M (PV).
Assumptions of the Economic Analysis
7.07      To assess the project's impact, the project area has been divided
into eight sub-areas using representative watercourse models. They are based
on the farm models discussed in paras 6.10-6.12 and account for Pakistan's
varied agro-climatic conditions, water quality, and watercourse improvement
technologies. Proposed watercourse improvements were tested on three prin-
cipal levels, i.e., chak, Province and project.
7.08      The economic analyses is based on the following assumptions:
(a)  Project Life, Phasing and Aggregation.  Given the technologies
to be implemented, the project would have an anticipated life
of 21 years. Renovated watercourses are expected to last
about 18 years. Project implementation would require three
years. Based on Pilot Project evaluations, the build-up of
production benefits were estimated at 60%, 80% and 100% in
the first to third years following completion of construc-
tion of each watercourse. Project full development would
be attained by 1987.
(b)  Prices.  For internationally traded goods, farmgate prices
were derived from the Bank's projected world market prices
expressed in January 1981 currency values. Appropriate
adjustments were made for freight, handling, processing and
quality differentials. The transport-related costs were
increased to take into account the projected increase in
real terms of energy prices (about 3% p.a.). Local costs
and locally valued benefits were expressed in border rupees
through application of estimated conversion factors, the
principal one being the Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of
0.90. To reflect the expected increased demand for labor
and the future labor trends, an increase of real wages of
3% p.a. was assumed for real wages during the 1981-90
period. Given the regional differences in Pakistan's labor
market and the limited availability of information, the
analysis used an overall weighted average wage rate for
rural unskilled labor. To account for the market season-
ality of labor demand and for future labor market trends,
the market wage rate for unskilled rural labor was adjusted
by a conversion factor of 0.80 during slack periods. The
market wage was assumed to be equal to the economic wage



- 41 -
during peak employment periods. Because the project's water
savings would be obtained at the lowest end of the irriga-
tion system, and therefore would not contribute to foregone
production, the shadow price of saved water was assumed
to equal zero. Year-specific farmgate prices have been used
for inputs and outputs over the 1980-90 period. Thereafter
prices were assumed to remain unchanged in real terms.
Pakistan is expected to be self-sufficient in wheat produc-
tion by the mid 1980s, but to account for possible production
fluctuations, the switch from a cif to an fob price was phased
out over a three-year period. Prices used in the economic
analysis are summarized in Annex 6, Table 2.
(c) Benefits. Incremental crop benefits are based on the most
probable production levels attainable with the project invest-
ments (see para 6.04). The estimates of water savings for
each of the models were based on research studies carried
out at MRES.
(d) Economic Project Costs. Costs for the economic analysis
exclude accelerated watercourse improvements, PLL, price
contingencies, and import duties and taxes. As earthen work
in the renovated watercourses is expected to last only six
years, economic costs include the required reinvestment costs
and incremental O&M cost during the project life.
(e) Farm Production Costs. Production cost includes both crop
and livestock input requirements. Total farm labor, including
family labor, was assessed according to the economic wages as
discussed in (b) above. Adjustment was made in the crop
production cost stream to reflect realistically the staggered
incurrence of costs and derivation of benefits in the farm
activities.
(f) Other Project Effects. The following effects have been omitted
from the quantitative economic analysis: (i) precision land
leveling; (ii) savings in farmer labor associated with irriga-
tion activities following watercourse improvements; and,
(iii) accelerated watercourse improvement program.
7.09     Based on the assumptions in para 7.08, the economic rates of return
(ERRs), net present values (NPVs), and switching values (SVs) for each model,
Province, and overall returns to the renovated watercourses are summarized
in Table 7.1.

/a   Switching value is the percentage change in the specified stream
(benefit or cost) that reduces the NPV to zero at the specified discount
rate (12% is assumed for Pakistan).
7.10      The overall ERR for investments on renovated watercourses is 45%
with a NPV of Rs 1,132 M (or US$114 M). The ERR for each model and Province
ensures that the project would be viable in all agro-ecological zones. The
wide variations in the ERR (from 21% to 77%) are due mainly to differences
among agro-climatic zones and groundwater quality. The differences between
the financial and economic results are due mainly to the differences in
financial and economic prices, and to a lesser extent to a different treatment
of investment and family labor costs. In general, ERRs tend to be higher for
models representing SGW areas or FGW areas without TW; the exception being the
rice/wheat model in Punjab, which has a TW with a moderate allocation of canal
water. This model presents the higher ERR among the models due primarily to
the high economic prices of rice (especially for the Basmati variety).
Project Risks and Sensitivity Tests
7.11      Based on the experience of the Pilot Project, the proposed project
incorporates a number of measures to minimize the project's risks. However,
full realization of the project's expected benefits could be adversely affected
by one or more of the following risks: (a) insufficient and/or untimely avail-
ability of funds at the Provincial level to carry out the project according to
the proposed implementation schedule (Annex 2); (b) shortfall in expected
water savings during the life of the project; (c) beneficiaries' weak response
to the additional water supply reflected in a slow build-up rate of estimated
full development benefits; (d) inadequate extension services; (e) inability of
Water Users Associations to adequately operate and maintain the watercourse



- 43 -
improvements. Sensitivity tests were made to assess the impact of these risks
if they were to materialize. The switching values (Table 7.1) show that the
project can absorb a substantial amount of shock and still remain economically
viable. Table 7.2 summarizes sensitivity tests expressed in terms of switch-
ing values on some of the more probable risks.
7.12      The economic viability of the renovated watercourses is more sensi-
tive to decreased water savings and delays in reaching full benefits than to
increases in construction or production costs. Assuming the wage rate for
unskilled rural labor equals the market rate (or increases by 34%), the ERR
is still 37%. The renovated improvements would remain viable (ERR of 12%),
even with an unlikely combination of a 15% increase in cost, 15% decrease in
expected water savings, and a delay of the full development benefits by one
year.

ON FARM WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Procedures for Operation of Civil Works Imprest Account
1.        A "Civil Works Imprest Account", hereafter referred to as "Imprest
Account", would be opened in the State Bank of Pakistan by the Director General,
Federal Water Management Cell (Federal Cell), Ministry of Food, Agriculture
and Cooperatives.
2.        The Federal Cell, through the Finance Division, would authorize the
Provinces of Baluchistan, NWFP, Punjab, and Sind to open sub-accounts (Personal
Ledger Accounts - PLAs) in the Treasury for purposes of receiving funds from
Imprest Account, depositing amounts representing their share and making pay-
ments for civil works items eligible for financing from the proceeds of IDA
Credit. These sub-accounts (PLAs) would be operated by each Provincial
On-Farm Water Management (OFWM) Director General/Director.
3.        An aggregate amount of Rupees 5.9 milion, representing all four
Provinces' initial contributions to their own sub-account (PLA), would be
deposited by the Provincial Governments. Each Province's share is estimated
as follows: Baluchistan Rs .20 million, NWFP Rs .30 million, Punjab Rs 4.5
million, and Sind Rs .9 million.
4.        Promptly after the Effective Date for the project, IDA would with-
draw Rupees 23.2 million from the Credit Account for deposit in the Imprest
Account, under intimation to Economic Affairs Department (EAD). The Federal
Water Management Cell would transfer the Provincial Shares to the sub-accounts
(PLAs) under intimation to Provincial Planning and Development and Finance
Departments. The amounts to be transferred from the Imprest Account to each
sub-account (PLA) are as follows: Baluchistan Rs .7 million, NWFP Rs 1.2
million, Punjab Rs 17.5 million and Sind Rs 3.8 million.
5.        Payments from the sub-accounts (PLAs) would be exclusively for
civil works. All withdrawals from the sub-account (PLA) by the OFWM Director
General/Director would be in accordance with the procedures prescribed by each
Provincial Government for operation of PLAs (sub-accounts). Copies of these
procedures would be forwarded to IDA. Check to withdraw funds from the sub-
account (PLA) would be signed by the OFWM Director General/Director and
co-signed by an appropriate officer designated by the Provincial Government,
preferably outside the OFWM Directorates. All documents substantiating any
payment made from the sub-accounts (PLAs) would be retained by the OFWM
Directorate in each Province.
6.        OFWM Director General/Director would submit to the Federal Water
Management Cell a monthly statement of expenditures verified by the team
leader of the supervisory consulting team.

7.        The Federal Water Management Cell, on the basis of monthly statements
received from the OFWM Directorates, would prepare Reimbursement Applications
for certificatin and signature of the Federal Government's representative duly
authorized to sign the withdrawal applications. IDA would withdraw from the
Credit Account the reimbursable amounts and remit them to the Imprest Account.
8.        A monthly statement of the Imprest Account prepared by the State
Bank of Pakistan reflecting all transactions during the month would be for-
warded by the Federal Water Management Cell to the IDA through EAD.
9.        With each application for reimbursement, the OFWM Directorate would
attach a certificate to the effect that an amount equivalent to at least 20% 1/
of the claim had already been maintained/deposited in the Provincial sub-
account (PLA).
10.       If for any reason IDA disallows or reduces the claim submitted by
the Federal Water Management Cell, the Cell would cause other appropriate
financial arrangements to be made by the respective Provincial Government
for smooth operation of the project. For expenditure held to be ineligible,
the concerned Provincial Government would be required to make up the amount
in the sub-account (PLA).
11.       The Imprest Account and also the sub-accounts (PLAs) would be
audited in accordance with para 4.09 of the Staff Appraisal Report.
12.       No further deposit to the Imprest Account would be made vien IDA's
participation in financing the civil works component had reached the equiva-
lent of SDR 24.4.
13.       GOP would obtain from the State Bank of Pakistan and furnish to IDA
any information relating to the Imprest Account or sub-accounts (PLAs) as IDA
may reasonably request.
1/   Inclusive of 15% of possible IFAD share.  Upon approval of IFAD loan this

1/  Economic prices for internationally traded commodities are based on the Bank's latest updating
of commodity price forecasts (memo from Commodities and Export Division, 11/12/80).
2/ Import-based price in 1980/81, but export-based price in 1990/91 to account for expected
production increases. This price switch from a cif to fob basis was phased over four years in
the mid-1980s.
3/ Export-based price.
4/ 553 is for 1980/81, and 231 is for 1981/82; the 1980/81 price level is unusually high; therefore,
the 1981/82 price figure is a more accurate indication of price trends.
5/ Local price converted into border rupees at the estimated Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of .90.
6/ Accounts for both the shadow price of labor (about .8) during the slack period and the SCF.

/ Cropping patterns & yields were estimated using the Indus Basin Standard Model and are shown in Annex 5, Table 1.  Maximizing objective function of the
polygon model is tarm income less premiom for the riskiness of the cropping pattern. Analysis done in 1990 prices expressed in 1981 currency oaloes.
Water losses along the watercourse were assumed to decrease from 44% without project to 25% with project. Built-up rate was assumed to be
60%, 807,, 100% for lot to 3rd year after completion of project works.
2/ Average of 162 hours/farm family; based on the 2,000 farm families agro-economic surveyed carried out by WAPDA on 1978 for RAP and use in the Indus
Basin Standard Model.
3/ Rs 43,485/watercourse; total conmmad area of 390 an per watercourse.
4/ Rs 30,280/watercourse for initial investment and at Rl  13,755/watercourse for earthen reinvestment; 20% of required unskilled labor would be hired labor
5/ Rs 1,230/watercourse for cost of materials and skilled labor.
6/ Includes all cash inper estimated using the Indus Basin Standard Model.
7/ Based on current water charge rates.
8/ Full cost of materials and skilled labor; Rs 43,485/watercourse with 10% hard lining.
9/ No repayment would be required for Baluchistan beneficiaries.
IO/ A 12% interest rate per annum over total cash production costs.
ll/ Cost of family labor was valued at market rate.
12/ Farmers would hire labor only if demand for labor in a given period exceeds supply of family labor.
3/ Rs 5,220/watercourse for incremental O&M costs; all would be family labor.
14/ 80% of the unskilled labor required for investment ind reinvestment would be done by family labor.
-1 10% of net benefit after financing.
16/ Net benefit after financing but before water charges and repayment less coat of family labor and managenent fee.
17/ Implicit land rent with project less implicit land rent without the project of respective years.                                                               79
