IVORY COAST
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
CHAPTER I
THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE/DRAINAGE SECTORS
Water Resources and Climate
1.01      Ivory Coast has two rainy seasons in the south, May-July and
October-November, which gradually merge into one season further north.
Although rainfall is heaviest along the coast, with an average rainfall of
about 2,000 mm/year in Abidjan, there are large annual variations between
1,500 and 3,000 mm/year. Rain intensities in Abidjan are high especially
for short periods, for example 115 mm/hour for a 15-minute period. Four
rivers running north-south constitute the principal surface water resources.
The coastal zone from Sassandra to the Ghanaian border is the only area with
good aquifers yielding ground water in large quantities.
General Country Population and Service Levels
1.02      In population size, the Ivory Coast ranks fourth in West Africa
(after Nigeria, Ghana and Camer 2on), with about seven million people on
a land area of about 330,000 km . During the last ten years, the indigenous
portion of its population has grown at an average annual rate of about 2.5%,
and because of immigration from neighboring countries its total population
has grown at an average rate of about 4%. General population growth coupled
with rural-urban migration, have resulted in rapid urbanization, the propor-
tion of urban to total population having increased from 13% in 1955 to about
34% in 1975. Abidjan has been the prime focus of urban growth, with a popu-
lation now over a million. Bouake has about 200,000 inhabitants while the
rest of the cities have populations lower than 50,000.
1.03      As of the fall of 1976, Abidjan, Bouake and 56 other urban centers
had piped water facilities. Water systems are generally well equipped and
maintained. In Abidjan 50% of the population has direct access to piped
water; the other 50% is served from public and private standpipes. In the
interior urban centers about 15% of the inhabitants have direct access to
potable water, the remainder being served by standpipes and wells. Data
on rural water supply facilities are scant, but an inventory of wells is
underway. At present, it is estimated that about 1,000 wells or boreholes
exist. The Government is presently carrying out an ambitious investment
program to reduce the disparities in living conditions between the capital
city of Abidjan and the rest of the country.
1.04      Apart from some rudimentary sewerage/drainage systems in the larger
cities of the interior (e.g., Bouake, San Pedro and Man), only Abidjan has
significant sewerage/drainage infrastructure. However, only about 25% of its



-2-
population is served by the sewerage system; an additional 10%, mostly in
the wealthier areas, are served by septic tanks. Because of the high urban
densities, increasing water consumption and continuing rapid population growth
rate, expansion of the sewerage system is essential. In the interior centers,
sewage disposal is fragmentary, and people rely mostly on septic tanks and
pit latrines and surface drainage. This has not created significant health
problems to date, because of the combination of low urban densities and low
per capita water consumption.
Abidjan Urban Planning
1.05      One of the Bank's objectives in financing part of Abidjan's urban
development was to develop a programming capability which would re-examine
urban sector priorities and define a balanced investment program for Aibidjan
under capital constraints. To this end, the Government agreed, under the
first Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project (loan 1076-IVC), to carry out
a detailed urban infrastructure study for Abidjan for the period 1978--1985.
This study was subsequently financed under the Abidjan Urban Development
Project (loan 1347-IVC). The study (henceforth called the "10-year Develop-
ment Study") will inter alia inventory available investment programs (in-
cluding sewerage and drainage) for the period 1979-1988. The study commenced
in June 1977 and is expected to be completed by early 1979. Considering the
leadtime of 1-2 years to prepare investment programs for actual implementation,
this study is expected to have a tangible impact on investments as of 1980/81.
Organization of the Sector
1.06      Since reorganization in 1974, the sector's basic responsibilities
are divided as follows:
(a) The Government, through the Ministry of Public Works,
Transport, Construction and Urbanism, establishes sector
policies, is responsible for the establishment of water
and sewerage tariffs and of master plans, establishes
sector regulations and provides technical supervision
("tutelle") to SETU, the main sewerage sector entity
(see (b) below). By contrast in the water sector,
the Ministry has not only the same broad overseeing
functions, but also carries out the investment programs;
(b) The Societe d'Equipement des Terrains Urbains (SETU), a
Government corporation, is responsible for the planning,
design, construction operation and maintenance of sewer-
age works. These functions are carried out by SETU's
Sewerage and Drainage Department (SETU-SDD). SETU has
also the responsibility for urban land development;
1/   Henceforth called Ministry of Public Works.

(c)  The Ministry of Finance exercises the ultimate financial
supervision of the sub-sectors by overseeing the FNA
(see (d) below). It also, through its Taxation Department
(Direction des Impots), bills and remits to the FNA the
drainage taxes;
(d)  The Fonds National d'Assainissement (FNA) is responsible for
the financial control and financing of the sewerage sector.
This fund centralizes all sector receipts and payments, and
oversees sector operations, investments and financial
plans. A similar fund (FNH) exists for the water supply
sector; and
(e)  The Societe de Distribution d'Eau de la Cote d'Ivoire
(SODECI), a private company, actually operates and main-
tains the sewerage and drainage systems in Abidjan under
a contract with SETU, signed in mid-1976. SODECI also
bills and collects the sewerage taxes on behalf of the
FNA. SODECI's main activity is to operate all water
systems in the Ivory Coast.
The organization chart for the sector is given in Chart 1-1; detailed
descriptions of each of the principal sector entities are given in
Chapter IV.
1.07      The organizational set-up is based on a sound rationale, and ex-
perience has shown that it is effective. The principal idea behind the
reorganizations in the water and sewerage/drainage sectors was to create
dynamic organizations to carry out the Government's large investment programs.
As local staff was not readily available, expatriate consultants provided the
entire initial staffing. Eventual replacement by Ivorians is envisaged (see
para. 1.08 on manpower). To minimize the lengthy government procedures,
a certain degree of autonomy was given to the new organizations to allow more
latitude in procurement and staff remuneration. The water supply sector,
which is presently carrying out most of its construction work in the interior,
was placed directly under ministerial authority while the sewerage/drainage
sectors (mostly for Abidjan) were placed with SETU. A second objective in the
reorganization was to provide the sectors with their own sources of revenue so
as to make them self-financing, and to establish investment funds separate
from the Government's general budget. As the sectors also depend for their
funding on foreign aid and loans, the administration of the funds (FNH and
FNA) was delegated to the government's debt management agency, the Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement.
Manpower and Training
1.08      The public civil works sector in the Ivory Coast, and the sewerage
and drainage sector in particular, is heavily dependent on expatriate t:echni-
cians and managers. This is also the case for the private sector. At
the source of this dependence is the lack of qualified Ivorian civil engineers



- 5--
and technicians. The present public works school graduates only about 30
civil engineers and 40 technicians per year, which is insufficient to fill
the needs of the whole public works sector. Furthermore, the level of civil
engineering education hardly reaches the undergraduate level. No specialized
courses in sanitary engineering exist.
1.09      The Ministry of Public Works is constructing a new 1,400 person
capacity public works school in Yamousoukro. The project was approved by the
President of the Ivory Coast in October 1976, and construction completion is
scheduled for late 1978. The feasibility studies for the school were pre-
pared by the French consultants BCEOM and financed by the Bank under the fifth
highway project (1161-IVC). Although the BCEOM-proposed curriculum did not
include specialized sanitary engineering courses, the Bank has discussed the
eventual inclusion of these courses with the Government. Detailed projections
of requirements for the higher and middle level sanitary engineering personnel
are not possible for the total water supply, sewerage and drainage sectors,
as manpower data are fragmentary. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that (a) the Government will conduct a survey of manpower requirements and
training needs and prepare a manpower development program for the water supply
and sewerage/drainage sector, in accordance with Terms of Reference to be
agreed before June 30, 1979, and implement any jointly agreed conclusions of
the study by June 30, 1980. Financing of this survey is included under the
Bank loan. Financing of the training program recommended by this study could
be included under the next Water Supply Project, currently scheduled for
FY80.
1.10      Technical training below engineering levels generally produces
graduates with insufficient skills and high job expectations. To accommodate
its own staffing requirements, SODECI created its own training center in 1974,
where it provides the required specialized training for its new staff. It
uses this center also for the recycling of its own staff. The manpower
development program will review the suitability of present technical training
at lower levels, and make recommendations on the optimal use of SODECI's
training center.
Sector Program and Priorities
1.11      As a result of the dynamic urban growth in the Ivory Coast and
particularly in Abidjan, the Government decided in 1973 to give extra
attention to two priority areas:
(i)  the development of water supply systems in the interior
towns and of village wells, as the Abidjan system was
already well-developed; and
(ii)  the development of sewerage and drainage systems in
Abidjan, the city with the most serious deficiencies
in this sector.

Water Supply Development
1.12      The development of public water supplies has been successful.  Five
to ten new systems are constructed per year, and the expansion of the 30 old
systems, including Abidjan, is proceeding systematically. The village well
drilling program has also had a good start, and a second program for the
construction of another 1,000 village wells was contracted in November 1977.
Sewerage and Drainage Development
1.13      The primary focus for this sector has been on the only large high
urban density area, Abidjan. In 1974-1975, under UNDP financed, a 10-year
(1975-1985) sewerage and drainage development program was developed by the
consultants Holfelder-SCET. This program's principal objectives were:
(i)  to eliminate high priority problems, including flood
damage, serious health hazards, and severe localized
pollution;
(ii)  to help create an institutional framework with autono-
mous financial resources within which the sewerage and
drainage sector could be developed; and
(iii)  to execute a long-term development program of sewerage
and drainage for the greater Abidjan area initially,
and later,for the rest of the country. The elements
of this program are essential for the orderly develop-
ment of the Ivory Coast urban sector.
1.14      The ten-year sewerage and drainage program for Abidjan was divided
into three phases, 1975-1978, 1979-1981 and 1982-1985. The first part of
this first phase is financed by the Bank under the First Abidjan Sewerage and
Drainage Project (US$7.8 million under loan 1076-IVC, report no. 580a-IVC),
while the second part is also financed by the Bank under the Abidjan Urban
Development Project (US$7.0 million under loan 1347-IVC, report no. 1892a-IVC).
The first project includes the high priority works of drainage for Treichville,
the Plateau-Adjame trunk sewer and primary sewers on the BANCO (see map IBRD
13256). The second project includes the extension of the Plateau-Adjame trunk
sewer to Abobo, the construction of primary sewers on Koumassi and Abobo, as
well as secondary and tertiary systems in parts of Abobo, Adjame and Koumassi.
1.15      The second phase constitutes the proposed project (see para. 3.03)
and consists principally of providing more of the collection network and a
part of the main trunk sewer. The third phase will see the interconnection
of the trunk sewer elements built under the first and second project, and the
construction of the last trunk sewer element leading to the ocean outfall,
plus the ocean outfall itself.

1.16      In addition to the above works, the Government is proposing con-
struction of a drainage canal, including laterals on the Ile de Bassam. This
canal will permit the drainage of a marsh area east of Marcory, above Koumassi
and adjacent to the Treichville industrial zone, and make it accessible for
urban development. The cost of these works, estimated at US$17 million, will
be borne by the Government budget.
Preparation for the 1980-1990 Water Supply and Sanitation Decade
1.17      The United Nations have designated the period 1980-1990 as the Inter-
national Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade. All developing countries have
been asked by the U.N. Water Conference in 1977 to prepare by 1980 detailed
investment plans, including identification of necessary financial and manpower
resources to provide all people with access to safe drinking water, and to the
extent possible with sanitation, by 1990. The investment plans and financial
and human resources needed would be reviewed in 1980 by a special meeting of
the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and a plan
would be prepared to mobilize these resources.
1.18      Even prior to the UN conference the Government, in order to be able
to assess the results and remaining needs of the total urban water supply,
sewerage and drainage sector, had begun taking the following actions:
(i) it has contracted consultants (SCET-SAUR) to make a
water supply and resources masterplan study for Abidjan,
up to the year 2000, during 1977-1978;
(ii) it has agreed with the Bank on a tariff study under the
Bank-financed Secondary Centers Water Supply Project
(loan 1484-IVC, report no. 1484a-IVC) to be executed
during 1978; terms of reference have been agreed upon,
and consultants' proposals will be requested in early 1978;
(iii)  it has contracted with the consulting group Santafric (Secelye,
Stevenson, Value and Knight (USA) with Safege (France)), to
make a sector study for sewerage and drainage in the 55 urban
centers above 5,000 inhabitants in the interior during 1978;
(iv) under the proposed project, feasibility studies will be under-
taken for the third phase of Abidjan sewerage and drainage
(1981-1985), and a new ten-year development plan (1981-1990)
will be prepared.
The above studies should give sufficient information to the Government
so that it can set its targets and establish its investment requirements
for the Water Supply and Sanitation Decade.



-9-
Performance under Previous Bank Lending
1.19      The performance under the first project (Loan 1076-IVC) has been
good considering the youth of the sector organizations created during 1975-
1976. The works are well executed and will be completed by the fall of 1978,
about one year behind schedule. The initial delays in execution of works by
SETU-SDD were principally due to longer than expected start-up times of SETU-
SDD and a new pipe manufacturer. Bid awards, contract signatures and payments
have taken much longer than expected, due to government procedures. However,
now that personnel of SETU, the contractors and the FNA personnel are familiar
with these procedures, a much better performance is expected. Further improve-
ments are expected with the reinforcement of the FNA management by an expatri-
ate manager to be provided under the Bank's financed Secondary Centers Water
Supply Project. Project costs are expected to be about 10% higher than
originally estimated. Apart from failure to properly complete an agreed pro-
perty tax study, all major covenants (establishment of a drainage tax, estab-
lishment of the FNA and a separate sewerage/drainage department within SETU,
subcontracting of system maintenance, revenue covenant and separation of
SETU's accounts) have been met. Fulfillment of some other covenants (sector
regulations, audit, additional accounting refinements) has been delayed but
will be met by the end of 1978 (paras. 2.11, 4.09, 4.10, 4.14). The commence-
ment of the property tax study will be a condition of this Loan (para. 6.27).
The major sewerage and drainage works included in the Urban Project which
started two years later, are being. executed according to the appraisal time
schedule and should be ready in early 1979.
1.20      The first Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project has been conducive
to the creation of a second concrete products (pipes, manholes, etc.) manu-
facturer in the Ivory Coast. This was possible by creating, together with
the general urban land development department of SETU, a bid lot for concrete
and plastic pipes large enough to attract international competitive bidding.
Several European pipe manufacturers bid, and the contract was awarded to the
lowest bidder, a newly-created Danish-Ivorian Government contractor, who
offered to construct the new plant with partial financing by Danish develop-
ment aid. The new pipe factory is now producing the necessary quality pipe,
previously not manufactured locally, and this has incited the other local
factory to improve the quality of its products. Plastic pipes were already
extruded by a local Lebanese-French factory, SOTICI. Following international
tenders for the pipe supply for the sewerage and drainage and the secondary
centers water supply project, SOTICI has begun manufacturing PVC pipes of
larger diameters (200-350 mm) which replace imported ductile cast iron pipes.
A summary market survey has shown that there is probably sufficient markets
to justify establishment of a factory for plastic sanitary equipment (shower
stalls, wash basins, etc.) which should result in substantial costs savings on
the presently imported porcelain equipment. Ivorian-French entrepreneurs are
presently exploring the possibility of installing such a factory.
1.21      The Secondary Centers Water Supply Project which was signed on
September 9, 1977 is expected to become effective in March 1978. Tenders
for 60% of the project have been received and are within 5% of the appraisal
estimate.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT AREA
General
2.01      Abidjan's population has grown eight fold since 1955, from 125,000
inhabitants to about 1.2 million in 1977. With the opening of the Vridi Canal
in 1950 and the creation of a deep water port, Abidjan became the metropolis
of the Ivory Coast in addition to being the country's administrative center.
Abidjan's initial development began in Treichville (next to the harbor) and
on the "Plateau"; Treichville developed into a residential area and a center
for commerce, whereas the Plateau became the center for Government and large
business. All the existing central urban areas are becoming more densely
populated, with high-rise buildings on the Plateau and restructuring and fill-
ing of unoccupied spaces in and around Adjame-Treichville.
2.02      In general, Abidjan's urban expansion is orderly and coordinated.
The city is developing along the lines of a 1974 master plan, which is modi-
fied according to needs. One major factor in this orderly development is that
the preparation for construction of new urban areas is practically exclusively
in the hands of SETU.  It simultaneously constructs the service roads with
all the required infrastructure; an efficient method which is also the most
economical. In addition, SETU also restructures some of the oldest areas
using the same methods.
Existing Water Supply
2.03      Abidjan has an extensive and well-operated water supply system.  Its
investment and operating costs are low because of the favorable location of
the city on top of an exceptionally productive aquifer. At the end of 1976,
about 50% of the population had house connections while the remainder of the
population was serviced by the numerous closely-spaced private water sales
points and a few public fountains.
2.04      To improve direct water supply service to the people, the Government
introduced a very low-cost house connection program in 1977, and it is expected
that 75% of the population will be serviced by house connection by 1985. This
program provides low volume 0 15 mm "social connections" and is principally
oriented towards the poorer 50% of the population. The only partial payment
required is a returnable deposit of US$40 to guarantee payment of consumed
water. The construction cost of the social connection is borne by the revenue
of the water tariff. There are no physical constraints on the implementation
of this program as the Abidjan system is developed in all the urbanized areas
of the city and has sufficient capacity and SODECI has a well-organized
connection service. To guarantee continuous development of the Abidjan water
supply system, consultants are making a water supply master plan for Abidjan
for the next decade (para 1.18).



- II -
Existing Sewerage and Drainage Systems
2.05      The present sewerage and drainage situation in Abidjan is unsatis-
factory, largely, as a result of inadequate and uncoordinated development
prior to 1975, coupled with continuing rapid population growth. Several
agencies such as the Ministry of Public Works and the Municipality as well as
the housing developers, have constructed sewers and drains without coordina-
tion, a master plan, or standard design practices. As a result many of the
pipes are undersized or have inadequate slopes. Maintenance has been sporadic
and inadequate. Much of the old system has been constructed using low quality
concrete pipes with cement joints, which were easily corroded by the sulfuric
acid generated by septic sewage caused by blockages and inadequate slopes.
However, this situation is a slowly being reversed now that SODECI has been
given the full responsibility for the maintenance of the systems (para. 4.18).
SODECI has started to clean and rehabilitate the priority points in the
systems and is preparing together with SETU an intensified action program
which will be coordinated with the rehabilitation program of the proposed
loan. The total length of the Abidjan sewerage and drainage systems is 380
km, of which 160 km are gullies and 220 km pipes, about 180 km are sewer pipes
(combined and separate systems).
2.06      The consultants estimate that the present sewerage system serves
about 25% of the city's population, in addition to the 10% served by septic
tanks. The present sewage disposal systems can be categorized as follows
(for location of areas, see schematic map IBRD 13406):
(a) by septic tanks and pit latrines, essentially in old
Koumassi, Marcory residential, West Cocody and zone
4C in Treichville;
(b) by combined systems, essentially on the Plateau. Although
the systems in part of Treichville, Cocody and Adjame were
designed as separate systems, they do function as combined
systems now;
(c) by separate systems, in the areas recently developed by
SETU and some housing developers; Banco, Deux Plateaux,
parts of Williamsville, Riviera Abobo, Vridi and Koumassi;
(d) by unorganized mixture of systems, essentially Treichville
zones 3 and 4B, Vridi, Adjame, Attiecoube, Abobo, Marcory
and Koumassi.
Numerous sewers discharge into the open lagoons surrounding Abidjan, where
septic tank sludge collected by the trucking companies is also discharged. A
number of small treatment stations exist for individual housing developments
or public installations such as hospitals. These installations are poorly
operated by their owners, due to lack of maintenance, theft of equipment and
shortage of trained operating personnel. They will be connected to the
sewer system on completion of construction of the collectors.

2.07      The surface drainage in Abidjan is collected by a system composed
of 2/3 gullies and 1/3 pipes. The system is often underdimensioned and
badly-maintained. As a result, during the rainy season, roads in the low-
lying areas are flooded for relatively short times, while the higher areas
with large slopes suffer from flash floods. Consequently, the damage to
roads, houses and other properties is often considerable.
Design Concept
2.08      Abidjan's system is now being developed as a separate system instead
of the original combined system (para 6.08). Drainage run-off is disposed by
the shortest routes to the surrounding lagoons without pumping. Sewage is
discharged through diffusers into the lagoons as an intermediate solution;
under the final solution it will be transported by one large collector sewer
system to a single ocean outfall. The existing combined systems will dis-
charge four times its dry weather flow into the central sewer system, with the
diluted excess flows discharging via overflows into the lagoons. The proposed
system will be compatible with any development strategy likely to be recom-
mended under the 10-year development plan (para 1.05).
Sanitary Conditions
2.09      Sanitary conditions are worst in the medium and lower income low-
lying areas of Treichville, Marcory, Koumassi and Blokosso, closely followed
by the areas on higher grounds of Abobo and Adjame, Attiecoube. Disease
rates for waterborne diseases (cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery and
hepatitis) are higher in the low-lying areas, largely as a result of the use
of contaminated private wells. Private wells are too expensive for low income
families to construct on the higher grounds because of the increased depth
to the ground water table. The water table below the higher grounds, used
by the SODECI for the Abidjan potable water supply system, is sufficiently
protected by clay layers in the 50-60 m overlaying soil. SODECI abandoned all
its wells on the low-lying areas when it found sharply increasing nitrate
levels which are an indication of pollution.
2.10      Pollution levels in the lagoons are high in the shallow dead-end
parts where little flow is generated by the tidal effect or the seasonal
heavy rainfall. Large deposits of organic sludge have built up in these
areas, and health hazards as well as foul odors close to housing and well-
travelled highways are a frequent occurrence. During the rainy season,
a large outflow from the lagoons takes place through Vridi Canal, partly
because of the local drainage, and also because the lagoons are part of
the Komoe river delta. The connection with the sea through the Vridi Canal
has created strong currents through this passage all year round, which
are very favorable for the dilution of the sewage effluents when discharged
at the proper points in the central lagoon system. With this good dilution,
the lagoons are capable of naturally treating a sizable organic waste load
(para. 3.13).

Sewerage and Drainage Regulations
2.11      Sewerage and drainage regulations were prepared by SETU's consultant
under the first project. The regulations are now in the hands of the Sewerage
and Drainage Department of the Ministry of Public Works, for the preparation
of promulgation as decrees in 1978. The proposed regulations include:
(a) design rules for the public sewerage and drainage
systems;
(b)  authorization procedures for service connections;
(c)  design rules for household treatment facilities in
urban areas (septic tanks);
(d)  authorization procedures and rules for dumping of
polluted materials (septic tank sludge, etc.); and
(e)  rules for disposal of industrial liquid wastes.
2.12      Under terms of the first Abidjan sewerage project, these regulations
should have taken effect before end 1976; however the lengthy consultations
with the interested parties gathered in the National Committee for Public
Hygiene have deiayed progress. As rapid effectiveness of these regulations is
necessary to develop the sector further, especially for establishing a sewage
connection program and, increasing the effectiveness of the system maintenance,
agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations that the above-
mentioned decrees will be promulgated by December 3.1, 1978.
CHAPTER III
THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01      The overall project objectives are to develop the Abidjan sewerage
and drainage system and the institutions responsible for this system. In
particular:
(a)  to develop an institutional framework with staffing
to assure a competent management of the sewerage and
drainage sector;
(b)  to provide the trunk and primary sewers and drains
which will permit the development of a sewerage and
drainage collection system necessary for the orderly
development of Abidjan;



- 15 -
(c)  to relieve the water pollution of the badly-affected dead-end
parts of the lagoons around Abidjan;
(d)  to establish a regular maintenance and repair service for
the sewerage and drainage system;
(e)  to assist SETU and SODECI in establishing a house connection
program and administration for Abidjan, including the study
of appropriate credit facilities for connections and the
installation of sanitary equipment in the houses; and
(f) to develop small entrepreneurs (especially plumbers), and
encourage local production of sanitary equipment.
Scope of the Project
3.02      The proposed project, which is the second of a three part 10-year
development program for sewerage and drainage in Abidjan, would include the
construction of the second part of the main trunk sewer which, when completed
in the third phase, will dispose of the sewerage of the central area of
Abidjan through an ocean outfall. The project will also develop the primary
sewers in adjacent areas to this trunk sewer (Treichville, Koumassi, Abobo and
Williamsville). Where necessary it will provide for construction of the addi-
tional sewer network and house connections. Primary sewers will be built in
newly-developed urban areas on the Banco. Drainage collectors will be con-
structed in parallel at the same time where population densities warrant it in
these above-mentioned areas. The project will make it possible to increase
the population served by sewer connection from presently 35% to 56% in 1980
and to 75% in 1985. A road surfacing component was added for the Marcory
area, as this was essential in constructing an orderly drainage system.
Provision is also made under the project for consultants' services, technical
assistance and training.
Project Description

- 18 -
3.05      The estimated total cost of the project net of taxes is US$53.1
million. Inclusive of US$11.7 million taxes, mostly value added tax (VAT),
the cost would be US$64.8 million. Foreign exchange costs would amount to
US$33.0 million or 62% of the total expenditures net of taxes. The foreign
exchange component is based on consultants' estimates of the direct and
indirect foreign exchange components of each relevant category. The cost
estimates are based on quantity take-offs made by the consultants from pre-
liminary design plans and unit costs of similar works now under construction,
adjusted to price levels expected to provide in early 1978. Final design and
construction supervision is estimated at 6.5% of the construction cost. The
500 man-months for consulting services are estimated at an average equivalent
base cost of $7,800 per man-month. A 15% allowance for physical contingencies
was added to the base costs. To provide for price escalation during the
project execution, annual inflation rates of 12% for civil works and 8% for
equipment procurement through the project execution period have been assumed.
These inflation rates are based on the trend of price increases, as recorded
by the Government's contract recording office. This trend is expected to last
for the project execution period of the next four years because of (i) high
demand on the construction market in Ivory Coast, and (ii) continuing high
inflation in France to which the Ivory Coast economy is tightly bound in trade
and in currency. Import duties are not payable on equipment and materials
purchased for use on Bank-financed sewerage/drainage projects in Ivory
Coast.
Loan Amount
3.06      A Bank loan of US$33 million is proposed which would cover the esti-
mated foreign exchange component. The balance of the project costs would be
financed by FNA's own resources and by other funds/loans provided by the
Government (paras. 6.10 to 6.13).
Implementation
3.07      SETU-SDD will be responsible for carrying out the project.  Final
design of the project started in February 1978. These consultants have given
full satisfaction during the first Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project. To
increase future competition among consultants, the Government intends to ask
for proposals from several firms for the other studies to be financed under
the project. One of the important requirements for any of the SETU-SDD
consultants will be that they execute the major part of the design work in
Abidjan. This has the two-fold purpose of ensuring better coordination with
SETU-SDD and training Ivorian draughtsmen and technicians.
3.08      To provide in-service training for Ivorian supervisory staff in
SETU, SETU-SDD's own staff will execute project construction supervision
and administration, while qualified expatriate engineers will be recruited to
fill the responsible SETU-SDD supervisory engineering positions. It is esti-
mated that one engineer and one assistant engineer are necessary to supervise
the construction of US$4 million of works per year. At negotiations, SETU



- 19 -
agreed to a staffing chart for its project supervision division and to dates
for recruitment of experienced in-house or consulting staff to fill the re-
sponsible positions. A bar chart of the works program is shown on Annex 3-3.
The project is expected to be completed in the period of December 1981-June
1982.
Bank Project Supervision
3.09      In addition to the normal IBRD project supervision activities, IBRD
staff will assist the Government and SETU in the review of:
(a) long range investment planning for the sector;
(b) planning and studies to promote local contractor
and industry participation;
(c) the feasibility studies for the planned ocean outfall
system and the third and last project of the ten-year
development program; and
(d) preparation of the manpower development program for
technical and managerial sector staff.
Procurement
3.10      All construction and supply contracts would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank group guidelines.
Local companies, most of which are fully or partially owned by foreign firms,
are expected to furnish most, if not all, of the concrete gravity flow pipes
as well as the plastic pipes for the project. Electro-mechanical equipment
and pipes and equipment for pressure lines are not manufactured locally and
will be procured from abroad. The connection program will be executed par-
tially by the contractors who win the bids for laying the sewer pipes as well
as by small local contractors for the individual connections in areas with
existing systems.
Prior Contracting and Retroactive Financing
3.11      To achieve rapid improvement of the property tax collection service
and cadastre, as well as a timely start of the final design, consultants to
provide these services should start work soon, if possible by early 1978.
Advance contracting is proposed for these contracts (estimated to cost about
US$2 million), with retroactive financing for an amount not to exceed
US$500,000.

Loan Disbursements
3.12      Loan proceeds would be disbursed so as to reflect the estimated
foreign exchange component of the project, as follows:
Amount Million US$
(i) 60% of the total cost for locally
manufactured and procured pipes                       6.2
(ii) 100% of the full CIF cost of all direct
imports or 70% of the cost of locally
procured imported equipment                           1.3
(iii)  45% of the total cost for pipe laying                13.2

Environmental Aspects
3.13      The project and program will improve sanitary conditions in the city
and eliminate the sewage outfalls in dead-end parts of the lagoons, which are
overloaded with organic pollutants at present.  It will make optimal use of
the natural purification capacity of the lagoons by disposing sewage through
diffusers in parts of the lagoons where the best dilution can be expected,
thus preventing overloading the lagoons. When the ocean outfall is in
operation, these diffusers will be closed, but conserved for emergency use.
It is expected that the sewage load in the lagoons will approach the limit
of inacceptable levels around 1985, when it is planned that the ocean outfall
should come into operation. In the proposed project, the sewage outfalls
into the Baie de Marcory will be closed and the sewage of the Treichville-
Marcory area will be discharged in the middle of the Baie de Bietri. The
few polluting industries along the north-west side of the lagoon de Bietri
will be obliged to take measures to control their pollution. These industries
will be permitted to discharge light organic polluted sewage in the central
sewer system; however, the discharges of chemical wastes, floating fats and
oils will have to be removed by the industries themselves. The latter pol-
lutants are poisonous to the environment or progressively block sewers. The
sewer regulations to be implemented by December 31, 1978 (para. 2.12) include
provisions to limit discharges of these wastes. The recuperation of fats and
oils is often in the interest of the industries themselves.

Monitoring Criteria
3.14      Annex 3-4 shows the key indicators which would be monitored by
SETU during project execution to measure the achievement of the technical,
financial, administrative and training goals set for the proposed project.
The key indicators will form an important part of the data on which supervi-
sion mission can evaluate the sector development and the projects, and discuss
sector performance with the Ivorian authorities.
CHAPTER IV
THE BORROWER AND THE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS
4.01      As under the first loan (1076-IVC) the Government would be the
borrower. The funds related to the sewerage/drainage works will be on-lent
to the FNA while SETU will be in charge of the execution of the project. The
funds related to the road component will be channelled through the Ministry
of Public Works. The funds related to the consulting services for the
taxation department would be channelled through the Ministry of Finance.
4.02      The sector entities concerned with the sewerage and drainage sector
are the Direction Centrale de l'Assainissement (DCA) of the Ministry of
Public Works, SETU, the FNA, SODECI, and the property tax collection service
and cadastre of the Ministry of Finance. The philosophy behind the sector
organization and the division of responsibilities have been discussed in
paras. 1.06 and 1.07.
The Direction Centrale de l'Assainissement (DCA)
4.03      The DCA of the Ministry of Public Works was created recently (1975)
to execute the "tutelle" task of this Ministry. DCA is staffed by an ex-
patriate director, two expatriate engineers and a few local support staff.
Although DCA is still small, there has been some indication that the Govern-
ment may decide in future years to transfer more responsibility in planning,
design, construction supervision and execution of studies, from SETU-SDD to
the DCA. This would be a logical development insofar as it concerns the
interior where the Ministry has original departments; however, such a move is
considered inappropriate for Abidjan. The size of the Abidjan sewerage and
drainage operation warrants a single autonomous unit whose operations should
be closely associated with the general Abidjan urban development as executed
by SETU. Agreement was reached with the Government not to alter the decree
establishing SETU, without consultation with the Bank.
SETU
4404      SETU was originally created in 1971, as a Government corporation,
to design and execute urban land development primarily for the rapidly
expanding city of Abidjan. In 1975, the Government, following the Bank's



- 23 -
recommendation, amended SETU's decree to add the task of developing the
sewerage and drainage sector in Abidjan, under the "tutelle" of the Ministry
of Works. This dual responsibility is reflected in the organizational
set-up, with the separation of the technical responsibilities between urban
development and sewerage/drainage divisions. The third SETU department
provides the financial/administrative support. SETU is managed b- a com-
petent Ivorian managing director who is assisted by an expatriate advisor.
All heads of SETU's divisions are Ivorians. SETU has a professional staff
of about 50, of which the engineers are generally expatriates and total
eight.

4.05      The Sewerage and Drainage Department (SDD) is headed by an Ivorian
director. SDD's total staff of 21 includes four expatriates provided under
IBRD Loan 1076-IVC. To carry out the second phase and execute ongoing oper-
ations, SDD will have to about double its staff over the next four years.
Because of shortage of qualified Ivorian engineers (para. 1.08), additional
expatriate engineers will be financed under the proposed loan. By the time
the project is completed, it is expected that no more than two to three young
Ivorian engineers will have been recruited for the SDD to replace expatriate
staff; complete Ivorization is not expected before 1990.
4.06      The Urban Land Development Department (ULDD) is also headed by an
Ivorian director and his top technical staff is expatriate. This department
has been very successful in its task of orderly development of the Abidjan
urban expansion, excluding the primary road system which is carried out by
the Ministry of Public Works. This ULDD is responsible for the secondary and
tertiary sewerage and drainage system construction, jointly with the other
secondary and tertiary infrastructure. The orderly continuation of the dev-
elopment of this collection side of the sewerage and drainage is essential to
the success of the total sewerage and drainage development. During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached that the Government will take all necessary
measures to ensure that all future urban development of Abidjan includes
satisfactory water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities and shall promptly
provide or cause to provide, the funds required for the purpose.
4.07      Since mid-1977, SETU made significant changes in its financial
staff. An Ivorian replaced an expatriate as the Head of SETU's Finance/
Administration Department. He appears promising. SETU's Chief Accountant
was recently replaced by an experienced and longtime former financial execu-
tive of the Railway Company. Furthermore, a financial analyst was engaged
for the SDD and a further analyst is expected to join the planning division
in mid-1978. As all Ivorian personnel is practically new and in part inex-
perienced, SETU agreed during negotiations that, if necessary, it will hire
an additional financial executive by June 30, 1980.
4.08      SETU, being a state corporation, follows accrual accounting prin-
ciples. Accounts are separated by the urban development and by the sewerage/
drainage activities. The Ministry of Public Works has delegated the main-
tenance and operation of assets of SETU. For the establishment of the Abidjan
system operation contract, the sewerage and drainage assets were inventoried
and valued as of December 1974. No proper asset register has yet been estab-
lished, but SETU agreed during appraisal to establish one, including criteria
and a mechanism to revalue assets, by September 30, 1978. This was confirmed
during negotiations.
4.09      The accounting separation between sewerage and drainage activi-
ties, a condition of the first loan (1076-IVC), has not been implemented
yet. SETU has been experiencing difficulties with the productivity of its
senior accounting staff which has caused serious delays in its basic account-
ing; for instance, closing of its 1976 accounts was delayed by about six
months. The correction of basic accounting problems was of higher priority



- 25 -
than the refinement of accounting procedures. However, as SETU is to change
over to a computerized accounting system in early 1978, agreement was reached
with SETU during negotiations that it will implement the separation of sewer-
age from drainage accounts at the start of the financial year beginning
October 1, 1978
4.10      In accordance with its agreement under loan 1076-IVC, in 1976 SETU
engaged an internationally known auditor. The first audit reports for 1975/76
have been delayed by the additional time required for the familiarization with
the scope of the required audit and by delays in completing SETU's accounting
(see para. 4.09). Although a first audit was submitted in November 1977, it
was incomplete. Additional perspectives on sewerage and drainage aspects were
provided in March 1978. Even though SETU is now becoming familiar with audit
procedures so that much better performance can be expected in the future, it
is more realistic to expect audit reports within six months after the end of
the financial year, rather than the four months currently stipulated. Agreement
was reached with SETU during negotiations that external audit reports, prepared
by an auditor acceptable to the Bank, will be submitted to the Bank within six
months of the close of each financial year.
Fonds National d'Assainissement
4.11      This fund was created together with a similar fund for the water
supply sector, Fonds National de l'Hydraulique (FNH) in 1976. It is super-
vised by a board composed of representatives of the Ministries of Finance,
Works, and Health, and the Director of the CAA. The Director of SETU-SDD
attends board meetings with a consultative voice. The board meets twice
a year to approve the sewerage and drainage investment and financing plans.
Board decisions can be vetoed by the Minister of Finance within 30 days.
4.12      FNA's resources are derived from:  (i) collected sewerage and
drainage taxes (para. 6.25), (ii) borrowing, (iii) grants, and (iv) earnings
on liquid reserves. These resources are applied to pay for:
(a) studies, construction operation and maintenance, and
renewal of the sewerage and drainage systems in the
Ivory Coast;
(b) debt service;
(c) administrative cost of the FNA.
Payment procedures are still being refined to allow mainly for speedier
settlement of contractors' claims. Improvements can be expected with the
appointment of an additional executive at the FNA (para. 4.13).
4.13      The FNA is managed by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA),
the Government's debt management agency. FNA shares the same competent
Ivorian director with FNH, which in turn is supported by 2-3 other CAA
administrative staff. To strengthen FNA's and FNH's focus on the particular
concerns of the sewerage/water sectors, the Government agreed under loan



- 26 -
1484-IVC to appoint by March 1978, for a period of three years, one additional
financial expert for both funds. Terms of reference have been agreed with the
Bank, and selection is underway. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that FNA's accounts be reorganized by December 31, 1978 to show separately:
(i) transactions related to Abidjan and those related to the interior, and
(ii) sewerage operations and drainage operations.
4.14      FNA being part of the public administration, keeps accounts on a
cash receipt and disbursement basis, i.e., recognizing receipts and payments
only. FNA's accounts are being audited by a recognized international auditor.
Since the principle of a comprehensive audit is new to Government organiza-
tions, the issuance of FNA's first audit for 1975/76 has been substantially
delayed. Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations, that
FNA's external audit reports prepared by an auditor acceptable to the Bank,
will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each financial
year.
4.15      To permit an assessment of the overall financial position of the
sector, the Government agreed during negotiations to prepare a pro forma
consolidation of accounts of FNA and SETU on the basis of consistently applied
accrual accounting principles. A similar arrangement for the water supply
sector has already been agreed under the Secondary Centers Water Supply
Project. In this case however, a consolidation is more complicated as differ-
ent accounting principles (see paras. 4.08 and 4.14) and financial years are
being followed--FNA follows a January-December financial year, while SETU
adheres to an October-September financial year. The sector's consolidated
accounts should be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of FNA's
financial year starting with FY 1978.
SODECI
4.16      SODECI was created in 1959 by an established French water supply
company (Societe d'Amenagement Urbain et Rural--SAUR) to operate Abidjan's
water supply system under a 30-year concession contract. SODECI is a private
company, the ownership of which is presently shared by French and Ivorian
interests 1/. In 1974, SODECI was given the responsibility to operate the
water systems throughout the country and in 1976, it entered a contract with
SETU to operate and maintain Abidjan's sewerage and drainage system for an
initial period of 13 years. Under this contract, SODECI is remunerated on
1/   Share ownership is split as follows:
SAUR                                      46
Private Ivorians                          45
Private French                             4
SONAFI                                      5

- 27 -
the basis of costs previously agreed and an overhead and profit mark up. The
combined overhead and profit mark up of initially 44% will eventually decrease
to 35% as it is inversely related to the growth in direct costs. The contract
with SODECI is subject to a trial period and will be adjusted if the actual
direct costs prove to be different. These contractual arrangements are
acceptable.
4.17      With increasing responsibilities in the water supply and sewerage/
drainage sector since 1974, SODECI has in three years more than doubled its
staff to about 1,200, of which about 70 are working for the Abidjan sewerage/
drainage operations. The rapid increase in staff has led SODECI to start
its own training center (para. 1.10).
4.18      Prior to 1976, under a contract with the Municipality, SODECI had
maintenance responsibility for only 1/3 of the sewerage and drainage system in
Abidjan, the rest being maintained on an incidental basis by local authorities
and development companies. Under the present contract with SETU, SODECI was
to increase its means from 2 to 4 hydraulic sewer cleaning machines, 4 to 10
trucks and 35 to 100 persons by 1978. Experience during 1976-1977 has already
shown that this equipment and staff will not be able to cope with the regular
maintenance and operation plus the rehabilitation of the existing deteriorated
system. During negotiations SETU agreed to prepare a program for the main-
tenance and rehabilitation and use its best efforts to incorporate this
program into the existing SODECI contract before December 31, 1978.
4.19      SODECI has been providing a good quality water supply service and
it is expected that in time, it will also provide satisfactory services on
sewerage/drainage operations.
4.20      The billing and collection of water and sewerage taxes is also
carried out by SODECI. Performance on billing and collection so far has
been only moderate, primarily as a result of difficulties with its computer
installations. Billings were delayed and computer analyses of collections
remained fragmentary, causing substantial delays in the transfer of funds
to the FNA, so that by the end of 1976 about ten months of the year's billing
remained to be transferred to the FNA. Under normal circumstances, about
2-3 months would be reasonable. However, some improvement can be expected
in 1977 as the billing is now under control and monthly analyses of actual
collections are being generated. SODECI should be able to redress past delays
by 1978 (para. 6.16).
4.21      SODECI's sewerage and drainage services are controlled by SETU's
regular analysis of its accounts. SODECI is under contractual obligation to
provide monthly statements. SODECI has also agreed under the recent water
supply loan to have its accounts audited by an external auditor.



- 28 -
Taxation Department (Direction des Impots) (DI)
4.22      As the drainage tax is a part of property taxation, its levy is
administered by the Ministry of Finance through its DI. The assessment of
property values and billing of property taxes is the responsibility of DI's
Cadastre. The collection of the tax is the responsibility of Service
d'Enregistrement. The collected funds are transferred to the FNA by the
Government's Treasury.
4.23      The level and growth of tax billings depends on the number of
housing units added each year, but also on the ability of the Service du
Cadastre to survey properties and assess their values regularly. Although the
Cadastre in the Ivory Coast is one of the best in Africa, it is acknowledged
that its surveys are lagging behind for lack of manpower. For instance,
delays in surveys are occurring in the Banco and Abobo areas of Greater
Abidjan. It is also understood that property values are not reassessed
regularly.
4.24      One of the reasons why property tax collections are low (60%) (see
also para. 6.25) is that DI's collection arm (Service d'Enregistrement) does
not have the manpower and organization to effectively deal with taxpayers.
Only two officials follow-up on several thousand delinquent taxpayers. The
Cadastre and Service d'Enregistrement will be analyzed within the proposed
property tax study (para. 6.27), and recommendations for reform can be expec-
ted therefrom. In the meantime, financing would be provided from this loan
for about 3 man-years consulting services to expand the computerization of the
Cadastre and to install a computerized information system within the Service
d'Enregistrement to recognize readily non payments and to follow up in a
timely fashion. Agreement was reached with the Government during negotia-
tions, to install the computerized information system by December 31, 1979.
CHAPTER V
DEMOGRAPHIC AND DEMAND FORECAST
Demand
(a) Population Growth
5.01      The rapid population growth of Abidjan has been a major contributing
factor to the present inadequate sewerage and drainage infrastructure (para.
2.05). The 1975 population census estimated the Abidjan population at 940,000
and different forecasts made by various agencies agree on a population of
about 2.9 million by 2000 (Table 5-1). Development plans for rural areas and
secondary centers are expected to reduce the attraction of Abidjan for rural
migrants (para. 1.02); however, the growth rate of the city is not likely to
drop to less than 8% before 1985 (as opposed to 11% from 1960 to the present),
meaning a doubling of population by 1987.

(b) Housing Development
5.02      This rapidly increasing population is expected to be housed under
existing land development plans which in turn necessitate the expansion of
sewerage/drainage facilities. SETU intends to prepare land during 1978-1982
for the ultimate construction of 51,000 dwellings, mostly of low-cost design,
whose construction is primarily the responsibility of the public housing
authorities.
(c) Water Consumption and Waste Water Forecast
5.03      The water consumption forecast (Table 5-2 and Figure 5-1) prepared
by the consultants and used as the basis for sewerage investment planning is
reasonable in view of historical growth in demand and the expected population
growth. Average domestic per capita consumption (73 lcd in 1975) is expected
to increase (96 lcd in 1985) as a result of anticipated increases in real
innome, the extension of service to new areas, and the emphasis on supplying
service via house connection. The growth rate of water connections has in-
creased from 10%/year to 20%/year following the elimination of connection



- 30 -
charges for the smallest diameter (15 mm) domestic connection/social connec-
tion. Growth in industrial and commercial consumption is expected to progress
roughly in line with growth in real GNP at about 5%. Total water consumption
should grow at an average rate of 8% until 1985. The water consumption growth
rate will decline to a rate in line with the population growth rate as the
percentage of population served approaches full service. The consultants'
forecast shows an average growth rate of about 4% from 1985 to 2000.
5.04      The waste water forecast (Table 5-2) is based on assumptions regard-
ing the percentage of water consumed, as shown in the consumption forecast,
and disposed of via the sewerage system. This waste water forecast assumes
that all dwellings with water connections also have sewer connections. Such
an assumption is necessary for designing the primary, secondary, and tertiary
network which must be sized to carry the ultimate load for the maximum popu-
lation density under the planned land use. However since the trunk sewer
network can be constructed in phases, the forecast of load to be carried by
this network has been correctly based on the lower volumes of waste water
which depend on the growing ratio of sewer to water connections.
(d) Sewer Connection Forecast
5.05      Table 5-3 shows the forecast of expected population to be served
by sewer or septic tanks. In 1975, 35% of the population was served by
sewerage or septic tanks; in 1980 and 1985 this percentage is expected to
grow to 56% and 75% respectively. The percentage served by septic tanks
should decrease from 10% in 1975 to 5% by 1985, since new housing will be
provided with sewer connections rather than septic tanks. This is justified
at the proposed population densities. In addition to sewer connections made
in conjunction with the operations of SETU and the public housing authorities,
a total of approximately 5,400 connections will be made in Adjame and Abobo
during 1978-1980 as part of the Bank's first urban project (Loan 1347--IVC).
Under the presently proposed project, a further 3,500 connections would be
constructed during 1978-1981. Most of the connections which will be made
are expected to be associated with SETU land development projects in which
all services (electricity, water and sewer) will be provided simultaneously
(para. 5.02). The achievement of a 75% service rate by 1985 is optimistic
and ambitious and depends heavily on SETU's ability to provide serviced lots
for construction at an affordable price. The need to obtain Government
assurances that all future land development in Abidjan include provision of
adequate sewerage and drainage facilities is discussed in para. 4.06. The
risk of failure to achieve the target rate of development is further discussed
under Project Risk, para. 7.16.

CHAPTER VI
FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      The following discussion for the sewerage and drainage subsectors
relates to the combined finances of the FNA and of the Sewerage and Drainage
Department of SETU (SETU-SDD) as they relate to Abidjan (para. 4.13).
6.02      The principle established under the first sewerage loan (1076-IVC)
of considering Abidjan financially autonomous, i.e., Abidjan's resources
finance sewerage and drainage expenditures in Abidjan, is being retained for
this proposed second loan. At present about 80% of the countrywide sector
revenues (sewerage and drainage) are being generated in Abidjan. In 1976
revenues of the interior amounted to about $1.2 million. Revenues of the
interior are used to contribute to the financing of studies and remedial
works for the interior (paras. 1.04, 1.17).
Past Finances - General
6.03      With the reorganization of the sewerage/drainage sectors in 1974
(para. 1.06) the Government has become the owner of existing fixed assets.
These assets include works which were financed from revenues as well as con-
sumer contributions. A breakdown of assets by financing source will become



- 34 -
available with the establishment of the asset register (para. 4.08). The
works under way since 1975 have been financed from revenues and the two IBRD
loans (1076 and 1347-IVC). As of December 31, 1977 total net fixed assets in
operation have been estimated at US$48 million. Debt represented 12% of the
long term capitalization. For 1976 the estimated rate of return on net fixed
assets (exclusive of consumer contributions) was for sewerage 18% and for
drainage 7%. This is high but is explained by the sectors' delayed invest-
ment activity. Expected future decreases are discussed in para. 6.28.
6.04      The main financial covenants established under the first IBRD loan
(1076-IVC) comprised a cash generation covenant and an investment limitation
covenant. The cash generation covenant stipulated that net revenues, i.e.,
after covering operating expenses, debt service and working capital require-
ments, should contribute 50% towards investments. This high level of cash
generation was judged appropriate in view of the relatively small first
project. It was recognized that with future investment phases becoming much
larger, the required cash generation level would reasonably have to be re-
duced. In fact the percentage was lowered to 40% effective January 1977
within the framework of Loan 1347. A further reduction is proposed under
this Loan (para. 6.19). The investment limitation covenant stipulated that
no capital expenditures amounting to more than US$500,000 be carried out
without consultation of the Bank. This was confirmed during negotiations.
Past Financial Performance - Sewerage
6.05      Key comparative financial indicators for the 1975-1977 period are
given below:

6.06      As compared to the estimates prepared under loan 1076-IVC and
considering the 1975-1977 period cumulatively, actual revenues amounted to 86%
of the forecast. However capital expenditures and the main operating expense
item, system maintenance, fell short by 44% of the forecasts on account of
delays in the capital construction (para. 1.19) and in the conclusion of a
maintenance contract with SODECI (para. 4.16). This explains why operating
ratios, debt service coverages, debt/equity ratios and year end cash balances
were more favorable during 1975 and 1976. While the cash generation covenant
has not been met in each single year, cash generation contributed cumulatively
during the 1975-1977 period 60% to investments which is satisfactory. A large
deterioration occurred in the level of receivables, which are estimated to
equal 8 months revenues at the end of 1977. With the introduction of a new
tariff system (para. 6.20) and on account of SODECI's internal difficulties
with its new computer installations, billings and transfers to the FNA were
often delayed (para. 4.20). For expected future improvements see para. 6.16.

6.08      The main features of past performance in drainage are similar to
sewerage. While actual revenues for the 1975-1977 period are, cumulatively
speaking, practically equal to the earlier forecasts, capital expenditures
and system maintenance have lagged behind. This explains the better operating



- 36 -
cash generation contributed 70% to investments during 1975-1977. This is
satisfactory. Finally, another similarity to sewerage, is the comparative
deterioration of the level of receivables which is estimated at the end of
1977 to equal 6 months revenues. This is due to delay in the transfers of
collected revenues from the Government treasury to the FNA (para. 6.26).
Financing Plans
6.09      Financial requirements are largely determined by the proposed
second phase investment program. 51% of these requirements will be met
through the proposed IBRD loan.

6.11      As indicated above, internal cash generation and borrowing would
contribute 17% and 64% respectively of total financing requirements and the
VAT exemption would contribute 19%. Sewerage taxes would increase 10% in real
terms effective January 1979. This would be in addition to the yearly adjust-
ment for inflation which has in fact been practiced so far. It ha- been
further assumed that real tariff adjustments of 10% p.a. after 197' would be
established in order to meet the proposed revenue covenant (see para. 6.19).
The terms of the proposed Bank loan to the Government would be for 17 years
including 4 years grace. On-lending to FNA would be at Bank terms. Neither
the source nor the terms of the assumed local loan has yet been identified. A
10% interest rate and a 12 year repayment period with 4 years grace have been
assumed. Similar borrowings have been made for the water sector. It is not
therefore expected that the Government will have difficulties in borrowing at
similar terms. The exemption of the VAT tax - levied at about 22% of contract
values - is based on a long-standing request by SETU to grant to the sewerage-
drainage sector the same exemption which has been granted to the water supply
sector. During negotiations the Government agreed to (i) a 10% tariff in-
crease in real terms effective January 1979, (ii) guarantee borrowing of
CFAF 1.0 billion at terms satisfactory to the Bank and (iii) the exemption
of the VAT tax, or provide an equivalent budgetary contribution.

6.13      As indicated above internal cash generation and borrowing contribute
15% and 66% respectively. The VAT exemption is equivalent to a contribution
of 19%. The level of cash generation is based on an assumed doubling in the
drainage tax, i.e., the levy would be increased from 5 to 10% of the pro-
perty's rental value. This measure is expected to take effect January 1979.
No further tariff adjustments during 1979-1981 have been assumed (para. 6.18).
Lending terms for the proposed IBRD and local borrowing and granting of the
VAT exemption are calculated as in para. 6.11 for the sewerage subsector.
During negotiations the Government agreed to (i) a doubling of the drainage
tax effective January 1979, (ii) borrowing of CFAF 1.3 billion at terms satis-
factory to the Bank and (iii) the exemption of the VAT, or to provide an
alternative budgetary contribution.

Future Finances
Sewerage
6.14      DetailQ' forecasts of projected borrowing and debt service, income,
funds flow and balance sheet statements for the consolidated sewerage sub-
sector operations are shown in Annexes 6-1 to 6-4. Key indicators are
presented below:
Year Ending December 31                      1978   1980   1982    1984

Debt/Debt & Equity (%)                     29      40      41      42
6.15      Revenues would grow at about 30% p.a. which is based on an assumed
8% p.a. growth of water consumption and yearly increases in the sewerage tax
of 10% in real terms starting in 1979 plus adjustments for inflation. Infla-
tion has been assumed at 12% p.a. until 1981 and 10% p.a. thereafter. Ad-
ministrative expenses have been projected essentially on the basis of the
expected staffing requirements of SETU. System maintenance expenses are
based on the present contractual arrangements with SODECI (para. 4.16). All
operating expenses have also been adjusted for expected inflation. Revalued
assets in service growth at about 35% p.a. as in addition to the proposed
project substantial secondary and tertiary sewerage works are being construc-
ted under SETU's land development activities and financed by buyers of the
developed land (para. 4.06). A third phase of construction of the collector
system has been assumed to commence in 1982.
6.16      The projected financial position into the mid-eighties remains
sound. Debt as a percentage of long term capitalization is projected not
to exceed about 40% and debt service coverage will remain above 1.3 on an
annual basis. Billings are estimated to remain outstanding 3 months. This
improvement over past performance (para. 6.06) is based on the proper function-
ing of SODECI's computerized information system in the future. Analyses of
collections became available in early 1977 and should allow SODECI, as of 1978,
to identify reliably the sewerage taxes collected and to transfer them to the
FNA within agreed lags.

6.17      Detailed financial forecasts are shown in Annexes 6-5 to 6-8.  Key
indicators are presented below:

Debt/Debt & Equity (%)                      11     25       24      26
6.18      Drainage tax revenues have been forecast on the basis of (i) a 60%
collection rate (para. 6.25) up to 1980 and 80% thereafter, and (ii) the
doubling of the drainage tax effective January 1979. Thereafter the growth
is linked to annual increases in property values resulting from increases
in the number of housing units and inflationary adjustments. Property value
increases have been assumed at 20% in 1978 on the basis of estimated results
of an ongoing revaluation of properties. Thereafter 12% has been assumed
to reflect the historical growth during 1975-1978. Operating expenses have
been projected as for the sewerage subsector (see para. 6.14). Revalued
net plant is projected to grow at an average of 30% p.a. This large increase
is, as in the case of sewerage (see para. 6.15) due to works constructed
within the framework of SETU's land development activity. The projected
financial position including the long term capitalization and debt service
remains sound throughout the projected period. On the basis of existing
projections, a further increase in the drainage tax of 30% would be required
in 1983.
Revenue Covenant
6.19      The existing revenue covenant requires the sector to contribute 40%
of investment requirements after covering current expenditures and debt service
(para. 6.04). During negotiations it was agreed that, although the existing
form of revenue covenant would be retained for the new project, in view of the
almost four-fold increase in investments, the requirements would be reduced
to 15% 1/. To avoid anomalies caused by fluctuations in annual investments
1/   Should the sector be eventually exempted of the VAT tax, the percentage
would increase to 20%.



- 41 -
during project execution, the yearly test will be applied by averaging cumula-
tively internal cash generation and investments over the estimated construction
period (1978-1981); the next test would occur in 1979 and would include the
actual results for 1978. The testing tool would be a cash flow analysis to be
submitted annually to the Bank as under Loan 1076-IVC covering the estimated
construction period. The previous and present revenue covenanLs have neces-
sarily been related to project execution periods. As the sector is relatively
new, the magnitude and timing of investments beyond 1981 as well as the result
of the proposed tariff studies will determine the pattern of future finances.
Nevertheless, during negotiations the Government agreed for the period after
1981 that the sector will continue to contribute a reasonable proportion of
investment requirements as shall be acceptable to the Bank. To this effect
the Government also agreed that it will proposed to the Bank by June 30, 1981
appropriate tariff levels.
Tariffs
Sewerage
6.20      The sewerage tax is one of the components of the water tariff, which
has been levied uniformly on water consumption throughout the Ivory Coast           3
since mid-1974.  In 1977 the average water tariff stood at about 50 US cents/mi
of which about 12% or 6 US cents/mi represented the sewerage tax. Since 1974
the overall water tariff, including the sewerage tax, has been increased by
about 40% to reflect investment requirements and inflation. These increases
have not noticeably affected the growth of water consumption.
6.21      The forecast annual increase in the sewerage tax to reflect infla-
tion and to allow for a 10% p.a. real increase (para. 6.11), will have a very
minor overall impact on the water tariff. During 1979-1981 total sewerage tax
increases will cause the overall water price to increase by less than 5% p.a.
Considering this, it is not expected that consumers' ability to pay - or water
consumption - will be affected. An analysis of household incomes and water
consumption patterns shows that 90-95% of Abidjan's population can afford the
cost of minimum water supply needs (33 lcd) through direct connection cal-
culated on the basis of existing tariff levels and structure.
6.22      The present tariff has the advantage that all water consumers pay
the sewerage tax whether or not they have a sewerage connection, thus adding
to subsector revenues. This is partly justified because of the benefits
which all citizens of Abidjan derive from the reduction of pollution in the
lagoons, and the improvement of sanitary conditions in areas newly served.
However, there is a certain measure of inequity in that those connected
benefit most and should pay a higher rate. Application of differential
rates to take account of the additional benefits to those who are connected



- 42 -
to the system, is not now possible because there is no record of existing
sewerage connections. During negotiations agreement was reached with the
Government that a solution to this inequity would be studied in the framework
of the water tariff study to which the Government agreed under loan 1484-IVC,
and that any desirable differential sewerage tariffs satisfactory to the Bank
would be implemented by December 31, 1980.
6.23      Because water consumption also involves water disposal, it is
desirable that the combined water and sewerage tariff should provide an
economically efficient price signal that reflects the joint long run marginal
costs of supply and disposal. Since the total water bill depends only on
consumption, the consumption is indifferent to the proportion of the total
tariff allocated to each sector. The marginal cost of water supply is cur-
rently being determined under the tariff study financed by the Secondary
Centers Water Supply Loan (Loan 1484-IVC); however, tentative Bank estimates
indicate that consumers in Abidjan will have to pay more than the long run
marginal costs of supply and disposal at the proposed tariff using opportunity
cost of capital discount rate of 10%. This situation is the result of the
policy of the Government to cross-subsidize secondary centers water supply
from the lower cost system in Abidjan. Thus, the sewerage surtax alone must
support the sewerage sector.
6.24      In order to facilitate the connection of existing houses to the
sewerage system, it is proposed that a social sewer connection be instituted
for customers who qualify for the social water connection (see para. 2.04).
The cost of these connections would be recovered through the sewerage tax.
Agreement was reached with the Government that the criteria for a social
connection charge be confirmed by December 1978. Possible additional measures
to encourage connection would include (i) loan financing for interior plumbing
through housing banks and (ii) the spreading out of connection charges in
monthly installments added to the water bill for those who do not qualify for
social connections. Financing of a short study to explore these additional
possibilities is provided in the loan. Agreement was reached that a study
conducted under Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank be completed by
June 30, 1979 and that any jointly agreed conclusions be implemented by
June 30, 1980.
Drainage
6.25      In 1975, the Government established a drainage tax, as a component
of the total property tax, equal to 5% of net rental values. The overall
rate of property tax ranges from 24-30%. While the property tax system allows
for exemptions, no exemption is allowed for the drainage tax proper. Col-
lection of this tax, however, has not been satisfactory. Only about 60% of
the tax billed has been collected and only 40% in the year in which billed.
The adequacy of data supporting the uncollected 40% is uncertain and would
be studied within the property tax study to be financed with the proposed
loan (para. 6.27). It is understood that: (i) about one-third of these
uncollected bills represents amounts due from the Public Housing Authorities



- 43 -
which, although not exempted, do not have the funds to pay; (ii) the remain-
ing two-thirds being made up of property owners who either do not have the
means to pay, or are influential Ivorians, or possibly customers who are not
being compelled to pay.
6.26      Another weak link in the cash flow in the drainage sector is the un-
certain timing of the transfer of funds to the FNA. For instance, the treasury
made no payment in 1975 and no payment in 1977 during the first 6 months. The
Government agreed during negotiations to require the treasury to make quarterly
payments to FNA on the basis of estimated billings/collections with yearly
adjustments for any over/under payments.
6.27      The existing knowledge about the customer's ability to pay, the
equity and the allocative effects (i.e., incentives for land use) of the
drainage/property tax is inadequate. Under the first Abidjan Sewerage Project
(1076-IVC), the Government agreed to study property taxation in detail.
However a study carried out in 1975 turned out to be too general. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government to engage the services
of consultants by March 31, 1979 satisfactory to the Bank to carry out a
new study. New terms of reference (see Annex 6-9) have also been agreed.
Following the study the Government would prepare and present to the Bank a
plan of action by December 31, 1980 and thereafter carry it out. The seven
man-months of technical assistance required for the study would be financed
from the proposed loan.
Cost Recovery
6.28      During 1978-1985 financial projections indicate that revenues in the
sewerage subsector would yield a rate of return on average revalued assets in
service varying between 5 and 8%. This level of cost recovery is satisfactory.
For the drainage subsector, rates of return vary between 1 and 4%. This lower
level of cost recovery is explained by the low collection rate of drainage
taxes and should improve when measures are implemented to reform the property
tax assessment and collection system (para. 6.25). Assets financed under
SETU's land development activity (para. 4.06) were treated as consumer con-
tributions and were deducted in calculating net fixed assets.
Insurance
6.29      As is usual, sewerage and drainage system losses through failure
or damage are taken as they occur. The building and vehicles are covered by
normal third party liability and fire insurance.
Road Component
6.30      Counterpart funding as well as the cost recovery mechanism for the
road paving component of the project (para. 3.03) was confirmed during nego-
tiations. Cost recovery would be made through the betterment tax, an existing



- 44 -
mechanism established under the Urban Project (Loan 1347-IVC). For this
mechanism to apply to this component, agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment during negotiations that it will declare the area served to be in the
public interest (utilite publique). Fulfillment of this requirement is a
condition of disbursement for the roadworks component.
CHAPTER VII
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
Sewerage Program
7.01      The choice of a water borne sewerage system with a trunk collector
system has been demonstrated to be the least cost solution to provision of
an overall sanitation system in Abidjan to meet the demand forecast discussed
in Chapter V. Other alternatives considered and found unsuitable or more
costly were multiple treatment plants, septic tanks, pit latrines, and com-
munal sanitary facilities. Consultants have also demonstrated that a separate
drainage/ sewerage system is more economical than a combined system. Intense
rainfall of short duration yielding high volumes of storm water, coupled with
the topography of Abidjan and its lagoons, dictates a drainage system which
follows the short natural water courses and discharges at the nearest points
in the lagoons. The economy of such a system offsets cost savings which would
normally be associated with a combined system. In addition, a combined system
with its larger diameters would require more maintenance in the dry season
than a separate system because of lack of flow to provide self-cleaning action
in the sewers and would be subject to more rapid deterioration due to the
corrosive conditions caused by septicity of slow-flowing sewage.
7.02      The feasibility studies for the first Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage
Project examined alternative plans for the separate sewerage system and deter-
mined that a central trunk system with a sea outfall would be more economical
than a system with several treatment plants discharging at various points in
the lagoon. Interim increases in the cost of energy will make the ocean
outfall solution even more economic. Because sufficient self-purification
capacity exists in the short run in the Baie de Bietrie and the lagoon near
Banco and Riviera, intermediate use of well-designed lagoon outfalls can be
used. The construction of the sea outfall and connection of all parts of the
trunk network will be phased to correspond with population growth in each
urban zone.
7.03      Secondary and tertiary sewers directly serving local neighborhoods
have been designed for a single stage installation to carry the waste water
load (Table 5-2) for population at maximum density and assuming that all
houses will be connected. Single stage construction for the maximum load
is more economic than multi-stage construction based on a growing number
of connections to the network because the incremental cost of providing for



- 45 -
ultimate need is less than the cost of later reinforcement. The trunk sewer
network design has been based on the existing load and the growth rate of
connections and resulting waste water to the year 2000, with consideration
given to the optimal phasing of construction and reinforcement. For the
Treichville trunk, to be constructed in this project, a 1,600 mm diameter
main is the most economical first phase for all reasonable growth rates when
compared with other possible staging at a discount rate of 10%.   A second
stage, parallel main, would be required sometime between 1990 and 1995.
Drainage Program and Project
7.04      The optimum level of protection against flooding involves a trade-
off between incremental costs and benefits for increasing degrees of protec-
tion as discussed in para. 7.08. The present rate of flooding of the lower
parts of Treichville is about 10 times per year and about 50% of the popula-
tion are directly affected. The consultants have shown that a reduction of
floods to once per year is, on average, the optimum for Abidjan. All draiange
works have, therefore, been sized to handle run-off volumes up to this level.
The construction of retention ponds with minimum size drains in Abobo has been
shown to be less costly than constructing canals to handle the peak flow to
provide immediate drainage. The project works in Banco Youpougon will be
used as a pilot project to investigate alternative solutions to protect the
canal against erosion to ensure that the remaining drainage program is carried
out at least cost.
Economic Justification
Sewerage
7.05      Very few of the relevant benefits of the sewerage program can be
quantified; therefore, an economic rate of return cannot be determined.   The
major benefit expected from the sewerage program in the local neighborhood is
an improvement in health through avoidance of contact with contaminated water
(para. 2.09). Proper sewage disposal in the project areas of Treichville,
Marcory, and Blokosso will help to reduce the annual rate of hospitalization
due to waterborne and water-washed disease which is currently the highest in
these areas with over 600 cases per 100,000 population. This rate can be
compared to a morbidity rate of 7/100,000 for the same diseases in the USA.
In addition to those hospitalized, many persons require treatment at clinics
or lose time from work. The project and its continuation has been designed
to prevent permanent damage to the environment and to ensure protection in the
future of the esthetical, recreational and ecological qualities of the lagoons,
including continuing sport and industrial fishing.
7.06      The internal financial return of the sewerage program has been
calculated to determine the adequacy of the sewerage surtax for cost recovery
(Annex 7). Costs are in 1977 prices less tax and duties while revenues cor-
respond to the water forecast (Table 5-2) and a 1% p.a. real inc5ease in
sewerage surtax starting in 1979 from 14.2 CFAF/m to 30.4 CFAF/m by 1985.
The sewerage surtax is collected on 85% of water consumed since standpipe
consumption and the social block are exempt.



- 46 
7.07      The internal financial returns under different assumptions are
shown below:
Internal Financial
Rate of Return (IFR) %
base case                                               8
sensitivity to change in                  +20%        -20%        -50%
-    capital cost                            6          10          -
-    operating and maintenance costs         8           8          -
-    revenues                               10           6          2
Under the pessimistic assumption of all costs + 20% and all revenues (sewer-
age surtax plus cost recovery of SETU land development) - 20%, the internal
financial return would be about 2%. Revenues are not directly dependent on
sewerage program investments since they are based on water consumption; hence,
reductions in revenues shown above reflect the effects of not increasing the
sewerage surtax by JO% p.a. If the sewerage surtax is not raised from the
present 14.2 CFAF/m , corresponding to a 50% reduction from the base case, the
TFR would be 2%. The proposed tariff increases are, therefore, necessary to
ensure an adequate recovery of costs and remuneration of capital.
Drainage
7.08      The consultants carried out a cost/benefit analysis to determine
the optimum level of protection against flooding and the internal economic
return for the drainage program to the year 2000 in each area in Abidjan.
A survey of 1,400 individuals and 65 commercial and industrial firms following
the floods in 1976 provided the basis for estimating future benefits (para
7.11). The estimated losses due to flooding in Abidjan in 1976 had the value
and composition shown below:

and housing                                           670           41
2.   avoidable loss or expense in

The estimaied premium paid for land with property drainage rapges between
500 CFAF/m (US$2) (low income housing areas) to 1,000 CFAF/m (US$45) (high
quality residential areas) and is the expected increase in land value with
the drainage program,
7.09      The costs per hectare of providing flood protection under each
topographic condition were derived from SETU's experience and the consultant's
cost estimates which have been found to be reliable.
7.10      The optimum period of return is the internal between flooding for
which the net present value of incremental benefits (with vs. without program)
minus the incremental costs is maximum for a given discount rate. This
interval corresponds to the optimum level of flood protection which throughout
Abidjan has been shown to be one year. The optimal period of return of
flooding is insensitive to changes in the discount rate. Because of the
economies of scale with respect to carrying capacity in constructing drainage
works and the characteristics of rainfall intensity and duration, both the net
present value and rate of return drop rapidly for suboptimal periods of return
while, for increases in the level of protection above the optimum, there is a
significantly lower rate of decline in net present value and internal rate of
return. There is therefore, more risk in loss of net benefits resulting from
undersizing drains than from oversizing.
7.11      The net present value of benefits for the total program in the
four project areas are shown below:

/1   Including engineering and physical contingencies.
7.12      The rates of return shown above are conservative estimates because
they do not take into account the increase that can be expected during the
life of the program in per capita private wealth and levels of public invest-
ment per hectare that would result in a rising value of benefits per hectare,
to be drained. The benefits were evaluated at the 1976 level of avoidable
damages per hectare and the projected rate of land occupancy to the year 2000.
There are, in addition, unquantifiable health benefits resulting from the



- 48 -
elimination of breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes and from the removal
of contaminated water carrying water washed diseases. Another unquantified
benefit of the total drainage program is that it will allow increasing the
housing density in the central areas of Abidjan, where commercial and indus-
trial activities are located. Such increased densification would not only
reduce transportation costs - large in Abidjan because of the need to cross
lagoons - but would also reduce the per capita cost of sanitation and drainage
through economies of scale.
7.13      The cost/benefit analysis does not consider the social aspecls of
the problem, such as the fact that rates of return in low income areas which
will be served by this Project are less than high income areas with comparable
costs for flood protection simply because poor people have less property to
lose in floods. The lowest income group will therefore benefit primarily from
an improvement in sanitary conditions in their neighborhoods.
Urban Poor
7.14      All proposed project works are to be carried out in areas of the
city where most of the population is in the lowest 50% income group. The
project is unlikely to serve the lowest 25% income group 1/ directly because
of cost of interior plumbing and sewer connections.  Subsid zed water connec-
tions are available and the social block consumption of 5 m /month can be
afforded by all but about the lowest 5% income group. The volume of water
consumed by the poor, however, is not generally high enough to require a
sewer connection and pit latrines can continue to be used to provide adequate
sanitation for this group. The poor will benefit directly from improvements
in general sanitation by drainage that will reduce the spread of contaminated
water and the breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes.
Project Risks
7.15      There are no unusual technical or institutional risks.  Project
costs and timing of the proposed investments are based on recent experiences
under loans 1076 and 1347. The risk of over-investment in the size of the
Treichville trunk is low because of the volume of existing flow from the
primary sewers which would be connected to the trunk sewer and because the
optimum size of the first stage pipe is relatively insensitive to likely
variations of the growth rate above this existing flow.
7.16      While the risk of not achieving the target of 75% of population
served by sewerage by 1985 (Table 6-3) is significant because of the depen-
dence on SETU's land development activities, the risk of over-investment in
facilities is much lower because the installation of secondary and tertiary
sewers is closely tied to the rate of land development which can be varied
according to demand. The primary collections to be provided by this project
in the SETU urban development area in Banco are required to serve existing
housing and lots for which there is an existing market.
1/   The urban poverty threshold in Abidjan is $205/capita annual income
and 20% of the population is estimated to have incomes below this level.



- 49 -
7.17      There is a risk that the benefits of sewerage serving existing areas
will not accrue as rapidly as foreseen. The burden of the cost of connection,
interior plumbing and the cost of associated additional water consumption may
dampen the customer's ability and willingness to connect. The establishment
of a social connection charge will reduce this burden. Additional measures
such as credit for connections and interior plumbing may be required and will
be studied under this project (para. 3.03).
7.18      The risk of not meeting financial objectives is low because sector
revenues are derived from water sales which are not dependent on the rate of
expansion of the sewerage system (paras. 6.19 and 6.22).

IVORY COAST
SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.        The proposed sewerage and drainage project, which is the second
phase of a ten-year development program, will essentially include the laying
of sewer networks and their primary collectors for neglected existing areas,
as well as the installation of house connections. The project will further
include a part of the main trunk sewer system which will eventually lead to an
ocean outfall and some primary collectors for new urban development areas.
2.        The main project elements are as follows:
A.   SEWERAGE
(i) 1.4 km of primary sewers for Treichville Sud (66 ha);
(ii) Sewer network for Marcory Habitat (85 ha);
- 17.5 km of secondary and tertiary sewers;
-   2.0 km of primary sewers;
-   0.5 km of force main; 0 200-400 mm diameter;
-   2 pumping stations;
(iii) Trunk sewer Treichville to Baie de Bietri. This is
the middle part of the main transport sewer for central
Abidjan and Abobo. Initially, it will serve only the
Treichville-Marcory area, but starting 1985 when the
ocean outfall will be ready, it will be connected to
the Plateau trunk sewer:
- 2 km of force mains 0 1,200 mm diameter;
- 3 km of trunk sewers of 0 1,400-1,600 mm diameter;
- I outfall and diffuser;
- 1 pumping station, dimensioned for the flow of year
2000 and equipped with pumps for the first stage
Treichville-Koumassi flow (until the connection is
made with both Plateau sewers);
(iv) Sewer network, Williamsville. It will serve an area of
about 107 ha and will integrate the already served
SOGEFIHA urban development bypassing the existing
derelict treatment station and connecting to the Abobo-
Adjame trunk sewer;
- 6.6 km of 0 200-250 mm diameter;



- 53 -                    ANNEX 3-1
Page 2 of 4
(v) Sewer network, Blokosso. It will serve an area of
11 ha of low cost housing:
- 2 km of 0 200 mm diameter;
(vi) Primary sewers, Banco. These are the last primary
sewers needed for completing the urban development
by SETU of the Banco area:
- 7.1 km of 0 200-500 mm diameter;
- 3.2 km of 0 600-800 diameter;
- 3 km of 0 100 mm diameter;
(vii) Sewer network, Treichville. Replacement and rehabilita-
tion of the secondary and tertiary sewers, which are in
disrepair. This will be executed at the same time as
urban restructuring takes place;
- 4.6 km of 0 600-800 mm diameter;
(viii) House Connections. Installation of 3,500 house connections
in combination with the sewer network construction programs
of (ii), (iv), (v) and (vii) above, over the period of 1978-
1981.
B.   DRAINAGE
(i) Primary drainage mains, Treichville Sud. These primary
drains will intercept the existing drainage networks. A
large part of this area will be restructured in the near
future and the secondary roads and drainage network will
be rehabilitated by the developers;
(ii) Primary mains and network, marcory Habitat. Primary drains
and network to serve 130 ha:
- 5.5 km of 0 400-600 mm diameter;
- 3.0 km of 0 800-1,400 mm diameter;
- 1.2 km of 0 1,600-1,800 mm diameter;
- 350 street drains;
(iii) Drainage Canal, Banco, Yopougon. Construction of concrete
drainage canal serving about 334 ha of middle and low-class
housing:
-  9.0 km of 1.8 m x 1.2 m to 2.3 m x 5.8 m (rectangular
cross-sections);
- 9 waterfalls to reduce flow velocity;
This part will be used as a pilot project for the future
development of drainage in the Banco area, by comparing



- 54 -
ANNEX 3-1
Page 3 of 4
several solutions for the protection of the canal against
erosion.
(iv)  Drainage Canal, Banco Nord.  Construction of concrete
drainage canal serving about 260 ha of mixed classes
of housing:
- 1.5 km of 2.1 m x 1.8 m to 3.7 m x 2.5 m (rectangular
cross-sections);
- 7 waterfalls to reduce flow velocity.
(v) Primary mains, Abobo. The collections will serve about
350 ha of Abobo, which is presently being restructured.
The size of the pipes have been kept to a minimum by
using the lower parts of the natural depressions as water
retention basins:
- 117.000 m3 earth moving to shape basins;
-    1.4 km of 0 1,000-1,400 mm diameter;
-    0.5 km of 0 1,600-1,800 mm diameter;
-    2.4 km of 2.10 m x 1.6 m to 3.3 m x 1.7 m
(rectangular cross-sections);
(vi) Rehabilitation of existing drainage works, incidental
operations in marcory Sud-Est and Adjame as well as
for existing drainage works to be taken over from the
housing developers.
C.   ROADS
(i) Asphalt road surfacing for 6.6 km of streets in Marcory
Habitat, at the same time as the construction of the
sewerage and drainage works.
D.   CONSULTANTS SERVICES FOR
I.   SETU
(i) The detailed engineering, preparation of bidding
documents, bid evaluation and preparation of contracts;
(ii)  Feasibility studies for a third phase project (1981-1985),
including advanced design of the ocean outfall, and the
preparation of a new ten-year (1980-1990) investment
program for Abidjan sewerage and drainage. This includes
the staffing of the post of SETU-SDD design department's
chief;



-55-
ANNEX 3-1
Page 4 of 4
(iii) Providing all the responsible technical staff to
SETU for construction supervision;
(iv) Providing one financial expert to SETU's finance/
administration department for a period of two
years;
(v) Studies to determine means to:
(a)  promote small enterprises as plumbers and local
civil works contractors;
(b)  promote small industries for local manufacturing
of sanitary equipment (e.g. replacing costly
porcelain sinks, toilet bowls, baths, etc.);
(c)  introduce commercial credit facilities for home
plumbing improvements and connections.
II.   GOVERNMENT
(i) Property tax studies;
(ii) Assistance to the property tax collection service and
cadastre (three man-years); and
(iii) Manpower and training studies for water, sewerage
and drainage sectors.
E.   TRAINING
Training abroad as well as apprenticeships for SETU technical
staff. This part of the project depends very much on the
availability of new graduates from the Public Works school.
An action plan for this training would be developed within
the proposed manpower study (para. 1.08).

IVORY COAST
SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR A STUDY FOR THE DRAINAGE
AND PROPERTY TAXATION
Objectives of Property Tax Study
The purpose of this study is to provide the Ivorian Government with
a factual basis on property taxation by focusing on the following issues:
(a) the actual and potential role of property, drainage and
betterment taxation 1/ in financing drainage and other
urban infrastructure projects principally in Abidjan;
(b) the impact of the present levels and rate structure in
terms of equity, revenues collected, and incentives to
construction; and
(c) possible improvements in management and administration
of the property tax system;
Tasks - suggested areas of inquiry are not necessarily exhaustive.
1.   The Nature and Role of Property Taxation in Ivory Coast
(a) Give a brief description of legislation, principles,
organization and operation of the property tax system;
(b) Give actual annual tax billings, collections and arrears
for Abidjan and the rest of the country since 1970;
(c) In order to provide a perspective, assess the contribution
of property taxation to urban finance in Abidjan and
other centers relative to other major sources of public
revenues (income tax, user charges, VAT) and relative to
the experience in other developing countries.)
1/  All further references to property tax include drainage and betterment
tax.

2.   Assessment Procedures
(a) Quality of physical cadastre
(i) Is land registration universal, accurate and up-to-date?
(ii) Are types of land tenure and land use clearly specified?
(b) Nature and quality of fiscal cadastre
(i)  What types of property values are contained in the
fiscal cadastre (land values, rental values, improvement
values and/or property sales values)?
(ii)  How are properties initially valued and revalued other
than by market transactions?
(iii) On the basis of a small sample, attempt to estimate the
average assessment ratio (assessed value to market value)
and the degree of deviation around the average.
(iv)  Are there any areas, or types of property (e.g. industrial
and/or commercial, squatter settlements, etc.) which are
particularly well, or poorly, appraised?
(v)  What are the procedures for notification of property
assessments and appeals?
(c)  What are the financial and manpower requirements to remedy any
weaknesses in the Cadastre? What are the priorities?
3.   Collection and Administration
(a) Organization and Operation
(i)  Give brief description of staffing and responsibilities.
(ii)  What are the billing practices (computerized, or processed
by hand; mail delivery or delivery by tax collector;
possibility of evasion by bribes, etc.)?
(iii) Collection cost by type of property (i.e. what is the
net cost in terms of foregone revenues of exempting
particular types of property under the existing exemption
system, or under a system which would exempt the lowest
value property in slum and squatter areas?)



_ 70 -                    ANNEX 6_9
Page 3 of 5
(b) Analysis of Arrears
(i)  What is the breakdown of arrears by type of debtor
(i.e. residential and commercial/industrial; high/low
income areas)?
(ii) What is the age structure of arrears (i.e. which debts
should be written off as bad debts and which can be
assumed to be collectible by improved collection
practices)?
(c) Enforcement Practices
(i)  What are the means of enforcement and to what degree
have they been and can they be utilized (e.g. auction
of property, public announcement of large debtors,
etc.)?
(ii) What are the penalties for late and non-payment (i.e.
cumulative interest charges or one-time penalties and
their relation to market rates of interest reflecting
the opportunity cost to the taxpayer)?
(d)  What are the financial and manpower requirements to remedy
any weaknesses of the collection/administration mechanism?
4.   Tax Rates:  Level and Structure
(a) Level
To establish whether there is room to raise the tax level
through discretionary fiscal action, the actual level of
effort needs to be established. To this end the following
relationships should be analyzed:
(i)  On the basis of the property sample collected under
2 (b) (iii) above, compute the average effective
property tax rates (i.e. the ratio of tax payments
to the market value of properties) and the degree of
deviation from it;
(ii) Relationship of per capita tax to per capita income; and
(iii) Relationship of growth of per capita tax revenues to
annual price increases since 1970.



- 71 -                    ANNEX 6-9
Page 4 of 5
Keeping in mind that a low level of tax effort, as indicated
by statistics under (ii) above, may be compensated by efforts
on other taxes, establish whether the tax effort in the Ivory
Coast is high or low. A reference to tax rates in other
developing countries would give an added standard of comparison.
(b) Establish a profile of the housing market by major area in
Abidjan (proportions of owners versus renters, relationship of
household expenditures for housing to income) and compare
the existing property and drainage tax system with an integrated
flat rate system without exemptions with regard to:
(i) the incidence of the tax by:
(a) Income Groups
-    test the hypothesis that since the poorer segments
of the population tend to live in older and rental
housing, the tax exemptions, which favor largely
new, owner-occupied housing, tend to be regressive;
-    to what degree are exemptions benefiting expatriate
property owners and any reduction or elimination
of these exemptions would therefore be borne by them?
(b) Major Area
are there any areas in Greater Abidjan which are
subject to different tax burdens?
(c) By Owner versus user of the Property
-    is there any evidence that taxes on improvements
are borne by consumers of housing services, that
taxes on land are borne by owners of land/capital
and that the overall result is regressive.
(d)  -    How would the incidence change under a flat rate
system?
(ii) the incentives resulting from the exemption system;
-    is there any evidence to believe that an elimination,
or reduction in scope and duration, of the exemptions
would seriously affect construction activity?
-    is it likely that the heavier tax on rental properties
and on the older housing stock has reduced the availability
of low-cost rental housing by inhibiting construction of
new rental units and improvements of existing ones?

(iii) the revenues effects of a flat rate, integrated structure:
-    how much revenue could be collected at given
property tax rates assuming the exemptions are
totally, partially, or gradually abolished?
(iv) special problems:
-    how would the elimination of exemptions affect
the operation of public housing agencies?
-    what measures are required to allow the public housing
authorities to pay the drainage tax from which they
are not exempted?
(c) Financing of Drainage Wrks
Assuming part or all of the program costs are to be financed
from property tax revenues, what legal and effective property
tax rates would be required to produce the necessary revenues
under the present system and under an integrated flat rate
system? What would be a reasonable proportion of the property
tax which should be devoted to drainage?
(d) Simplication of Rate Structure
What is the scope for simplifying the rate structure besides
the elimination of exemptions, for example integrating existing
rates?
(e) Alternative Property Tax Systems
Given the findings of this study, is it feasible or desirable
to switch to an alternative tax base such as capital, or site
value instead of rental and betterment value?
What structure and level of taxes would be required to generate
equivalent revenues?
(f) Public Acceptance of Tax Increases
If property taxes are to be increased, what strategies can be
implemented to achieve an understanding response from the public?
For instance, can tax increases be timed to coincide with the
completion of improvements of infrastructure such as drainage.
