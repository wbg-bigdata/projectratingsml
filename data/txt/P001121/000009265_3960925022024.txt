SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1577-IVC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report represents the results of a performance review
of the Second Abidjan Sewerage and Drairage Project for which
Loan No. 1577-IVC of US$33.0 million to the Government of the Ivory
Coast (GOIC) was approved in May 1978. Seventy-seven percent of the
loan was disbursed on December 31, 1985 (closing date). At that point
all originally planned works were implemented and objectives attained.
Additional activities (the need for which was diagnosed during
implementation) were equally carried out. The strength of the US
dollar vis-a-vis the CFAF in recent years would enable the Government
and the Bank to cancel 14% of the loan.
The report consists of Highlights and a Project Comp'etion
Iteport (PCR) prepared by the West Africa Regional Office. A review of
Bank files and a PCR prepared by SETU (SociWt6 d'Equipement des Terrains
Urbains) form the basis of this report. The Region also took into
account the findings of a project completion mission carried out in
September and November 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluations Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Borrower and Executing Agency. Cesuents from the National
Sewerage pund (PNA) have been reproduced as Attachment A to the report.

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(Loan 1577-IVC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project constituted the second phase of a program
established in the early 1970s to remedy shortcomings in Abidjan's
inadequate and poorly maintained sewerage and drainage systems, which
caused environmental pollution and damaging floods in the rainy season.
Earlier projects (first Abidjan Sewerage and Dr&inage-Loan 1076-IVC and
Abidjan Urban Development Project--Loan 1347/8-IVC) had launched the
initial works under the program. The loan for this project was for
US$33 million, towards total estimated expenditure of US$53.1 million
(net of taxes, from which the project was subsequently exempted by the
Government) (paras 1.01, 1.02 and 2.01 to 2.05).
2.        The works proposed comprised some 77 km of sewers and drains
with the necessary pumping stations, including further sections of the
main trunk sewer, which would eventually terminate in a sea outfall,
thus carrying all wastewater away from the hitherto polluted lagoons
surrounding Abidjan. The works actually carried out consisted of some
69 km of mains and canals, broadly as planned but modified from the
original design to reflect unforeseen urban development and to permit
better functioning of the works completed under earlier projects; some
variations were also caused by major road construction and actual
obstacles in the terrain.  The final phase of the program, including the
sea outfall and a program of sewer connections, is the subject of the
proposed Bank-financed Third Abidjan Sewerage Project (paras 2.06 and
3.01 to 3.02).
3.        Though most of the major works were completed about a year
late (due to administrative delays aud problems such as bad weather, the
major road reconstructions and the insolvency of a pipe manufacturer),
the project was closed on December 31, 1985, two and a half years late;
the additional slippage relates to delays in preparing and executing a
program of house connections and to slowness in forwarding disbursement
requests. The number of connections actually executed is less than it
was foreseen at appraisal (paras 3.02 and 3.03).
4.        Total project costs came out much as projected, but, because
of appreciation of the dollar, represented an underspending of some 14%
in US dollars. About US$4.5 million of the loan is likely to be
cancelled as not required for the works under this project (paras 3.06
and 3.07).
5.        Due to the lack of quantifiable benefits, the economic rate of
return of the sewerage component was not calculated at appraisal. A
financial internal rate of return was computed to determine the adequacy
of the sewerage surcharge for cost recovery. The relative share of this
surcharge in the water tariff sharply decreased in 1984 and water
consumption forecasts being presently revised at 55% of the volumes
foreseen, the financial internal rate of return (FIUR) of the sewerage
component is now estimated at -8.7% vs. an expected 8%. However, on a



sector basis tha average water revenue per m9 compares with the combined
(water supply and sewerage) average incremental cost. As regards the
drainage component, flooding reduction objectives were distinctly
achieved through the project and the reevaluation of the economic rate
of return (ERR) now provides identical results to '.hose expected at
appraisal (ERR ir the range of 6%) (paras 7.06 to 7.08).
6.        The sustainability of the benefits of the project is
questionable if the present level of maintenance expenditures will keep
going in the future. Tariff adjustments are needed, specifically to
ensure the generation of sufficien- funds for a full coverage of
operating and maintenance costs. Thus the sustainability of benefits
would be definitely enhanced (para 4.03).
7.        The principal project agencies (SETU's Sewerage and Drainage
Department for Construction, DDA (Direction du Drainage et de
l'Assainissement) and the National Sawerage Fund, FNA (Ponds National de
l'Assainisset2nt), for project finance) functioned satisfactorily,
though some of the institutional proposals under the project were
delayed or not implemented at all. The national water company, SODECI,
(Soci6t6 de Distribution d'Eau de la C6te d'Ivoire) operates and
maintains the installations efficiently by delegation from SETU, and
also collects, on behalf of FNA, the separate sewerage surcharge as part
of the water tariff. Because of the lengthy period of project
execution, FNA was able to generate from this surcharge a larger share
of project costs than anticipated, thus avoiding additional borrowing
for the project; but all the project entities are plagued by massive
balances of mutual indebtedness, symbols of the widespread economic
depression of recent years (paras 6.02 to 6.04).
8.        The diffused institutional structure of the sector (and
similarly the water supply sector), with different entities responsible
for construction, operation and finance worked rather well for some
years, but has recently shown signs of strain, and a major review has
been undertaken, with Bank assistance. Proposals to streamline the
sector and to resolve some of its cash flow problems are likely to be
the subject of the water supply and sewerage sector adjustment loan, in
the near future (paras 6.06 to 6.08).
9.        Following are the lessons which emerged from the project
experience (para 9.05) and which are already learned and embodied in
Bank policy:
(i)     the need for realistic projections of project timetables,
loan disbursements and public utility revenues;
(ii)    the importance of adequate internal cash generation,
rather than relying on debt financing, particularly in
currencies subject to possible appreciation; and
(iii)   the desirability of maintaining continuity of the Bank
staff assigned to a project and sector.



REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(Loan 1577-IVC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
A.  The Borrower and the Project
1.01        The Government of the Republic of C8te d'Ivoire is the
Borrower under Loan 1577-IVC, approved on May 25, 1978 and signed on
June 9, 1978. The loan was for US$33 million, of aich US$28.7 million
was to be on-lent to the Government's National Sewdrage Fund (FIA) for
use by the principil beneficiary under the project, SETU, whose Sewerage
and Drainage Department (DDA) executed most of the project. The
Government itself was to be the beneficiary of US$0.3 million of the
loan, for study and computerization of the property tax administration,
and for manpower and training studies in the water supply, sewerage and
drainage sectors. The remaining US$4 million of the loan was
unallocated, available as needed for either beneficiary, to meet
physical and pri^e contingencies.
1.02        This project was a follow-on operation to the first Abidjan
Sewerage and Drainage Project (Loan 1076-IVC), approved in January 1975
and which closed in June 1979. The Project Completion Report was issued
on February 5, 1981. Other works in the sewerage and drainage sector
were included in an Urban Development Project (Loans 1347/8-IVC). A
third sewerage and drainage project is tentatively scheduled for FY88.
In the related water supply sector, two projects have also been
undertaken with the aid of Bank financing (Loans 1484-IVC and 2130-IVC,
approved in 1977 and 1982, respectively.) A sector adjustment loan was
also appraised in May/June 1985.
1.03        This Project Completion Report is based on one prepared by
SETU, and on information supplied by SETU, FNA, the Cent.al Water
Directorate (Direction de 'Eau, DE), the national water company
SODECI 1/, the Tax Department and the Treasury, as well as by Bank staff
formerly associated with the project, to all of whom appreciation is
expressed. Reference was also made to project documents, reports and
correspondence in the Bank's records. Project completion missions to
the Republic of C3te d'Ivoire were made in September 1985 (for technical
aspects) and November 1985 (for financial and economic aspects).
B. The Sector
1.04        The project and its forerunners were part of a program drawn
up in the early 1970s, aimed at remedying some of the serious
1/   Societ6 de Distribution d'Eau de la Cote d'Ivoire.



-2-
shortcomings which bad developed in Abidjan's inadequate and poorly
maintained sewerage and storm drainage systems. About 65% of the
population had to dispose of waste water and sewage into open pits and
unlined watercourses and, since no public sewage treatment stations
existed, raw sewage was discharged into the lagoons surrounding the
city, creating serious pollution. Storm water drainage was likewise
inadequate, with the result that several densely populated areas
experienced contiuual problems with flooding. The first project (Loan
1076-IVC) comprised a relatively small package of urgent works under the
program, which alleviated the more pressing ueeds of the city and formed
a prelude to a major construction program. This project represents a
substantial part of that progroa.
C. Sector Organization
1.05        As part of the rehabilitation program, the Government in
1974 introduced a comprehensive reorganization of the sector, in
parallel with a similar modification for the water supply sector. A new
financing strategy was created for botb sectors, with all capital works
to be financed from loans, through special revolving funds (FNA for
sewerage and drainage and FNH (Fonds National de l'Hydraulique) for
water supply) and a uniform country-wide water tariff established, with
separate components to cover water supply operation, water supply debt
service and sewerage; a component was also added to the general property
tax levy towards the cost of drainage.
1.06        Under the institutional structure for the sewerage/drainage
sector, the planning, design and construction of capital works, together
with their operation and maintenance, were the responsibility of
SETU/DDA, until recently supervised by the Government's Central Sewerage
Directorate (DCAD). By Presidential Decree of April 11, 1984 DCAD was
merged with the Central Water Directorate to become the Direction de
l'Eau (DE) responsible for planning, design and construction of water
and sewerage works since the date of the decree. However, for practical
reasons, the responsiblity for implementing the Second Abidjan Sewerage
Project was left with SETU/DDA, which Is likely to be liquidated soon.
Opevatio" and maiutenance of the main Abidjan systems are, however,
sub-contracted to the private water company SODECI, which also bills and
collects the water and sewerage surcharge portions of the water tariff
respectively on behalf of FNH and FNA. FNA centralizes all sector
receipts and payments (including debt service) and oversees sector
borrowings, investments and financial plans. FNA is an offshoot of the
Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), the national debt office of the
Republic of CMte d'lvoire, and is subject to the supervision of the
Ministry of Economics and Finance; that Ministry also collects the
drainage taxes on property on behalf of FNA, through the Tax Department
and the Treasury.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin
2.01        The project, together with the first Abidjan Sewerage and
Drainage project, originated from a general water supply, sewerage and
drainage study of Greater Abidjan, carried out in 1970-72 by the World
Health Organization with UNDP financing; this was followed by master
plan studies for sewerage and drainage in Abidjan for the decade
1975-85. Studies for other cities have also been carried out in more
recent years.
2.02        The feasibility studies on sewage treatment and disposal
indicate that the long-term least cost solution, in view of rising
energy custs, was primary treatment with ultimate disposal through an
ocean outfall, rather than by more advanced treatment prior to lagoon
disposal. The whole program of works was divided into three phases:
the first phase began with a package of urgent measures to reduce lagoon
pollution and serious flooding, and to sewer new residential and
industrial areas, entailing the laying of about 23 km of sewers and
drains with pumping stations, all comprised in the first Abidjan
Sewerage and Drainage Project (Loan 1076-IVC). The project also
included logistic support (buildings and equipment) and technical
assistance to the newly established DDA. These investments were
estimated to cost US$15 million towards which the Bank loan contributed
US$9 million. The Bank was associated with the master plan and
feasibility studies from the outset and concurred with the solutions
proposed, including the choice of SETU/DDA as executing agency for the
sector.
2.03        The remaining portion of the first phase of the 1975-85
program, comprising extensions to the network of trunk and collector
sewers, was completed with Bank assistance of US$7 million provided
under the Abidjan Urban Development Project (Loans 1347/8-IVC). The
second phase constituted the project now under review, and consisted
principally of further expansion of the collection network and another
section of the main trunk sewers interconnected and extended to the
proposed ocean outfall.
B. Appraisal and Negotiations
2.04        Appraisal took place in June 1977, with follow-up missions
in November 1977 and January 1978, and negotiations in April 1978. The
delay before negotiations was mainly due to lengthy discussions on the
project financing plan, and the need to submit this for Cabinet
approval.
C. Project ObJectives
2.05        The overall project objectives were to continue to develop
the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system and the Institutions
responsible for this system. In particular:



-4-
(a)    to develop an institutional framework with staffing to
assure a competent management of the sewerage and
drainage sector;
(b)    to provide the trunk and primary sewers and drains
which would permit the development of a sewerage and
drainage collection system necessary for the orderly
development of Abidjan;
(c)    to relieve the water pollution of the badly-affected
dead-end parts of the lagoons around Abidjan;
(d)    to establish a regular maintenance and rcpair service
for the sewerage and drainage system;
(e)    to assist SETU and SODECI in establishinig a house
connection program and administration for Abidjan,
including the study of appropriate credit facilities
for connections and the installation of sanitary
equipment in the houses; and
(f)    to develop small entrepreneurs (especially plumbers),
and encourage local production of sanitary equipment.
D.  Project Description
2.06        The Project was conceived to cover the second phase of the
master plan for the improvement and expansion of the sewerage and storm
water drainage facilities in Greater Abidjan. At appraisal the project
provided for:
I. Sewera&e
(a)    Supply and laying of:
(i) about 1.5 km of primary sewers in Treichville Sud;

outlet and diffuser and construction of, and equipment
for, one pumping station;
(iv) about 6.5 km of sewers in Williamsville;
(v) about 2 km of sewers in Blokosso;
(vi) about 13.5 km of primary sewers in the Banco; and

combination primarily with (a) (ii), (iv), (v) and (vii)
above.
II. Drainase
(a)    Supply and laying of:
(i) about 1.5 km of drainage mains in Treichville Sud;
(ii) about 10 km of primary drains, including necessary
streetdrains, in Marcory Habitat; and
(iii) about 4.5 km of primary drains in Abobo.
(b)    Construction of:
(i) about 4 km of drainage canals, including necessary
waterfalls, in the Banco and Yopougon; and
(ii) about 1.5 km of drainage canals, including necessary
waterfalls, in Banco Nord.
(c)    Rehabilitation of existing drainage works, incidental
operations in Marcory Sud-Est and Adjame, as well as works
undertaken in the areas of housing developers.
III.  Road Upgrading
Asphalt road surfacing for about 6.5 km of streets in Marcory
Habitat.
IV. Consulting Services
1. Strengthening of SETU in financial management;
strengthening of SETU's activities related to the Project;
and consulting services, in collaboration with Ivorian
agencies concerned, for the preparation of:
(a) feasibility studies for a project covering the third
phase of the Abidjan sewerage and drainage master plan;
and
(b) studies to determine means:



-6-
(M) to promote small entrepreneurs such as plumbers
and local civil works contractors;
(ii) to promote small industries for local
manufacturing of sanitary equipment; and
(iii) to introduce commercial credit facilities for
home plumbing improvements and connections.
2. (a) the preparation of a property tax study;
(b) the establishment of a computerized information system
to strengthen the Borrower's property tax collection
capability; and
(c) the preparation of manpower and training studies with
respect to the Borrower's water supply and sewerage and
drainage requirements.
V. Training
Training abroad and local apprenticeships for SETU staff in
sewerage and drainage system management and operations.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
A. Project Inception
3.01                Procedural delays held t;p effectiveness of the loan; for
example, nine months elapsed before the subsidiary on-lending agreement
was signed. The loan eventually became effective on September 14, 1979,
more than fifteen months after Board presentation; however, PNA was able
to advance funds to start up the project before loan effectiveness.
B. Project Revisions
3.02        Annex 3-1 tabulates works projected and actually
executed. All components identified at appraisal were realized, though
a number of revisions were introduced in the originally planned
facilities, for various reasons. Some modifications were made after
completion of the first phase, to improve sanitary conditions in the
areas concerned, to reflect unforeseen urban development, and to permit
more efficient functioning of the works already constructed. Other
modifications entailed realignments of the main collector sewer because
of major road reconstruction, or to avoid having to move other utility
mains or demolish buildings, or because land owners or local inhabitants
raised objections. Some public utility mains did have to be moved, and
in places project materials had to be changed because of adverse soil



-7-
conditions encountered. Some of these revisions gave rise to additional
costs and/or delays in execution. In addition, some project components
were extended or reduced, including:
(a)    increased length of drainage facilities, due to erosion
provoked by 1983 heavy rainfalls, during the project
execution;
(b)    repair of existing sewage pumping stations, and addition of
an administrative building to one pumping station;
(c)    additional consulting services related to the definition of
the third phase of the Greater Abidjan Sewerage Master Plan
and to its impact on the Abidjan Lagoon environment as well
as to the establishment of a detailed inventory of the
Abidjan sewerage and drainage fixed assets; on the other
hand, the property tax study was transferred to the Second
Water Supply Project;
(d)    purchase and installation of a mini-computer to improve
SETU's organizational and managerial performance;
(e)    decrease of the number of social sewerage house connections
from 3,500 to 1,500, due essentially to a too conservative
approach adopted by SETU which consisted of implementing
this program in two phases:
Ist phase: 1,500 sewerage house connections;
2nd phase: 2,000 sewerage house connections.
The time spent by SETU in identifying the solution to be adopted for
these connections, the households to be equipped, and launching,
evaluating, and awarding the contract was abnormally loug, so that
practically only the first phase of 1,500 house connections was
completed only a few months before the loan closing date. A number of
sewer connections were made during the course of the project, by private
developers and individuals; thcse were often unsupervised, or even
clandestine, some being made to the storm water sewers. However, a
major expansion of sewer conaections was frustrated by indecision as to
whether SODECI or DDA should be responsible, and by a downturn in SETU's
program of urban land development. An inventory of actual connections
to date was carried out by SODECI.
3.03        Project construction was delayed by over three and a half
years. The main reasons for delay were:
(a)    additions and revisions to the program of works, outlined in
para 3.02;
(b)    bid evaluation and contract award which took several months;



-8-
(c)    roadworks in Treichville-Bietri, which held up work in the
area for about six months;
(d)    insolvency of a major local pipe manufacturer which caused a
year's delay in starting the second half of the project;
(e)    bad weather and unstable soil conditions.
Though the bulk of the work had been completed by early 1983, the sewer
connections program got under way very late (para 3.02) and in view of
the lengthy time needed to process disbursement applications in FNAICAM,
the loan closing date, originally fixed as June 30, 1983, was deferred
twice; the loan actually closed on December 31, 1985.
C. Reporting
3.04        SETU kept the Bank well informed about matters of project
implementation and responded in a timely manner to the Bank's remarks
and suggestions. Financial and audit reports were duly received, but
sometimes with considerable delays.
D. Procurement
3.05        SETU had no difficulties in complying with the Bank's
procurement guidelines, though five to ten months generally elapsed for
bid evaluation and contract award. Sewerage and drainage works in the
same area were combined into one contract where possible.
E. Project Costs
3.06        Annex 3-2 shows details of project cost; at the time of
appraisal this was estimated to be CFAF 13,010 million (US$53.1 million
equivalent) net of taxes, of which the foreign exchange cost was CFAF
8,085 million (US$33.0 million equivalent). The cost estimate included
15% for physical contingencies and 34% for price contingencies. The
Bank loan of US$33.0 million was to cover foreign exchange costs of the
project, equivalent to 62% of total cost.  Of this, US$29.5 million was
for sewerage and drainage work and US$3.5 million for consulting
services.
3.07        The actual project cost, CFAF 13,219.1 million (US$45.9
million equivalent) is almost the same as the amount estimated at
appraisal, but represents about 14% savings in US dollars, reflecting
mainly currency readjustments. Therefore, loans savings in the amount of
US$4.5 million are expected, which would be cancelled by Government and
the Bank. (The appraisal estimates were based on a rate of CFAF 245 to
US$1, but the dollar, after falling during 1978-80, appreciated markedly
thereafter, reaching over CFAE 400 in 1984-85.) The cost of physical
components came out broadly as estimated (including contingency
allowances), the extra costs of pipe laying and civil engineering,
attributable to variation orders and to price increases because of
project delays, being compensated by lower prices for supply contracts.



Engineering, administration and other studies cost more than the amount
estimated, due to the extended construction period and a greater volume
of work on the preliminary design of the final disposal system (Third
Phase).
F. Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.08           Annex 3-3 shows the consulting assignments awarded.  The
consultants in charge of design and bid evaluation of the Abidjan
sewerage and drainage sector performed satisfactorily. However, SETU
feels that some of the problems and auditional costs incurred through
unsuitable soil conditions might have been avoided by a more thorough
geotechnical survey. Consultants in charge of the feasibility study
related to the third phase of the Greater Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage
Project were selected according to the Bank guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Notwithstanding, these consultants
recommended a solution which was not adopted, because it was too
sophisticated, inappropriate and too expensive. The recruitment of two
specialists in wastewater treatment and disposal was necessary. They
identified and cost estimated the solution which was finally adopted,
consisting of floatable removal and ocean disposal through an outfall
(as originally envisaged), but without primary treatment. Consultants
In charge of studies relating to the promotion of local entrepreneurs
operating in the water/sanitation sector performed reasonably; however
their recommendations have not yet been put into effect. The property
tax study was transferred to the Second Water Supply Project (Loan
2130-IVC) as funds allocated for this study within Loan 1577-IVC were
thought to be too limited. Consultants in charge of work supervision
performed satisfactorily.
3.09           The goal of obtaining satisfactory competition and better
quality at lower prices was achieved with the international competitive
bidding for large contracts, and, in general, performance of suppliers
and contractors was good.
G. Disbursements
3.10           A comparison of the estimated and actual disbursements of
the Bank loan appears in Annex 3-4; this shows that by the forecast date
of final disbursement (December 1982), only 56% had been in fact
disbursed. This underdisbursement (which, incidentally, is consistent
with a regional profile of actual disbursements In the sector) reflects
the delays in project implementation, compounded by delays in the
approval of contracts by higher authority in the Republic of C8te
d'Ivoire and in eubsequent processing of disbursement applications. In
an endeavor to speed up disbursements, SETU requested direct payments to
suppliers, only to find that these took even longer because of increased
processing time in the agencies responsible for forwarding disbursement
requests to the Bank. All the project objectives were attained at a
cost in CFAF which is very close to the amount estimated at appraisal.
However, because of the appreciation of the dollar, some US$4.5 million



-10-
of the loan would not be required and would be cancelled. The
disbursement percentages originally fixed in the Loan Agreement were
based on project costs inclusive of taxes; therefore, when the
Government exempted the project from taxes, the percentages were
increased correspondingly, so that the average disbursement rose from
51% of project costs to about 62X, broadly as proposed in the SR.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01           The main technical objective of the second-phase project
was to provide immediate measures to reduce lagoon pollution and to
eliminate serious flooding and provide sewerage for priority areas.
4.02           While flooding elimination in critical areas and sewerage
provision to priority areas were achieved through the project, the
reduction of the lagoon pollution was not achieved in either the first-
or second-phase sewerage projects as the wastewater effluents are still
discharged into the lagoon. Only the implementation of the third phase
project will significantly reduce the lagoon pollution, through the
ocean outfall.
4.03           Operation and maintenance of the system are carried out
competently by SODECI, as sub-contractor to SETU/DDA, though hampered by
insufficient funds and the lack of pollution control regulations
(para 4.04). However, SODECI only mai'ntains part of the network; about
100 km of large drainage sewers built by the Governments's Major Works
Directorate DCGTX (Direction et ContrBle des Grands Travaux) and a
number of privately constructed sever systems are not maintained at all.
In this situation the sustainability of sewerage and drainage services
is unsatisfactory and could be improved through an appropriate tariff
adjustment.
A. Operating Covenants
4.04           Operating covenants were, by and large, respected by
SETU, including the establishment of a fixed assets register
(sub-contracted to SODECI) and the execution of an amended maintenance
contract with SODECI which better copes with actual requirements.
However, the sector regulations required under the Loan Agreement (for
instance those concerning social connections) were never promulgated,
though the requisite decree was drafted; and the recruitment by SETU of
an additional financial expert was repeatedly and permanently deferred,
partly because of uncertainty surrounding SETU's future status and
attributions.



-ll-
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01           The divided institutional structure of the sewerage and
drainage sector provides that SODECI operates and maintains the systems,
and bills and collects the sewerage surcharge as part of the water
tariff; the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance bills and collects
drainage taxes; FNA receives all revenues actually collected, together
with loans and grants, and pays all charges; and DDA is responsible for
construction. This allocation of responsibilities enables each sector
entity to concentrate on its own particular task; however, it means that
the financial picture is equally dispersed and fragmented. The Bank has
endeavored, both for this sector and the water supply sector, to require
the compilation of global sector accounts, so as to give a complete
overview of each sector's finances; but despite repeated loan covenants,
this haa never got off the ground (though a start has been made, for the
first time, on a fixed assets register).
5.02           One obstacle to such a consolidation is that the various
agencies have different accounting methods, different financial years,
and different auditors. Under this project the requirement was pitched
more modestly, to the effect that FNA should prepare annual statements
combining DDA's accounts with its own. This has been complied with
after a fashion, since up to 1985 DDA kept no accounts at all, merely
billing its expenditures to FNA for reimbursement; in this sense, the
accounts may indeed be saiL to be consolidated. Annexes 5-1 through 5-3
set out FNA's detailed fine Zial statements for the period 1978-84.
5.03           The SAR pro, -ed the financial statements of the sector
in the way in which a public ' lity undertaking would present them.
FNA, however, prepares its accounts more from the standpoint of a
banker; for example, fixed assets appear in the books only to the extent
that loan debt is still outstanding on them, and are revalued annually,
not for inflation, but in step with exchange rate fluctuations affecting
the related loan debt 2/; all other capital expenditure is written off
immediately by massive depreciation charges. Revenues are credited only
as collected, not as billed; sewerage operation and maintenance
expenditure is capitalized; on the other hand, capital grants are
credited as current revenue. These conservative practices are perhaps
defensible in an organization whose expenditures are all contractual
cash outflows which cannot be met out of mere notional bookkeeping
surpluses; nevertheless, they do distort the financial picture, in the
sense that comparisons with SAR projections are of necessity superficial
and can give only an incomplete indication of comparative financial
performance.
2/ The auditors have criticized FNA's practice of writing down and
revaluing fixed assets so as to keep their value equal to
outstanding loan debt.



_12-
5.04           Accordingly, the table below picks out the salient
features of the sector's finances, extracted piecemeal from the SAR and
from FAM's accounts, both for the originally forecast project
implementation period 1978-81 and for the extended period 1978-84. The
SAR showed sewerage and drainage separately, and it was a loan condition
that FNA should do likewise; however, this requirement has never been
complied with, nor has it been possible to keep completely separate
accounts for Abidjan, as promised.

Comparison of other items would be meaningless; for example,
depreciation in the SAR was calculated at 2% on all assets, including
pre-1974 installations, whereas FNA depreciates only works in the
ongoing program, but at rates up to 100%.
5.05           It will be observed that capital expenditure fell well
short of the amount projected. Up to 1981, the shortfall was
attributable to project delays; after 1981, to the limited amount of
further investment undertaken, in particular that the third phase of the
program has not yet been started. (Projections assumed this to begin as
early as 1982, as originally planned.) Loan receipts were
proportionately even more reduced, in comparison with projections,
partly because the project slippage made possible increased financing
from FNA's own resources. Debt service, after 1981, however, shows a
sharp increase in relation to the amount borrowed, because of the fall
in the value of the franc which inflated the liability for prior
borrowings; it is in fact the case that, though FNA repaid CFAF 2.5
billion during 1978-84, the remaining debt still to be repaid swelled by
almost exactly the same amount because of higher exchange rates for the
currency in which that debt is denominated, thus in a sense wiping out
FNA's repayments.
5.06           Revenues from the sewer surcharge fell somewhat short of
the estimate after 1981. From the economic analysis in the SAR, water
sales in Abidjan appear to have been projected to rise from 64 million
ms in 1978 to 100 million by 1984. In fact, 1978 sales for the whole
country totalled only 59 million ms; those for Abidjan were only 43.5
million ms, and by 1984 were still only 51 million, having shown
practically no change since 1980 -- far short of projections. The
stagnation is attributed to the closing of a number of large industries,
the exodus of many major domestic consumers (expatriates) and consumer
resistance to tariff increases in the general climate of economic
recession (the number of consumers in Abidjan actually rose by 40%,
despite the stagnant sales volume).
5.07           Sewer surcharge rate levels were projected to rise by 10%
annually, plus inflation (10-12%); in fact, the tariff was subjected to
spasmodic revisions, as follows:
Average Sewer Surcharge (CFAF/ms)
Date                AbidJan  Elsewhere  National Average
1978 (yearly average)         14.4        14.4         14.4
Oct. 1, 1979               30.8        16.8         27.0
Oct. 1, 1980               37.1         3.4         27.0
Oct. 1, 1981               37.2        3.4          26.6
Apr. 1, 1984                4.6         3.3          4.2
Oct. 1, 1984               15.3       10.5          13.8
Actual implementation of tariff increases sometimes lagged for months
after the official date indicated above, however. The uneven movements
in 1984 reflect the need to make room for substantial increases in the
Abidjan water surcharge, without increasing the overall rate beyond



-15-
affordable limits; and, from 1980, the logic of reducing the sewer
surcharge for areas outside Abidjan with little or no sewerage
infrastructure. Though the average countrywide surcharge was almost
doubled in 1979, it is by now lower than in 1978, FNA being judged to be
in a much better financial situation than its sister fund for water
supply (FNH), and thus needing a smaller share of the total revenue.
5.08           The drainage tax likewise was not as productive as
forecast, building construction having slowed down: the amounts credited
in FNA's accounts representing collections by the Tax Department grew
from CFAF 1.6 billion in 1982 to CFAF 4.1 billion in 1984, but the
apparent growth appears to result from cumulative correction of amounts
under-credited previously, rather from a real upsurge in collections,
which remain fairly constant over time.
5.09           Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable in the table
reflect a major problem in recent years in Ivory Coast: shortage of
liquid assets.  All the sector institutions (as in other sectors and in
other countries) are struggling in a morass of mutual indebtedness.  At
the end of FY84, SODECI claimed to be owed about CFAF 14 billion by
Government and public agencies.  In turn, SODECI owed FNH about CPAF  8
billion and FNA CFAF 0.8 billion, for surcharges actually collected;
SODECI's customers owed a further CFAF 6 billion and CFAF 0.8 billion,
collectible respectively for PNH and FNA. The Treasury owed FNA CFAF 5
billion on account of drainage tax collections 3/, while FNA in its
turn owed the national debt office (CAA) almost CFAF 1 billion for
unpaid debt service and other liabilities, as well as CFA? 0.7 billion
to SODECI for works.
5.10           FNA's general financial situation, however, remained
surprisingly satisfactory otherwise. It maintained a cash reserve of
between CFAP 2 billion and CFAF 4 billion throughout the period (partly
representing unused grants) which produced useful interest; and though
its revenue surplus fluctuated considerably year by year, as a result of
its draconian depreciation policies, this ended up  dlmost exactly as
forecast at the end of 1984 (CFAF 3 billion). However, given the
completely different accounting principles, as assumed for projections,
and as applied in reality, this similarity is purely fortuitous.
3/ These arrears were verified by the completion mission at the
offices of SODECI and the Treasury; the latter reported that its
arrears were in fact settled during 1985.

5.12           The comparison above does not call for major comment; it
will be seen that, because of project delays, FNA had longer in which to
generate contributions from revenue, enabling it to avoid further
borrowing and to compensate for lower equity contributions (Government
grants).
5.13           The SAR included a number of key financial ratios.
Calculation of those actually achieved would not be meaningful for
comparison because of the numerous disparities in accounting principles
and is therefore not attempted.
B. Rate Covenant
5.14           The rate covenant for this project and its predecessors
was of the "net cash generation" kind. It provided that net cash
generation from Abidjan should cover an agreed percentage of capital
expenditure on the Bank projects, originally fixed at 50X; but by the
time of appraisal of this project, it was felt that, with the
considerably enlarged investment program, 20% would be more reasonable
(assuming VAT exemption for project expenditures), and the calculation
was converted to a cumulative one over the period, in place of separate
annual calculations.
5.15           An exact test of compliance is difficult, because in
FNA's accounts capital costs and other expenses and revenues
attributable to each Bank project are not always readily ascertainable
year by year; moreover, the calculation formula excluded technical
assistance and studies from the definition of capital expenditure,
whereas these are included by FNA. The main distortion, however,
subsists in the large and unforeseen fluctuations in working capital
which affect annual cash generation ratios (though the cumulative
calculation tends to smooth these out). Indeed, one drawback in cash
generation covenants is that a borrower can enhance his performance,
perhaps unintentionally, merely by falling behind in payments to
creditors. For all the above mentioned resources, the "net cash
generation" covenant has not been a very useful tool to highlight the
Borrower's performance.
5.16           Annex 5-4 sets out a statement of the cumulative cash
generation percentages achieved, calculated as closely as practicable to
the basis intended. This shows that the target appears to have been
well attained, with rates of cumulative cash generation ranging from 291
to 44%. The lag in construction no doubt helped; but in reality
performance was even better, since cash generation was artifically
depressed by the large amounts outstanding from SODECI and the Treasury;
there are grounds for arguing that, as these had already been collected
from consumers, they were not debts due to the sector, and could
therefore well have been added to the sector's revenues for purposes of
this calculation.

C. Other Financial Covenants
5.17           The main financial covenants not referred to elsewhere
are listed below:
(a)    Increase of 10% in sewer surcharge from January
1979 (almost doubled from October 1979);
(b)    Drainage tax to be doubled (done);
(c)    Supplementary loan of CFAF 2.3 billion to be
raised (not needed);
(d)    Exemption of sector expenditures from VAT
(done);
(e)    Sewer charges co be included in water tariff
study (done);
(f)    Quarterly remittance of drainage tax to FNA
(partially and irregularly complied with);
(g)    Separate accounts for sewerage and drainage
(not done);
(h)    Asset register established for sewerage sector
(done but much delayed);
{i)    Social connections study (done with some
delay); and
(j)    Investment limitation (complied with).
In general, apart from the delays, compliance may be said to have been
satisfactory.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMAUCE
6.01        The objectives of both this project and its predecessor
focussed to a considerable degree on institutional improvements. Before
the first project, the sector was fragmented and poorly organized. The
groundwork for the first project accordingly included a substantial
ov( haul of the sector organization, including the establishment of two
new entities (FNA and DDA); the project itself included measures to
promote their institutional development, including technical assistance,
training, management studies and insistence on effective arrangements
for system maintenance. By the time of appraisal of this project, a
good deal had been achieved, but there still remained work to be done;
and the project accordingly included further technical assistance to
SETU, FNA and the Tax Department. The sector agencies have continued to
mature and, generally speaking, have become reasonably efficient bodies.



-19-
*         Whether the allocation of responsibilities between the various entities
is still valid is considered below (para 6.07).
A. SETU/DDA
6.02           Technical operations have been carried out efficiently by
SETU, assisted until recently by considerable expatriate assistance,
which by 1981 ineluded eight persons in DDA out of a staff of 47. Of
these eight, only one remained until the closing date, and DDA's
institutional performance has slipped back, for example, in bid
evaluation and contract award -- partly for this reason, and partly due
to some decline in staff morale following a change in SETU's personnel
statutes imposed by the Government, which entailed severe salary cuts.
This deterioration appears particularly noticeable in the field of
accounting, always a weak point in SETU; the financial accounts have
fallen into disarray, being now 15 months in arrears.  Technical
assistance in accounting was to be provided under the project, but SETU
has never taken advantage of this. DDA's accounts were for the first time
incorporated into those of SETU in 1985.  Although this consolidation
may be deemed as positive, it will not be significant in the future as
all sector responsibilities were transferred to DE by Presidential
Decree of April 11, 1984 (para 1.06).
B. FNA
6i-03          FNA, which shares the same staff of about a dozen people
with INH, functions adequately (apart from some of its unusual
accounting practices) and has been able to dispense with expatriate
assistance. The advent of computer systems to replace the cumbersome
manual methods previously used has effected an improvement in the speed
and accuracy of accounting operations. Processing of project
expenditures within the FNA/CAA complex still, however, appears to take
too long.
C. SODECI
6.04           SODECI has throughout shown itself to be a well-managed
and efficient organisation. Its size and autonomous status, the
availability of expatriate expertise from its parent company in France,
coupled with its own training center for local staff, and its commercial
orientation make it one of the most effective water authorities in West
Africa. Operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of the sewer and
drainage network are efficiently executed by SODECI as sub-contractor to
DDA, though difficulties have arisen through the lack of control and
enforcement regulations for the sector (para 4.03). Apart from this,
the company's main problem is recovery of customer arrears, despite
strenuous efforts, because of circumstances beyond its control.
D. Tax Department
6.05           The SAR identified weaknesses in the operation of the Tax
Department, responsible inter alia for collecting the drainage tax on



-20-
behalf of FNA; these weaknesses stemmed primarily from under-staffing
and obsolete recording systems, and the project included studies and
assistance for the assessment and collection sections, including
computerization. However, for a long period, no agreement could be
reached on this matter, which appears to be politically extremely
sensitive; these components were eventually transferred to a later
project (Second Water Supply) and are not yet completed. A major
problem is the poor performance of the Tax Department which results into
a slow and incomplete collection of the tax; despite all efforts, this
continues to be disappointing. As of September 1985, only 25S of the
1984 tax had been collected; in fact, of the total tax due over the
previous ten years, only 601 has been collected up to now, the other 401
being considered to be virtually irrecoverable. The valuation register
on which tax is assessed was updated in 1979/80 but has not been revised
since and is gradually becoming outdated once again.
E. General
6.06           The unorthodox structure of the sector organization, with
responsibilities dispersed among several bodies, affords certain
practical advantages; DDA is able to concentrate on planning and
construction and SODECI on operational and commercial aspects, both free
from preoccupations about capital financing, which is provided by a
separate fund with its own revenues, distinct from those of SODECI and
the general state budget. The Government owns the sector assets and
exercises overall supervision through DE and the Ministry of Economics
and Finance.
6.07           Over the years, this system and the similar arrangements
for water supply have worked surprisingly well. However, they do demand
a close degree of cooperation and co-ordination among all concerned; and
recently these relationships appear to have deteriorated. SODECI finds
DDA's supervision somewhat restrictive (though fruitful weekly meetings
take place), and DDA apparently does not always agree with DE. Disputes
a2.so surface between FNA and FNH, which have to provide funds, and thuse
responsible for spending those funds. For these and other reasons, a
major study was commissioned under Loan 2130-IVC to review the entire
structure -- administrative, technical and financial -- of the water and
sewerage sectors, including proposals to resolve the cash flow problems
of the authorities concerned. The Bank is preparing a sectoral
adjustment project to assist in this restructuring. Indications are
that consideration is being given to concentrating all activities under
one body. Meanwhile, it is understood SETU will in any case cease to
exercise responsibility for capital expenditure in this sector after the
present project.
6.08           In summary, while iudividual sector entities have
improved their institutional performance considerably compared to the
situation in the early days of the first Bank loan in the sector, this
improvement has in some respects tended to level out during the course
of this project; while, collectively, there appears to have been a
deterioration in teamwork, which has given rise to the concerns



-21-
addressed by the study mentioned in the previous paragraph. If these
concerns can be resolved, the latent strengths of the sector's
institutions should be capable of fruitful combination.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION
7.01           As the project was conceived to cover the second phase of
a three-phase 10-year sewerage and drainage development program, its
justification should be analyzed as part of the program as a whole,
particularly as regards the sewerage component.
A. Sewerage
7.02           The major benefits of the sewerage component of the
program identified in the SAR were essentially of a quaiitative nature:
(a)    improvements in health through avoidance of contact with
contaminated water;
(b)    prevention of permanent damage to the environment; and
(c)    protection of the ecological qualities of the lagoons.
7.03        One cannot expect tangible results regarding (b) and (c)
before the completion of the entire program and specifically of the sea
outfall, which would significantly reduce the lagoon pollution (para
4.02).
7.04        Health improvements can hardly be (and actually were not)
quantified in direct relation to such a project. However they depend,
as far as sewage disposal is concerned, on the service levels and on the
number of population connected to either sewerage network or septic
tanks. In this respect, ambitious targets were set in the 10-year
program with a forecast sewerage service rate of 70% by the year 1985
(terminal date of the whole program including the third phase). They
were mainly expected in conjunction with SETU land development projects,
assumed to accomodate more than 850,000 inhabitants over the period.
7.05        As a matter of fact, the general slowdown in the Ivorian
economy and subsequent changes in Government strategy have dramatically
reduced the funding for public housing programs and SETU's prospects
have not materialized. Nevertheless the sewerage service rate has
increased to around 35Z. (More accurate figures will be provided at
completion of the connections' inventory carried out by SODECI.) Some
410,000 additional people have benefitted from the sewerage investments
at this point (Annex 7-1).
7.06        Due to the difficulty in quantifying the main project
benefit (public health), the economic rate of return of the sewerage
program was not calculated at appraisal. The financial internal rate of
return (FIRR) was computed to determine the adequacy of the sewerage
surcharge for cost recovery; FIRR was estimated at 8%. Calculations



-22-
performed after completion (Annex 7-2), using the latest forecast of
water consumption and present tariffs, now result in a negative FIRR
(-8.7%). Current estimates of future consumption are 45% lower than
those forecast at appraisal. Actual revenues from the sewerage
surcharge could not cover the adequate level of operating costs, valued
at more than twice the present expenditures (para 4.03). The sewerage
surcharge should be increased to CFAF 64/ms (to be compared to a
prevalent CPAP 15/mi) to achieve the expected 8% FIRR. However, at
sector level, cost recovery may be regarded as satisfactory, since
approximate values of the AIC for urban water supply and sewerage
combined are in the range of CFAF 300 to 320/ms, which compares with the
average revenue of CFAF 312/ms in 1985 (including water and sewerage
surcharges).
7.07           The sewerage tariff issue is now reconsidered, in the
light of the completion of the inventory of sewer connections. This
would allow to identify the direct beneficiaries from the program. (The
sewerage surcharge is applied to water customers, excepted those falling
into the social block, regardless of the presence of a sewer
connection). A review of the tariff structure is c7ntemplated in a Bank
sector adjustment loan currently under preparation.
B. Drainage
7.08           The drainage component's benefits identified at appraisal
comprised:
(a) unquantifiable health benefits resulting from the
elimination of breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes and
the reduction of the spread of contaminated water; and
(b) reduction in private and public property losses and
damages due to flooding.
Results of a cost/benefit analysis carried out by consultants in the
feasibility study were recapitulated in the SAR; taking exclusively into
account benefits from (b), the economic internal rate of return (ERR)
was estimated at 6% for the entire program.
7.09           Flooding elimination in Marcory, Treichville, Abobo and
Banco low-lying areas was distinctly achieved through the project, at a
cost lower than appraised (CFAF million 4,700 vs. 5,000 at 1977 prices).
On the other hand, a reevaluation of benefits is difficult, given the
intrinsic problem of ex-post evaluation of losses avoided. Moreover the
benefit analysis was based on a costly sample survey of population and
businesses which cannot be repeated. Therefore recalculations, (i)
keeping those quantified benefits estimated at appraisal and (ii) based
on investment costs as incurred in the second phase and as appraised for
the further phase, would provide an ERR slightly higher than the
expected 6%.

C. Urban Poor
7.10           A specific feature of the project is the provision of
social connections. During implementation, it was decided that those
connections will be constructed, free of charge, in heavily populated
areas, to serve "concessions" not connected to the water supply network.
It was foreseen that the average 30-40 persons per courtyard will
consume enough water for a proper operation of a sewer connection,
adequate indoor plumbing fixtures being also installed. 1,500
connections were executed, serving a total of 49,400 people. The
average cost of CFAF 368,000 (US$890) per connection well exceeds the
normal amount of CFAF 100,000 to 150,000 (US$240 to 360), but is quite
comparable, when taking into account the number of persons served (CFAF
11,000 per capita vs. CFAF 12,000).
7.11           Following that innovative approach, the project's impact
on urban poor has gone beyond the objectives set in appraisal as It
highlighted the possibility of disposing waste waters of low standing
houses not connected to the water distribution network, through sewerage
connections at a reasonable investment cost (US$29 equivalent per
person). However, the generalization of such a program is not currently
contemplated, unless some part of the cost could be recovered from the
direct beneficiaries.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
A. Project Preparation and Objectives
8.01           This project was a further stage in a cohesive program of
works for the Abidjan sewerage and drainage systems; a program in which
the Bank had been actively concerned, both in the Master Plan drawn up
in 1973-74, and in subsequent execution of works thereunder (first
Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project, Abidjan Urban Development
Project). Although the sector institutions were still fairly new at the
time of appraisal of this project, the Bank had thus acquired some
knowledge of these capabilities; weaknesses were correctly identified
and appropriate remedies proposed. The objectives of the project were
similar to those of the previous projects, and are summarized earlier in
this report (para 2.05). The proposed works planned were consistent
with the long-term objectives and appear to have been technically sound,
and the cost estimates reasonable; modifications subsequently introduced
in the works were necessary in the light of later experience, and
unforeseeable at the time of appraisal. All in all, the preparation and
appraisal of the project may be said to have been executed in a
workmanlike manner, subject to what is said below (paras 8.02-8.03).
B. Project Scheduling
8.02           The time-horizon for project completion was, in the light
of hindsight, clearly too optimistic; a project appraised today would
undoubtedly make greater allowance for the uncertainties and unforeseen
delays inescapable in projects of this nature.



-24-
C. Project Implementation
8.03           The execution of the project in terms of physical works
did not present any insurmountable problems, though those problems which
did occur sometimes gave rise to delays (para 3.02).
8.04           The loan conditions aimed at remedying institutional
shortcomings (additional financial expert for SETU, tax department
improvements, sector control regulations, prompt remittance of tax
receipts, inventory of sector assets) were appropriate and necessary,
and the revenue covenant was practical and fairly simple to understand
and monitor (though not in the exact form in which it was expressed,
i.e. for Abidjan only). However, some of the accounting requirements
(separation of sewerage and drainage accounts, global sector accounts
consolidated on typical public utility principles), while consistent
with normal Bank standards, were perhaps somewhat ambitious, having
regard to what must have been visible at appraisal, of the sector
entities' accounting practices and limitations. Projections of water
sales and consequent sewerage revenues appear likewise to have been much
too optimistic, even in the light of circumstances prevailing at the
time. What could not have been foreseen at appraisal, however, was the
subsequent complete stagnation of sales in Abidjan essentially due to
the economic crisis, the high water tariff level and the possibility for
the industrialists to abstract ground raw water through private
boreholes; nor could some of the other problems affecting the sector
readily have been anticipated: the widespread liquidity problems, the
unfavorable exchange rate movements, and the exceptional sensitivity
about revising or even investigating the property tax system. The slow
rate of consumer connections to the network was, however, considered at
appraisal to be a project risk, hence the inclusion of studies to
provide concessionary connections.
D. Supervision
8.05           Since several water supply and sewerage projects were in
course of preparation or implementation at one time or another during
the period of this project, in which the same Bank staff and sector
institutions were concerned to some degree, project supervision was
fairly close and constant. The Bank missions devoted much of their time
and attention to efforts to speed up disbursements, to urging
acceleration of the new connections program, to monitoring the sector's
finances, and, in the latter part of the project period, to trying to
clarify the intentions of the authorities about the institutional
structure of the sector, and in particular about SETU's future role.
Subject to the limitation that supervision of an individual project may
tend to become diluted when combined with several other simultaneous
activities, the intensity of supervision given by the Bank to this
project is felt to have been appropriate and adequate, assisted by a
fair degree of staff continuity, on the engineering side at least.



-25-
E. Borrower's Perception of Bank Policies
8.06           There is no evidence that any fundamental criticism of
Bank policy has been voiced by the Borrower or any sector institution,
F. Bank's Contribution
8.07           Working relationships between the Bank staff and their
counterparts in the Republic of CBte d'Ivoire were harmonious and
productive in the main, and any differences which arose were usually
satisfactorily settled by discussion. The Bank's continuous and
detailed dialogue with the sector institutions unde-altedly helped
overcome day-to-day difficulties and, by virtue of having a bird's-eye's
view of all the sector's problems, the Bank probably helped to reconcile
the differing viewpoints of the individual institutions, each intent on
its own particular role. When technical doubts arose on the methodology
for the Third Phase of the Sewerage Program, the Bank was able to put
SETU in touch with individual experts in the field who could provide an
independent and informed assessment of the solutions proposed by
consultants; similarly, the Bank itself provided a consultant for a
preliminary review of the tax department's organization and one to
assess water and waste disposal needs in areas of urban poverty.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01           The physical components financed with the aid of Loan
1577-IVC represented mainly straightforward pipelaying, civil
engineering, and supply contracts. Despite some technical problems,
caused by bad weather, soil conditions and the occasional material
defects, the works were competently executed, though with delays, mostly
caused by extraneous factors. The project has thus achieved one of its
objectives, namely to provide the sewer and drainage collection network
necessary for the orderly development of Abidjan; and it has also
contributed successfully to the elimination of the damaging floods which
plagued low-lying areas of the city. It had not been so successful in
reducing lagoon pollution; while the dead-end portions of the lagoon may
no longer receive the quantity of sewage effluent which they formerly
received, all the effluent as well as the nightsoil of septic tanks
still go into the lagoon somewhere. A layman might question why the sea
outfall, which will resolve this problem, has been left until last.
9.02           Another aspect, for which the project did not produce the
results hoped for, relates to the number of connections to the network.
The works constructed to date remain underutilized (with an implication
of overinvestment) and a future project now in preparation would include
a program of sewer connections. The authorities have so far been slow
in promoting this essential feature of a properly functioning waste
water disposal system.
9.03           Institutionally, the project had mixed results.  Some of
the planne'1 measures were never implemented, or were delayed
considerably; the sector institutions, while they did not attain the



-26-                                              4
levels of perfection envisaged, nevertheless managed to function
satisfactorily. At the same time, for reasons not entirely connected
with this particular project, the efficacy of the present fragmented
sector structure has been the subject of growing concern; and a future
project is intended to address this aspect also.
9.04           Of the other project objectives, some progress has been
achieved, but not to the extent hoped for. A regular maintenance and
repair system has been established, but only for those parts of the
network for which this responsibility has been assigned to SODECI; and
studies have been executed with a view to encouraging small scale
enterprise and to facilitating "social" connections.
9.05           As to lessons to be derived from experience under this
project, those that can be instanced reflect confirmation of lessons
already learned and embodied in Bank policy:
(a)    the need for realistic projections of project timetables,
loan disbursements and public utility revenues;
(b)    the importance of adequate internal cash generation,
rather than relying on debt financing, particularly in
currencies subject to possible appreciation;
(c)    the desirability of maintaining continuity of the Bank
staff assigned to a project and sector.
9.06        In summry, therefore, the project, while not attaining
all the objectives aimed at, did manage to acbleve considerable progress
in building up the sewerage and drainage infrastructure for a rapidly
growing tropical city. The full benefits of this project and its
predecessors will, however, not be perceptible until a major increase in
the number of connections is effected and the final disposal facility
(the ocean outfall) constructed and put into operation; coupled with the
necessary streamlining of the institutional structure and, if possible,
an injection of funds into the sector to overcome present cash flow
problems and the growing burden which debt service represents (though
this last is more imperative in the water sector). All these matters
that have been only partially achieved, will be addressed in the
proposed Bank sector adjustment loan and the Third Abidjan Sewerage
Project currently under preparation.

SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1577-IVC)
SEWERAGE COMPONENTS: CALCULATION OF F1RR AFTER PROJECT COMPLETION
A. Assumptions for recalculations
1.          As in the SAR, calculation of the FIRR is carried out only
for determining the accuracy of the sewerage surcharge as regards cost
recovery and assumes:
(i)  as costs:  all capital and recurrent costr, but
excluding tertiary and secondary network costs which
were included at appraisal and recovered in full after
a three-year period;
(ii)  as revenues:  sewerage surcharge revenues from Abidjan
consumers, including those levied on private abstracts.
2.          Deflators -  Actual figures in current prices are converted
to 1977 prices using deflators as shown in the table below:
1977  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  0985
Public wrks dflator
(capital cost)       1.00  1.04  1.13  1.22  1.24  1.42  1.50  1.59  1.66
CDP deflator
(OR4 costs and revues) 1.00  1.06  1.13  1.16  1.20  1.33  1.48  1.67  1.79
3.          Capital Costs - Capital costs a*C estimated as follows:
(i)  sewerage component of the project from SETU completion
report; in areas where sewerage and drainage costs are
not clearly isolated, a breakdown was made on the basis
of the respective length of pipes laid;
(ii)  third phase:  latest estimates of investment costs
(figures from SAFEGE sector study - November 1985).
4.         Recurrent Costs - 501 of past expenditures are allocated to
the sewerage network. They comprise costs incurred by FNA
(administration), SETU and SODECI (maintenance contract). The adequate
level of costs (estimated at 2.5 times the present amount) is assumed to
be reached in 1987. An additional amount of 5% of further investments
will be spent on operation and maintenance.

B. Results
1.          Data used in the recalculation are shown in Attacbment 1 of
this annex, along with Abidjan water consumption forecasts. The FIRR is
now estimated at -8.7% vs. 8% at appraisal.
2.          Computations of the level of the average water surcharge
required, from 1986 onwards, to reach a 81 FIRR give the following
results (in CFAF/m9i):
1977 prices         1985 prices
Average surcharge in SAR                26.5                47.6
Present level (1985)                     8.5                 15.3
Average surcharge required              35.7                64.0
- increase from present level         +320%                +320%

No. 2484/FNA/YKC/NMB

Attention; Mr. Brian Shields, Chief, Energy, Infrastructure and
Urban Development, Operations Evaluation Department
In response to your letter of June 6, 1986, we have the honor
to advise you that we have no objection to the draft of the Project
Completion Report on the Second Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project
as a whole.
However, we wish to make certain comments on the contents of
certain paragraphs (page VIII para. 3, page 10, para. 3.03, page 24, para.
6.03) which attribute to the FNA the responsibility for the delays found
in the treatment of the disbursement requests.
In our view, the report identifies clearly the causes of this
situation, namely:
- late effectiveness of the loan (page 9);
- delay in execution of the works (page 10).
In any event, at the FNA level, disbursement for works cannot
exceed the average of one week and the request for payments, established in
this regard, are made without delay. We emphasize that it is particularly
the frequency of disbursement requests which determine the disbursements.
Therefore, we consider it somewhat excessive to impute these
delays to the FNA.
Very truly yours
Signed
For the Director General
and by Authority Chief of Services
