SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Project Summary
Borrower:               The Republic of the Ivory Coast.
Amount;                 US$33 million.
Terms:                  17 years, including 4 years' grace at an interest rate
of 7.5 percent per annum. US$28.7 million would be
onlent to SETU, the project executing agency at the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan to the
GovernmLent.
Project Description:   The Project would aim at developing the Abidjan sewerage
and drainage system and the institutions responsible
for this system. It would consist of the second phase
of the Government's 1975 to 1985 Sewerage and Drainage
Development Program. It would be carried out from 1978
to 1981 and include supply and laying of primary sewers
and drains, sewer and drainage networks, construction
and equipment of a pumping station at the Treichville
trunk sewer, construction of drainage canals in the
Banco area, road surfacing and about 500 man-months of
consulting services. The road surfacing works would
ensure the stability of the drainage works. The con-
sulting services are mainly for detailed design, pro-
curement, construction supervision, management assist-
ance, training and feasibility studies for the third
phase of the ten-year development program.

protect the aesthetic and recreational qualities
of Abidjan's lagoons. The benefits of the drainage
works relate to the reduction of damage due to flooding,
giving an economic rate of return of about 6 percent
at a cost of about US$22.3 million in 1976 prices
(about 50 percent of total project costs).

INTERNATIONAI. BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EX(ECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST FOR A
SECOND ABIDJAN SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$33.0 million
to help finance the second phase of the Government's ten-year Abidjan Sewerage
and Drainage Development Program. The loan would have a term of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7.5 percent per annum. US$28.7
million would be onlent to the Fonds National d'Assainissement (FNA) at the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan to the Government.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The Report No. 1147b-IVC "Ivory Coast:  A Basic Economic Report"
was circulated to the Executive Directors in May 1977. Its principal find-
ings and conclusions, updated by a mission which visited the Ivory Coast
in February and April 1978, are incorporated in the following paragraphs.
Annex I provides basic country data.
Past Performance
3.        Throughout the 1960's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a high
annual rate of about 8.3 percent; however, during 1971-75, economic growth
slowed to an average of 5.6 percent per annum partly because of the effects
of adverse climatic conditions in the early years of the period and the
impact of worldwide recession, and partly for structural reasons. In 1976,
per capita GNP reached US$610, one of the highest in Africa. The good over-
all performance of the Ivorian economy over the last 17 years has resulted
from a combination of the following factors: large agricultural potential
and early identification by the Ivorian Government of the best opportunities
for developing this potential; liberal Government policies vis-a-vis foreign
private investment as well as importation of foreign labor and managerial
talent; and generally adequate public finance performance and availability of
external aid.
4.        Favorable ecological conditions in the southern region give the
Ivory Coast a comparative advantage in the cultivation of tree crops (parti-
cularly cocoa and coffee) and in the exploitation of timber resources. From
the early years of independence, the efforts of the Government were concen-
trated on the agricultural and forestry sectors. Large investments were made
in transport infrastructure to open up new forestry and agricultural areas,
and in agricultural research programs. Adequate guaranteed producer prices
and other incentives were introduced to which a dynamic small-holder sub-sector
has responded well. Government-owned large-scale plantations with outgrower

components were developed for oil and coconut palm. Rapid growth has been
achieved in the production of cotton, pineapple, palm and coconut oil, cocoa
and coffee, for the last two of which the Ivory Coast is now the third largest
producer in the world.
5.        A long period of political stability, combined with the free trans-
ferability of profits and capital, has created an aura of confidence abroad
which assured access to -__eign capital. However, the necessary technical
skills to foster the planned development were lacking in the country, and the
Ivorian community welcomed the wide variety of foreign managerial and technical
assistance which rapid growth required.  A member of the franc area and a
strong supporter of monetary and economic cooperation, the Ivory Coast has
always been willing to welcome new regional institutions; it joined the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and has recently helped
promote the CIMAO project, which is the first regional industrial undertaking
involving both French and English speaking countries in West Africa. An
important feature of this cooperation with neighboring countries, which has
been beneficial to all parties concerned, is the large influx of unskilled
labor from less well endowed Sahelian countries, particularly Upper Volta and
Mali. In 1976, the foreign population of the Ivory Coast (mainly non-Ivorian
Africans) was estimated at 2 million, i.e. close to 30 percent of the country's
total of 7 million inhabitants.
6.        The factors mentioned above have enabled the external sector to
grow rapidly, and the value of exports and imports increased more than six
times from 1960 to 1975. The trade balance during this period was positive
and amounted to 14 percent of export earnings from goods. However, the
deficit on non-factor services, workers' remittances and direct investment
income was always large enough so that the current account has never been
in surplus. The most noticeable aspect of export earnings in recent years has
been the high prices received for coffee which increased by 60 percent in
1976 and a further 120 percent in 1977, and those for cocoa which increased
by 20 percent in 1976 and a further 66 percent in 1977. Total export receipts
more than doubled from 1975 to 1977, when they reached approximately US$2.7
billion. However, merchandise imports increased by 70 percent from 1975 to
1977 to US$2.2 billion, partly in response to the import requirements of the
increased public investment program (see paragraph 7 below). The deficit on
services and transfers also increased at a rapid pace, amounting to more than
US$800 million in 1977, but net capital inflows of approximately US$500
million allowed a foreign exchange reserve build-up of US$112 million.
7.        The success of the Ivorian economy is to a substantial extent
attributable to generally sound Government policies regarding public finance
and external aid. The public sector generated savings which, after debt
service, financed about 50 percent of the public investment program. The
level of public investment is projected in the five-year plans (the current
one covers 1976-80) and implemented through a series of rolling three-year
investment programs and annual investment budgets. The 1976-80 Plan called
for public investment of about US$5 billion, the equivalent of about 30
percent of projected GDP (compared to 23 percent during 1971-75). The main
objectives stated in the Plan were to further increase production in developed



regions, develop agriculture in poor Savannah areas, accelerate the open-
ing up of the Southwest, and substantially increase social services. During
the last two years, however, public investment has increased substantially
beyond what was envisaged in the Plan as funds became available from coffee
and cocoa export receipts and as the country borrowed extensively abroad. New
investments were programmed to expand education and other social services, to
develop sugar production into a major industry, and for a variety of projects
in transportation, energy, and other fields. State enterprises have played a
substantial role in this expansion, especially in that portion financed by
external credit. The increased reliance on external capital is reflected in
total external debt (disbursed and undisbursed) which stood at US$1.5 billion
at the end of 1975, US$2.2 billion at end 1976, and approximately US$4.2
billion at end of 1977. The implications of the sharp rise in external public
debt are discussed below (paras. 13 through 16).
Recent Development Issues
8.        To maintain the momentum of recent years and help broaden the access
to the benefits derived from it, the Government will need to persevere with
existing policies designed to diversify the economic base, improve income
distribution, increase the participation of Ivorian nationals in the management
of the economy, and maintain a public investment program of appropriate
dimensions. Current Government policies are directed with some success to
protecting the export-oriented economy against fluctuations in world market
prices and to promoting imore balanced regional development. Agriculture
remains the most important sector, but the share of manufacturing in GDP has
increased from 4 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 1976. Within agriculture,
the production of new crops such as bananas, pineapples, rubber, cotton,
coconut and palm oil has been encouraged, resulting in a decline of the share
of cocoa and coffee in agricultural exports from 72 percent in 1960 to 51
percent in 1976. In 1977, a year of very high coffee and cocoa prices, these
commodities' share of exports rose to 60 percent. As part of a more balanced
regional development policy, large infrastructure investments are under way in
the Southwest in an effort to develop access to that potentially rich region.
9.        Better income-earning opportunities are being provided for the
population in poor rural areas in the North following the identification
and cultivation of improved varieties of cotton, and the promotion of
ox-drawn methods of farmLing. Income distribution is being further improved
by increases in agricultural producer prices, implementation of wage poli-
cies which favor the urb,an poor, and execution of regional investment
programs. As a result, income inequality has diminished in recent years,
with the poorest 40 percent of the population currently receiving about 20
percent of total income.
10.       Progress in "Ivorianization" of capital and labor remains limited.
While agriculture is almost entirely in Ivorian hands, foreign ownership is
still important in forestry, industry, and modern commerce. However, educa-
tion and training are giLven very high priority in the allocation of Government
resources; increasing recognition is given to the employment potential of the



-4-
informal sector and the Government is sponsoring a variety of programs
designed to promote the development of small-scale industrial and commercial
enterprises.
11.       These new policy directions are, however, being implemented at some
cost. The development of new products, new sectors, and new regions yields
decreasing returns on investments. For example, agricultural diversification
is being extended to crc., with lower comparative advantage; forest reserves
may be depleted in ten to fifteen years unless costly reforestation programs
are started; the best opportunities for import substitution in industrial
development are becoming exhausted; heavy infrastructure and productive
investments in the potentially rich but sparsely populated Southwest yield
initially low returns; large programs to improve living conditions in the
North and other poor rural areas involve long gestation periods. Finally the
direct and indirect costs of foreign production factors are increasing.
12.       The financial burden of the expanded public investment program has
also increased despite the funding of a large proportion from the excep-
tionally large surpluses accumulated in 1976 and 1977 in the stabilization
fund (equivalent to about US$1.5 billion). Thus, the program still relies
on external credit for 40 percent of its funding, about 85 percent of which
comes from private banks and suppliers. This represents a large increase
from previous years. The overall terms and conditions of external public debt
are hardening, reflecting increased reliance on commercial credit, and the
grant element of public and private lending to the public sector declined from
29 percent in 1969 to 8 percent in 1976. The increased costs of development,
the larger scale of investment now being undertaken and envisaged for the
future and the heavy reliance on foreign commercial credit to fund a major
portion of investment, all point to the necessity of measures to ensure that
the limits of absorptive capacity are not exceeded and that repayment capacity
is not strained. The Government of the Ivory Coast is aware of the situation,
and following the large increase in foreign borrowing in 1977, the substantial
decrease in external borrowing reported in the first quarter of 1978 is an
encouraging sign of their response to it. Other recent measures include a
much stronger control by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement over the state
enterprises' borrowing and investment programs.
Prospects
13.       Provided the Government becomes more selective in determining in-
vestment priorities and limits external borrowing to prudent levels, the
medium- and long-term prospects of the Ivorian economy remain favorable and
an annual rate of growth of about 6 percent is a feasible objective for the
eighties.
14.       The economy has considerable potential for further development
of traditional export crops. Moreover, after large initial investments
have been made, output of new products and development of new regions will
start to yield substantial benefits, and can later be expanded at reasonable
economic cost. The Government is planning to review the system of protec-
tion and tax holidays which has encouraged some marginal import-substitution



industries, and there is scope for expansion of export-oriented processing
of local raw materials. Finally, many aspects of the country's policies
of income distribution (preference for the family-size farm, programs to
increase agricultural productivity in the poorer North, and the promotion of
the informal sector and of small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises)
are fully compatible with sustained economic growth.
15.       Despite the fact that exports are expected to perform well in re-
spect of volume, it is unlikely that the high prices for coffee and cocoa
will persist, and therefore export earnings will probably be considerably
less buoyant in the near future than in the past two years despite some
mitigating effects of diversification into export products such as rubber,
pineapples, and industrial products. Imports, however, have increased sub-
stantially and the large deficit on services will remain as long as the
country relies heavily on foreign factors of production with their increas-
ing costs. Thus, pressures on the balance of payments will remain. The
size and financing of the public investment program will be a key element
in determining the extent of these pressures.
16.       The authorities are therefore engaged in a review of new commitments
and indications are that the three-year public investment program 1979-1981
will be essentially limited to available public savings plus official develop-
ment assistance. The Government is also considering the possibility of
repurchasing part of the existing commercial debt. The aim is to carry out as
much as possible of high-priority plan targets while achieving an external
debt structure consistent with the medium-term balance of payments prospects
of the economy. By these means it should be possible to keep the debt service
ratio below 25 percent by the end of the decade, and maintain the country's
creditworthiness for borrowing on IBRD terms.
17.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1976,
18 percent was provided bilaterally by governments, 20 percent by interna-
tional organizations (of which 68 percent by the Bank Group), and 36 percent
by private banks and bond issues, while 23 percent came in the form of sup-
pliers' credits. More than half of the total capital not supplied by inter-
national organizations came from four countries; France (27 percent), USA
(20 percent), Italy (5 percent), and Germany (4 percent). France and the
European Communities remain the principal source of development assistance
in grant form, accounting for about 6 percent of the flow of foreign assist-
ance to the public sector.,
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
18.       Since 1968, when Bank Group operations in the Ivory Coast started,
lending has expanded rapidly and now includes thirty-one loans totaling
US$408.7 million (including US$14 million from the Third Window) and an IDA
credit of US$7.5 million. Thirteen of these thirty-two operations have been
for agriculture, supporting cotton, cocoa, rubber, oil palm and coconut
development. There were six road projects. The remaining thirteen loans were
for education, telecommunications, the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system,
water supply, urban development, tourism development, small- and medium-scale



-6-
enterprises, a regional cement project and a regional railway project. IFC's
participation in the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel (US$204,000)
was increased in 1974 by a 50 percent stock dividend and in April 1978 by
another 10,000 shares of a total par value of about US$204,000. IFC's Board
also approved, in 1977, a 10 percent equity investment, equivalent to about
US$880,000, in Etablissement R. Gonfreville (ERG), the largest textile plant
in the country. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects, with particular reference to
those which are encountering problems in execution and giving rise to delays
in disbursements.
19.       The main thrust of the Bank's lending program will continue to be in
the agricultural sector but focussing much less on the traditional export
crops, where Bank involvement has helped create effective institutions. The
OED report on the first Oil Palm Project praised the project's achievements
but was critical of training of local staff. Although SODEPALM still employs
a large number of expatriate staff, it has now an efficiently run training
program aiming at the progressive Ivorianization of its staff. A second
rubber project in the Southwest has been approved by the Executive Directors
in May 1978. The Government has recently decided to shift emphasis from
plantation to smallholder production, where the benefits will more readily be
felt by the small farmers. This policy reorientation is reflected in our
strategy for the agricultural sector which, in the future, will support
smallholder and integrated rural development projects. The first examples of
this new strategy are another rubber project mainly benefitting small farmers
and a rural development project in the Northeast currently under preparation.
20.       The Bank was closely associated, as executing agency, with the 1969
UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast, which has served as a basis for
determining future priorities among transport investments. Thus far the Bank
has financed six road projects totaling US$123.3 million. The First Project
was completed in December 1974 with final costs within appraisal estimates.
The OED report dated June 28, 1977 on this project recommended, inter alia,
that more emphasis should be given to road maintenance. This had been picked
up in the third highway project. A follow-up project for road maintenance
with a feeder roads component was approved last December. The second road
project was satisfactorily completed in September 1975, after an initial delay
caused by project modification and subsequent poor work organization for the
construction component. The Third and Fourth Highway Projects incurred sub-
stantial cost overruns which the Government is covering; otherwise execution
is proceeding satisfactorily. The Fifth Highway Project approved by FY76
will contribute to a further improvement of the primary road network of the
country. We are also studying the possibility of extending a highway sector
loan to the Ivory Coast. A railway project, focusing on the improvement of a
priority section of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line, renewal of rolling
stock, technical assistance and training, was approved last fall. While the
Bank is expected to continue to play a major role in the transport sector,
financing will increasingly be shared with other aid donors.
21.       The education system of the Ivory Coast has not provided the country
with an adequate supply of skilled manpower. The Bank is closely associated



-7-
with the Government's efforts to modernize the education system, in particular
at the secondary and vocational levels. Both of the Bank's ongoing projects
have been directed to this end. A third project is currently being prepared.
22.       The Abidjan sewerage and drainage project approved in 1975 will
cover the first phase of a ten-year Government program to improve sanita-
tion in Abidjan. The propiosed project would help finance the second phase
of the program and studies for the third phase. In September 1977 the Board
approved a secondary centers water supply project. An urban development
project, primarily aiming to help meet some of Abidjan's low-income housing
and transport needs, was signed in December 1976.
23.       In view of the predominance of foreign ownership and management
in the private sector of the Ivorian economy, the Government is placing
high priority on strengthening local entrepreneurship. In support of this
policy the Bank extended a loan for the promotion of small-scale enterprises.
A follow-up project is under preparation. The Bank Group also provided support
for medium-scale enterprises through a local development finance company. In
June 1976 the Bank extended a loan to the Ivory Coast in support of the CIMAO
project, which is sponsored jointly by the Governments of Ghana, Ivory Coast,
and Togo. CIMAO will utilize limestone deposits in Togo for the production
of clinker for the cement market of the three countries.
24.       The Bank Group's lending in the Ivory Coast has increased steadily
from a yearly average of 'below US$20 million during the early years to an
average of US$47 million annually in the 1973-77 period. The average annual
lending rate is expected to continue to grow substantially over the next few
years.  The Bank Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt at the end
of 1976 stood at approximately 13.8 percent (including undisbursed). Its
portion of external debt disbursed is expected to rise from the present 7.5
percent to about 11 percent in the next ten years; its share of total debt
service, at present 4.9 percent, is expected to go up to about 7.0 percent in
the early 1980's.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
Water Resources
25.       Ivory Coast has two rainy seasons in the South and one in the North.
The rainfall is heaviest along the coast (an average of more than 2,000 mm in
Abidjan) where it rains every month. Rainfall decreases further inland (about
1,500 mm in Yamoussoukro) and a dry season of several months in the North
produces water shortages. Ground water in large quantities is found only in
the coastal zone, from Sassandra to the border with Ghana. Four major rivers
running north-south constitute the principal surface water resources. Cur-
rently Abidjan is supplied entirely from ground water, while other centers
derive about 80 percent of their requirements from surface water.



Service Levels
26.       Existing service in the water supply and sanitation sector, albeit
requiring further extensions, is better than in other West African countries.
Piped water facilities are available to 50 percent of the population of
Abidjan and to 15 percent of the population in the interior. The remainder
is served by standpipes and wells.   Sewerage and drainage facilities are
available only in Abidjan, where about 35 percent of the population is being
served.
Investment Programs
27.       As a result of the rapid urban growth of Abidjan, and to help reduce
disparities in living conditions in various parts of the counry, the Govern-
ment decided in 1973 to tackle two priority areas: water supply service in
the interior and sewerage and drainage services in Abidjan. A water supply
development program is now underway. The 1977-1980 tranche is estimated to
cost about US$235 million and the Bank is contributing US$16 million under
Loan 1484-IVC. Piped water supply to the interior is to be extended by 1985
to 25 percent of the population and the number of village wells is to be
increased from currently about 1,100 to 10,300. Sewerage and drainage devel-
opment priorities in Abidjan have been studied in 1974/75 by consultants
financed by UNDP. A 10 year development program was established to eliminate
serious health hazards, flood damage and severe pollution in the lagoons
around Abidjan. A first phase of this 10 year program is presently under
execution with financing from two Bank loans (US$7.8 million under Loan
1076-IVC and US$7.0 million under Loan 1347-IVC). The first Abidjan Sewer-
age and Drainage Project has suffered initial delays, mainly due to slow
procurement decisions, but is now progressing satisfactorily. Project com-
pletion is expected in the fall of 1978. The second phase of the 10 year
sewerage and drainage program forms the basis of the proposed project and is
to be carried out from 1978 to 1981.
Sector Organization
28.       The Ministry of Public Works has been responsible for the sewerage
and drainage subsector since 1968 and after a Government reorganization in
July 1977 took over from the Ministry of Plan responsibility for the water
supply subsector. Execution of the investment programs in the two subsectors
is, however, carried out by separate organizations. The water supply sub-
sector program is executed by a Department within the Ministry of Public
Works. SETU, a Government-owned corporation, handles sewerage and drainage.
Each subsector has its own fund handling all aspects of the sub-sector's
finances: FNH for water supply and FNA for sewerage and drainage. Water and
sewerage revenues are derived from a water tariff uniformly levied throughout
the country. Drainage revenues are derived from a property tax. Apart from
internal cash generation, loans finance most of the investment requirements
of the two subsectors. SODECI, a private company, is responsible under
contract to the Ministry of Public Works, for the operation of the water
supply systems, as well as for the sewerage and drainage system for Abidjan
under contract to SETU.



-9-
Staffing and Training
29.       Both the water supply and sewerage & drainage subsector are heavily
dependent upon expatriate management and technical manpower. Due to the
shortage of Ivorian civil engineers, the Ministry of Public Works has tradi-
tionally relied upon expatriate technical consultants to reinforce its tech-
nical capability. SETU's top management is Ivorian but its technical staff is
largely expatriate. SETU's staff relies on in-service training. The manpower
study included in this project would help to determine further manpower devel-
opment needs for the sector. An Ivorian national has recently become SODECI's
director general. More than half of the company's mid-level management and
technical staff is already Ivorian and SODECI is making further progress
Ivorianizing its staff. SODECI has its own training center which it currently
proposes to expand.
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade
30.       The United Nations have designated the period 1980-1990 as the
International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade. All developing countries
have been asked by the U.N. Water Conference in 1977 to prepare by 1980
detailed investment plans, including identification of necessary financial and
manpower resources to provide all people with access to safe drinking water,
and to the extent possible with sanitation, by 1990. The investment plans and
financial and human resources needed would be reviewed in 1980 by a special
meeting of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and
a plan prepared to mobilize these resources.
31.       Even prior to the UN action, the Government, in order to assess the
remaining needs of the Ivory Coast, had commissioned a water supply master
plan for Abidjan and a study of sewerage and drainage requirements in other
cities of the country. In addition, under the proposed project sewerage and
drainage investment studies for 1981-1990 and feasibility studies for Abidjan
for 1982-1985 would be carried out. The studies underway will enable the
Ivory Coast to present a full assessment of its needs to the ECOSOC conference.
Bank Role
32.       Bank activities in the water supply and sewerage and drainage sub-
sectors are designed to help the Government strengthen the institutional base
and identify the priorities for investment, as well as to promote more ade-
quate sector policies. T'he combined investments currently under consideration
for the water supply and sewerage subsectors are estimated to be about US$300
million until 1981. Careful financial planning will therefore be necessary.
The Bank's water supply project will assist the Government in its planning and
financing activities in the sewerage and water supply subsectors, through a
tariff and sector study.
33.       While the Bank's contribution to the water supply subsector rep-
resents only about 7 percent of the subsector's total investments, it con-
tributes about 50 percent: to sewerage and drainage investments. Continued
Bank assistance for the sewerage and drainage subsectors is vital to further



- 10 -
improve sanitary conditions, reduce the risk of flood damage and control the
pollution in Abidjan's lagoons. Bank assistance would also help consolidate
the newly created sector institutions (SETU, FNA and FNH) and help train local
personnel.
PART IV- THE PROJECT
34.       The feasibility studies for the proposed project were financed with
proceeds from the first Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Loan. The project was
appraised in June 1977, with a short follow-up mission in November 1977.
Loan negotiations took place in Washington from April 18 to 21, 1978. The
Ivorian delegation was led by Mr. Gbozia, Director of FNA, Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement. The project is described in detail in the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 1874-IVC dated May 4, 1978, and summarized at the beginning of
this report.
35.       The project would comprise about a four year slice of the 10 year
development program. It would be carried out from 1978 to 1981 and consist
of supplying and laying of a trunk sewer (5 km), primary sewers (14.7 km) and
drains (4.3 km), sewer and drainage networks (42.9 km), construction and
equipment of a pumping station on the Treichville trunk sewer; construction
of drainage canals in the Banco area (5.2 km), road surfacing and about 500
man-months of consulting services at an average cost of US$7,800 per man-
month. The road surfacing works are necessary to insure the stability of
part of the drainage works. The consulting services are for detailed design,
procurement, construction supervision, further feasibility studies for phase
III and a new 10 year program, studies of property taxation, manpower and
training requirements of the water and sewerage and drainage subsectors, and
computerization of the Government's property tax collection system.
Project Objectives
36.       The primary objectives of the project are to improve sanitary
conditions, improve system operations and maintenance and strengthen
further sector institutions and staff. These objectives will be monitored
through selected technical, environmental, organizational and financial
standards.
Implementation
37.       As under the first phase project the Sewerage and Drainage Depart-
ment of SETU would be responsible for implementing the project, including the
road component. Project implementation would be governed by a Project Agree-
ment between SETU and the Bank, execution of which would be a condition
of effectiveness (Section 6.01 (a) of Loan Agreement). The project's final
design started in February 1978. Construction supervision and administra-
tion would be carried out by the staff of SETU's sewerage and drainage depart-
ment that would be strengthened through recruitment of qualified expatriate
engineers. Training of local staff would be on the job by the expatriates and
through short apprenticeships and courses abroad. The manpower and training



- 11 -
needs of the water and sewerage and drainage subsectors would be studied by
June 1979. The Ministry of Finance would be responsible for executing the
property tax study and for the computerization of the property tax collection
system.
Cost Estimates
38.       Project costs niet of taxes are estimated at US$53.1 million of which
the foreign exchange component would represent US$33 million. Taxes, mostly
value added tax, would amount to about US$11.7 million. The proposed Bank
loan would cover the foreign exchange component (51 percent of total project
cost or 62 percent of net of tax cost). The balance would be provided from
local sources as explained in paras. 43 and 44 below. The major portion of
the Bank loan would be onlent to FNA under a subsidiary loan agreement satis-
factory to the Bank (Section 3.04 of Loan Agreement). Execution of the
subsidiary Loan Agreement would be a condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01
(b) of Loan Agreement). Cost estimates are based on preliminary design and on
unit costs of similar work under construction. Base costs (project cost table
on page (ii) of Project Summary) are estimated at early 1978 price levels and
include taxes, but not import duties, since the sewerage and drainage subsector
is exempt from import duties. Yearly price escalation would be 12 percent
for the civil works and 8 percent for equipment throughout the project period.
Disbursements
39.       Loan proceeds would be disbursed to reflect the estimated foreign
exchange component of the project as follows:
Amount Million US$
(i)  60% of the total cost for locally
manufactured and procured pipes                         6.2
(ii)  100% of the CIF cost of all direct
imports or 70% of the total cost of
locally procured imported equipment                     1.3
(iii)  45% of the total cost for pipe laying                  13.2
(iv)  50% of the total cost for civil works                   4.0
(v)  50% of the total cost of road construction              1.3
(vi) 60% of the total cost of consulting
services, technical assistance for
a)  SETU                                            2.6
b)  Government                                      0.3
(vii)  100% of the foreign expenditure for training            0.1
(viii)  Unallocated                                             4.0
Total                                     33.0



- 12 -
Disbursements are expected to start in the third quarter of FY1979 and be
completed in the second quarter of FY1983. The closing date would be June 30,
1983.
Retroactive Financing and Prior Contracting
40.       To achieve a timely start of the final design, advance contracting
for consultants' services (about US$2 million) was required, of which ex-
penditures of about US$500,000 would accrue until signing of the Loan. Thus
retroactive financing in an amount not to exceed US$500,000 from February 1,
1978 on is proposed.
Procurement Arrangements
41.       All construction and supply contracts would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Local companies, most of which are fully or partially owned by foreign firms,
are expected to furnish most, if not all, of the concrete gravity flow pipes
as well as the plastic pipes for the project. Electro-mechanical equipment
and pipes and equipment for pressure lines are not manufactured locally and
would be procured from abroad. The connection program would be executed par-
tially by the contractors who win the bids for laying the sewer pipes as
well as by small local contractors for the individual connections in areas
with existing systems.
Past Finances
42.       Since 1974 investments in both the sewerage and drainage subsectors
have been financed through revenues and Bank loans (1076 and 1347). The first
of these two loans stipulated that net revenues should cover at least 50
percent 1/ of the investment cost. This requirement has been met overall in
both subsectors for the period 1975-77 (60 percent for sewerage and 70 for
drainage). Revenues are below forecasts in sewerage and about equal to
forecasts for drainage, but capital investments and the main operating cost,
systems maintenance, lagged in both subsectors. A feature of both subsectors
during this period was the high level of receivables (equal to 8 and 6 months
of revenues respectively) due mainly to delays in transferring collected
drainage taxes from the Government treasury to FNA and sewerage taxes from
SODECI to FNA.
Future Finances
43.       Sewerage Subsector.  For the proposed project period, 1978-81, total
investment would be US$37.9 million. This would be financed as follows:
1/ Later lowered to 40 percent effective January, 1977, under Loan 1347-IVC.

100
Internal cash generation hwas been calculated on the basis that there will be
annual adjustments in the sewerage component of the water tariff equivalent
to about 10 percent in real terms. The first such increase would occur as
of January 1, 1979 (Section 4.04 of Loan Agreement). Later increases would
be geared to meet the cash generation requirements (Section 4.07 of Loan
Agreement). Exemption from the Value Added Tax (VAT) is a longstanding aim
of SETU designed to bring the sewerage and drainage subsectors into line with
that of water supply. However, should the Government finally decide not to
grant the VAT exemption, iLt would assure equivalent budgetary contributions
for the purposes of the project (Section 4.11 of Loan Agreement). The source
of the local borrowings has not yet been identified, but a 10 percent rate of
interest over 12 years (including four years of grace) has been assumed, based
on recent similar borrowings for the water supply sector. The local borrow-
ings would be on terms an(d conditions satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.01
(d) of Loan Agreement).
44.       Drainage Subsector.  Investments in the drainage subsector for the
period 1978-81 would totaL US$32.6 to be furnished as follows:
Amount
(US$ millions)      Percentage
Net internal cash generation                   4.8                15
VAT exemption/budgetary contribution           6.1                19
Existing Bank loans                             1.0                3
Proposed Bank loan                             15.4 1/            47
Proposed local loans                           5.3                16
100
The level of cash generation is based upon a doubling of the drainage tax in
1979 (i.e. an increase from 5 percent to 10 percent of the property's rental
value) (Section 4.05 of Loan Agreement). No further tariff adjustments are
assumed for the project period. The VAT covenant (Section 4.11 of Loan
Agreement) would apply equally to drainage as would the terms and conditions
of local borrowings (Section 3.01 (d) of Loan Agreement).
45.       The most important feature of the financing requirements would be
the revenue covenant (Section 4.07 of the Loan Agreement). This would require
1/   Does not include US$1.7 million for the road component (paras. 35 and
37).



- 14 -
that the average cumulative internal cash generation for both subsectors
applied yearly from 1978 onwards, should be equivalent to at least 15 percent
of combined investment requirements or 20 percent, if the VAT exemption is
granted. The existing revenue covenant for the sewerage and drainage sub-
sector (Ln. 1347-IVC - Urban Development Project) requires the subsector
to contribute 40 percent of investment requirements after covering current
expenditures and debt service. During negotiations it was agreed that the
existing form of revenue covenant would be retained for the proposed project.
But in view of the almost four fold increase in investments, the cash con-
tribution requirement would be reduced to 15 percent or 20 percent, as the
case may be. The previous and present revenue covenants have necessarily
been related to project execution periods. As the sector is relatively new,
the magnitude and timing of investments beyond 1981 as well as the result of
the proposed tariff studies would determine the pattern of future financing.
Nevertheless, the Government agreed for the period after 1981 that the sector
would continue to contribute a reasonable proportion of investment require-
ments as shall be acceptable to the Bank and that it would propose to the Bank
by June 30, 1981, following the sewerage study, appropriate tariff levels
(Section 4.08 of Loan Agreement).
46.       In 1977 sewerage revenues and assets stood at US$2.6 and 18.1 mil-
lion equivalent respectively.  Revenue growth during the 1978-1981 period is
expected at about 30 percent and is based on an 8 percent annual water con-
sumption growth and tariff increases of 10 percent in real terms and normal
inflation adjustments. Operating ratios are expected to remain in the 50 to
70 and debt service coverages should remain satisfactory. Drainage revenue
and assets in service in 1977 stood at US$1.7 and US$29.8 million respec-
tively. With the drainage tax increase effective in 1979, the future finances
of the sewerage and drainage subsector appear reasonable until the early
eighties. To maintain this position a further tariff increase in the drainage
tax would be required by 1983. Operating ratios are expected to remain in the
70 to 90 percent range and debt service in the 1.6 to 3.0:1 range. The level
of receivables would be substantially reduced by requiring that payments to
FNA by the treasury should be made quarterly on the basis of an estimate of
the previous quarter'srevenue from the drainage tax component (Section 4.14
of Loan Agreement).
Cost Recovery
47.       During 1978-1985 financial projections indicate that revenues in the
sewerage subsector would yield a rate of return on average revalued assets in
service varying between 5 and 8 percent. This level of cost recovery is satis-
factory. For the drainage subsector, rates of return vary between I and 4
percent. This lower level of cost recovery is explained by the low collection
rate of drainage taxes and should improve when measures are implemented to
reform the property tax assessment and collection system.
Tariff Aspects
48.       The proposed sewerage tax increases will cause the overall water
price to increase by less than 5 percent p.a. in real terms during the



- 15 -
1979-1981 period. With this minor impact and the fact that 90 to 95 percent of
Abidjan's population is already able to satisfy minimum needs, no significant
social repercussion on consumers' ability to pay is expected.
49.       In the Ivory Coast the sewerage surcharge being included in the water
tariff, the consumer perceives only the direct relationship between water con-
sumption and the total water bill. Under these circumstances an economically
efficient price for water should be equal to the combined marginal cost of
supply and disposal. The proposed water tariff is slightly higher than this
combined marginal costs. This price level is justified to support the Govern-
ment's reasonable policy of cross-subsidizing water supply systems in the
interior from water sector revenues collected in Abidjan.
50.       The billing and collection mechanisms of the drainage tax and prop-
erty taxes need to be reviewed and knowledge of the level of effort, equity
and allocative effects of the property tax system is inadequate. A property
tax study has been a condition of loan 1076-IVC. Although a study was carried
out, it proved to be too general. Therefore, a new study would be financed by
the loan. Terms of reference were agreed upon during negotiations. The
consultants contract for the study would be signed by March 31, 1979 (Section
3.02 of Loan Agreement). On the basis of the recommendations of the Property
Tax Study, the Government would prepare a Plan of Action which it would
discuss with the Bank by December 31, 1980 (Section 3.07 of Loan Agreement).
Economic and Social Justification
51.       Few of the relevant benefits of the sewerage program can be quan-
tified. The major benefit relates to the improvement in health through
avoidance of contact with contaminated water. The sewerage works will also
prevent permanent damage to the environment and help protect the aesthetic and
recreational qualities of Abidjan's lagoons. The benefits of the drainage
works relate to the reduction of damage due to flooding, giving an economic
rate of return of about 6 percent at a cost of about US$22.3 million in 1976
prices (about 50 percent of total project costs). In 1976 alone the damage
from flooding for all of Abidjan has been estimated at US$6.5 million.
Property losses aside, the drainage works are expected to reduce malaria
incidence due to the elimination of breeding grounds for mosquitoes and are
expected to allow increasing housing density in central areas of Abidjan, thus
helping reduce transport costs.
52.       All proposed project works are to be carried out in areas of the
city where most of the population is in the lowest 50 percent income group.
However, the sewerage component of the project is unlikely to serve the lowest
25 percent income group directly because of the cost of interior plumbing and
sewer connections.  On the other hand, 3subsidized water connections and a sub-
sidized water tariff for the first 5 m /month per connection can be afforded
by all but the lowest 5 percent income group. The volume of water consumed by
this income group is not generally high enough to require a sewer connection
and pit latrines can continue to be used to provide adequate sanitation. This
group would benefit directly from improvements in general sanitation by
drainage that will reduce the spread of contaminated water.



- 16 -
Project Risks
53.       The project does not present any unusual technical or institutional
risks. Project costs and timing of the proposed investments are based on
recent experiences under Loans 1076 and 1347. The risk of over-investment in
the Treichville trunk sewer is low, because the optimum size of the first
stage pipe is relatively insensitive to likely variations in the growth rate
above the existing flow.
54.       A risk factor is that the benefits of sewerage serving existing
areas will not accrue to the population as rapidly as foreseen (75 percent of
the Abidjan population to be served by 1985). The burden of the cost of con-
nection, interior plumbing and the cost for associated additional water con-
sumption may dampen the consumer's ability and willingness to connect. The
establishment of a social connection charge for which a study will be financed
under the proposed loan, will reduce this burden. Additional measures such as
credit for connections and interior plumbing would also be studied under this
project. Whether the 75 percent target can be achieved depends also heavily
on SETU's land development activities. The risk of over-investment in local
sewerage facilities is low, however, because the installation of secondary and
tertiary sewers is closely tied to the rate of land development which varies
according to demand. All the project works are in areas for which there is
existing demand.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory Coast
and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
56.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. The execution of the Project Agreement and the subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and FNA would be conditions of effectiveness
of the loan (paras. 37 and 38 respectively).
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Ln. No. 686           Cocoa Project:  US$7.5 million Loan of June 5, 1970;
Effectiveness Date: November 27, 1970; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978.
The project originally consisted of the planting of 18,800 ha of cocoa and the
rehabilitation of about 38,000 ha of existing cocoa plantations. The loan
became effective in November 1970. The project was amended in April 1973
(R73-74) to reduce the rehabilitation component to 15,500 ha; this revised
program has been completed. Approximately 10,000 ha had been established
under the new planting program by the end of 1973 and about 6,000 ha in 1974.
The project had proceeded satisfactorily except for administrative problems
which have delayed the submission of requests for reimbursement. However,
the administration of this; and the second cocoa project (Loan 1069-IVC) were
combined and an estimated 3,200 ha of cocoa were planted under the second
project. Savings of US$2.2 million resulting from the amendment and the merg-
ing of the two projects were cancelled at the date of signing of the second
project. Disbursements for the reduced program have now been completed
and an additional balance of US$0.5 million remains undisbursed; ongoing
exchange of views with Government may lead to its cancellation.
Ln. No. 761           Second Highway Project:  US$20.5 million Loan of June 22,
1971; Effectiveness Date: January 31. 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Execution of the project was satisfactorily completed in September 1975. The
funds remaining under the loan are being used to finance the supplementary
urban studies for Abidjan, initiated under the Third Highway Project.
Ln. No. 837           Third Highway Project:  US$17.5 million Loan of June 23,
1972; Effectiveness Date: May 4, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
The maintenance and betterment programs are progressing satisfactorily. Con-
struction work for the pavement strengthening program started in March 1975;
contract amount is about 120 percent over appraisal estimates due to inflation
and modification of design standards. The Government has agreed to finance
all overruns. Construction of the bridge and the urban development study for
Abidjan have been satisfactorily completed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.



- 24-                   ANNEX II
Ln. No. 938           Rubber Plantation Project:  US$8.4 million Loan of
October 23, 1973; Effectiveness Date: April 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Due to slow progress in the planting program and as a result of higher-than-
expected inflation, funds under this project will only cover plantation of
about 7,000 ha which is not expected to be completed before 1979 (the total
foreseen at appraisal was 13,500 ha).  Co-lenders met in January 1976 to de-
cide on the continuation of the planting program. The Bank has agreed to
amend the Loan Agreement to reflect the reduced planting (Memorandum to the
Executive Directors R-76-240 of September 29, 1976). In September 1977 the
Government has announced the dissolution of SOCATCI, the Borrower under this
loan, one of a number of measures presently being taken to restructure the
agriculture sector. The Government has given assurances that it intends to
complete the project as amended in September 1976 and has decided to take
over the responsibilities as Borrower under this project. A Substitution
Loan Agreement was approved in March 1978 (Ref. R78-38).
Ln. No. 981           Telecommunications Project:  US$25.0 million Loan of
May 3, 1974; Effectiveness Date: January 31, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project has experienced a two-year slippage due mainly to management and
organizational changes and delays in appointing engineering consultants.
After the Government awarded the contract for switching equipment to other
than the lowest evaluated bidder, the amount earmarked under the loan to
finance the equipment (US$7.6 million, including contingencies) was can-
celled as of March 31, 1977 (R77-128). The result of ICB for the remaining
part of the project has been satisfactory and most of the contracts have
been awarded. A 50 percent tariff increase for telecommunication services,
effective January 1, 1978, is expected to generate the cash necessary for
the Postal and Telecommunication Office to carry out its expanded investment
program.
Ln. No. 1069           Second Cocoa Project:  US$20.0 million Loan of January 10,
1975; Effectiveness Date: September 30, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
More than 50 percent of the total planting foreseen for the five-year project
period was completed in 1976. Block plantings have been lagging behind due to
difficulties in infrastructure development.  Disbursements are currently two
years behind project execution due to problems in establishing a system to
provide the necessary documentation and format for withdrawal applications.
A recent agreement with the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement to have withdrawal
applications prepared by the executing agency should speed up the process.
Ln. No. 1076          Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project:  US$9.0 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Effectiveness Date: January 19,
1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Although construction works have already started, project execution is ex ected
to be delayed by about one year due to delays in procurement decisions.   ork



- 25-                   ANNEX II
is now progressing satisfactorily. Project costs are expected to be close to
appraisal estimates. The Abidjan sewerage and drainage sector's financial
situation is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 1077          Cotton Areas Rural Development Project:  US$31.0 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Effectiveness Date: June 4,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Physical progress of the piroject under CIDT is in line with appraisal estimates
and overall performance of' CIDT is satisfactory. As a result of overestimated
increase in demand for food crops, marketing of the crops has caused problems.
Although the village water supply and feeder road program was originally
delayed,.appropriate measures have now been taken to implement both programs.
Disbursements are currently two years behind project execution due to problems
in establishing a system to provide the necessary documentation and format for
withdrawal applications. A recent agreement with the Caisse Autonome d'Amor-
tissement to have withdrawal applications prepared by the executing agency
should speed up the process.
Ln. No. 1124          TourLsm Development Project:  US$9.7 million Loan of
June 11, 1975; Effectiveness Date: January 19, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1981.
Project execution is progressing satisfactorily. The line of credit is
expected to be fully committed by the middle of this year.
Ln. No. 1125          Second Education Project:  US$5.0 million Loan of June 11,
1975; Effectiveness Date: September 9, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
Good progress is being made in provision of technical assistance. The studies
of regional training needs, legislation for vocational training and management
of educational TV are under way; plans are well advanced for the preparation
of an inventory of secondary school facilities. The design of project insti-
tutions is some twelve months behind schedule, but is now proceeding satisfac-
torily.
Ln. No. 1161          Fifth Highway Project:  US$43 million Loan of September 5,
1975; Effectiveness Date: November 4, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
Construction of the Anyama-Agboville road and the pavement strengthening pro-
gram started at the beginning of 1976 and is progressing satisfactorily. Con-
sultants have started the engineering studies provided for under the project.
UNDP was originally to finance the updating of the transport survey but cannot
do so due to lack of funds. The Government has agreed to amend the Loan Agree-
ment to include financing of the survey in this loan.

Ln. No. 1162          Small-Scale Enterprises Project:  US$5.6 million Loan of
September 5, 1975; Effectiveness Date: February 2, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Initial commitments by Credit de la Cote d'Ivoire, the project's financial
intermediary, have been slow. However, the line of credit is expected to be
about 80 percent committed by this fall.
Ln. No. 1177          BIDI DFC Project:  US$8.0 million Loan of December 12,
1975: Effectiveness Date: September 10, 1976: Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
Three sub-projects have been approved; others are being prepared.
Ln. No. 1297          CIMAO Prolect:  US$3.5 million Loan of June 28. 1976 ;
Effectiveness Date: April 19, 1978: Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The first regional industrial venture in West Africa, co-financed by seven
other official aid agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily. Financing arrange-
ments are on schedule. Procurement is proceeding according to plan: the most
important contract - for raw mills and kilns - has been awarded.
Ln. No. 1347          Urban Development Project:  US$44.0 million.  Loans
and 1348-T            (US$30.0 million and US$14.0 million on Bank and Third
Window terms respectively) of December 15, 1976;
Effectiveness Date: March 9, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31. 1980.
Effectiveness was delayed until March 9, 1978 as the Government did not
provide the proper legal opinion in time. Although many of the project
components, such as sewerage and highway construction works, studies and
technical assistance have already started with Government prefinancing,
overall project execution is about six months behind schedule.
Ln. No. 1382 1/       Fourth Oil Palm Project:  US$20 million Loan of March 30,
