LOAN FOR OIL AND GAS SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
Loan and Program Summary
Borrower:           India, Acting by its President.
Amount:             US$150 million equivalent.
Terms:              20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Description:        The proposed loan would complement the financing provided
under the Gas Flaring Reduction project (Ln. 3364-IN). It
would allow India to meet part of the external financing
needs caused by the increase in oil imports resulting
from the closure of oil wells with exceedingly high gas-
oil ratios (GOR) in the Bombay High oilfield.
Project Benefits:   The proposed loan would (i) support the Government's
measures to attract private sector companies to
participate in the accelerated development of India's oil
and gas reserves; (ii) provide support to ONGC's ongoing
efforts to improve the management of the reservoirs of
India's largest oilfield, the Bombay High; these efforts
will result in an increase of oil output in future years;
Proiect Risks:      General slippages in the implementation of the
Government's emerging overall stabilization and reforms
would pose major risks for the specific policy and
program changes in the oil and gas sector supported by
this loan. In addition, the implementation of the
program changes is subject to the implementation risks
set out in the Gas Flaring Reduction project. The
intensity and quality of the ongoing policy dialogue with
both Bank and Fund and the urgency and size of the
Government's resource needs provide significant
safeguards against policy slippages.
Disbursements       The proceeds of the loan would be available for
disbursement in one tranche upon credit effectiveness.
Staff Appraisal     This is a combined Staff Appraisal and President's
Report.             Report.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA FOR OIL AND GAS SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Loan
to India for Oil and Gas Sector Development for the amount of US$150 million
equivalent to complement the financing provided for the Gas Flaring Reduction
Project (Ln. 3364-IN), which was approved by the Executive Directors on June
*          25, 1991. The proposed loan amount would finance part of the increase of oil
import requirements caused by the loss of oil production in the Bombay High
oilfield as a result of ONGC's decision to close oil wells exceeding an
acceptable level of associated gas output. This operation was originally
conceived as an integral part of the Gas Flaring Reduction Project. However,
India's caretaker government was not in a position to undertake the policy and
program changes needed to promote private sector participation in oil
exploration and development, in particular the announcement of an invitation
to international oil companies to explore for oil and gas in India ("Fourth
Round") and approval of a request by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC)
to enter into joint ventures in order to accelerate the development of its
existing oilfields. Moreover, the macroeconomic framework essential for
dealing with the difficult balance of payments position of the country was not
in place. However, since the formation of the new government several major
initial stabilization and structural measures have been put in place in
advance of the presentation of the budget on July 24, 1991, which will set
forth in detail the Government's macroeconomic framework and outline further
structural changes. These developments have made it now possible to proceed
with this loan to complement the assistance provided under the Gas Flaring
Reduction Project. The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate with a maturity of 20 years including five years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Background and Recent Economic Performance
2.        Since Independence in 1947, India's governments havc faced the
daunting task of forging a large population, sharply divided along ethnic,
linguistic, and religious lines, into a modern, federated nation state.
Driven by the need to build consensus in a highly diverse society, economic
policies have been dominated by goals of interpersonal and interregional
equity. The strategy for achieving these goals assigned a major role to the
state, which either made or served as arbiter of virtually all economic
decisions, and took substantial, sometimes exclusive, ownership positions in
several sectors of the economy.
3.        This strategy resulted in slow but steady progress toward many of
India's development objectives. Growth performance, however, was modest in
relation to India's relatively high saving and investment rates. Its
manufacturing sector and exports, both large at Independence relative to other



- 2 -
developing countries, stagnated. Population growth rates remained high, and
indicators of the health and educational status of India's population, while
showing some progress, were still among the world's lowest. By 1977, thirty
years after Independence, more than 402 of the population remained in poverty.
4.        A consensus began to build in the late 1970s that India would have
to modernize and increase the efficiency of its economy if it were ever to
improve materially the standard of living of its poor. This was reflected in
gradual changes of its development strategy ia three important dimensions.
First, and foremost, greater emphasis was given to growth as the primary
motive force for poverty alleviation. To this end, the Government took a
variety of policy initiatives to stimulate aggregate supply and demand. On
the demand side, macroeconomic policy became more expansionary, financed by
increased domestic and external borrowing. New financial instruments were
developed to stimulate financial saving and facilitate public sector
borrowing. On the supply side, significant initiatives were launched to
improve infrastructure performance, and the scope for private initiative was
gradually increased. Constraints on industrial investment, expansion, and
diversification were partially relaxed. While the trade regime retained its
overall bias toward import substitution, an increasingly active export
promotion effort and (since the mid 1980s) flexible exchange rate policy were
utilized to reduce the bias against industrial exports.  Second, an effort was
made to increase investment in human capital formation with the launching of
national programs aimed at expanding services in health and education. Third,
direct poverty interventions, based on credit and subsidies for self
employment and publicly financed work schemes for the rural unemployed were
initiated.
S.        Recent Economic Developments.  Viewed in terms of India's
historical growth, export, and poverty alleviation performance, the shift in
economic policies served India well in the 1980s. GDP growth averaged 5.6?
(up from 3.5? in previous decades) and, despite only modest success in
reducing population growth, per capita income growth was three times its
historical average. Growth rates increased across the board, but growth in
industry, and more narrowly in manufacturing, was particularly strong.
Productivity growth, stagnant from the mid 19608 to the mid 1970s, averaged
2.9?. In real terms, exports have grown at rates in excess of 10? p.a. since
1986/87. The incidence of poverty continued to trend downward, declining from
over 402 of the population in 1977 to less than 30? at the end of the 1980s.
Finally, although still low in relation to the rest of the low income
developing world, there seemed to be some modest acceleration in the rate of
improvement of social indicators. The foregoing successes notwithstanding,
India's expansionary fiscal policies have also created unsustainable
macroeconomic imbalances. Fiscal deficits have gradually risen from about 6t
of GDP in the early 1980s to 9Z of GDP in the last three fiscal years. The
current account deficit worsened as a consequence, and India's external debt
increased from US$20.7 billion at the end of 1980/81 to US$71.5 billion at the
end of 1990/91 that is, from 1.4 years of exports to 2.8 years of exports.
The debt service ratio rose from less than 15? to about 28? over the same
period.



- 'i .
6.        The Gulf crisis accentuated India's macroeconomic imbalances.
World oil price hikes Increased India's oil import bill by about $1200 million
in 1990/91. Lost remittances ($290 million), debt repayments ($100 million),
and receipts from exports to the Gulf region ($100 million), in addition to
costs of repatriating Indian nationals working in Iraq and Kuwait ($250
million) cost India another $740 million. The current account deficit reached
an estimated $9.9 billion (3.5T of GDP), up from $8.4 billion (3.22 of GDP) in
1989190. At the end of 1990/91, foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $2.3
billion (equivalent to one month of imports). The Gulf crisis, combined with
political instability, led to a severe erosion of India's creditworthiness in
the international capital markets, a development which has compounded the
country's liquidity problems.
7.        In response to the Gulf crisis, the Government introduced a number
of stabilization measures.  A surcharge of about 25Z was imposed on domestic
petroleum product prices (on top of an 112 price increase in March 1990); this
surcharge has remained in place despite the fall in international oil prices.
In addition, selected taxes were increased and expenditure restraints
effected. These measures are estimated to have reduced the fiscal deficit by
about 1? of GDP in 1990191, in relation to what it would have been otherwise.
On the monetary front, interest rates were increased and liquidity
requirements tightened several times during the course of 1990/91 and a
partial liberalization of interest rates was introduced in September 1990. On
the external front, the Government sought to contain imports through an
accelerated depreciation of the rupee and a cash margin scheme for imports.
Under the scheme, banks were instructed to open letters of credit only against
cash deposits varying between 50S and 200S of the letter of credit amount
depending on the nature of the goods to be imported.
8.        These measures have had some success.  The fiscal deficit was
contained at about 9.0S of GDP in 1990/91 (the same as in 1989/90) in spite of
the pressures created by elections, the Gulf crisis, and the absence of a
government with a mandate to implement a major program of economic
adjustments. Broad money growth rate declined from 191 in 1989/90 to 162 in
1990/91. Annual inflation, after reaching almost 131 in the first months of
1991/92, fell to less than 11 in June.
9.        India availed itself of the Fund's Compensatory and Contingency
Financing Facility (CCFF) and a first tranche stand-by in January 1991. The
total drawings amounted to SDR 1.8 billion. Despite this inflow and
assistance from a number of bilateral donors, the country's foreign exchange
reserves have continued to decline and were about $1.1 billion at end June
1991.
Medium-Term Policies and Prospects
10.       Redressing macroeconomic imbalances and continuing the
liberalization and deregulation of the economy have been important priorities
for every government in recent years, but political difficulties have slowed
progress on both fronts. Despite three successive budgets calling for
reductions in the central government's deficit, fiscal imbalances have
worsened. Two governments have fallen since the general elections of November



- 4 -
1989, most recently in March 1991. The elections that followed were marred by
considerable violence, and could not be completed until June 1991. The
1991192 budget, covering the period April 1991 to March 1992, had to be
deferred until the completion of elections and is now scheduled to be
presented to Parliament on July 24, five months later than normal.
11.       India's future growth depends on a prompt resolution of the current
liquidity crisis and restoration of macroeconomic equilibrium. Stabilization
of the economy alone, while essential, will not, however, be sufficient for
dealing with the current economic crisis. Broad-based structural reforms to
improve the efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of the economy are
essential to achieving the export growth required to strengthen India's
creditworthiness and to support the future growth and development of the
economy.
12.       The new Government, which took office on June 21, 1991, clearly
recognizes both the immediate stabilization problem and the more fundamental
need for structural reform. It has already moved forcefully to initiate
policy measures on both fronts. The Rupee was devalued by 23Z (measured in
terms of the rupee cost of the US$) in the first week of July. Thus, since
December 1990 the nominal exchange rate has been depreciated by about 40? in
relation to the US Dollar and by about 30? in relation to the SDR. This
compares with an inflation rate which in the last six months has been hovering
around 121 p.s. Second, all regulated interest rates were increased by one
percentage point. while lending rates were raised by 1.5 percentage points;
this increase also applied to the Reserve Bank of India discount rate (from
10X). Thirdly, the Government has unified and increased to 30? (from 5-202)
the share of export proceeds that exporters may use for their own import
requirements or freely trade, while at the same time introducing significant
accompanying procedural simplifications. Finally, it eliminated export
subsidies discontinuing the Cash Compensatory Scheme. The latter was an
important sc%irce of pressure on the budget which, if not discontinued, would
have added about 0.5? of GDP to the budget deficit in 1991/92. The Government
has also reiterated that the forthcoming budget would introduce a major fiscal
adjustment, bringing the budget deficit down to 6.5? of GDP in 1991/92.
13.       As the early steps noted above indicate, the Government has
promptly embarked on devising and implementing a medium-term economic reform
program. The details of the rest of this program, particularly with respect
to fiscal adjustment, will be unveiled in the budget, and subsequently
developed with greater specificity on the structural dimensions. As set out
in the policy letter, the Government would continue to undertake further
structural reforms covering the areas of industrial de-regulation, foreign
investment, reforms of the financial and capital markets and more realistic
policy in respect of public sector undertaking." The underlying intent will
be to enhance the international competitiveness of the economy and to ensure
that India's growth momentum is protected and strengthened.
14.       The stabilization and structural measures being put in place should
result in a decline in the current account deficit from a record $9.9 billion
(3.5 of GDP) in 1990/91 to about $5.5 billion (2.3? of GDP) in 1991/92,
stemming from a substantial reduction in the trade deficit. Despite this



- 5 -
projected large reduction in the current account deficit, the overall balance
of payments position would remain tight in 1991/92 unless there is an early
resumption of access to private capital markets. India currently faces a
potential financing gap of about $3-4 billion in 1991192, which could only be
covered in the context of an adjustment program supported by concerted
additional assietance from official creditors.
Bank Group Operations
15.       The Bank's assistance program gives the highest priority to
supporting India's efforts aimed at restoring macroeconomic equilibrium,
accelerating structural reforms in the areas of industry, trade, finance and
public enterprises, and regaining access to private credit markets abroad.
These reforms are essential to improving the efficiency, productivity and
competitiveness of the economy, and to strengthen India's creditworthiness.
Contingent on the implementation of a comprehensive economic reform program,
the Bank will be prepared to assist India with policy-based lending,
particularly in the key areas noted above. Specifically, a structural
adjustment loan, a financial sector adjustment loan and an IDA credit, which
would be designed to support programs providing social safety nets in the
adjustment process, are under discussion with the Gover"nent.
16.       The Bank's overall assistance strategy aims to strengthen support
for efficiency-improving sectoral reforms and institutional development in
agriculture, infrastructure, human resources and poverty alleviation through
investment and sector lending operations. Agriculture, which provides the
livelihood of most of India's poor, accounts for 30? of GDP. In the medium-
term, agricultural growth will be essential for sustainable economic growth
and the reduction of poverty. The Bank will seek to support projects for
irrigation, rural roads, marketing, research and extension while encouraging
changes in policies and institutions that could increase productivity.
Lending for developing India's infrastructure will be directed towards
projects in: (i) energy to develop India's gas resources and to support
central power entities and those State Electricity Boards which, together with
their respective governments, are committed to reform; (ii) transport to
improve the efficiency of the existing network and finance needed additions;
and (iii) urban areas to provide needed infrastructure and improve the
management of urban areas. Lending for human resource development will focus
on improving the delivery of educational and health services, particularly to
*         the most vulnerable groups.  Nutritional programs for the poorest segments of
society and family planning will be emphasized. Poverty alleviation will be
an objective wherever applicable particularly in projects for the development
of agriculture and human resources, but the Bank will also seek to support the
Government's efforts to improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of social
safety nets.
Relations with the IMF and Donor Coordination
17.       The Bank and the IMF are making a carefully coordinated effort to
support India's stabilization and adjustment program. The Fund is currently
finalizing a further drawing of the CCFF, to be followed by a stand-by
program. Negotiations for the stand-by are expected to begin after the
announcement of the budget.



-6-
18.       As noted earlier, India's external financing needs in the near and
medium term will require substantial official assistance. In this context,
the Bank will continue to play a key role as the Chairman of the Aid India
Consortium in mobilizing support from other official donors and creditors. In
support of a comprehensive stabilization and adjustment effort by India, the
Bank will seck quick disbursing cofinancing from bilateral donors to
supplement its own policy-based lending.
PART II - THE ENERGY SECTOR
India's Limited Energy Resources
19.       Considering the size of its economy and its rapidly growing
population, India is only modestly endowed with energy resources. Despite
allocating almost a third of its public investment resources to the
development of these resources, India depends heavily on oil imports to meet
its domestic energy needs. India's energy resource base is dominated by coal.
Total coal and lignite reserves are estimated at more than 170 billion tons.
Although these coal reserves are mostly of low quality, they are India's most
important commercial energy resource. India also has a sizeable potential for
the generation of hydro-electric energy, estimated at 100,000 MW, of which up
to now only about 13,000 MW have been developed. Environmental concerns, the
high cost of, and growing resistance to, the resettlement of a large number of
people, disputes about water rights and financial constraints have made hydro-
electric power projects increasingly unattractive. Thus, the power sector
prefers to invest in coal and gas-based thermal power ge-Qration. Compared to
coal, India's oil and gas reserves are small.  Proven an4 probable oil
reserves amount to about 840 million tons. At projected consumption levels
these reserves will last about two decades. Thus, unless exploration efforts
succeed in raising the level of reserves, India will need to meet its demand
for petroleum products lncreasingly through imports. Increased use of natural
gas may provide some respite in the medium term. Natural gas reserves, which
are estimated at 961 billion cubic meters (BCM), would permit India to reduce
imports of oil products. Up to now this effort has been hampered by
conflicting policies and insufficient financial resources. Finally, India
also has modest reserves of uranium, which would be sufficient to support a
nuclear power program of about 8000 megawatts (MW).
India's Emerging Oil Gap
20.       Oil production in India is in the hands of two public sector
companies, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd. (OIL).
Production has increased dramatically over the past 15 years to reach 30.4
million tons in 1990/91, primarily due to the discovery of the Bombay High and
its satellite fields in the early 1970s. As a result, India has been able to
reduce its dependence on imported oil from about 80S in the early 1970s to
less than 402 in the early 1980s. These fields now account for about 602 of
indigenous oil production. After increasing at a rate of about 202 a year
during the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, oil output from the
Bombay High fields reached a plateau in 1984/85. Delays in the implementation
of measures to maintain reservoir pressures (e.g. through water injection)



- 7 -
have led to a sharp increase in the output of associated gas. To avoid
permanent damage to the reserveirs ONGC has adopted a program under which oil
wells whose output of associated gas exceeds a certain level will be closed.
This will reduce oil production from the Bombay High oilfield by about 2.4
million tons a year.  To restore optimum oil production levels and thus reduce
the risk of a sharp increase of oil imports, ONGC will need to use capital-
intensive enhanced oil recovery technology as well as substantial investments
for the development of smaller satellite fields.
21.       A field-by-field review of oil reserves concluded that indigenous
oil production would reach a peak of 42 million tons in 1996/97, and then
gradually decline to about 38 million tons in 2000/01. These projections are
based on the assumption that ongoing exploration efforts will lead to no
significant discoveries. Crude oil imports would then increase to 24 million
tons (equivalent to US$4.1 billion) in 1996/97 and 36 million tons (equivalent
to US$7.9 billion) in 2000/01. To maintain the present level of self
sufficiency, indigenous oil production would have to reach 51 million tons in
1995/96 and 67 million tons in 2000/01. Such an increase would require
substantial additional investments in enhanced oil recovery, the accelerated
develoin'ent of undeveloped fields and a major increase in exploration
activities. The total cost of the implementation of these measures over the
next five years it estvmated at about US$10 Lllion of which about US$7
billion would be itn foreign exchange.
The Government's sroAram
22.        In order to keep the gap between indigenous oil production and
demand within manageable limits, the Government is designing a medium term
program for the oil and gas sector based on significant policy and program
changes. The main thrust of this program is directed at improving the
operational efficiency of the sectoral entities and market-based resource
mobilization. Critical first steps include improvement of the management of
the Bombay High reservoirs and opening the sector to foreign investment in
exploration and development.
23.       ONGC is relying increasingly on private sector companies for its
operations. ONGC uses not only the services of existing domestic private and
public sector companies, it also assists former emp3oyees in setting up
companies which then provide services to ONGC's operations. At present, there
are about 40 such privately owned companies, which provide charter hiring of
drilling rigs; helicopter, marine and diving services; operation and
maintenance of installations and vessels; soil investigation, surveys, well
logging and production testing. Orders to local privately-owned companies
have increased from US$71 million in 1980/81 to US$560 million in 1989/90.
24.       In the early 19809, the Government adopted a policy of inviting
international oil companies to explore for oil on a sole risk basis. Under
this arrangement oil companies commlted themselves to a program of exploration
work in certain geographical areas. They were under an obligation to finance
and carry out this program within a certain time frame, in exchange for a
share of their output if hydrocarbons were found.



25.       Up to now, there have been three "rounds of offerings of
exploration acreage". The first two rounds met only with limited success.
The industry felt that the terms of the production sharing contracts were r-ot
competitive and the blocks offered were not sufficiently prospective. In the
"First Round" (in 1980), the Government offered 15 onshore and 17 offshore
blocks.  Only four international ccapanies submitted bids for two blocks and
only one contract was signed. In the "Second Round" in 1982, the Government
offered eight onshore and 42 offshore blocks. No contracts were signed. For
the "Third Round" (in 1986/87), the Government improved the terms of the
contracts and offered more prospective areas. Of the 27 offshore blocks that
were offered, seven international oil companies submitted 12 bids. A "Fourth
Round" has been announced by the Government on July 10, 1991. While the
contractual terms are similar to those of the "Third Round', and are in line
with international practices, the Government has made a major effort to select
highly prospective areas. Despite the lack of success of the three previous
rounds, international oil companies appreciate that India is essentially still
underexplored, particularly in techlically difficult areas such as the Bay of
Cambay, Kutch and the possible western extension of Bombay High in deeper
waters on the continental shelf and slope. With the general improvement in
the environment for private investment which the Government has decided to
establish and the selection of highly prospective areas, the "Fourth Round"
should result in a substantial number of bids.
26.       As indicated above the production of the Bombay High reservoir has
reached a plateau in 1984/85. A preliminary report on the prospects of
India's oil production, car.ied o4t by the Bdnk, recommended that ONGC close
all oil wells with a GOR exceeding 400 vlv (on a volume for volume basis), in
order to minimize further damage to the reservoirs of the Bombay High
oilfield.  A report by the Bombay High Review Committee confirmed the basic
thrust of the Bank's findings.  On the basis of these recommendations ONGC has
adopted a program of shutting-in of wells with a high gas-oil ratio.  This
will result in a temporary reduction of ONGC's overall oil production by 3.9
million tons in 1991/92.  A similar drop in production is expected to occur
over the next three to four years. In the Bombay High oilfield alone the
decl4'e in production would amount to 2.4 million tons per year. This program
will, however, increase the total ultimately recoverable output from Bombay
High. At current market prices, this loss of production would amount to about
US$307 million.
27.       The Gas Flaring Reduction Project contains a component designed to
assist ONGC in its program to improve the management of the reservoirs of the
Bombay High oilfield. In addition to a study of the current status of the
reservoirs, this component would provide for the procurement of equipment and
services to improve reservoir pressure and enhance the quantity of oil that
can be ultimately recovered.
28.       In addition to the important program changes described above, the
Government has introduced the following policy changes:
(a) implementation of a new gas pricing policy, which links domestic
gas prices to fuel oil prices in international markets, thus making
it more attractive for private sector companies to explore in gas
prone areas and de-elop gas fields; and



- 9 -
(b) adoption of a policy which would permit ONGC and OIL to enter into
joint ventures with international oil companies for the development
of existing oil fields in order to accelerate indigenous oil
production.
PART III - THE PROPOSED LOAN
Rationale for the Proposed Loan
29.       The proposed loan is a quick disbursing operation to complement the
financing provided for the Gas Flaring investment operation approved by the
Board on June 25, 1991. It is aimed at supnorting the policy and program
changes the Government has undertaken, as explained above, in order to improve
the management of the Bombay High reservoirs and promote private foreign
investment. The policy context in which this loan has been formulated is
described in para 28 (Refer to Annexes 2 and 3 for the Policy Letters]. As
explained in the introduction, it could not be presented to the Board at the
same time as the investment operation because India's caretaker government was
not in a position to implement the required sectoral policy changes, in
particular the announcement of an invitation to international oil companies to
explore for oil and gas in India ("Fourth Round") and approval of a request by
ONGC to enter into joint ventures in order to accelerate the development of
its existing oilfields.
Loan Amount
30.       One of the objectives of the proposed loan is to assist the
Government in defraying the cost of additional oil imports due to production
shortfalls in the Bombay High oilfield. The shortfalls result from the
implementation of the shutting-in of oil wells as recommended by the Bank. A
loan of US$150 million is proposed, which would finance roughly SOZ of the
cost of additional oil imports required to compensate the shortfall in the oil
output from the Bombay High oilfield in 1991/92. The loan would be disbursed
upon loan effectiveness in a single tranche. The Gas Flaring Reduction
Project (Ln. 3364-IN), has been declared effective on July 12, 1991.
Disbursement, Procurement and Auditing
31.       The proposed loan would finance 1002 of the CIF cost in foreign
currency of crude oil and oil products imports. In view of the current
foreign exchange shortage and in order to cover expenditures incurred under
contracts awarded in a manner consistent with the guidelines, retroactive
financing would be provided in an amount of US$30 million for items contracted
after March 31, 1991, that is within four months of the expected date of loan
signing. The closing date for the loan would be June 30, 1992.
32.       Procurement will be car-.ed out in accordance with the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Contracts for purchases of crude oil and oil products
the cost of which is estimated at US$5 million equivalent or more will be
procured following ICB procedures acceptable to the Bank or through organized
international commodity markets. Contracts valued at less than US$5 million,



- 10 -
would be procured following Government procurement practices acceptable to the
Bank. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the collection of the
required documentation and for preparing and submitting withdrawal
applications under the proposed loan.   Crude oil and petroleum products
imported under existing contracts may be eligible for Bank financing provided
that the contracts have been awarded through procedures and under terms
acceptable to the Bank. For auditing purposes, a separate ac ount would be
kept by the Ministry of Finance for all expenditures made under the loan. The
account and statements of expenditure would be audited by independent uditors
and the audit report would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months
after the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.
Risks
33.       General slippage in the implementation of the Government's emerging
overall stabilization and reforms would pose major risks for the specific
policy and program changes in the oil and gas sector supported by this loan.
In addition, the implementation of the program changes is subject to the
implementation risks set out in the Gas Flaring Reduction project. The
intensity and quality of the ongoing policy dialogue with both Bank and Fund
and the urgency and size of the Government's resource needs provide
significant safeguards against policy slippages.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.

NEW DELHI
July   12 ,1991.
Dear  K%   (   4
I write to you in continuation of my letter of 1st July,
1991 and to thank you for your statement expressing confidence in
our policies designed to impart long-term dynamism to the Indian
Economic System. Over the past two weeks you may have noticed the
bold initiatives taken by Government for a more realistic
realignment of the exchange rate which will instil confidence in
our system, check the flight of capital, secure outstandiffg export
receipts and contribute to a sound management of the balance of
payments situation. You may have also seen the adoption of far-
reaching measures in the area of "Trade Policy Reforms" which
lend; greater transparency to our system by replacing a maze of
regulation through a system of "EXIM Scrips" leading to a more
open trade system.   We would continue   this process of policy
reforms in other sectors covering the area of industri&l
deregulation, foreign investment, reforms of the financial and
capital market and more realistic policy in respect of public
sector undertakings.
2.        It is in this context that we greatly value your aupport
by way of fast disbursing loans for various projects to meet out
immediate needs. My senior officials are making a more specific
request to the Bank in regard to a fast disbursing loan under ther,
Gas Flaring Project in the nature of an 'Oil Adjustment-Loan'>and I
hope that this request would be processed as quickly as-possible.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Qureshi,
We are grateful to the World Bank, and to you, for the understanding
5hown for enabling us to tide over the present transitional difficulties and to implement
policies designed to achieve stabilisation and structural adjustment.
2.          1 am sure, you would have noticed the far-reaching measures for stabilisa-
tion and growth which we have already initiated over the past few weeks covering
the field of trade policy reforms including a more realistic alignment of our currency
and other measures which will impart a long-term momentum to our export efforts.
We do hope that in the near future further structural reforms measures would encompass
other areas along with lines appended with this letter.
3.          During the transitional period,. we greatly value fast-disbursing loan
components frorm  the World Bank, which would mitigate our present difficulties.
In this context, a fast disbursing loan of US $ 150 million to compliment the assistance
provided under the Gas Flaring Reduction Project would assume special significance.
It would allow the oil industry to proceed with the implementation of its ongoing
programme to increase the ultimate recovery of oil from the Bombay High oilfield
by shutting-in oil wells whose gas output exceeds a certain maximum level. This
results in a temporary decline in oil production, which exacerbates current balance
of payments difficulties. As such, a fast disbursing loan in support of this prograni
would ensure their continued implementation.  In support of this program, we have
also decided that ONGC and Oil India will take steps to enter into joint ventures
with domestic and foreign private companies in order to accelerate the development
of our oilflclds; in addition, we are implementing a rnore rational ¢,as pricing policy,
and decided to invite the fourth round of bidding for exploration of oil and gas in
selected onshore and offshore areas.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,
