              Theexternal low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LICDSA) reveals that
             Afghanistan has a high risk of debt distress, underlining the needfor debt relief under the
             HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDH).',? Under the alternative
             scenario which assumesfull delivery of HIPC, MDRI, and beyond-HIPC debt relief at the
             completionpoint of the HIPC Initiative, debt burden indicatorsfall below the country-
             specific indicative thresholds. Thepublic debt LIC DSA suggests that Afghanistan's overall
             public sector debt dynamics will remain manageable, despite rapid increase in domestic
             borrowing toward the end of theprojection period. Further$scal consolidation (or more
             external grants) should be considered in order to stabilize the debt burden indicators.

                                                         A. INTRODUCTION

              1.       The external and publicdebt sustainabilityanalyses presentedhereare based on
             the commonstandardLIC DSAframework,with a modificationto the stress tests to
             addressthe volatilityof aid inflows."` The DSApresentsthe projectedpatho f

             ' These  DSAshavebeenproducedjointly by Bank andFundstaffs.
               Usually, the country-specific indicativethresholds for the LICDSA are determinedusing a three-year average
             o f the country's ratingunder the World Bank's Country Policy andInstitutionalAssessment(CPIA). However,
             the CPIA for Afghanistan is availableonly for 2006 and2007. Inbothyears, Afghanistanwas rateda weak
             performer.Accordingly,the thresholds for the LIC DSA are 30 percentfor the NPV of debt-to-GDPratio,
             '100 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, and 15 percent for the debt service-to-exportsratio.
               See "Debt Sustainability in Low-IncomeCountries: Proposalfor an Operational Frameworkand Policy
             Implications"(IDNSECM2004-0035,2/3/04) andhttp://www,imf.org/extemal/np/pdr/sustain/2OO4/020304.htm
             and "Debt Sustainability inLow-Income Countries:FurtherConsiderationson an OperationalFrameworkand Policy
             `Implications"(IDNSECM2004.0629,past      9/10/04 and http://www.imf,org/extemal/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091OO4.htm).
              The volatility of aid flows over the       five years makes ashock to non-debt creating flows basedon
             historicaldata difficult to interpret. Hence, we follow the approachinthe 2007 LIC DSA of assuming grant
                                                                                                                   (continued)

Afghanistan's externalandpublic sector debt burdenindicators, anddraws some conclusions
on the forward-lookingsustainability of debt. The baselinescenario assumescontinued
deliveryofHIPC interimdebt relief duringthe life of the PRGF arrangement(no irrevocable
debt reliefat completionpoint), while analternativescenario assumes the deliveryof debt
relief, includingMDRIandbeyond-HIPCdebt relief, at the HIPC completionpoint, which is
assumedto occur inmid-2009.

2.        Two key changesto the baselinescenarioexplainthe differencesbetween the
currentanalysis and the previousDSA includedin the HIPC decisionpoint: (i) aid
inflows are significantlyhigher (about sevenpercentagepoints of GDP higherinthe long-
term), reflectingthe upwardrevisionto the size of the donor-fundedexternalbudget; and(ii)
real GDP growthis projectedto average about one percentagepointmore inthe long-run
than at the time of the decisionpoint,reflectingthe higheraid flows andpublic investment
coupledwith the direct andindirecteffects o f the Aynak copper mine.

3.        Average annual realGDP growthis expectedto moderateover the projection
period, from 7.8 percentin 2008/09-2012/13 to the long-run averageof 6.1 percentin
2013/14-2030/31. This patternreflectsthe projecteddecrease inthe investment-to-GDPratio
from short-tomedium-termexceptionallevelsof around 30 percent,to astill high,yet
markedlylower,long-termlevel(around 17%percent).The latter is necessaryto sustainan
acceptablepaceof growthinper capitaconsumption.Continueddonor support for
reconstructionandpublic investment is likely to bethe maindriving factor duringthe earlier
years. The contributionof donor-ledinvestmenti s expectedto decline over the medium-term,
with privateinvestmentgaining inprominenceand eventuallyplayingthe leadrole. Inflation
i s projectedto easeover time from about 20.7percent in 2007/08 to 5 percent starting in
2012/13 andduringthe remainderof theprojectionperiod.Thenominalexchange rate i s
assumedto remainstable over theprojectionperiod,leadingto acontinued real exchange
rate appreciation.

4.        Continuedmacroeconomicstability is predicatedon sustained fiscal discipline,
with the government's overalldeficit (includinggrants) improvingfrom apeak of 3.0 percent
ofGDP in 2009-10 to about 1.2 percentof GDP bythe endof the projectionperiod.
Underlyingthis, revenues are assumedto increasegradually from 7 percent o f GDP in
2007108 to 11.6percentof GDP in 2028129, whileexpenditures(channeledthrough the
national budget) are expected to declineinthe short termbeforerising graduallytojust over
19percentof GDP with the mountingcosts of maintainingnew investments.

5.       The external position is expectedto remain manageable providedcontinued
donor support and increasing mining-related FDI over the medium-term.Over the long-
term, the current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to decrease gradually from
66.9percentofGDP in2007108 tojust under 9percent in2028/29, inline with an
improvement inthe trade balancerelativeto GDP as importsrelatingto post-war
reconstructiondecline andthe export sector, inparticular mining, rebounds.The negative
effects ofthe continuedreal exchange rate appreciationon exports andreal economic activity
are expected to be offset by continued productivitygains. External grants are expected to
remain the predominant form o f financing, but would declinerelative to GDP from
63.2 percent in2006107 to 6.9 percent in 2028/29.'

                             C. DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSES

External Debt Sustainability

6.       The baseline scenario indicates that Afghanistan has a high riskof debt distress
(Table 1andFigure 1). Although theNPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio remainswell below
the threshold(30 percent), the NPV o f external debt-to-exportsratioremainsabovethe
100percent threshold until 2010/11, reflecting Afghanistan's very narrow export base. As
exports are expectedto grow inUS$terms at 15 percent on averageover the projection
period, the NPV of externaldebt-to-exports ratio declines rapidly and is expectedto approach
20 percent towardthe endofthe projection period. The relatively comfortable debt service
ratios (to export andrevenue)reflect inpart thevery highdegree of concessionalityon the
outstandingstock of debt from multilaterals (mainly on IDA or IDA-like terms).

7.       The alternative scenariosand stress tests indicate that the evolution of
Afghanistan's external debt position is subject to considerable vulnerabilities (Table 2,
Figure 1). Most debt indicators deteriorate significantly under the boundtests (temporary
shocks) andinthe face of a permanent worsening in the terms ofnew borrowing. The debt
ratios also deteriorate significantlyunder the historical scenario, where the main
macroeconomic variables are kept at their historical averages over the projectionperiod.6
This reflectsmainlyaprojectedimprovementinthe current account excluding grants-
which i s not captured inthehistorical scenario-from higher export growth, higher
mining-related FDI, and aslow-down inimports related to post-war reconstruction.

8.       The bound tests and the alternative scenariosunderscore the vulnerability posed
by Afghanistan's heavy reliance on official transfers. Ifofficial transfers in2009/10-
2010/11 were 25 percent lower than inthe baseline, the NPV o f externaldebt-to-exports
would rise to 276 percentby 2010/11 andwould not fall below the threshold until2019120.

 Due to lack of data, five-year averages are usedrather than the standard ten-year averages.

                                                                                             Page 5 of II




                                               4


9.      The boundstests also demonstratethat an improvement inAfghanistan's
externaldebt indicators depends heavily on an expansion of its very narrow export
base.Ifexport growthduring2009/10 and2010/11 were to fall to alevel one standard
deviation below the historical average, the NPV o f externaldebt-to-exportswould rise to
184percent in2010/11andwould not fall below the 100percent thresholduntil2015116.

10.     Debt relief under the HIPC and MultilateralDebtReliefInitiatives (MDRI) is
expected to significantlyimproveAfghanistan's debt situation.Assumingthe full
delivery of HIPC andMDRIassistance at completionpoint, all three debt-burdenindicators
(NPV o fdebt-to-GDPratio, NPV o fdebt-to-exports ratio, anddebt service-to-exportsratio)
would fall significantly below the indicative thresholds.

PublicSector DebtSustainability

11.     Under the baselinescenario, Afghanistan's public debt (includingdomestic debt)
is expectedto decline moderately relativeto GDP until 2014/15, increasingthereafter
(Table 3 andFigure 2). Inthe short term, the government is expectedto draw down its
significant deposits at Da AfghanistanBank (the centralbank) which, together with generous
grant financing, explainsthe initialdeclineinthe public debt ratios.However, the availability
of externalgrants (channeledthroughthe national budget) is expectedto decline as ashare o f
GDP over the projection period, from ahighof around9.5 percent of GDP in2008109 to
about 6.2 percent in2028129.

12.     The medium- to longer-termdecline in externalgrant financing is expected to
be offset by a combination ofincreasedrevenueand domestic borrowing.By 2028129,
the domestic debt is projectedto reach 11.3 percent of GDP from azero basein2008109,
under the expectationof agradual development ofthe domestic debt market.While the level
ofpublic debt over the projectionperiodwill not endangerfiscal sustainability, the average
long-runprimary deficit, at 1.1percent of GDP, would be above the level that stabilizesthe
debt to GDP ratio.

13.     Debt dynamics remain manageableunderthe various stress tests, but
nonethelessvulnerableto a reductionin foreign grants. (Table 4 andFigure 2). The
most extreme stress test (scenario that produces the largest deteriorationinadebt burden
indicators after 10years) is linkedto a 10percent ofGDP shock indebt creatingflows. The
above scenario could be interpretedas anegativeshock to foreign grants, which confirms the
vulnerability posedbythe heavyrelianceon official transfers that is seen inthe external
DSA.The no reformscenario (no improvement inthe primary balance) also produces
significant deterioration inall debt burdenindicators, which highlights the needfor
adherence to the medium-term fiscal framework.

                                                                                            Page 6 of II

14.     As in the external DSA, debt relief underthe HIPC and MultilateralDebtRelief
Initiatives(MDRI)is expected to significantly improve Afghanistan's public debt
situation.

                                    D. CONCLUSION


15.     The LICDSA reveals that Afghanistan continues to face a high riskof debt
distress. The baselinepath of the NPV o f external debt-to-exportsremains above the LIC
DSAthreshold(100 percent) until2012/13, while the sensitivity analysis indicatesthat
Afghanistan's externaldebt sustainability is heavily dependant on the continued availability
of official grant financing supplementedby highly concessionalloans. The emergingrole of
domestic debt financing over the longerterm does not posean immediate risk to the debt
outlook, but it does underscorethe need for acautious approachto fiscal policy as the
government builds the domestic revenuebase, and giventhe uncertainties about the pace at
which donor expenditures would bebrought on budget,While the level ofpublic debt
remains manageableover the projection period, the government will need additional grant
financing and/or fiscal consolidation to containthe debt dynamics beyond that horizon.

ProgramDevelopment        The grant of SDR 23.5 million (US$35 million equivalent) supports the
Objective(s) and          implementationof the Government of Afghanistan s (GOA) medium-term
Contributionto Interim   development strategy within the context of a satisfactory macroeconomic
StrategyNote (ISN)       framework. The purpose of the DPG is to secure sound macroeconomic
                          managementand fiduciary standards for all resources channeledthroughthe
                          Afghan core budget including funds from the World Bank and the
                         Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF).          The Strengthening
                          Institutions Development Policy Grant (DPG) will have the following core
                          development objectives: (i)improve fiscal policy and planning, and public
                          financial management, (ii)strengthenpublic administration reformand sub-
                          nationaladministration, and(iii)increase transparencyand accountabilityin
                         the managementofpublic finances.

                         The proposed development policy operation will primarily support the ISN
                          strategic area of developing the capacity of the state, in particular the
                          financial management capacity, including interventions that counter or
                         prevent corruption. The operation is aiming at complementing other
                          investment and technical assistance operations in the areas of public
                          financial managementandpublic administration.

                             InvestigationUnit and the Information Technology Audit section.

Risks andRiskMitigation  The grant has significant risks; these include country-specific risks
                         (political, security, related macroeconomic management, and capacity
                         risks), vulnerabilities to external shocks (donor aid, debt distress, global
                         economic and financial trends), and project-specific risks (fiduciary and
                         implementation). Deterioration in security constitutes the largest source of
                         risk. It would adversely impact every single area of public life in
                         Afghanistan,    including     donor    engagement    and      macroeconomic
                         management.       Presidential elections are set for August 2009 and
                         Parliamentary elections for 2010, which may lead to major political
                         changes. Capacity remains weak and could weaken the link between
                         reforms supported by the DPG and envisioned reform achievements. The
                         mitigation of these risks, which affect the whole IDA program, is outside o f
                         the scope of the proposedoperation. The design of the proposedDPG as a
                         stand-alone operation, disbursed only after all prior actions are fulfilled,
                         provides the International Development Association (IDA) with assurance
                         that the main reform steps are implemented in this environment of
                         heightenedrisks.

                         Vulnerabilities to external shocks for Afghanistan are significant due to the
                         heavy reliance on donor assistance, the high level of debt distress and large
                         import-dependency for basic supplies and goods.      In particular wavering
                         donor support would delay the implementation of the reform program.
                         While the scope of the operationto mitigate these risks i s limited, the DPG
                         can mitigate some risks, by contributing to macroeconomic stability
                         (through fiscal sustainability), supportingthe GOA to build core institutions
                         of the state and to strengthensub-nationalfunctions of the government, and
                         contributing to maintaining a focus on key reforms. Also, the Bank's
                         support is provided on grant terms in response to the country's risk of high
                         debt distress.

                         Fiduciary and implementation risks include weakened ownership and
                         capacity to implement the reform program, and vulnerabilities to
                         corruption. The proposedDPG mitigates these risks with prior actions that
                         focus on areas for which the government, under the leadership of the MOF,
                         has clearly expressed ownership and has already built a good track record
                         of reforms. The DPG, together with other IDA projects, directly supports
                         the government's fiduciary systems and the government's efforts to
                         strengthen its implementation capacity through investments and technical
                         assistance. Measuresto reduce vulnerabilities to corruption with the goal of
                         increased transparency and accountability in the management of public
                         finances constitute amain theme ofthe proposedDPG.

                                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Afghanistan (GOA) followed an ambitious reform strategy guided by the
2006 Interim Afghanistan Development Strategy (I-ANDs) and the Afghanistan Compact over recent
years. The Compact constituted a framework for Afghan development and cooperation between the
GOA and the international community following the completion o f the 2001 Bonn Agreement. It set
specific and practicable goals and benchmarks in security, governance, economic and social
development, and counter-narcotics to evaluate performance over the five-year period 2006-11. In
April 2008 the GOA promulgated it's medium-term development plan, the Afghanistan National
Development Strategy (ANDs) -A                             Strategy for Security, Governance, Economic Growth and
Poverty Reduction', which i s also its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.                                               Arrangements for the
oversight and management o f the ANDs implementation are at an early stage and still gathering pace.

2.      The government's reform program reflected in the I-ANDs and Compact was supported by a
previous series o f World Bank development policy operations -the                                              Programmatic Support for
Institution Building (PSIB) 1-111.The PSIB series focused on supporting reforms inthe areas o f public
administration and fiscal management, with the objective to build an accountable and effective state.
Over the period o f World Bank development policy operations the reform implementation has been
satisfactory overall, although uneven at times. In many areas PSIB supported reforms were successful,
warranting the continuation o f development policy operations. Progress has been achieved in a
number of reform areas, for example macroeconomic management and public financial management,
while implementation has been somewhat slower in others, for example public administrationreforms
and private and financial sector reforms.

3.         The proposed Strengthening Institutions Development Policy Grant (DPG) supports the
implementation o f the GOA'Smedium-term development strategy within the context o f a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. The DPG will be a stand-alone operation in response to an increased
level o f uncertainty in Afghanistan that could impact the Government's commitment to a multi-year
reform program. Presidential elections are planned for August 2009, to be followed by Parliamentary
elections in 2010. The DPG will follow broadly the core development objectives o f the PSIB series:
(i)improvefiscal policy and planning, andpublic financialmanagement, and (ii)strengthenpublic
administration reform, including sub-national administration. The DPG will continue supporting these
two objectives, while adding a third one: (iii)increase transparency and accountability in the
management o f public finances. This objective contributes to the Government's efforts to address
weak governance and corruption. The purpose o f the DPG i s to secure sound macroeconomic
management and fiduciary standards for all resources channeled through the Afghan core budget
including funds from the World Bank and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF).




1The PRSP and the Joint StaffAdvisoryNote (JSAN) Islamic Republic of Afghanistan:Joint StaffAdvisory Note of the Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper,

preparedby the staffs of the InternationalDevelopmentAssociation (IDA) and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMT),May 15, 2008 (Report No. 43431-AF) were
discussedby the IMT BoardonJune 2,2008 and by the IDA Boardon June 3,2008.



                                                                            3

4.       The grant will provide SDR 23.5 million (US$35 million equivalent) in development policy
support to provide vital finance resources as the government tries to meet its development goals.
Currently the government has limited discretionary fiscal resources to react to potential external and
other shocks, e.g. the impact o f the global economic crisis as well as the deterioratingcountry security
situation. Due to weaker than expected revenue performance, spending for the 2009/10 (Solar Year,
SY 1388) budget had to be tightened and non-security expenditures are planned to increase less than
real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Treasury's cash balance i s depleted and it will continue to
adhere to very tight cash management.

5.       There are a number o f risks which may affect the implementation o f the government's reform
program. Key challenges remain the volatile security situation, partly attributable to the large illicit
narcotics industry, and the government's weak institutional capacity and associated limited absorption
capacity. Nevertheless, the GOA is committed to implementing the reform agenda supported by the
DPG. While these reforms are difficult under the best o f circumstances, the reform environment in
Afghanistan continues to be particularly complex and high level political attention is being
increasingly absorbed with the security situation and the upcoming elections. Therefore expectations
and the specific reform program supported by this operation are calibrated to fit this context.

6.     The country assistance strategy in which this DPG is anchored is outlined in the Interim
Strategy Notefor the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Period FY09-FYII (Report No. 47939-
AF), and jointly discussed at the Board in June 2009. The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) anticipates
continued provision o f single-tranche development policy grants. The DPG is aiming at providing

                                   11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT



7.     Afghanistan continues to face simultaneous challenges of forming a peaceful society,
reconstructing vital infrastructure while creating economic growth and reducing poverty.
Developing functioning and accountable state institutions that are able to deliver security, stability
and social and economic services demanded by citizens are imperative to achieving these objectives.
The social, economic, and political environment in Afghanistan remains complex. It i s severely
affected by the ongoing violent Taliban insurgency and the heavy entrenchment o f narcotics
production and trade, as well as the challenges o f weak governance and lack o f rule o f law.

8.     The security situation is worsening as the confrontationwith the Taliban enters its eighth
year. While large-scale armed clashes in the field have become less frequent a higher number o f
recorded asymmetric or terror-style attacks have spread across a widening geographic area. Violence
and intimidation o f all kinds have increased against the civilian population, especially those perceived
to be in support o f the government, international military forces as well as the humanitarian and
development community. The Government has attempted to find a non-military resolution o f the
conflict; however offers to hold peace talks have consistently been rejected by the Taliban. At the
same time, the Afghan National Army (ANA) force has been increased throughout the last years to
about 80,000 in 2008. Since then a further increase in the size o f ANA to 134,000 troops has been
approved. About 50,000 international troops under the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF) and 18,000 troops under the United States-led Operation Enduring Freedom remain in
Afghanistan and will be supplemented by additional UnitedStates' commitments in 2009. In addition
to politically motivated violence, poppy cultivation, general crime and lawlessness have contributed
to the poor security climate which i s hampering progress in reconstructing the country and in
achieving better social and economic outcomes.

9.     Despite the ongoing insurgency, the political system has been relatively stable. The
Government under President Hamid Karzai, elected in the country's first free elections in 2004, i s
expected to complete its regular electoral term in 2009. However, the government has been unable to
project its authority to all provinces and districts. With Presidential elections coming up in August
2009 and legislative elections the year after that, the question o f the future leadership o f Afghanistan
is increasingly preoccupying political players. As political competition intensifies, implementation o f
the government's reform agenda may be hampered by the difficulty o f forming coalitions and
resolvingtensions among rival political forces, many o f which are currently represented inthe directly
elected lower house (Wolesi Jirga). Economic issues are o f key concern to the electorate, as is
corruption. There is increasing pressure on the administration to deliver demonstrable results,
especially in the priority areas o f economic growth and poverty reduction, governance reforms, and
security. However, these pressures might be counterbalanced by the need to accommodate powerful
vested interests and to distribute patronage and other forms o f largesse to politically strategic groups
which could have an adverse impact on reform efforts and the budget.

10.    By most accounts Afghanistan's governance is weakening, underminingstate building and
developmentefforts. Corruption is perceived as widespread. The country's ranking in Transparency
International's corruption perception index dropped continuously over recent years to the fifth-worst
in the world in 2008 (i.e. 176thout o f 180 countries). The police, justice system, municipalities, and
customs department are widely seen as the most corrupt institutions. Extortion and other crimes by the
police and drug-related corruption are major issues. In2004 Afghanistan signed the United Nations
Convention Against Corruption, UNCAC, but it is still awaiting ratification by Parliament.
Corruption constitutes a serious threat to Afghanistan's state-building and development agenda
undermining revenue collection and service delivery and, perhaps more importantly, eroding
government credibility and state legitimacy. Public pressure to tackle corruption is increasing.
Afghanistan's international partners have also voiced concerns about corruption risks and may
become more reluctant to provide funds through government budget channels despite progress in
improving the fiduciary environment. The government is demonstrating initial efforts in pursuing
anti-corruption measures. Following the promulgation of a Law on Anti-corruption in June 2008 it
established the Anti Corruption High Office, which is in the process o f starting an Asset Declaration
Process for public office holders.

11.    Afghanistan's economy has been devastated by years of conflict, but has grown at a rapid
rate since the collapse of the Taliban government in 2001. In 2007/08 non-opium GDP growth
was estimated at around 12.1 percent driven by agricultural production recovering from drought.
Below average rainfall in 2008/09 is once again negatively affecting agricultural growth. Industry
growth, in particular in construction, appeared to slow down compared to past years. Rising import
prices for food and fuel created inflationary pressure in the early months of 2008/09 but eased off
toward the end o f the fiscal year due to recently declining world prices. Cultivation o f poppies for
heroin and opium production i s Afghanistan's most important economic activity, accounting for over
90 percent o f world opium production and trade (Box 1). The United Nations OfJice on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC) reported for 2008 fragile progress in reducing the area o f poppy production and the
yield o f opium from these crops, reflecting limited counter-narcotic efforts and adverse weather and
price developments.2 However, 2.4 million people and 370,000 households remain directly involved
inpoppy cultivation with the livelihood of a large part ofthe population indirectly affected. There is a
strong link between opium cultivation and insecurity: 98 percent o f the total cultivation in 2008 was
confined to seven provinces inthe south and the west o f Afghanistan with security problems.

   Opium is the largest cash crop in Afghanistan. However, opium cultivation and estimated production decreased in
   2008, 19 percent and six percent respectively. Of the 34 provinces 18 were poppy-free in 2008 as compared to 13 in
   2007. Almost all of the total opium production took place in seven southern and south-western provinces where
   cultivation is concentrated and where the yield per hectare was relatively higher than the rest of the country. Strong
   leadershipof some governors reduced level of cultivation in 2008 and unfavorableweather conditions led to lower yields
   in the central and eastern regions. Eradication was ineffective in terms of results. The gross income for farmers who
   cultivated opium was estimated to be US$723 million in 2008, decreasing from 2007 when farm-gate income was
   estimated at US$1 billion. Opium prices fell in 2008 and the weighted average farm-gate price of fresh and dry opium
   at harvest time decreased by around 20 percent from in 2007, to US$70/kg and US$95/kg respectively. The farm-gate
   value of opium as a percent of GDP decreased in 2008 to 7 percentcomparedto 13 percent in 2007.

   Opium directly provides livelihood for about ten percent of the population. In 2008 the number of households
   involved in growing poppy was 366,000 or 2.3 million people. For these households the average yearly gross income
   from opium cultivation was US$1,997 or US$307 per capita, while Afghanistan's per capita income for 2008 was
   US$417.

12.    The poverty headcount rate in Afghanistan is 42 percent according to the national
household survey, the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, NRVA, of spring of 2007
(Table 1). The ANDs presented a detailed profile o f poverty based on quantitative data from the
NRVA 2005 survey combined with qualitative findings from a participatory poverty assessment. The
analysis covers most o f the basic determinants o f poverty and highlights the disparities between the
rural, urban, and nomadic populations, as well as across regions. Limited access to infrastructure and
basic services, poor education outcomes, and lack o f employment opportunities are identified as the
main determinants o f poverty, especially among the rural poor. The poverty profile also indicates that
there are large numbers o f vulnerable people close to the poverty line who are at risk o f falling into
poverty in the face o f shocks emanating from a variety o f sources (for example sickness, conflict,
drought, increase in food prices).                             Data limitations have yet precluded the measurement o f other
important indicators like infant mortality, and access to clean water and sanitation.

Overall trends


13.    Afghanistan's economic performance has been resilient with limited effect of external
shocks on macroeconomic stability. This was exhibited in moderate inflation, manageable fiscal
deficits, high reserves, and solid growth (Table 2). The inflation trend has been overall declining.
Afghanistan's exchange rate regime fits the definition o f a managed float and Da Afghanistan Bank
(DAB) sought to smooth short-term fluctuations in the nominal rate. However, the volatile security
situation fuelled by the resurgence o f the Taliban, intertwined with the persistence o f the opium
economy continues to remain a major obstacle to Afghanistan's economic development.

14.    Growth is subject to significant fluctuations

opium) increased to 16.2 percent from 11.2 percent in
2006107, reflecting in large part a rebound in
agriculture after drought in 2006/07. Growth in the
industry sector was affected by a decrease in food-
related manufacturing, following lower agricultural
production in previous years (Figure 1).             Expected
growth rates for 2008109 were recently revised down
to 2.3 percent due to the lower wheat harvest resulting
from poor springrains. Production and export growth
was dominated by primary agricultural products (e.g.
opium, nuts, dried fruits, wool and hides), traditional
products (e.g. hand-woven carpets) and marble and                       Note ExcludW taxes on fmports

16.        Afghanistan's external position is largely dependent on aid inflows, opium flows and
remittances. Inparticular illicit opium activities obscure a clear picture o f external balances (Figure
3), leading to a high share o f balance o f payments receipts and an overestimation o f the current
account deficit3 Imports largely consist o f duty-free imports by donors, besides goods for local
consumption (Table 2). Exports are dominated by transit trade and smuggling. Foreign Direct
Investments (FDI) are relatively small, but growing. Official transfers -grants that come to fund the
operating and development budget- remain very high and constitute more than 50 percent o f (non-
opium) GDP. Large official transfers, FDI and debt relief helped improve the import coverage of
gross international reserves from 7.7 months in 2005/06 to 12.7 months in 2007/08.

i s recently coming under pressure (Figure 4).                                         In
2007/08 revenue performance weakened -and declined
as a percentage o f GDP to 6.9 percent-- at a time when
there appeared growing expenditure demands on the
government's budget due to the volatile security
situation and the impacts o f the international food and
fuel price crisis. As a result operating expenditures
increased from Af50.7 billion (10.5 percent o f GDP) in
2007/08 to an estimated Af73.0 billion (12.2 percent o f
GDP) in 2008/09, depleting discretionary cash balances
at Treasury (Table 4).

19.       In international comparison Afghanistan
scores very low in revenue mobilization. But despite the recent weakening o f its revenue
performance, Afghanistan has made significant progress in advancing domestic revenue collection. It
increased the overall revenue to GDP ratio from an extremely low base o f 3.2 percent in 2002103 to
7.5 percent in 2006/07. This is a noteworthy achievement given that real GDP growth in this period
averaged double-digit numbers. Import duties represent more than a third of total domestic revenues
(Table 3).4 While in 2007/08 domestic tax collection has continued to increase, attributable to the
successful establishment o f a Large Taxpayer Office, custom duty has fallen short o f its target. The
shortfall in customs revenue was mainly due to inadequate evaluation, weak enforcement and
reportedly corruption on the collection side. Also, new tax measures planned for 2007/08 were
delayed as crucial amendments to the income tax law were awaiting Parliamentary approval. In
2009/10, revenues are projectedto recover to 7.3 percent.

20.    Afghanistan's public expenditures depend heavily on donor funding (Table 4). This is
partly reflected in the large external budget grants (i.e. outside o f the government's core budget,
executed and financed directly by donors).                        It was estimated that in 2007/08 the external budget
amounted to 52.0 percent o f GDP, o f which 25.9 percent comprised outlays on security. Besides
external donor funds, grants to fund the core budget are substantial. It is noteworthy that the
expansion in core development expenditures in recent years was mostly possible with donor support.
Donor funding comprises 4.8 percent o f GDP for the core operating budget, mainly through the ARTF
Recurrent Cost Window, and 6.3 percent o f GDP for core development spending through donor
projects.

21.    Fiscalsustainabilityis an important medium and long term objective of the government.
However, Afghanistan is confronted with a set o f daunting challenges: (i)a low revenue base, (ii)
post-conflict reconstruction needs, and (iii)the impact o f external assistance on budget balances. In
the long term it depends on a favorable debt dynamic and sustained concessional external financing.
In the medium-term the risk is high, because a large part o f the core recurrent budget (and the
recurrent component o f the external budget) i s financed by donors. The government's medium-term
fiscal planning i s following a sustainability framework that is not based on the traditional framework,
but is defined as covering recurrent expenditure with domestic revenue sources. A zero operating
balance (without grants) is serving as a suitable fiscal anchor (Figure 4). The further out in the future
the target date is the higher the risks that in light of decreasing donor support painful fiscal
adjustments have to be made (Para. 25).

22.    Institutional reforms have progressed to address fragile public finances. A number o f
reforms have focused on creating a legal framework and establishing fiscal authority as well as
strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) and revenue administration. This is reflected in
improvements for several indicators in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment between June 2005 and December 2007 (Annex 4).                                         For example, in 2007/08 the
government introduced program budgeting with the goal to consolidate the budget preparation process
and aligning expenditures with the priorities in the ANDS. The 2008/09 budget was for the first time
approved by the Parliament within the alloted time and before the start o f the new fiscal year.
Medium-term fiscal policy objectives are started to being formulated in the MTFF. The main
challenges remain inflated budget projections and low budget execution, linked to limited absorptive
capacity in line ministries. While in 2007/08 core development budget implementation reached 55
percent, the ratio decreased in 2008/09. Second, P F M capacity outside the Ministryo f Finance needs
to increase.       Third, there still remain concerns about comprehensiveness and transparency in
accounting and reporting (e.g. State-Owned Enterprises). Finally further improvements in internal
and external audit should be pursued. Despite the challenges in managing revenues and expenditures,
implemented structural policies have helpedto consolidate macroeconomic stability.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

23.    Growth (without opium) is expected to reach 9.0 percent in 2009/10, driven by the
recovery in agricultural production. Favorable weather conditions for agriculture and opium
production will remain most significant for growth. Given Afghanistan's limited trade and financial
linksthe global crisis is not expected to have a major impact. Inthe medium-term growth is projected
at around 8.0 percent (Table 5)'.                              While donor-funded public investment i s expected to remain
important for economic growth it is expected to drop as a percentage o f GDP. The medium-term
macroeconomic outlook assumes an improving security situation and that key obstacles to formal
private sector growth, like electricity shortage, will be gradually removed. Medium-term sources o f
growth besides agriculture are mining supported by FDI, and growth in trade and services. Inflation
in 2009/10 is expected to decline. Monetary policy will continue to contain inflationary pressures but
its effectiveness will be limited by the dollarization o f the economy and by the small number of
monetary instruments.

24.   In line with the deteriorating global outlook export projections have been lowered for
2009/10. The current account deficit is unlikely to decline in the medium-term and is expected to
worsen in 2009/10 due to the impact o f global conditions on foreign aid, remittances and export. In
the long-term it should gradually improve in step with an improving trade balance, under the
assumption o f declining donor-related imports, increased FDI, and delivery o f debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative. The export-base would need to be strengthened,
hand in hand with maintaining a liberal trade regime and addressing the major constraint to export
growth. The main constraint to external competiveness o f Afghanistan remains the highcost o f doing
business and institutional red-tape.

25.   For 2009/10 operating grants are projected to increase as well as revenues. The operating
budget deficit (before grants) is expected to moderate from 5.5 percent in 2007/08 to 4.7 percent in
2009/10. Because o f recent expenditure pressures the government's objective for progressingtowards
fiscal sustainability by covering operating spending with domestic revenue by 2012113 now looks
very unlikely to be achieved before 2014/15.                                      Core development expenditure will continue to be
mostly covered by donor grants and highly concessional lending.

26.   Afghanistan's risk of debt distress remainshigh. However, debt sustainability has improved
significantly as a result o f debt relief from its bilateral creditors and interim debt relief under the
HIPC initiative. The Paris Club creditors agreed in June 2006 to cancel the majority o f Afghanistan's
US$11 billion debt and at the HIPC decision point in July 2007 committed to 100 percent debt relief

                                                                                   12

once Afghanistan reaches its completion point under the HIPC initiative.                                  The authorities are
committed to implement the HIPC triggers in the remainder o f 2009. Although full delivery o f debt
relief under HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) would reduce Afghanistan's debt to
sustainable levels, the recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)6 (Annex 6) identifies as the main
risks for debt sustainability a slower-than-expected expansion o f Afghanistan's narrow export base
and lower-than-expected official transfers.

27.      For 2009/10 limited discretionary funds will.make Afghanistan vulnerable to external
shocks. Cash funds o f the MOF are drawn down and will make it difficult for the government to
address unexpected short-term fiscal demands. There are a number o f risk factors which may affect
the Afghan growth objectives for future years and the stability o f the overall macroeconomic
framework. First, growth will depend on favorable weather conditions for agriculture. Second, there
are two items that are likely to exert fiscal pressure: the implementation o f the Pay and Grading
(P&G) (including pension) reform, and the expansion of the security sector in light o f growing
political uncertainty.

28.      Overall the macroeconomic framework appears adequate given the country
circumstances. The authorities conducted prudent monetary and financial sector policies reflected in
a receding inflation rate and stable exchange rate. However, unexpected spending pressures emerging
through the increase in world-wide commodity prices and a faltering revenue performance due to
governance problems at customs interrupted a path toward fiscal consolidation. Nevertheless, the
2009/10 budget exhibits necessary expenditure restraint and the government is committed to
advancing revenue administration reforms. Following the successful implementation o f an IMF Staff
Monitored Program (SMP) starting in March 2004 the IMF initiated a Poverty Reduction Growth
Facility (PRGF) in June 2006, which beside structural reforms also focused on strengthening the
monetary policy framework and banking supervision. The authorities successfully completed the fifth
review under the IMF PRGF in April 2009 and extended the program to March 2010 to allow for the
implementation o f pendingreforms.

Afghanistan's National Development Strategy


29.      The GOA'S medium-term development plan is anchored in the ANDS.                                        The ANDs
covering the five-year period from 2008 to 2013 was approved by President Hamid Karzai and his
Cabinet on April 21 2008, and submitted to the IMF and World Bank as Afghanistan's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper. The ANDs followed on a series o f earlier government strategy documents,
including the National Development Framework o f April 2002, the Securing Afghanistan's Future
report o f January 2004, and the I-ANDs o f January 2006. The ANDS also builds on the commitments
made by Afghanistan in the context o f the 2006 Afghanistan Compact, which guided the cooperation
o f government and international community after the completion o fthe Bonn Agreement o f December
2001, and set benchmarks to evaluate performance over the five-year period 2006-2011. Afghanistan
has also endorsed the Millennium Development Goals.

30.      The ANDs was prepared over a two-year period and followed an extensive consultation
process. Consultations happened through a credible participatory process involving some 17,000


6 Afghanistan Joint Bank-FundDebt SustainabilityAnalysis (Report No. IDA/SecM2008-0563), September2008



                                                                          13

representatives o f government, civil society, the private sector, and general public at the national,
provincial, and local levels in all 34 provinces. The ANDs itself is a very comprehensive strategy,
which: (i)provides a development vision for the country; (ii)lays out national objectives for the three
ANDs pillars (Security; Governance, Rule o f Law and Human Rights; and Economic and Social
Development); (iii)   integrates six crosscutting issues (Counter-Narcotics, Anti-Corruption, Capacity
Development, Gender Equity, Environment, and Regional Cooperation); and (iv) discusses some 17
specific sectors and areas o f activity. The ANDs presents 12 sector strategies plus a strategy for
private sector development to achieve these goals.

31.    The total resource requirement to implement the ANDs was presented as US$50 billion
over five years. Donor assistance was planned to account for more than US$43 billion o f which so
far approximately US$20 billion has been pledged. While the ANDs document is very comprehensive
it lacks sufficient prioritization across sectors, appropriate sequencing, and the identifiedpriorities are
not clearly linked to poverty reduction goals. The Bank-Fund JSAN highlighted areas to strengthen
the ANDs including: (i)prioritizing sectoral programs based on a realistic resource envelope and
poverty impact; (ii)streamlining the number o f policy measures and establishing government
oversight institutions for implementation and Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E); (iii)increasing
domestic revenue to balance external resources; (iv) improving capacity development; and (v)
enhancing aid effectiveness.       Presently the lack o f clear priorities means that without further
refinements the ANDs does not provide enough strategic guidance to make the difficult tradeoffs in
line with the given resource constraints.

32.    The proposed DPG is supporting the ANDS, its underlying macroeconomic framework
and growth strategy. The ANDs draws a strong link between growth, poverty reduction and
employment creation, reflecting on the growth strategy as the backbone o f the ANDS. Key challenges
are connected with the question on how to best use foreign assistance for growth and development: (i)
the alignment o f financial resources with ANDs priorities, and (ii)the improvement o f absorptive
capacity reflected in better quantity and quality o f budget implementation. The ANDs renewed the
GOA'S commitment to prudent fiscal policy and public financial management, which will ensure
macroeconomic stability and the implementation o f the development strategy, making them key
ingredients for sustained growth. In support o f these key government instruments and functions the
authorities embarked on a series o f related reforms initiatives over the past years, largely within the
M O F and as part o f the MOF Strategic Plan 1384-1389. There were considerable achievements in
improving P F M and the overall budget process; and in establishing the legal framework for ensuring
appropriate fiduciary standards (Public Financial Expenditure Management, PFEM, Law and
Procurement Law). As described in the main text, the proposed DPG supports these elements o f the
government's reform program directly with its selected prior actions.



Rationalefor the Development Policy Operation


33.    Development policy support grants in Afghanistan have been successful in the past and
build on the excellent dialogue with successive government counterparts and the need to
consolidate medium-term reforms. The proposed DPG will allow the World Bank to stay engaged
in a policy dialogue during a critical time, reinforcing reforms in those areas with a proven track
record from previous development policy operations. In its original design the PSIB series was
expected to conclude with the consolidation o f PFM and public administration reforms during the
implementation o f PSIB 111. While implementation o f the reform program has been broadly on track,
its achievements remain fragile and subject to potential back-sliding. In some areas, like Public
Administration Reform (PAR), the implementation o f reforms is taking longer than expected. For
these reasons, the focus o f the DPG will be on sustaining ongoing reforms. The supported reform

                                                     14

program is ambitious given the current uncertain environment in Afghanistan, but is based on strong
commitment from the Afghan government.

34.    Continued development policy support by the World Bank will help the GOA to keep the
momentumof reform in an increasinglychallengingenvironment. The proposed DPG will track
a reform program in areas that are mainly within the scope o f responsibilities o f the MOF. The M O F
established itself in previous years as one o f the most progressive and efficient ministrieswithin the
new Afghan state. It achieved success in reinstating the government's revenue mobilization function
and introducing modern practices for managing public finances. It increasingly functioned as a driver
o f reform across government. For that reason MOF-centered reforms are seen as the focus o f this
development policy operation with the attention on protecting gains o f previous reforms and
deepening reforms in certain areas o f vital importance in the MOF.

35.    The DPG will support government reforms that consolidate achievements in public
financial management and public administration reform and support increased transparency
and accountability in the management of public finances. Given the need to provide continued
reform support through the government core budget and in absence o f a functioning ANDs
implementation mechanism, it i s proposed to support targeted reforms. The DPG will address the
increased financing needs o f the Afghan government during the current fiscal year. It will also have
an important role to play in facilitating policy reforms to support continued disbursements o f ARTF
resources. Through the ARTF, the development partners provide GOA with significant assistance             -
Af16 billion or 22 percent o f total operating expenditure in 2008/09- to the core operating budget. It is
critical to ensure that these substantial recurrent expenditures, along with all resources flowing
through the Afghan core budget, are spent within a stable macroeconomic context and a reasonably
strong fiduciary environment. Given that much o f the ARTF assistance is unconditional, the DPG
serves as an accompanying operation which can strengthen these standards to ensure effective use o f
the recurrent cost funds disbursed through the ARTF in support o f the Afghan budget. This could
help to ensure that more donors provide funds through government budget channels. It suggests that a
focused operation from the Bank to safeguard progress to date and to continue fiduciary reforms can
leverage greater donor funds, which are becoming increasingly uncertain in the deteriorating Afghan
environment.



             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINKTO ISN

36.    The I S N FY09-11is presented jointly to the IDA Board of Directors with this operation.
This new ISN follows the FY07-08 ISN, which guided IDA'Sengagement in Afghanistan over
previous years. The Bank Group's overall strategic thrust for the FY09-11 ISN period is to sustain
and accelerate the progress made in the areas o f state building and service delivery, while supporting
government and other stakeholders to reach consensus on coordinated approaches to addressing the
country's long term development challenges and opportunities.

37.    Bank Group interventionswill continue to operatewithin the framework of state building,
supported by the same three strategic pillars used in the FY07-OSISN. These are: (i)buildingthe
capacity o f the state and its accountability to its citizens to ensure the provision o f services that are
affordable, accessible and o f adequate quality; (ii)promoting growth o f the rural economy and
improving rural livelihoods; and (iii) supporting growth o f the formal private sector. Retaining these
pillars, and operating with continued flexibility and pragmatism within and across them, provides the
scope to consolidate and build upon the gains made so far, respond to opportunities for new


                                                    15

approaches where conditions are right, adjust to any changes in circumstances that may arise, and
support government leadership in key areas.

38.   This DPG supports primarily the I S N strategic area of developing the capacity of the
state, in particular the financial management capacity, includinginterventionsthat counter or
prevent corruption. Through its impact on budget management, fiduciary standards, and capacity
building, it also supports the entire IDA portfolio. Its design is in line with the overall mix o f
instruments (investment lending, analytical work, and administration o f the ARTF). The previous
series o f development policy operations (PSIB 1-111) established a good track-record for the
government to follow a reform program on institution building, with focus on the MOF. Inthe course
o f these operations the government also demonstrated strong commitment and ownership in many
areas of the reform program. The ISN anticipates continued provision o f single-tranche development
policy operations. Beyond FY09, the ISN will consider the potential for a new series o f DPGs as the
reform environment becomes clearer after the August 2009 Presidential elections.



COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

39.    GOA attached high priority to aid effectiveness, but this has not yet translated into major
progress in the way donors are doing business in Afghanistan. Difficulties in aid management
have been exacerbated by several factors. First, around 60 international donors are active in
Afghanistan, challenging coordination and often leading to fragmentation o f the aid efforts into a
multitude o f small, overlapping, projects. Second, two-thirds o f international assistance bypasses
government systems, undermininggovernment-led coordination and government's accountability for
results. Much o f this assistance i s delivered through large contracts with expatriate firms incurring
costly security overheads. Furthermore, donors are often unable to provide the government full
advance details o f their aid programs which further undermines the ability o f government to
coordinate assistance. Inaddition to the difficulties this poses for government leadership, it i s highly
distortionary in terms o f prioritization, and results in lack o f predictability and competition for scarce
resources.

40.    The Bank's role as the Administrator of the                 Box 2: Donor Coordination in Afghanistan
ARTF positions it as a key coordinating actor.
Although the United Nations Assistance Mission in            The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1868
                                                             (March 23, 2009) expanded the coordination role of

coordination in Afghanistan (Box 2), through the             June 2008 Paris Conference in Support of Afghanistan,
                                                             the UNAMA has been given a clear mandate to
ARTF and continued development policy operations             coordinate    donor     assistance.     UNAMA    has
the Bank                     the government's Policy         subsequently established three standing committees
                                                        Of   below the JCMB structure to support decision-making
using the budget as a vehicle for donor coordination         within the three pillars of the Compact and ANDS: (1)
and enhanced government leadership,          Indeed, the     Security, (2) Governance, Rule of Law and Human
                                                             Rights, and (3) Economic and Social Development. In
ARTF has developed into the primary multi-donor              addition, UNAMA is establishing task forces to focus

41.       The proposed DPG is expected to foster donor coordination as it supports stronger fiscal
management and administrative reforms, key elements to increase the share of external
assistance using the government's systems.                                       The proposed DPG supports a subset of the
government's overall reform program which is complementing: (i)the ARTF recurrent cost
framework and the newly introduced ARTF Incentive Program which will reward government
through additional discretionary allocation of ARTF resources for progress against annual
benchmarks, focusing on customs and revenues, public administration reform (in education),
transparency, and the enabling environment for the private sector; (ii)the IMF's PRGF which
continues to place considerable focus on promoting fiscal discipline in particular revenue
mobilization;and (iii)the budget support providedby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with the
Fiscal Management and Public Administration Reform Program on budget formulation, revenue and

42.       The new ARTF IncentiveProgramwas establishedinthe framework of the phasingout of
the ARTF Recurrent Cost (RC) window financing. Inview ofthe difficultiesto mobilizesupportto
the budget, GOA was offered by the ARTF donors an incentive program to shift resource from
supporting the development budget to the ARTF RC window, if there is concrete progress in the
government's reform agenda. The program will be started to be partially implemented in 2009/10,
following the Afghan fiscal year (US$40 million in SY1387, US$60 million in 1388, and US$70
million in 1389).             The funding will be allocated through two schemes: a structural benchmarks
scheme (accounting for three quarters of the available incentive funds) and the revenue matching
grant scheme (accounting for one quarter of the available incentive funds). Some structural
benchmarks for the first year of implementationof the incentive scheme overlap with IMF PRGF
conditionality.There is no overlap with prior actions for the DPG. Supportedthemes and benchmarks
are plannedto focus on key sectors, where member donors are active, includingeducationand private
sector development. The disbursement of the ARTF Incentive Program is following regular ARTF
RC window procedures, i.e. the reimbursement of ARTF eligible recurrent expenditure per
authorization ofthe independentARTF MonitoringAgent (MA)(Para. 66).


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

43.       Since 2002, IDA has committed a total of US$1.7 billion in grants (74 percent) and credits
(26 percent) in Afghanistan. Thirty-onedevelopment and emergency reconstructionprojects as well
as three development policy operations have been implemented to date. During FY07-08, IDA
delivered 10 new investmentoperations, three additionalfinancingoperations, and one US$80 million
development policy operation for a net commitment amount of US$562million. IDA'Scurrent active
portfolio comprises 24 investment projects with combined net commitment of US$1,02 1 million, of
which US$550 million (or 54 percent) hadbeen disbursed as of January 31, 2009. As Administrator
of the ARTF, the Bank also supervises implementation of the ARTF investment portfolio.There are
currently 20 active grants funded by the ARTF Investment Window with combined commitments of
US$921 million-- of which seven are co-financedby IDA.

44.       The DPG complements and supports other parts of the Afghanistan portfolio, including
investment projects and the ARTF administration. In particular the proposed DPG directly
coordinates with and underpinsthe support providedthrough several ongoinginvestmentprojectsthat
aim to improve the overallmanagement and transparency of public financial and human resourcesin

Afghanistan, including the Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP), the Public
Financial Management Reform Project (PFMRP), the Civil Service Reform Project (CSRP), the
Sustainable Development of Natural Resources Project (SDNRP) and the planned Pension Reform
Project. Also, the Bank is working closely with the Ministry o f Mines and the MOF. Through
additional financing and a new grant operation the government's capacity to effectively regulate
Afghanistan's minerals and hydrocarbon sector in a transparent manner while fostering private
developments will be strengthened; and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) will
be implemented, to which the GOA committed as a prior action o fthe proposed DPG.

45.      The PACBP and the PFMRP (IDA US$60 million in total) directly support the
Government's efforts to strengthen Treasury, procurement, financial management, and internal and
external audit functions and capacity within government. These efforts are critical to raising overall
fiduciary capacity and enabling the government to manage donor and own resources effectively. The
two operations provide the technical support necessary to realize the objectives o f improving fiscal
policy and public financial management that are also followed on the policy level with the supported
reform program o fthe DPG.

46.      The CSRP (IDA US$20 million) complements the public financial management reform efforts,
through strengthening human resource management practices across government, including increasing
personnel performance through incentives, merit based hiring, good management and competency
enhancement. Considering that personnel costs account for more than 50 percent o f the operating
budget, gains in this area will be significant for controlling costs and increasing expenditure
effectiveness. The CSRP i s closely associated with the proposed Pensions Reform Project that will
support the development and administration o f a fiscally sustainable pension reform. Together these
operations strengthen core business practices within government, namely human resource and
financial management.'              They are critical for the achievement o f the DPG objectives in the area o f
human resources management.

47.      The SDNRP (IDA US$30 million) provides technical assistance to the government to manage
the exploitation o f natural resources in a sustainable manner. This is particularly important in
Afghanistan given the potential revenue that could be generated from the mining sector, and the need
to avoid the pitfalls that some resource rich countries have encountered. To this end the SDNRP i s
strengthening the Ministry o f Mines among other agencies, and helping with establishing a cadastre
and the drafting o f regulations for the key mining laws. These efforts are complementary to the DPG,
which supports the government in its endorsement and implementationo fthe EITI in order to promote
transparency and oversight o f the public resources flowing from this sector.



LESSONSLEARNED

48.      Through the successful implementation of the previous development policy series,
investment operations, and analytical work on Afghanistan, a number of lessons have been
learned. These lessons are in line with, and build on lessons learned in other fragile states.' First,
the ISN summarizes lessons from previous strategy implementation, underlining that state and
capacity building is the key priority for development progress.                                    Second, in the fragile context o f
Afghanistan, principles of selectivity, ownership, and flexibility, which are applicable across
countries, must be specifically emphasized. Finally, a solid monitoring and evaluation system is

important given the weak statistical system in Afghanistan. This will require overcoming the
complexity o f defining indicators that can be used to evaluate the success o f the reform program
supported by the DPG.

49.    The reform success of PSIB 1-111provides a foundation for continued development policy
support.     Progress under the main objective, strengthening fiscal management and public
administration reform, has been satisfactory overall. Progress in some non-core objectives, i.e.
financial and private sector development has been more moderate. The PSIB series, together with
ARTF and IMF programs, has led to notable achievements in the area o f macroeconomic stability. It
has greatly reinforced,the importance and credibility o f the budget and o f the MTFF. Expenditure
systems have been strengthened and some capacity has been built to implement the budget and
development programs in a more transparent and accountable manner. Finally, the PSIB success and
the upcoming political uncertainties validate the design o f one-tranche operations with prior actions
determining the release o f funds.       The previous series demonstrated that development policy
operations can be successful in a post-conflict, fragile environment, provided there is government
ownership.

50.    Reflectingon the PSIB experience there remain many gaps, as well as considerable risk in
sustaining reform achievements. Analytical work and policy dialogue suggest that these gaps
require further clarification o f the regulatory framework, in particular for P F M and administrative
reform. More effort in reducing vulnerability to corruption through transparency and accountability
measures is warranted. Also, the successful reforms at the center have to be extended to sub-national
level. The budget process needs further strengthening and budget implementation needs to improve.
This will require a sound MTFF that increases budget realism and links the budget and ANDs
priorities, as well as capacity building o f civil servants involved in budget formulation and execution.
The issue o f weak government capacity can be mitigated by maximizing synergies o f development
policy operations with other Bank instruments. As described in other sections, the design o f the
proposed DPG builds on synergies with the Bank's analytical work and investment operations, as well
as synergies with the IMF's PRGF, the ADB's program loans, and the ARTF (Para. 41).

51.    The PSIB series supported with its prior actions key legislative reforms and
improvementsin the MTFF, but progress could not be sustained or fully implemented in some
of these areas. First, the Civil Service Law o f 2005, a prior action for PSIB 11, laidthe foundation for
a modern legal framework for improved human resource management o f the government. However, it
became clear that it provided inadequate guidance for the PAR implementation, inparticular in regard
to the P&G reform (Para. 68). Thus GOA decided to have a separate Civil Servant Law, which would
set out more specifically the legal framework for employment in the civil service and would include a
P&G scale. Given the importance o f the content o f the new Civil Servant Law for the implementation
o f the PAR agenda it was included in this DPG as a prior action. Second, the Public Procurement
Law (PPL) o f 2005 was a prior action for PSIB 11.Duringthe implementation o f the law it appeared
that threshold limits for large awards were too low and created delays in the approval for procurement
contracts due to overburdening o f the Special Procurement Committee (Para. 66). In 2008 GOA
changed the PPL, increasing the threshold limits, but also included some provisions that weakened
transparency in procurement, in particular, making reimbursement for some expenditures under the
ARTF RC window impossible. Inorder to guarantee an adequate fiduciary environment for the ARTF
RC window, as well as overall government procurement standards, corrective amendments to the PPL
were urgently needed and included as a prior action to the DPG. Finally, the first MTFF o f 2005 and
the MTFF for SY1386 were prior actions for PSIB I1 and 111, respectively. However, problematic
issues related to the capacity o f the Fiscal Policy Unit (FPU) led to deterioration in the quality'and
relevance o f the recent MTFF (Para. 62). Given the significance o f the MTFF in regard to the
implementation o f the ANDs and its importance for informing the annual budget process the
formulation o f a MTFF budget statement was included as a prior action for the DPG.

                                                      19

52.      These lessons learned have been instrumental in allowing the team to develop best
practices in conditionality(Box 3). This is reflected inthe government policy matrix, which outlines
specific actions and progress indicators for the proposed DPG (Annex 2).


                         Box 3: How the DPG Reflects Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership. The government demonstrated strong ownership of the supported reform program,
despite the leadership change in the MOF in early March 2009 after which efforts re-doubled to implement all prior actions.
Development policy operations in Afghanistan have an excellent track record, built over the three PSlB operations between
2004 and 2007. The government fulfilled for PSlB 1-111   all prior actions before Board discussion and met most subsequent
triggers. There was continued progress in the core areas of the proposed operation, i.e. improving fiduciary standards and
strengtheningpublic administration reform. For the proposed DPG a whole new component on transparency and accountability
was added to acknowledge critical anti-corruption efforts GOA is pursuing. The MOF became a champion of reforms in all
these areas, a testimony to its continued strong leadershipgovernment-wide.
Principle 2: Agreement upfront with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework. The policy matrix (Annex 2) was agreed with the government and serves to monitor progress under the reform
program. The authorities took a more active part in the design of the proposed DPG reform program and provided the first
drafts of the matrix. There were open discussions and mutual agreement early on in the preparation of the operation on
expectations and monitoring requirements. Reforms were discussed with the main development partners in these areas, the
IMF, the Department for International Development and the ADB, when possible, during joint-missions. Given the context of
weak capacity in the government the policy matrix was kept as simple as possible to avoid confusion on the key reform steps
required and to allow easy monitoring of progress by the counterparts.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances. The
DPG reflects country circumstances and priorities as indicated by the government, in particular, the need for selectivity and
flexibility. More sensitive and complex reforms are continuously supported by analytical work, technical assistance and
investment projects, such as in public administration reform and public financial management capacity building. As noted
above, strong ownership has systematically been a criterion for selecting policy reform areas supported by the DPG. For
example, within the MOF the Internal Audit Department emerged as a key reform unit in increasing transparency and
accountabilitywithin the MOF. The Extractive IndustriesTransparency Initiativewas added, when the government signaledthe
wish to expedite the tendering of major mining contractswith the objectiveto increase revenue.
Principle 4: Choose actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The chosen prior actions are
adequate and the number of progress has been considerably reduced with respect to those contained in the Monitoring &
Evaluation framework of the PSlB series. The focus of the proposed DPG on a more targeted set of reforms is essential to
establish a track record of reform implementation in the difficult country environment, including the deteriorating security
situation and in light of the expected political uncertainties over the next year.       Selectivity is critical given the limited
implementation capacity and the lack of clear priorities from the national development strategy. Presently it appeared most
urgent to consolidate achievements in the areas of public financial management and civil service reform. However, it was
necessary to include measures to increase transparency and accountability, in particular in public financial management. In
order to ensure that donors continue to provide funds through the government budget weak governance and perceivedwide-
spread corruption risks needed to be addressed. Also, some prior actions reflect the early stages of the development process
in Afghanistan,for example in strengtheningsub-nationalfiscal functions.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support.
Progress reviews under the proposed DPG are planned about every 4-6 months, based on discussions with the respective
counterparts and under guidance of the MOF. They will be thoroughly documented to ensure transparency and predictability.
However, there is considerable room for improvement in M&E, as well as statistical data and management capacity on the side
of the government. It remains weak and results in the fact that monitoring is often carried out jointly with the GOA team during
task team supervision missions. While this DPG is a stand-alone operation, given the volatile country circumstances, it is
imbeddedin ongoing dialogue on medium-term reform efforts of the government.




ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

53.      The Bank's Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) for Afghanistan have been well
received by the government and the international community. A range of flagship reports have
been central to the Bank's overall strategy. All such reports have included a range of intermediate
outputs in terms o f policy notes, technical assistance and capacity building efforts. In addition, a
variety o f "just in time" policy assistance notes have responded to the government's request for
guidance on a range o f complex and controversial issues.                       Effective dissemination o f analytical
findings and broader development results under the Bank's program has been an important part of the
Bank's strategy.



                                                              20

54.     The proposed DPG is based on previous and ongoing analytical work and technical
assistance undertaken by the Bank Group. Technical assistance has been continuously provided
by Bank staff in support o f fiduciary and civil service reforms. For example, in the area o f civil
service reform, continuous Bank engagement has assisted the government indrafting the Civil Servant
Law and designing the rollout o f the new pay and grade structure. The recent PEFA reports (June
2005 and December 2007) were important analytical products that fed into the design of the DPG.
The PEFA reports measure reform progress in PFM and chart the areas with outstanding issues.
Comparison between the first and second assessment shows significant improvements in several
areas, particularly in regard to budget predictability and transparency as well as accounting, reporting
and audit.      It also identified areas for further reforms, such as transparency, accountability and
internal audit, to which related measures were included inthe supported reform program o f the DPG.

55.     More broadly, the DPGhas been informed by several major analytical products:

     i. AmajorreportonBuildinganEffective State-Prioritiesfor PublicAdministrationReform
          in Afghanistan (June 2008), proposes a 12 point agenda for public administration reform,
          reflecting the difficult environment o f state building in Afghanistan and the challenges in
          extending core competencies across government. This has provided important guidance on
          civil service reform sub-national efforts and transparency and accountability measures that
          have been built into the DPG.

     ii.A recent report Fighting Corruption in Afghanistan - Summaries of Vulnerabilities to
          Corruption Assessments VCAs (January 2009) contains a series o f VCAs on key sectors and
          agencies. It analyzes important government processes and vulnerabilities in customs, revenue,
          financial management and appointments, and develops action plans with the concerned
          agencies to address them. These reforms are directly reflected and built upon inthe supported
          reform program o f the DPG (Box 4).

     iii.A report on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Sub-national Expenditures (August
          2008) identifies key policy and reform challenges confronting Afghanistan in the area o f
          intergovernmental finance and i s the basis for efforts to clarify the fiscal financing framework
          for sub-national reforms supported under the DPG.



                                    Box 4: Forms of Corruption Findings from the VCAs
                                                                   -
Corruption is widely recognized to be an extremely serious problem in Afghanistan. Corruption, a symptom of poor governance,
constitutes a serious threat to Afghanistan's entire state-building and development agenda. At the request of the GOA, the
World Bank, in collaboration with the Department for International Development and ADB, and with the cooperation of the GOA,
carried out corruption to vulnerability studies in 2007/08 covering the roads ad energy sectors as well as civil service
appointments and revenue and public financial management.
The vulnerability studies concluded that exposure to corruption is significant although considerable progress has been made on
the prevention side through PFM reforms and improvements. Corruption opportunities in PFM can be divided into: (i) high level
opportunities to influence patronage, (ii) petty corruption and bribery, and (iii) financial leakages and embezzlement. While all
three forms affect public wealth, the threat to donors' funds entrusted to the Government in support of the budget would
primarily arise under financial leakages and embezzlement.
In Afghanistan, the strong centrally managed and computerized payments mechanism has contributed to the soundness of the
PFM system which effectively mitigates the risk from financial leakages and embezzlement. Maintenance of the effectiveness
of this system requires continuous monitoring and renewal of system components along with strengthening of the
professionalism of public sector accountants. As the government pursues multiple reforms and capacity building initiatives all
along the public accountability chain of accounting, reporting, internal audit, external audit, and parliamentary oversight,
progress is being made in establishing the foundation for a multi-faceted and mutually reinforcing governance system to help
deter and detect corruption.
Corruption in pocurement similarly threatens public wealth and the low capacity in public procurement and the transition to the
new regulatory framework presents another challenge. Nevertheless, these risks are mitigated by the central oversight by the
Afahanistan Reconstruction and Develoment Services (ARDS) and the external oversiqht bv the ARTF Monitoring Agent.

                    V.        THE PROPOSEDDEVELOPMENTPOLICY GRANT

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

56.        Development objective: The grant o f SDR 23.5 million (US$35 million equivalent) supports
the implementation o f the GOA'Smedium-term development strategy, the ANDS, within the context
o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework.                   The overall goal o f the operation is to consolidate
macroeconomic stability and enhance fiduciary standards o f the core budget. The reform program
will support improved management o f public finances, further strengthen fiscal and economic
governance, foster fiscal responsibility, and introduce aspects o f greater transparency and
accountability.       In particular, the DPG will have the following core development objectives: (i)
improve fiscal policy and planning and public financial management, (ii)strengthen public
administration reform and sub-national administration,                         and (iii)increase transparency and
accountability in the management o f public finances. The operation is aiming at complementing other
investment and technical assistant operations in the areas o f public financial management and public
administration.

57.        Reform Program: The government requested IDA to support the national development
strategy, the ANDS, with its commitment to fiscal sustainability and improved fiscal and economic
governance as outlined in the attached Letter of Development Policy (LDP, Annex 1). The focus o f
the proposed development policy operation will be to sustain and deepen reforms focused onthe MOF
and support its role as a government-wide reform champion. The proposed DPG will support the
GOA to consolidate previous achievements under the ongoing public financial management and
public administration reform agenda. This will help maintain reforms in areas with a proven track
record, but in an increasingly uncertain environment. Given current levels o f uncertainty about the
commitment to a medium term reform agenda, the operation is designed as a stand-alone operation.

58.        Prior actions: The operation i s designed so that all prior actions for the DPG have been
taken prior to Board presentation. The prior actions are described in Box 5 and present the specific
actions within the broad government reform program that will form the basis for the DPG
disbursement. They are imbedded in the medium-term government reform program as reflected in this
section.


                     Box 5: Prior Actions for the Strengthening Institutions Development Policy Grant

 (1) The government has: (i) submitted to Parliament a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework budget statement for discussion as
      part of the SY1388 budget discussion, which includes expenditure estimates based on reasonable approximations of
      the medium term cost impact of the P&G reform, and (ii) established and appointed members of a joint MOF-
      lndependent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC) technical working group on P&G reform
      implementation.
 (2) The Budget Department is reorganized along the ANDs priority sectors with the view to ensuring that: (i) the budget
      becomes an implementation instrumentfor the ANDS, and (ii) is approved by Parliament in a timely manner.
 (3) Enactment of Amendments to the 2008 Procurement Law providing for, inter alia, the reinstatement of transparency of
      the procurement process with respect to low value procurement; and reissance of a circular restoring ARDS
      procurementoversight.
 (4) Official gazetting of a new Civil Servant Law with a new P&G scale.
 (5) Increase direct deposits under the GOA Verified Payroll Plan (VPP) from 50,801 civil servants at the end of SY1386 to
      at least 95,000 by the end of SY1387.
 (6) Report on the assessment of the provincial budgeting pilot is issued by the MOF with the view of developing an
      institutional position on sub-nationalfinancing reform.
 (7) Cabinet announcementto commit to the Extractive lndustries Transparency (EITI) Initiative for Afghanistan.
 (8) Establish in the lnternal Audit Department (IAD) of MOF: (i) a Fraud lnvestigafion Unit (Flu) with a qualified auditor and
      a training programfor staff, and (ii) an lnformation Technology (IT) Audit Section.



                                                               22

POLICY AREAS

59.    The operation has three main components based on the objectives of the proposed DPG
and the areas supported in Afghanistan's ongoing reform program. The associated government
policy matrix, which outlines specific actions for these components, is appended to this Program
Document (Annex 2). The matrix also describes key progress indicators for the next 12 months and
the M&E arrangements.        Recent achievements, key challenges and the government medium-term
reform strategy in each o f the sub-areas o f the reform components are discussed below. The reform
components supported by the DPG are: (1) Improve Fiscal Policy and Planning and Financial
Management; (2) Strengthen Public Administration Reform and Sub-National Administration; and (3)
Increase Transparency and Accountability inthe Management o f Public Finances.



Theme 1: Improve Fiscal Policy and Planning and Financial Management

1.1 Improvingbudgetprocessand medium-termfiscal planning

60. Recent Achievements and Challenges: The GOA has undertaken specific initiatives to
strengthen the budget preparation process (Para. 22), including a series o f institutional reforms in the
Budget Department. The latest two budgets for 2007/08 and for 2008/09 were approved by Cabinet in
accordance with the legally required 45 days before the end o f the fiscal year. They were also
approved by Parliament on time before the start o f the new fiscal year without major changes. This is
a major achievement given the increasingly complex budget structure and budget preparation process.
As the budget preparation process developed further into a more consultative process between MOF
and line ministries, and the budget itself underwent structural changes to become fully aligned with
the ANDS, it became o f utmost importance to also update the institutional structure o f the Budget
Department and assure a smooth preparation process to keep the legally required timeline for budget
approval by Cabinet and Parliament.

61, One main challenge remains the low budget implementation. Low budget execution is related to
the overall problem o f inflated budget projections and at the same time the still limited absorptive
capacity in line ministries. Although there were steady improvements in the ratio in recent years,
progress is slow, considering that capacity buildingtakes time and that the budget became much more
comprehensive. In 2008/09 core development budget implementation decreased to 49 percent (from
55 percent in 2007/08). Two specific reasons contributed to the decrease as compared to the year
before: (i)a delay following confusion about the chart o f account related to program budgeting, and
(ii)lackofbridgefinancingfromthegovernmentasaresultofthedeterioration ofthecashposition.
While the cash position o f the government will remain tight over 2009/10, budget implementation is
expected to increase again. The implementation o f ongoing reforms in procurement and the Mustofiat
reforms on the sub-national level are expected to contribute to this goal inthe medium-term.

62.    Significant progress has been made in the preparation of the MTFF as a forward looking
planning instrument since the first version o f 2005. The MTFF has been updated regularly and more
consultations and better analysis now support the MTFF. In particular at a technical level, much
progress has been made to develop more robust and informed projections. In2006 the MTFF was for
the first time integrated into a Fiscal Strategy and Budget Framework report. From a process point of
view, this was a very positive development as this report provided a clear signal for fiscal policy, as
well as guidance for the following 2007/08 budget. The MTFF presented to the Cabinet and
Parliament in 2005 and in March 2007 were prior actions for the previous development policy
operations (Para. 5 1). However, capacity constraints at the FPU, combined with lack o f priority for
this planning tool within the MOF, led to deterioration in the quality and relevance o f the 2008/09

                                                   23

MTFF which was presented to Parliament in March 2008. The JSAN for the ANDs pointed out that
the role o f the MTFF as a medium-term fiscal and planning instrument in support of the ANDs was
not sufficiently developed. In fact, the medium-term resource envelope for ANDs implementation
presented in the ANDs was not coinciding with the 2008/09 MTFF projections, discrediting it as a
fiscal planning tool.

63.      Reform Strategy:              A future timely budget preparation process and subsequently timely
approval o f the annual budget was facilitated by the reorganization o f the Budget Department in
2008/09, which includes now the functions related to the ANDs and was supported through a prior
action for the DPG. (Annex 5). This will ensure that the budget becomes a key instrument for the
implementation o f the ANDS. The Budget Department already integrated this structure into the recent
Tashkeel and used this organizational set-up for the 2009/10 budget preparation process. The timely
submission o f the 2010/11 budget is a progress indicator for the DPG. In the medium-term it is
expected that ANDs priority sectors will be adequately reflected in the budget structure and budget
implementation improves with optimized cash management and appropriate controls.

64.      The GOA formulated an improved forward-looking 2009/10 MTFF budget statement and
submitted it to Parliament as part o f the 1388 budget documentation, supported as a prior action by
the DPG. This MTFF included expenditure estimates based on reasonable approximations of the
medium term cost impact o f the P&G reform. In addition to the technical costing exercise, the
authorities established a joint technical working group between relevant units in the M O F and the
IARCSC as a mechanism for a more coordinated approach to managing the fiscal implications o f the
P&G reform. Since the wage bill accounts for almost two thirds o f operating expenditures, changes in
the pay structure o fthe civil service will affect the government's overall fiscal position. According to
current estimates, the total net fiscal cost o f P&G will amount to about US$205 million" once all
current civil servants have been moved to the new scale in 2013/14, adding about 17 percent to the
existing wage bill. It will be critical for the government to actively manage the roll-out o f the P&G
reform in a manner that i s fiscally prudent and sustainable, i.e. that stays within the parameters set in
the MTFF and is adjusted should the overall fiscal framework change, and for example, should
shortfalls in revenues occur. As a progress indicator it i s expected that the 1388 MTFF will be
regularly updated and integrated into a Fiscal Strategy and Budget Framework report. Inthe medium-
term it is expected that the MTFF will guide GOA'S policy decision towards the medium-term fiscal
sustainability goal (Para. 21) to cover operating core budget expenditure with domestic revenues.



1.2 Enhancefinancial management and fiduciary standards

65.      Recent Achievements and Challenges: There has been continued progress in Afghanistan's
PFM reforms (Para. 32), particularly in budget execution elements o f control, accounting, reporting
and audit as evidenced by the latest World Bank PEFA-based PFMReview from 2008 (Annex 4). The
Government met for 2007/08 its own regulations on content and timeliness o f financial reporting and
independent review by the Auditor General, presentingto Parliament the audited budget statement for
2006/07 within six months following year-end.                            Transparency remains good. There are monthly
financial reports on the MOF website, the state budget i s audited and state financial accounts and
budget performance report are submitted to Parliament. A new Procurement Law was enacted in
2005 (a PSIB I1prior action, Para. 5 l),                following good procurement practices. The functioning o f the
Procurement Policy Unit for monitoring and oversight o f procurement and the Special Procurement
Commission is improving. Proper complaint handling and reporting mechanisms are in place. The
country StandardBidding Documents (SBDs) and all pending circulars (completing the Procurement

Rules of Procedures) havebeen drafted. Procurementcontracts, bids, and awards are publishedby the
ARDS", a centralprocurement facilitation service under the supervision ofthe Ministry of Economy.
ARDS is in charge of assisting government entities in their procurement activities until full
procurementcapacity is achievedon all levels.

66.      Recently there have been issues in further implementingand sustaining some PFM reforms.
First,while there were inprevious years significant improvements in the total ARTF eligibility ratio,
it decreasedin 2007/08 to 79.5 percentfrom 82.9 in2006/07 (Box 6). Second, GOA's amendmentsto
the 2005 PPL in July 2008 had mixed implications.On a positive note, the proposed amendments
made an upwardrevision of the threshold limits for first grade award authorities. This allows faster
processingof procurement documentation.But there were revisionsof several Articles which were a
cause of concern, in particular, Art. 21 allowed for quotations without a proper Request for
Quotations for low value procurement.This dilutedthe transparency of the procurement process and
together with other changes weakened the fiduciary environment, including compromising the
eligibility of government's Operation & Maintenance (O&M) expenditures for reimbursement from
the ARTF RC window. Finally, procurement oversight by ARDS for large procurement contracts
needsto be renewedandrestored, in particularfollowingthe PPL 2008 revisioninthreshold limits.




                                            Box 6: Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund

The ARTF is committed to funding recurrent cost of the government budget (in addition to investment projects) in
accordance with the GOA's macroeconomic and budget framework as reviewed by the IMF and the World Bank.
Promoting transparency and accountability of reconstruction assistance was a central aim in the establishment of the
ARTF. Transparency is achieved through the use of a public comprehensive budget and reliable reporting on uses under
this budget. For the funding of the non-security recurrent cost specifically, the transparency is complemented by the use of
an independent Monitoring Agent, who recommends for reimbursement those items which comply with the GOA'S own
financial management regulationsand with the procurement rules agreedfor the Trust Fund.
Eligibility Ratios under the ARTF Recurrent Cost Window. The government has made substantial efforts to raise the
level of eligibility. It increased from 36.4 percent in 2003/04 to about 80 percent in 2007/08. The recent decline in payroll
eligibility from 92.5 percent to 89.2 percent was due to payroll for unauthorized head count and incomplete documentation
for payroll from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. O&M ineligibilities decreased from 64.6 to 62.0 percent, due to increased
non-compliancewith procurement procedures,with many line ministries still followingthe pre-2005 rules for advertisingand
bidding.

Procurement under ARTF. The Grant Agreement for the recurrent cost trust fund provides the procurement rules to be
followed for the uses of funds. Bank guidelines are specified for works and capital items as well as the rules for goods and
services. The O&M rules of the Grant Agreement were found to align with the Procurement Law of 2008 and as such the
eligibility rules of these under the ARTF MonitoringAgent specify compliancewith the Law as the basis for acceptance.

67.      Reform Strategy:                  The GOA issued in January 2009 amendments to the PPL 2008,
incorporating Bank Procurement team comments and suggested improvements to the clarity o f the
law. Except for a few Articles, the modified version o f the PPL agrees again with good public
procurement practices. Also, the circular PPU/COl 0/1386 was reissued inFebruary 2009 reconfirming
ARDS oversight on procurement over the fixed thresholds. These two measures constituted a prior
action for the DPG. More minor concerns were addressed in the Rules ,of Procedures o f March 2009,
the SBDs and Standard Request for Proposals. A few structural issues in six Articles o f the Law are
planned to be addressed in the medium term and GOA is also planning a stakeholder workshop to
disseminate the revised law and get feed back from the civil society and stakeholders. Over the next
twelve months the government is committed to implement the following reform actions: (i)finalize
and publish the Procurement Manual; and (ii)complete and disseminate the SBDs. M O F will start
reporting on compliance with the ARDS circular and will establish a baseline for SY1388. The
government is committed to increase the ARTF eligibility ratios and the proposed DPG will use the
ratio o f eligible expenditures determined by the ARTF MA as a key indicator o f successful
implementation o f PFM reforms. In the medium-term progress i s expected in the implementation o f
the new procurement law, following the roll-out o f procurement training to the line ministries and the
plan to decentralize procurement authority. A Management Information System strategy and road map
were developed for the ARDS and planned to be extended to line ministries and provinces.                                               12




Theme2: Strengthen Public Administration Reform and Sub-NationalAdministration

2.1 Improve human resourcemanagement

68.      Recent Achievements and Challenges:                                  There have been initial signs o f success in
establishing some basic prerequisites for an effective civil service in Afghanistan. Key personnel
management institutions, such as the IARCSC and the Independent Appointment Board (IAB) were
established. There has been progress in developing the legal framework, starting with the Civil
Service Law enacted in 2005 and a comprehensive PAR strategy from November 2005. A central
element o f the PAR program was a Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) scheme, an asymmetric
approach which facilitated the restructuring o f key government departments and staffed these with
civil servants through merit-based recruitment on a higher salary scale. The PRR process had
approved by March 2009 more than 30,000 appointments in ministries and agencies eligible for an
Interim Additional Allowance after administrative reforms. The IAB has appointed since its inception
in September 2003, morethan 3,000 candidates for senior grade 2 and above and monitoredmore than
20,000 appointments at grade 3 and below. Recently the Government has been actively working on
developing a strategy o f the pension reform for the public pension program. Prompted by the growing
fiscal pressure o f the pension payouts and expected fiscal impact o f the P&G reform on the pension
liabilities, in 2007, the Government formed an inter-ministerial Steering Committee on Pension
Reform and a supporting technical working group to draft a pension reform strategy and proposal.

69.      While the PAR program and the PRR scheme provided the basic building blocks for the civil
service they have been subject to implementation delays and questions o f coherence and fiscal
sustainability (Para. 33). The institutions that govern the civil service and its reform still suffer from
weak capacity. The Civil Service Law has not provided sufficient guidance for the implementation o f
the PAR and the envisioned P&G reform. In2007, the GOA decided to have a separate Civil Servant
(Employee) Law, which would set out more specifically the terms o f reference for civil servants.

While this delayed the overall P&G reform progress it was an unforeseen, but inthe view o f the GOA
a necessary, reform step. Other planned initiatives, e.g. for pensions, also were delayed, because they
depended on the finalization o f the P&G policy. Nevertheless, a Pension Strategy Note was endorsed
by the Steering Committee on Pension Reforms in early 2008 and immediately following the
enactment o f the Civil Servant Law, new Pension Regulations have been drafted. While the civil
service's size has been effectively controlled, capacity in most line ministries in Afghanistan remains
weak and heavily reliant upon external support. The P&G implementation is a key element o f the
government's agenda to build sustainable capacity in the civil service (Para. 5). At the same time it is
the single most extensive and complicated administrative reform that, the government has attempted
(Box 7).

71.   Reform Strategy: The enactment o f the Civil Servant Law in June 2008, a prior action for the
DPG (Para. 51), strengthened the overall legal framework for civil service management in
Afghanistan. It included provisions to implement a new P&G structure across the non-military civil
service, replacing the ad hoc salary structures devised by the PRR. The main change from the old to
the new P&G system is that it will move civil servants from a person-based grade structure to a
position-based grade structure. This reflects a change towards a more transparent and equitable P&G
structure for the civil service. However, the pay levels appear to be more compressed than originally
envisioned and it remains to be seen if this will attract quality staff at senior levels in the short term.
Important next steps for the GOA on the civil service reform agenda for this year are: (i)progress in
implementingthe P&G reform, including a phased re-grading and re-appointment process o f civil
servants in accordance with fiscal realities (Box 7); and (ii) agreement on the key features o f a fiscally
feasible pension system in line with-the P&G reform with the adoption o f the Pension Regulations.
The completion o f the re-grading process at 10 ministries by end 1388 (baseline: 5 ministries in 1387)
will be an important progress indicator for the DPG. In the medium-term the GOA is committed to
clarify the status o f key regulations under the Civil Servant Law, complete the process o f transferring
all civil servants to the new P&G scale, and implementpension reforms.

72.      The government committed itself to nearly double VPP direct deposits o f payroll between
2007/08 and 2008/09 to at least 95,000 from 50,801, which was supported by a prior action o f the
DPG. By the end o f 2008/09 the VPP direct deposits o f payroll has expanded to over 122,000 civil
servants. As a key outcome indicator the DPG will monitor progress toward the target o f at least
40,000 additional staff included inthe Afghanistan RegistrationAuthority and be covered inthe direct
deposit phase o f the VPP under the M O F by end 2009/10. In the medium-term it is expected that all
370,000 civil servants receive payroll payments intime and with adequate controls (i.e. through direct
deposits under the VPP).

the area o f budgeting for sub-national expenditures
and services*            In this context, and in regard to the
MOF's role for fiscal oversight and management, the
importance was recognized that the M O F provides the
framework for a strategic approach to sub-national
financing. This will be not only o f utmost importance for shaping its own reforms, but also for
guiding the work o f line ministries and IDLG as proposals for the organization o f sub-national
financing continue to develop.

74.      While strengthening sub-national administration i s a key element o f the government's objective
to build an effective and legitimate state and deliver services throughout the country, the capacity o f
sub-national administration remains weak (Para. 9). The MOF is one o f the few ministries that have
more active departments at the provincial level and the MOF has pursued reforms to strengthen
crucial sub-national fiscal functions by initiating pilots on provincial budgeting and rolling-out
M~stoJiat'~       reforms. The Budget Department is the carrier o f the provincial budgeting pilot designed
to: (i)make the budget more effective as a major development tool, (ii)ensure that provinces become
stakeholders in budget preparation, (iii)ensure an equitable allocation o f resources across provinces
to facilitate effective service delivery, and (iv) empower provincial authorities. However, it appears
provincial budgeting to date has had limited success and an assessment o f the provincial budgeting
pilot experience i s warranted to assess whether this was due to limited incentives for stakeholders to
engage with the process and the capacity reforms involved.

75.     Reform Strategy: The government completed in 2009 a report on the assessment o f the

MOF institutional position on sub-national financing reforms. Over the next twelve months, building
on a deepening dialogue between the GOA and the World Bank, along with other development
partners, a draft strategic approach to sub-national financing i s planned to be developed. Such a
strategic approach would particularly need to address the questions o f how sectors would determine
the vertical structure o f budget authority, and within what framework they would develop budget
norms for allocating resources across sub-national units. This will help guide the expansion o f sub-
national reform efforts beyond the current provincial budgeting exercises. In the medium-term it is
expected that reforms in this area lead to a better reflection o f sub-national priorities through
improved vertical structures o f sector budget authority and established budget norms lead to a more
equitable allocation o f resources across sub-national levels.

progress has been made by MOF
on the prevention side o f the anti-
corruption            effort.       This         is
reflected in P F M reforms to the
oversight o f funds channeled
through the government's budget
and evidenced by the latest PEFA
assessment that financial controls
and       fiduciary          standards         are
adequate and reduce the risk o f
fraud        and       other     misuse          of
budgetary          funds (Annex                 4).
However, corruption remains a
serious problem at all levels
(Figure 5)              which       decreases
donors' willingness to provide                          Source: Transparency lnternational
funds through the government
budget(Para. lo).

77.       Also, transparency and accountability reforms have not yet expanded to the revenue side o f the
budget. In this regard, one particular reform initiative has emerged, namely, increasing transparency
intax collection and monitoring proceduresfor royalties from existing and planned miningand quarry
operations following the Extractive Industries Transparency l4                                        framework. Afghanistan is a natural
resource rich country where the mining and hydrocarbons sector could function as an important
engine o f economic growth (Para. 23). It could contribute significantly to government revenues,
essential to reconstruction and development. The EITI framework i s a globally developed standard

that promotes revenue transparency in resource extraction industries.                                 However, it should be
recognized that there are limits on the impacts that can be achieved through prevention alone in the
absence o f other critical components o f an anti-corruption strategy such as external accountability and
law enforcement (Para. 10).

78.    Reform Strategy: The MOF is promoting good governance as part o f its strategy, with
particular focus on making budget informationpublicly available and exercising effective control over
the use o f public funds. As an element o f its revenue mobilization function, it i s committed to grow
revenues dynamically and collect it in a fair and transparent manner. The EITI framework could
become increasingly important as new mining operations come on stream and the potential for new
revenue to the government grows, one recent example being the Aynak copper project (Box 9). As an
important first step for implementing the EITI framework, the government publicly committed to
adopting EITI in Afghanistan in March 2009, supported by a prior action for the DPG. Related to
this, over the next twelve months the government has committed to the following measures: (i)
appoint an EITI champion and all members o f the multi-stakeholder EITI steering committee; (ii)
approve and publish a work plan and budget for the EITI implementation; and (iii)create a baseline
inventory o f companies in the extractive industries and publisha list o f all mine titles. Inthe medium-
term the government objective is, after fully establishing the institutional framework o f the EITI and
becoming an EITI candidate country, to reach compliant status, Le. complete an EITI validation
within two years of becoming a candidate country.                            These comprise important steps in the
implementation o f accountability and good governance in the exploitation o f natural resources in
Afghanistan.



                                             Box 9: Afghanistan's Mining Potential

   The Afghanistan IDA document, Miningas a Source of Growth (2004) estimated that the gross annual market value of
    solid minerals produced could increase dramatically over the medium and longer term. More recent projections estimate
   that total minerals production could reach US$600-800 million by 2015. Such growth scenarios would imply significant
   economic benefits in terms of value added, royalties and taxes to the government, export earnings, new jobs, and
    substantial community development spin-offs. For example, the mines would build substantial transportation, power,
    and water infrastructure to service the needs of the mine as well as the surrounding communities. Government
    revenues by 2015 could reach US$lOO-150 million.          However, the institutional capacity to manage the country's
    resources is limited and mining sector development will require substantial new private sector investment. This requires
   that the Afghan government will facilitate positive economic impacts by creating good governance through institutional
    strengthening and capacity building, and establishing conditions for an enabling environment to attract and retain
    investment by private local and international companies.
    In May 2008 an agreement was signed between the GOA and China Metallurgical Group Cop., Jiangxi Copper
    Corporation, and Zyin Mining Group Company, the winners of a joint bid to develop the Aynak mine, which some
   geologists predict to become the largest copper mine in the world. Assuming a five year exploration and development
    profile for the Aynak project and a capital depreciation period of five years, it is anticipated that direct revenues from the
    sector could increase to US$lOO-120 million annually by 2015. The government intends to conduct an international
   tender in the near future for the Hadyak iron deposit, which is the largest undeveloped iron ore deposit in Afghanistan.
    In addition, Afghanistan has excellent potential to expand existing coal operations as well as opening new coal mines;
   good potential also exists for gold mining and industrial minerals. Finally, artisanal mining of semi-precious gemstones
    has been carried out for many years and this continues to be source of livelihood to large numbers of rural people. If
   these operations materialize they could produce annual receipts of up to US$150 million by 2015.




3.2 Increasefinancialaccountabilitythrough transparentand improvedauditingfunction

79.    RecentAchievements and Challenges: The PFEMLaw from 2005 (a prior action for PSIB 11)
provides the legal framework for the government's audit requirements following international good
practice. The presentation to Parliament o f the external audit o f the annual state budget by the CAO
was successfully institutionalized. However, legislative scrutiny o f audit reports needs to extend
beyond the review o f the traditional annual accounts (Qatia)and be reflected in a formal follow-up to
audit findings and a comprehensive annual audit report. Internal audit i s operational for most central

                                                               30

government entities and a systems review was conducted for the Treasury in 2007/08. However,
assurance of adequate quality of internal audit remains confined to the MOF and Treasury, due to
capacity constraints and the decision of the MOJ in 2007 that audit units in line ministries will not
report to the MOF, but will rather operate in line with the Audit Law.Audit reportsare distributedto
the respective line ministries, but not the MOF, and there is little formal follow-up to audit
recommendations.

80.   The InternalAudit Department at the MOFwas reorganizedin2005 and audits the budget units
of the MOF and works with the FinancialControllers,who are delegates of the Treasury Department
in the line ministries. All staff has been trained in basic accounting and auditing, supported by the
World Bank technical assistance projects (PACBP and PFMRP). The IAD carries out audits under
risk-basedaudit plans and as part of the audit reviews the internal control processes. Work is being
carried out under the supervision of qualified auditors and is done at acceptable audit standards. In
early 2007, the MOF decided to set up a Fraud InvestigationUnit within MOF to investigate the
complaints beingreceived in MOF. Trainingfor MOF auditors in forensic audit was providedin late
2007 through the UnitedNations Development Program's Accountability and Transparency Project.
As more automation takes place includingthe implementation of the Automated System for Customs
Data, ASYCUDA, and the expansion of automatedpayroll systemsthe needfor internalaudit review
of Information Technology will grow. The IAD staff of the MOF has acquired the skills through
training and the use of full time regionalexperts to assess and report on all the risks in MOF, except
the risk from misuse or failure intheAutomated Financial Information Management System (AFMIS)
through which all the headquarter payments are made and all the accounting is done. For this reason
the governmentcommittedto establishinthe IADof MOFan ITAudit Section.

81.   Reform Strategy: The GOA established in early 2008 a new section, called FIU, staffed with
ten trained auditors. Recently it has becomefully functionalunderthe guidance of a qualifiedauditor.
This was supportedby a prior actionof the DPG.The FIUhas establishedbotha trainingprogramfor
staff and work practice tools, including a Fraud Investigation Manual, to support their work. The
establishmentofthe ITAudit Section in2008/09was another importantachievement inthe attempt to
increasefinancial accountability.A managerof the unit was recruitedand basic traininginknowledge
of the AFMIS system was conducted for all staff. Currently four out of seven total staff are recruited
and working at the unit, with the remainingpositionsto be fielded during2009/10. An IT manualfor
the unit was developed. Over the next twelve months, the government is committedto implementthe
following reform steps: (i)the InternalAudit plan of the MOF will include reviews by the two new
audit units, the FIUandthe IT Audit Section; (ii) the first audit ofthe AFMIS systemwill be initiated;
and (iii)a follow-up report on the 2007/08 audit will be produced and presented to Parliament.
Actions under (i)  and (ii)will be importantprogress indicatorsfor the DPG. Inthe medium-termit is
expected that the FIU and IT Audit Section in the IAD are instituted and fully functional. The
objective is that there is adequate transparency, reliability and timeliness of GOA finances and
financial information, including regular audits of the AFMIS system and timely submission of the
externalaudit to Parliament.


                          VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS

82.   The poverty and social implications of the reforms supported by the grant were reviewed
(Table 6). Most of these reforms are not expectedto generateconcerns regardingsocial or livelihood
impacts. However, the focus of the DPG is largely on central state level and geographical areas with
adequate state presence, which might create unequal benefits for the populationin more secure areas
of Afghanistan. They might gain benefits disproportionallyas comparedto citizens in unsecureareas

                                                  31

and with less state authority (Para. 9 and 0). Overall the operation is likely to contribute to positive
poverty and social impacts as described below:


    1.  Macroeconomic stability and sound fiscal underpinnings will support economic growth which
        could improve the quality o f life for all segments o f the population. Measures to improve the
        budget process and MTFF will ensure better medium-term fiscal planning and priority setting
        for resources on poverty-related expenditure and infrastructure. With this it is likely that
        donors will feel more comfortable to use government systems to channel their resources and
        implementtheir projects. This in turn would likely help increase health and education budgets
        and could overall improve services delivery outputs. Proposed measures to improve the
        management o f public funds are likely to have efficiency gains. Improved allocative
        efficiency will better channel resources to priority sectors, like rural development, education
        and health and thus i s likely to improve the conditions on the community level. Execution
        efficiency will increase the likelihood o f resources and service delivery reaching
        communities, including the poor. However, these improvements in the quality o f life o f the
        population are expected to be medium to longer term, and would need proper targeting for the
        poor to positively affect this group.

    11. Measures to strengthen public human resource management will positively affect through
        more equitable and less distorted public wages and improved public service delivery. It will
        directly benefit motivated public servants and educated youth job searchers. Although this
        will also have a positive effect on users o fpublic services and other labor market participants,
        the benefit to the poor i s assessed as moderate. Also, over the medium-term GOA will remain
        heavily reliant on donor's technical assistance and development projects, which will continue
        to considerably distort the overall labor market and wage structure. Sub-national financing
        reforms can lead on the provincial level to more inclusive budget preparation, more equitable
        resource allocation across provinces and, in effect, better sub-national service delivery in the
        long term. However, assuming a similar resource envelope this might lead to benefits for
        previously proportionally underfunded provinces, but potentially losses to others.
    ...
    111.Proposed measures to improve transparency and accountability in the management o f public
        funds are likely to reduce vulnerabilities to corruption.        On the revenue side, the full
        implementation o f the EITI could provide an improved investment climate for firms in the
        mining sector. Increased direct investments and activities in the extractive industry have the
        potential to provide employment and livelihood for many Afghans, directly and indirectly.
        This could in the medium-term to long-term positively affect the living standard o f several
        segments o f the population, especially population in relevant geographical regions and rural
        poor, since mining i s typically relying on a large number o f unskilled workers. Measures on
        the expenditure side are also expected to benefit Afghan citizens, but these measures
        presently only concern the small proportion o f all public expenditure that government
        oversees. However, in the medium-term it is likely to contribute to the level o f assurance for
        donors to use government systems for the implementationo f their projects.

83.    IDA will monitor developments in PAR, including pension reforms (Para. 71). Public
employment is adequate by international standards. Thus retrenchment i s not a priority option to
restructure the civil service. The demographic profile o f the civil service makes retirement a better
option to deal with any need to create space for recruiting new skills. IDA will also review proposals
for managing employees that do not qualify for the new pay scale. Building on the 2005 Gender
Assessment (National Reconstruction and Poverty Reduction - the Role of Women in Afghanistan's
Future), IDA will continue the dialogue on women inthe civil service. Although civil service reforms
such as the introduction o f meritocracy are an opportunity to enhance the role o f women in the
government, realizing this opportunity requires targeted programs.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

84.    The three themes of reforms supported by the DPG are not likely to have any significant
positive or negative effects on the country's environment, forest, and other natural resources.
Measures to improve fiscal policy and planning, PFM, to strengthen public administration and to
promote transparency and good governance are unlikely to have negative environmental
consequences, and are expected to be environmentally neutral. The specific actions supported by the
operation focus on establishing legal, administrative, and regulatory functions o f the state and do not
include physical investments or policy changes that would significantly affect the environment. As a
result, no major environmental concerns are noted. The commitment to the EITI, covered by the third
theme, concerns an initiative to increase transparency o f revenues from the extractive industry. As
such it is not likely to extensively affect the environment. However, a potential benefit o f the full
implementation o f the EITI i s that the investment climate for firms in the mining sector improves.
This could lead to higher direct investments and increased activities in the extractive industry and in
turn negatively affect the environment. At the same time the EITI could potentially benefit
environmental enforcement inthe mining sector due to increased transparency and increased access o f
information in the public domain about those revenues. Altogether it is not expected that the EITI as
an initiative for more transparency and accountability in the extractive industries will result in
negative environmental consequences. Nevertheless, this will be continuously monitored.



IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

85.    The Ministry of Financewill be responsible for overall implementationand monitoringof
the DPG. The government has appointed a focal point to provide overall coordination for the DPG
process. The focal point and the Minister's team o f Deputy Ministers have been working with the
Bank team since the inception o f the DPG.

86.    The Bank team will monitor actions and review implementation during regular
supervision missions. The Government Policy Matrix (Annex 2) o f the proposed DPGprovides the
results framework with expected progress indicators for the next twelve months. In this context,
monitoring and evaluation o f the DPG will focus partly on processes and inputs, as opposed to
outcomes. The M&E framework also includes indicators that are partly beyond the Government's
control, and, for example, depend on timely transfer o f donor commitments.            Implementation,
monitoring and evaluation remains challenging, as significant data gaps and capacity limits are still
being addressed. Weak reform implementation capacity in the GOA will be addressed by the close
coordination o f the DPG with various IDA investment and technical assistance projects (Para. 44). In
light o f the limited capacity inthe government for M&E, the Bank team has to rely to a large extent
on third-party or internal monitoring and verification efforts. The policy matrix clarifies the M&E
arrangements between the government and the Bank.

87.    In some areas progress has been made toward developing capacity to monitor progress
and evaluate outcomes of the reform program. Monetary and fiscal data continue to be released
on a timely basis, which is supported by continued adherence to the IMF PRGF program (Annex 3).
Performance in the P F M area continues to be monitored with a set o f PEFA indicators (Annex 4). A
notable achievement was the completion o f the 2005 and 2007 NRVA, which created a solid
household-based database to set a baseline for a number o f socio-economic indicators, feeding into
the country's first poverty diagnostic. Since then the improved NRVA 2007/08 was launched,
completed, and awaits data analysis, all with support from IDA. Currently the M&E framework for
the ANDs is being developed, with input from IDA and other development partners, buildingon the
monitoring mechanisms o f the Compact.


                                                  34

88.   There remain however many data gaps and capacity needs to be enhanced at all levels of
planning, design, data collection, and analysis. The Government is committed to continue
developing its statistical capacity, but institutional reform in the statistics sector, including the CSO,
i s slow.    As mentioned above, IDA in collaboration with other agencies is supporting the
Government's strategy in the area o f monitoring and evaluation, through technical assistance to the
NRVA and ANDS teams.           Finally, the DPG, together with other IDA lending and analytical
instruments, supports reforms o f the monitoring framework, especially in fiscal, procurement and
PAR.



FIDUCIARYASPECTS

89.   Fiduciary risks remain significant despite progress in clarifying the legalframework. The
roll out o f the procurement law and associated training was only underway in 2007/08 and the
difficulties with implementation and understanding by the oversight bodies, like the Attorney General,
have created some confusion inthe implementingunits.This resulted innegative changes inthe O&M
ARTF eligibility ratios for 2007/08 (Para. 66). A number o f measures are taken to mitigate those
(Para. 99). First, the proposed operation has as its main objective further improvements in fiduciary
standards, reflected in the reform program and key progress indicators (Annex 2).              Second, this
program i s complemented by a series o f IDA investment projects to strengthen the'treasury,
procurement, internal and external audit functions (Para. 44). Third, the performance o f the PFM
system has been rated usingthe PEFA framework, developed by IDA and other development partners,
which provides analytical underpinnings for the fiduciary aspects o f the DPG (Annex 4). This
framework i s designed to track progress toward an increase in fiduciary standards. Finally, fiduciary
risks are mitigated by the coordination betweenthe DPG, the ARTF, and the IMFPRGF (Para. 41).

90.   DAB, Afghanistan's central bank, has completed and submitted to Parliament its audited
2006/07 financial statements.        However, the 2006/07 financial statements disclosed several
unresolved issues, namely: (i)no proper accounting procedure i s built in the system; (ii)there is no
Accounting Manual; and (iii)DAB does not follow a system o f periodic internal review, verification,
and reconciliation o f balance. Under the IMF's safeguards assessment policy, DAB is subject to a
safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved in June 2006. A safeguards
assessment o f DAB was completed on June 12,2006 and updated on March 18,2008. The assessment
revealed serious vulnerabilities in DAB'Sexternal and internal audit mechanisms, as well as in its
financial reporting framework and system o f internal controls. Capacity constraints, however,
hampered the effective implementation o f measures recommended by the assessment, and follow-up
staff visits found that while external audit arrangements had been strengthened, financial reporting
and accounting controls remain weak. Nevertheless, DAB is continuing its implementation o f
outstanding safeguards recommendations. These efforts are being monitored by IMF staff in the
context o f the PRGF program.

91.    To monitor the flow of funds at DAB, for the purpose of this operation, a dedicated
Foreign Currency Deposit Account and Local Currency Deposit Account will be established at
DAB (see below). This will form part o fthe country's official foreign exchange reserves.


DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

92.    Grant Amount, Beneficiary, Terms, and Tranching: The Recipient is the Islamic Republic
o f Afghanistan, represented by MOF. The grant i s for an amount o f SDR 23.5 million, equivalent to
US$35 million, on IDA grant terms to be released in one tranche following approval o f the grant and


                                                    35

notification by IDA o f grant effectiveness. The completion o f the prior actions and the maintenance
o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework are sufficient to release the grant.

93.    Implementation,Monitoring,and Supervision: Duringthe preparation o fthe grant, IDA has
assisted the government to help ensure timely implementation o f the agreed measures. Counterparts
responsible for monitoring progress have been identified and a plan to monitor indicators developed.
To assess the impact o f the proposed operation, IDA will monitor progress in achieving the progress
indicators described inthe Government Policy Matrix and LDP.

94.    Grant Management: A dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account in U S Dollars and a
Local Currency Deposit Account will be established at DAB inthe name o f the MOF. The Accounts
will be managed by MOF, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The only funds paid to these
accounts would be the proceeds o fthe grant.

95.    Disbursements: Upon notification by IDA o f grant effectiveness, and with the submission by
the Recipient o f a withdrawal application, the proceeds o f the grant will be deposited by IDA into the
Foreign Currency Deposit Account o f the Recipient. An amount equivalent to the grant proceeds will
then be credited to an account o f the government to finance budgeted expenditures. Disbursements
will not be linked to specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be necessary.
However, the proceeds o f the grant cannot be used for ineligible expenditures (Le. to finance goods
and services from the IDA'Sstandard negative list as reflected inthe FinancingAgreement). If, after
deposit into the Foreign Currency Deposit Account, the proceeds o f the grant are used for ineligible
expenditures, IDA will require the Recipient to either (i)return the amount to the account for use for
eligible purposes, or (ii)refund the amount directly to IDA. Eligible expenditures would include
payments by the GOA to meet its external service obligations, provided that there are legal
agreements that establish such external debt service obligations. Transactions and balances o f the
government account will be fully incorporated into the government's accounting records and financial
statements, via the AFMIS.

96.    Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing: The Financing Agreement gives IDA the right to
require the Recipient to audit the Foreign Currency Deposit Account through agreed terms o f
references. IDA may also request audits o f the Foreign Currency Deposit Account prior to its closure
inaccordance with the FinancingAgreement.

97.    ClosingDate: The expected closing date o fthe grant will be August 31, 2010.


RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

98.    The DPG faces significant risks includingcountry-specific risks,vulnerabilitiesto external
shocks and project-specific risks (Table 7).        Country-specific risks include political, security,
related macroeconomic management, and capacity risks. Further deterioration o f the security
situation supersedes all other risks since such deterioration would adversely impact every single area
o f public life in Afghanistan, including donor engagement. The drug industry continues to pose
complex risks that are interrelated with security and governance issues. By nature, insecurity and
political instability are intertwined and the impact o f a deteriorating security situation on the fragile
political process could lead to increased political uncertainty and associated unrest. It would have an
adverse impact on macroeconomic management, in particular revenue mobilization, budget
implementation, and take strategic priority over the implementation o f the reform program.
Presidential elections are set for August 2009 and Parliamentary elections for 2010, which may lead
to major political changes altering reform program ownership. Capacity remains weak and could
diminishthe link between reforms supported by the DPG and envisioned reform achievements. These

                                                   36

risks will pose a serious threat to the sustainability o f the results achieved by reforms supported by
this DPG. The mitigation o f these country-specific risks, which affect the whole IDA program, is
outside o f the scope o f the proposed operation. The design o f the proposed DPG as a stand-alone
operation, disbursed only after all prior actions are fulfilled, provides IDA with assurance that main
reform steps are implemented in this environment o f heightened risks. It also allows adjusting
subsequent operations to the security and political situation and the pace o f reform implementation.

impact.


99.    Afghanistan's vulnerabilities to external shocks are significant due to the heavy reliance
on donor assistance, the highlevelof debt distress and large import-dependencyfor basic goods.
The latter became apparent in the recent experience with the sharp increase in global food and fuel
prices with its impact on the economy still felt (Para. 17). Overall, the macroeconomic scenario is
uncertain since the economy remains undiversified and private sector development is highly
dependent on the political and security situation. The risk related to continued donor aid flows was in
part mitigated by commitments made at the Paris Conference 2008, where donors pledged support to
the ANDS. Nevertheless, wavering donor support would delay the implementation o f the reform
program. The high debt distress level is addressed by the participation o f Afghanistan in the H P C
Initiative (Para. 26). The scope o f the operation to mitigate these risks i s limited. However, the DPG
grant can mitigate some risks, by contributing to macroeconomic stability (through fiscal
sustainability), supporting the GOA to build core institutions o f the state and to strengthen sub-
national functions o f the government, and maintaining a focus on key reforms. Also, the Bank's
support i s provided on grant terms in response to the country's risk o f high debt distress. Funds
provided through the DPG are o f discretionary nature for the government and enables it to react to
external and other shocks.

100. Project-specific risks consist of fiduciary and implementation risks, including weakened
ownership and capacity to implement the reform program and vulnerabilities to corruption.
Some o f these risks have materialized duringthe implementation o f the previous PSIB series, such as
limited capacity to gazette laws or delays in the PAR implementation. The proposed DPG mitigates
these risk with prior actions that focus on areas for which the government, under the leadership o f the

                                                        37

MOF, has clearly expressed ownership and already built a good track record o f reforms. This is
evidenced by the overall successful implementation o f the PSIB series, and the completion o f all
reviews under the IMF-supported PRGF program. Improvements in fiduciary standards and budget
implementation were reported in the recent PEFA assessment (Annex 4). In addition, the
arrangements in place for the ARTF and IDA projects (PACBP and PFMRP) provide direct support to
the government's fiduciary systems and contribute to higher fiduciary standards for all government
transactions. Despite these mitigating factors, fiduciary risks remain significant due to the weak
implementation capacity o f the government, amplified by the threat o f corruption. IDA and other
donors are supporting the government's efforts to strengthen its implementation capacity through
investments and technical assistance, which will be closely monitored in consultation with other
donors. Measures to reduce vulnerabilities to corruption with the goal o f increased transparency and
accountability inthe management o f public finances constitute a main theme o f the proposed DPG.

   I. INTRODUCTION

    1. Afghanistan has achieved significant results in the last few years despite a

challenging context. Following the Presidential elections in the late 2004, the new

administration has emphasized the importance o f moving from the concept of post-

conflict emergency management to a more medium-term, sustainable development

framework and increasing Government ownership o f policies. Two decades o f conflict

had reduced physical and social infrastructure to skeletal proportions.       Coherent

Government and administration were non-existent. Social indicators were among the

world's lowest, and simply maintaining security was an immense challenge. This

transition necessitates reorienting efforts from day-to-day management in ministries and

Government agencies to emphasizing forward looking strategies.



   2. Establishing the institutions and processes necessary for a peaceful political

transition has been at the forefront o f the Government's agenda, and in line with

commitments made at the Bonn Conference. Both the presidential and parliamentary

elections (in September 2005) were significant achievements for Afghanistan. The next

elections are planned over the coming year, starting with the President elections this

August. The security situation, however, remains volatile.



   3. The Government o f Afghanistan (GOA) remained committed to rebuilding

economic and financial institutions and implementing sound macroeconomic policies.

Development priorities were first identified in the Interim Afghanistan National

Development Strategy (I-ANDs), which served as the country's interim Poverty

Reduction Strategy Paper.        The I-ANDs was complemented by the Afghanistan

Compact, presented together with I-ANDs to the international community in January

2006. In2008, the Government developed the ANDs which will direct our development

efforts going forward.

                                                                                 Page 3 of 12




    4. Over the past several years, Afghanistan has made significant progress towards

strengthening the foundation for macroeconomic stability. Progress has also beenmade in

the area of political and institutional development which has in turn facilitated strong

economic growth. With political and institutional structures in place, structural reforms

are needed to pave the way for a sound economic environment. The security situation,

however, has hampered the Government's efforts in creating a sound economic

environment in which the private sector can flourish. Building on our gains, the ANDs

submitted to the donor conference held in Paris in June 2008 provides a strategic

medium-termvision to foster sustainable growth, create jobs, and tackle poverty. GDP

per capita has grown progressively from $157 in 1381to a projected $450 in 1388 and is

projected to reach $750 in 1392.


    5. Afghanistan's economy i s characterized by the high dependence on agriculture,

which makes the economy vulnerable to weather-related shocks. Because o f adverse

weather shocks, the agriculture sector has experienced negative growth rates inthe recent

past including for 1387. This ledto a decline inthe overall growth rate.



    6. Real GDP growth in 1386 was 11.5 percent. Available information suggests that

GDP growth will be reduced to about 3.4 percent in 1387 due to a drought-induced

decline inagricultural production. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index for

Kabul, was about 13 percent (period average) in 1386, as a slower increase in rent prices

largely offset a faster rise infood and tremendous increase inenergy prices. The spike in

food prices in 1387 together with significant increases inthe oil prices earlier this year i s

projected to push headline inflation to about 28.2 percent in 1387. However, non-food

inflation i s likely to remain around 10 percent for the year.



    7. Due to limited exposure to foreign capital markets, the recent global financial

crisis i s expected to have little direct impact on the Afghan economy. However, there are

secondary effects from the 2008 economic turbulence. On the positive side, falling oil

and food prices are boosting household spending power; on the negative side, reduced

                                                                                    Annex 1
                                                                                 Page 4 of 12

demand for Afghan exports will hurt the economy, a strengthening dollar will impact the

purchasing power o f non-dollar aid flows, and lower aid pledges as donor Governments

switch expenditures towards their own domestic priorities.



    8. Looking ahead, Afghanistan's medium-term prospects are broadly favorable.

Based on preliminary projections, agricultural growth i s expected to return to its

historical trend, while telecommunications, transport, and trade should continue to

expand at a strong pace, and construction activity should increase steadily, albeit more

slowly than inrecent years. Further growth prospects are predicated on the emergence o f

new economic activities, assuming increased efficiency inthe public sector, the design of

an appropriate regulatory framework for private sector activity, and improvements in

humancapital and infrastructure.



    9. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 7.4 percent in 1388 with a slight slippage

due to the agricultural sector's slowdown in 1389 to reach 7.5 percent and deteriorate

further to 7.1 percent in 1390 and to 6.9 percent in 1392. Assuming world food prices

return to their long-term trend, and continued sound monetary and fiscal policies,

inflation i s expected to decline to 6 percent in 1388. With the projected decline in oil

prices, inflation i s expected to decline further to about 5 percent by 1392. With tight

monetary policy measures, the exchange rate i s expected to remain stable at around the

Afs 52AJS dollar.


Maintenance of Satisfactory Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework

    10. Over the past several years, Afghanistan has made significant progress towards

strengthening the foundation for macroeconomic stability.               The Government's

expenditure programs are planned within a pragmatic and sustainable medium term

macroeconomic and fiscal framework. Enhancing revenue mobilization, which i s part of

this framework, is a necessary condition in order to provide the resources required to

support the implementation o f the ANDS, to fulfill the Millennium Development Goals

and finance the provision o f essential public services and buildthe infrastructurerequired

to sustain pro-poor economic growth. Thus, the need for increased revenue is critical.

                                                                                    Annex 1
                                                                                 Page 5 of 12

Over the past four years, the Government performed well in the collection o f domestic

revenues; however, revenues have not been fully sufficient to cover operating

expenditures. In 1387, we met our revised revenue target, having collected Afs 41.55

billion, a 23 percent increase over 1386. Our target for 1388 i s Afs 51 billion. To

achieve this, we will continue to undertake numerous steps to reform and strengthen tax

policies and administration.



     11. More broadly, we are working to reach fiscal sustainability (i.e., covering

operating expenditures by domestic revenues), but this i s particularly challenging given

increasing security-related costs for the Government. In the shorter term, we are also

working to increase the revenueto GDP ratio to 10%. We currently project this ratio will

reach 9.7% in 1392 and i s likely to exceed 10% in 1393, if our revenue reforms are

successful. Given this commitment, the Government has to make some hard choices in

allocating resources among sectors and budgetary units. The Government's fiscal policy

approach also ensures that our expendituresare aligned with the ANDs priority sectors o f

security, infrastructure, agriculture and rural development, and education. Disciplined

public expenditure management i s a key guiding principle o f GOA, and significant

progress has been made, as evidenced through our improving Public Expenditure and

Financial Accountability (PEFA) scores



     12. The short-term expenditure allocations outlook for 1388 and beyond looks very

challenging and will influence the medium-termfiscal path. The year 1387 saw a series

o f emerging expenditure pressures, which may spill over into the medium-term. The

recent global food price increases and growing shortages of essential commodities are

likely to keep the pressure on the prices o f essential commodities inthe short to medium-

term. The cost o f addressing security concerns continues to escalate. While most o f these

costs are borne by the external budget, decisions to increase the size o f the Afghan

National Army (ANA) to 134,000 by 1389 will substantially augment the size o f the

operating budget.

                                                                                Page 6 of 12

    111.     AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS)


     13. It i s useful to provide some context to our efforts going forward.           The

Government's main strategy, the ANDS, provides a focus for all programs and reforms.

The ANDS, which was submitted to the donor conference held in Paris in June 2008,

provides a strategic medium-term vision to foster sustainable growth, create jobs, and

tackle poverty. As agreed by the Government, MoF i s responsible for coordination o f the

ANDs implementation and the Ministry of Economy is responsible for the monitoring

and evaluation. Based on the ANDs priorities, sectoral strategies have been developed

and the costing process has already been initiated in priority sectors (health, education,

and transport). The costing will enable the line ministries/agencies to align their budget

with ANDs and Afghanistan Compact benchmarks, within the resource envelope. The

Government i s currently putting structures and mechanisms in place for implementing,

monitoring, and reporting on the results o f the ANDS. The budget itselfwill be the main

implementationtool with respect to the ANDS.


IV.     GOA'S       MEDIUM-TERM          STRUCTURAL           REFORM         PROGRAM
SUPPORTED BY THE DPG


     14. The World Bank's        Development Policy Grant (DPG)            reinforces    the

Government's efforts to undertake key reforms, which are necessary for us to move

forward on a range o f programs. The DPG provides an additional time-bound incentive

for some fundamental improvements, including those improving the fiscal and

macroeconomic foundation for our growth and fiscal sustainability.              We have

successfully completed a range o f prior actions under the DPG, on which we can build

for any future World Bank budget support programs.          This discretionary funding is

critical to the Government. The lack o f such funding in 1387 resulted in a draw down o f

cash reserves at Treasury due to budget pressures from external shocks inprevious years

and due to insufficient discretionary resources to react to unexpected budget demands or

to finance any parts o fthe development budget.

                                                                             Page 7 of 12

Improving FiscalPolicy and Planningand Financial Management

    15. As noted above, the Government has maintained a stable macroeconomic

framework.     We recently achieved our revenue target for 1387 and look forward to

making more progress in 1388. As part o f our overall strategy to increase revenue

collection, we have enacted amendments to the Income Tax Law.              These were

successfully enacted in March 2009 in order to simplify the income tax code and move

the business receipt tax (BRT) towards a broad-based goods and services tax.

Specifically, the income tax amendments were focused on achieving two main objectives:

removing "nuisancell taxes and simplifying the income tax regime as it applied to small

businesses; and amending the business receipts tax to move it towards what will later

become a VAT. The amendments are expected to have a positive revenue impact inthat

they includedthe imposition o f BRT on imports (along with its removal from exports), a

withholding tax on contractors which has been extended to private sector contracts, and

an additional personal income tax 2 percent bracket.      The main remaining revenue

reforms are: the drafting o f a new "tax code" for Afghanistan which would comprise 4

separate laws (1388); the establishment o f MTOs in the priority provinces (1388 and

1389); the introduction o f an integrated computer system for tax administration (1389);

and the introduction o f VAT (1390). We believe these changes, along with other reforms

we are undertaking, will enable us to achieve our 1388 revenue target o f Afs 51 billion,

and improve our domestic revenue to GDP ratio.          Our associated objective i s to

increasingly cover our recurrent expenditures with domestic revenue, and make progress

towards the medium-term goal o f fiscal sustainability.



    16. A key instrument in our fiscal planning i s the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework

(MTFF) instrument, first developed in 2005. The MTFF outlines the fiscal frameworks

based on projections for broad fiscal aggregates that are consistent with key

macroeconomic variables and fiscal targets. Broad fiscal aggregates (i.e., revenue and

expenditures) are projected based on macroeconomic variables (i.e., growth and

inflation), donors' pledges and commitments, and policy measures. The adoption o f the

MTFF served as a foundation for confidence in the Government operations and played a

key role inthe Compact Conference inLondon inlate 1385 (2005/06).

                                                                                   Annex 1
                                                                               Page 8 of 12



    17. We have undertaken several actions in order to improve the budget process and

medium-termfiscal planning. First, we revised the 1388 MTFF to include expenditure

estimates based on reasonable approximations o f the mediumterm cost impact o f the pay

and grading (P&G) reforms, security sector expansion, and a range of other government

expenditure policies.   We plan to closely monitor the implementation o f P&G and

regularly update the MTFF with improved projections on the P&G reform

implementation. The most recent MTFF, which covers the period o f 1388-1392,

determines the operating ceilings based upon key underlying assumptions, including that

the operating budget increases year on year broadly in line with inflation.         Other

assumptions are that wages and salaries are indexed with half projected inflation; goods

and services are indexed with full projected inflation; capital i s indexed with projected

nominal GDP growth; and policy reserves plus the contingency fund for emergencies

should not exceed 3 percent o f total line ministries operating budget. Grant levels are

agreed with donors, and debt repayments are estimates for future years. The short-term

outlook for 1388 looks very challenging and that will influence the medium-term

projections. SY1387 saw a series o f emerging expenditure pressures which presented a

major challenge for the maintenance o f the operating budget, and some of these will flow

through into 1388 and beyond. The increases in fuel and food prices look likely to keep

the pressure on in the short to medium-term. The cost o f addressing security concerns

continues to escalate and while most o f these costs are borne on the external budget,

decisions to increase the size o f the Afghan National Army to 134,000 by 1389 (2010/11)

will substantially impact the operating budget.



    18. Second, MoF and IARCSC established a joint technical working group to

continuously monitor the fiscal implications o f P&G reforms and to continuously refine

the cost estimate as ministries complete the re-gradingprocess and start the appointment

process. This group will help MoF project the fiscal impact and implementationprogress

of P&G reform. A revised terms of reference was approved by this working group in

April 2009. Third, the MOF Budget Department has beenreorganized along the ANDs

priority sectors to ensure that the budget becomes an implementation instrument for the

                                                                                Annex I
                                                                             Page 9 of 12

ANDS, and that the ANDs priority sectors are adequately reflected in the budget

structure. We are also focused on ensuring the budget is approved by Cabinet and

Parliamentina timely manner.



     19. With respect to financial management and fiduciary standards, we successfully

enacted amendments to the 2008 Procurement Law to put it in line with Public

Procurement Law (PPL) 2005 and re-distributed the circular that restores ARDS

procurement oversight. We would note the constructivemotivationbehind the changes

o f the PPL 2008; a key objective was to adjust the thresholds upward to speed up the

procurement process, but in the process, some changes unintentionally made

reimbursement for operations and maintenance under the ARTF recurrent window

impossible. However, the Government acknowledged these problems and quickly

resolved them in the recent amendments to the law.       The Government will further

modify the Procurement Law, if required, after discussionswith stakeholders. As note,

the amendments were requiredto address previous revisions that were not in line with

eligibility guidelines for recurrentexpendituresunderthe ARTF recurrent cost window.



StrengtheningPublicAdministrationReformand Sub-NationalAdministration
     20. ProgressinPublic AdministrationReform(PAR) is ongoingandnot as fast as we

mightlike, butwe are makingimprovementincivil servicehumanresource management.

In 1387, the Civil Servant Law with P&G scale was passedby Parliament and enacted.

While implementationof P&G has finally started, there have beensubstantial delays due

to the complexityof this ambitiousundertaking. By now, re-gradinghas beencompleted

infour ministries(MoF, MRRD,MAIL, andMoJ) andis well underwayina fifth (MoE).

Together these add up to roughly 30,000 re-graded positions. The IARCSC is now

movingto the next group ofministries.



     21, We also madeprogressinthe implementationo f the GovernmentVerified Payroll

Program (VPP), which provides assurance that submitted payrolls are supported by

genuine employment contracts, and disbursed to the individual identified by making a

                                                                                    Annex I
                                                                               Page 10 of 12

direct deposit. By end-1387, we increased direct deposits o f payroll under the VPP to

more than 120,000 civil servants.



    22. Our medium-term objectives include for IARCSC to move ahead with the P&G

implementation, which will concern the re-appointment o f civil servants on the re-graded

positions in all Government agencies. The roll-out o f the P&G reform will take place

within the fiscal framework reflected in our MTFF.            In order to facilitate the

implementation o f the new Civil Servant's Law (a prior action for the DPG) we plan on

developing a status report on key regulations and guidelines under the Civil Servants

Law. We also plan to increase the proportion o f civil servants who receive payroll

payments on time and with adequate controls (Le. through direct deposits under the VPP)

to above 1/3 o ftotal number o f civil servants.



    23. The Government has substantial work ahead with respect to pension reforms and

regulations. We seek within the Government agreement on the key features o f a fiscally

feasible pension system inline with the P&G reforms. We are committed to approve the

pension regulations by Cabinet this year, and by HIPC Completion Point, we will have

designed pension reforms for public employees; and initiated the implementation o f a

Government-endorsed pension strategy based on the new pension regulations.           There

was an expectation that we would also work on pension reforms with respect to the

military,butthis is presenting some challenges that we will need to address inthe future.



    24. The Government has initiated reforms in sub-national administration through a

provincial budgetingpilot. With respect to sub-national administration, the Government

has just begun to develop a strategy and while refining this framework, it will draw on

MoF leadership in the area o f fiscal sub-national issues. This effort should make the

budget more effective as a major development tool by ensuring that provinces become

stakeholders in budget preparation, there i s an equitable allocation o f resources across

provinces to facilitate effective service delivery, and to empower provincial authorities.

MoF has now issued a report assessing the pilot, which will help us to develop a MoF

institutional position on sub-national reform.     Our objective i s to better reflect sub-

                                                                                      Annex I
                                                                                 Page 11of 12

national priorities through an improved vertical structure o f sector budget authority, and

establish budget norms for more equitable allocation o f resources across sub-national

units.



    25. We have also extended the Large Tax-Payer Office (LTO) functions to three

provinces (Herat, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif). We are planningto progressively introduce

five new Medium Tax-Payer Offices (MTOs), the first o f which will be Herat, but we

will start MTOs inboth Herat and Balkh provinces in 1388 and inNangarhar, Kandahar

and Kunduz in 1389.          This expansion will help us to develop provincial tax

administration under MoF Revenue Department's 5-year plan, and will yield important

revenue benefits.




IncreasingTransparency and Accountability inPublic Finances
    26. Corruption remains a substantial problem for the Government. It is critical that

we increase transparency and accountability in Government operations to ensure

resources are effectively utilized and to reduce the prospects for and incidences o f

corruption.



    27. With that goal inmind, the Cabinet has announced its commitment to implement

the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Inthe medium-term, miningis

expected to become an important growth sector, generating substantial revenues for the

Government. With new mining operations coming on stream, this initiative will help us

strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability in the extractives

sector. This will help MoF to assess and collect taxes and royalties from mining and

quarry operations. We now needto beginwork to establish an institutional framework o f

the EITI.    We will need to increase accountability and good governance in the

exploitation o f natural resources through the verification and full publication o f company

payments and Government revenues from oil, gas and mining. To achieve these

objectives, we will need substantial funding and technical support from the World Bank

and the international community.

                                                                                  Annex 1
                                                                             Page 12 of 12



     28. Recognizing the need to improve financial accountability, MoF has established a

Fraud Investigation Unit (FIU) and IT Audit Section in the Internal Audit Department

(IAD). Developing the capacity to undertake this important investigative and auditing

work ina thorough manner, including follow-up, will be a challenge. Going forward, our

objectives are to ensure the FIU and the IT Audit Section in the IAD are instituted and

fully functional; that MOF IAD has Government-wide internal audit purview; and that

there i s adequate transparency, reliability and timeliness o f GOAfinances and financial

information, including regular audits o f the AFMIS system.


     V. CONCLUSION


     29. The Government i s committed to continue reforms intended to improve

institutions o f core governance, in particular to consolidate achievements in public

financial management and public administration reform and support increased

transparency and accountability inpublic finances. We are confident o f the sustainability

o f these reforms despite the challenging environment approaching elections and we will

continue to make progress inour development reform agenda. The World Bank support,

which remains critical at this stage in our development, will enhance our ability to keep

the momentum ofthese essential reforms, which benefit all our citizens.

              RELATIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
                                           (As of April27,2009)

The IMF became involved in Afghanistan in 2002, sending staff teams to help rebuild key
economic institutions and advise the government on economic policies and reforms. The
relationship strengthened in 2004 with a Staff Monitored Program and later in 2006 with a full
fledged three program supported by the Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).'

The PRGF-supported program for Afghanistan-amounting             to SDR81.O million (50 percent o f
quota)-aims     to address poverty, unsustainable public finances, and weak governance through
policies to lower inflation, raise domestic revenues, prioritize public spending, increase
transparency and accountability, and reform key public enterprises.

Duringthe first two years o fthe program growth averaged about 10 percent per annum, although
this fell to about 3 percent in the 2008/09 fiscal year (which runs through March) because of a
drought. Inflation ranged from 5 percent in 2006/07 to over 25 percent in 2008/09 (because o f the
surge in international food and fuel prices). Growth is expected to recover in the coming year
while inflation is expected to fall to 6 percent or less in2009/10.

One area where performance has been disappointing is in raising domestic revenue. Revenue has
been stuck at between 6% and 7% percent o f GDP for several years, and this i s one o f the lowest
ratios inthe world. With total spending in excess o f 20 percent o f GDP, the gap has to be covered
by donors.

There has been considerable progress under the program across a broad range o f objectives.
However, the deteriorating security situation over the past two years has resulted in the loss o f
control over large parts o f the country, facilitated the expansion o f illicit poppy cultivation,
encouraged corruption, and eroded political support for the government. This has slowed
implementation o f the economic reform agenda and, by undermining revenue collection, i s
beginningto compromise macroeconomic stability.

Donors, already strained by the global economic downturn, are increasingly concerned. Focusing
on the program's weakest links-revenues         and state-owned enterprises-the    government's efforts
in the period ahead should concentrate on strengthening governance in customs and tax
administration, modernizing indirect taxation, and tightening controls o f key public enterprises.
Much also depends on an improvement inthe security situation.


The IMF technical assistance for Afghanistan focuses on developing monetary instruments,
strengthening the central bank and banking supervision, modernizing foreign exchange
regulations, reforming tax and customs administration, enhancing public financial management,
and improving macroeconomic and financial data.




I The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. Loans under the PRGF carry an
annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, with repayments made semiannually, beginning 5% years and ending 10
years after the disbursement.

Discussions on the Fifth Review of the program were held in Kabul in December 2008 and
January-February    2009. The IMF Executive Board of Directors concluded the FirthReview on
April 22, 2009. While the original PRGF arrangement was planned to expire in June 2009, the
Executive Board o f Directors extendedthe program on April 22, 2009 until March 2010 to allow
more time to implement pending reforms. Satisfactory performance under the program will also
facilitate completion of debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative. The fifth
review enabledthe releaseof an amount equivalent to SDR 11.3 million (about US$17.1 million),
which will bring total disbursements under the program to SDR 69.7 million (about US$105.4
million).

                                          PERFORMANCE OF
              AFGHANISTAN'S PUBLIC FINANCEMANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1.     This annex is the executive summary o f the Public Financial Management (PFM)
Performance Assessment for Afghanistan prepared as part o f the Public Finance Management
Review undertaken by the World Bank and UK Department for International Development in
close cooperation with the Government o f Afghanistan and various external partners in 2008. It
is based on a performance measurement framework developed by the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) partnership program2which identifies a set o f critical objectives
of a PFM system and a standard set o f high-level PFM indicators to assess performance against
those objectives.     The methodology provides a consistent framework for analysis and a
monitoring tool for the Government to manage reform and demonstrate progress to domestic and
international stakeholders.

2.     The situation inAfghanistanhas some special features which needto be kept inmindwhen
interpreting the ratings. First, some ratings reflect temporary factors (for instance, until recently,
the absence of a Parliament). Second, some ratings are based on changes made recently, and it is
                                 '

still uncertain whether these changes will be sustained.              Third, the ratings assess the current
situation in which significant external support (both advisory and operational) is being provided
to the Government; in several areas, this raises sustainability issues as the external support will
have to be reduced over time, especially inrelation to financial management operations.

3.     Public financial management in Afghanistan as depicted through the PFM Performance
Indicators as o f December 2007 is summarized below, under six critical attributes o f a public
financial management system and is outlined inthe attached table.


Credibilityof the Budget (Performance Indicators1-4)
Theseindicators measure whether the budget is realistic and is implementedas intended.
4.     Strong revenue performance in the past few years and donor support to operating
expenditures through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and Law and Order
Trust Fund (LOTFA) have enabled the government to maintain budgeted operational
expenditures (about 60 percent o f which i s salaries and wages). The centralized nature o f
payment controls prevents a build-up o f arrears, although Afghanistan has not yet established an
arrears monitoring mechanism. By contrast, the credibility of the budget is hampered by the
existence o f a significant volume o f reserve funds in the budget, which affects outcomes in terms
o f expenditure composition as compared to the budget targets. More importantly, the sizable gap
between the budgeted and actual core development expenditures is o f significant concern. The
gap mainly attributes to a lack o f realism at the budget formulation stage and limited capacity to
implement the budget.

Comprehensivenessand Transparency (Performance Indicators5-10)
These indicators measure whether the budget andfiscal risk oversight are compreherrsiveand
whetherfiscal and budget information is accessibletopublic.

5,     Significant progress has been made in improving transparency and comprehensiveness,
although some weaknesses remain. The government has developed a robust classification system
which to some extent facilitates the tracking o f expenditures on organizational, economic and

                                                                                           Annex 4
                                                                                        Page 2 of 5

functional, and program basis. However, the Chart o f Accounts needs to be further developed
and amended to support and facilitate program budgeting. The government is committed to share
budgetary information transparently, and the annual budget documentation has been improved in
terms o f quality and comprehensiveness.      The extent o f unreported government operations in
terms o f extra-budgetary funds appears to be very low, and all donor funding to the Core Budget
i s included in fiscal reports. Municipalities, which are fiscally autonomous from the national
government, report on their fiscal and financial status on an annual basis, although information is
currently not being fully consolidated or reported. Fiscal risk oversight o f the commercial
activities o f the government, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state corporations, i s
lacking due to low reporting compliance and quality, requiring urgent action. Public access to
fiscal information has improved but needs further attention to ensure full transparency for the
public, especially with regard to audit reports.

Policy BasedBudgeting(Performance Indicators 11-12)
These indicators measure whether the budget is prepared with due regard to government
policy.
6.     Progress has been made in planning and organizing the annual budget process with a longer
and more realistic budget formulation schedule as well as political guidance needed to ensure
strategic prioritization in the resource allocation process. The Cabinet approved a rough inter-
sectoral prioritization o f the ANDS, which is planned to be integrated in the budget process
beginning in 2009/10 (SY1388). Further initiatives are needed to ensure the successful
implementation o f program budgeting in additional ministries during the coming years. The
budget approval process o f the National Assembly has been greatly improved, and the 2008/09
budget was approved by parliamentbefore the start o f the fiscal year.

7.     The multi-year perspective o f the budget process has been enhanced since 2005 with the
linking o f budget and national strategy and regular updating o f the Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework (MTFF), which is gradually emerging as a multi-year budgeting framework through
the estimation o f budget ceilings. Debt sustainability analyses have been undertaken annually by
the IMF and the World Bank for the past three years, but the Ministry o f Finance needs to
develop its capacity in this area. Three sector strategies are being costed, and additional sectors
are planned to be costed in 2008/09 (SY1387). However, linkages between investment budgets
and forward expenditure estimates generally remain very weak and need to be strengthened inthe
interest o f future fiscal sustainability.

Predictabilityand ControlinBudget Execution(Indicators13-21)
These indicators measure whether the budget is implemented in an, orderly and predictable
manner and there are arrangementsfor the exercise of control and stewardship in the use of
publicfunds.
8.     Budget predictability has been greatly improved both for revenues and expenditures, while
budget control has room for further improvement. On the revenue side, the income tax law
(November 2005) provides clarity on tax liabilities and procedures, although enforcement
remains a concern.      The establishment o f the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO) in 2004 and its
operationalization are important steps to improve enforcement.             On the expenditure side,
predictability o f funds availability has improved through better cash flow forecasts where there
has been improved information on actual cash balances and commitments.

9.     However, and despite the improvements in most indicators, there has been no progress on
internal audit, except in the Ministry o f Finance. Internal audit is operational for most national
government entities but, except in the Ministry o f Finance, this work is not done to any
recognized professional standard, and there is little follow-up o f audit recommendations.

                                                                                              Annex 4
                                                                                           Page 3 of 5

Accountability,Recordingand Reporting(Indicators22-25)
These indicators measure whether adequate records and information are produced,
maintained, and disseminated for purposes of decision-making, control, management, and
reporting on operations.
10.    Progress has been made in improving these indicators since 2005. Reconciliation o f bank
and advance accounts is regularly conducted at least on a quarterly basis, within four weeks after
the end ofthe month. The Treasury Department has established and implementeda procedure by
which advances and suspense accounts are cleared at least annually.                The computerized
Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) enables the Ministry o f
Finance to produce monthly reports (which are put on their website) within a month.                 A
consolidated government statement is prepared annually with a complete set o f information. This
i s sent to the President's office within six months of the fiscal year end. Despite good information
on Core Budget execution, data are not specifically collected on resources utilized for service
delivery. Also, AFMIS does not recordheport commitments.


ExternalScrutinyand Audit (Indicators27-28)
These indicators assess the arrangementsfor scrutiny of publicJinances andfollow up by the
executive.
11.    With the enactment o f the PFEM Law in July 2005 and the subsequent formation o f the
National Assembly, the legislature started its involvement in budget scrutiny. The PFEM Law
provides clear rules such as for budget amendments within the financial year. Nevertheless, the
legislature's procedures for scrutiny are rather weak and need to be documented and formalized.
Also, legislative scrutiny o f audit reports needs to extend beyond the review o f only the audit o f
the traditional accounts (Qatia). Currently, over 50 percent o f expenditures are audited annually
and reports are issued within 12 months o f year-end with significant issues being identified.
However, there has been no significant improvement on the quality o f review from the 2005
Assessment.


DonorPractices (Donor PracticesIndicators1-3)
12.    Afghanistan's great reliance on donor financing requires means that donor practices are
very important for P F M and development performance. Actual budget support reached at least
90 percent o f budgeted figures in two o f the last three years, and quarterly disbursements do not
deviate from the original disbursements schedule. The Aid Coordination Unit (ACU) o f the
Ministryo fFinance now plays a bigger role incollectingfinancial information from donors. The
A C U has initiated a "donor financial review" in late 2007, which will enable the Ministry o f
Finance to acquire forward looking informationfor the next five years.

13.    However, the continuing pattern whereby most aid funds do not go through the national
budget and PFM procedures hampers fiscal policy as the government has limited control o f the
related expenditure. Furthermore, donor practices need be improved to support properly and
correspond to a reasonable extent with the budget process o f the national government, especially
with regard to the Development Budget which in past years has been finalized very late in the
process, due among other reasons to a lack o f timely communication from some donors with
regard to their spending priorities.

                                                                                        Page 4 of 5

Conclusion and Impact on development outcomes
14.   This report depicts significant positive developments in Afghanistan's PFM system since
the 2005 PEFA-based P F M review. The comparison with other countries shows that the PFM
system in Afghanistan performs relatively well. Nevertheless, a number o f weaknesses exist
which must be addressed, including areas where progress in improving the P F M system and
processes has been slow. Additional improvements in the following areas would contribute to
further improving future PEFA ratings:

    Credibility of the Budget: The gap between budget and realization remains substantial
    especially for core development expenditures, although there has been an improvement in
    recent years. Measures for further improvement would include, first, further strengthening
    the link between the annual budget and MTFF. This includes, for example, systematically
    estimating future recurrent costs implications o f investments. Second, there needs to be a
    proper link between the ANDs and fiscal policy.
    PFMcapacity outsidethe Ministry of Finance:Capacity development in line ministries, as
    executing agencies o f expenditures, i s critical. Compared with the progress inthe Ministry o f
    Finance, developments in most line ministries lag behind. For example, cash management
    and payment scheduling procedures in line ministries have not improved.           Capacity of
    internal audit in line ministries should be developed.      Also, capacity building on public
    procurement (now underway) should be accelerated so that line ministries can progressively
    take greater responsibility for procurement activities.
    Comprehensiveness,transparency,accounting, and reporting: The centralized nature o f
    Afghanistan's fiscal system has helped to prevent exposure to significant contingent
    liabilities. However, in order to mitigate future fiscal risks, accounting and reporting o f the
    State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and municipalities should be strengthened through
    developing their capacities.     Related to this, the monitoring o f the stock o f expenditure
    payment arrears should be improved.
    Internal and external audit: PEFA ratings related to audits remain low. Although
    internal audit is operating in most o f the government entities, the work does not yet meet
    recognized professional standards, especially in line ministries. In addition to in-house
    training in the ministries, formal academic/professional training in auditing should be made
    available for staff in internal audit departments. Also, most internal audit manuals are very
    outdated and need to be revised based on modern internal audit practices that also take into
    account the current context in Afghanistan. Likewise, capacity for external audit needs to be
    further developed along with a revised legal foundation based on international standards.
    However, the Audit Law is not yet in effect. Acceleration o f the accounting and auditing
    certification process for all professional staff is commendable.

Planned update
15.   The Government and its international partners intend to update this assessment during the
2009/10 fiscal year.
