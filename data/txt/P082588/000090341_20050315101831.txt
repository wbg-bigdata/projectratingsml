A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE
1. CountryandSector Issues
Overview
Peru is a lower-middle-income country in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, with a per
capita gross national income (GNI) of US$2,150 (income category 111), making it eligible for a World
Bank loan. Despite experiencing significant positive growth in recent years, and having the highest
growth potential in the subregion, per capita GDP and poverty rates show little progress due to lack of
employment creation. Deep inequalities of wealth and well-being persist. The national poverty rate,
according to 2003 estimates, was 49 percent (Annex 14), an increase from 42.7 percent in 1997. Thirty
percent of Peru's population lives in rural areas, three-quarters of which are categorized as poor' (living
on less than US$2 a day), and one-half of which is categorized as extremely poor (living on less than
US$1 a day). This poverty i s most pronounced in the highlands (sierra) and the jungle (selva), where
poverty rates are nearly double that of the coast. Agricultural research capacity i s an important factor in
reducingpoverty by building food security and economic stability while a well-developed agricultural
innovation system with sound policies for efficient and effective functioning are important prerequisites
for dissemination and adoption of new innovations.

Government Strategy
According to the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the current Government of Peru's (GOP's)
development strategy to address the issue of poverty has three main objectives: (a) increased
competitiveness of the private sector and employment generation; (b) equity, and social justice - to
provide access to quality health, education, cultural, and basic services; and (c) institutionalization of
public sector democracy, and creating an efficient, transparent, decentralized state. Due to the high
monetary indebtedness of the Peruvian public and private sectors, the GOP, through World Bank
assistance, is attempting to strengthen the fiscal balances through controls on expenditure, improved debt
management, increased tax collection, and initiation of a national competitiveness program to address
barriers to private sector growth and increasing exports. The Bank's assistance i s directed at moderating
the overall decline in public sector funding of agricultural research, stimulating private sector funding of
the transfer of agricultural technology, and strengthening institutions. The presence of a strong economic
program and institutional infrastructure i s essential to reduce the detrimental effects of periodic economic
shocks on poverty reduction gains due to tactical investments on programs and projects related to
agricultural productivity.
As most recently articulated in the revised "Policy Letter" (Annex 15), the strategy describes the
following issues: (a) the role of the State in institutional modernization of science, technology, and
innovation inthe agrarian sector; (b) the challenges for improved competitiveness of Peruvian agriculture
inglobalization; (c) the long-termobjectives of the programand Government's commitments with respect
to institutional reforms, policies, and financing; (d) the achievements of the Program so far and the
proposal for the Phase I1Project; and (e) The Phase I1project proposal and triggers for Phase 111.

Agricultural Sector Issues
Agriculture plays a dominant role in the Peruvian economy. About 80 percent of the rural poor are
employed in agriculture and fishing. Rural poverty i s closely associated with low agncultural
productivity. Over the past several years, government policies have led to an opening of the economy,
thereby increasing pressure on the agricultural sector to be more competitive. The need to improve
competitiveness will be further increased with the finalization of trade agreements with the United States,


IIncomparison, a householdi s also definedas poor when per capita consumptionis lower than the cost of a minimumbasket of
goods and services and extremely poor when per capita consumption is lower than the cost of a minimum basket of food
necessary to maintainadequate caloric intake.


                                                           1

the European Commission, and MERCOSUR. These agreements will have immediate implications for
the development and strengthening of science, technology, and innovation policies, the level of public
investment required, research orientation, the intellectual property environment that would influence
incentives for the private sector in innovation, and the rules and regulations that affect commerce. Such
new demands on the technological competitiveness of the country pose new challenges that must be
addressedby the program (described in detail inAnnex 1).
In this regard, the public sector has a clear role in enabling and supporting the development of an
innovation system that i s characterized by institutional diversity, and that would generate the required
scientific knowledge and information appropriate to the demands of the sector. The centralization and
lack of competency to implement technology transfer and quality extension services and to identify the
bottlenecks in information systems for innovation are the leading challenges to technological
development, especially at the regional level. The institutional changes that have taken place in the last
few years are driven by an increasing awareness of a demand structured around several dimensions
requiring a more open, decentralized, and demand-oriented National Agricultural Innovation System
(NAIS). The supply system also needs to be multidimensional, specialized, and well coordinated to
ensure appropriate allocation of scarce public resources to high-priority issues and areas. This calls for
better orchestration of the NAIS to facilitate the involvement of a large number of actors, and the efficient
implementation of policies, financing, and implementation of research and extension by the various
specialized institutions.
The NAIS has had difficulties in adjusting to these new demands. Deficiencies still exist in the areas of
research, extension, and education capacities among public and private sector partners. This Adaptable
Program Loan (APL)addresses a range of issues in the NAIS. The Program i s justified since it aims to
create new opportunities and increaseagricultural competitiveness by improving innovations arisingfrom
new knowledge. Phase Iof the loan now in place has assisted the GOP in supporting reforms in this
subsector.    The institutional changes brought about through Phase I indicate the existence of a
multidimensional demand for innovation. The supply side i s also shown to be multidimensional. This
situation implies a larger window of opportunity for the reorganizationof the NAIS with the objective of
facilitating multi-actor participation and institutional specialization.   The scope of this framework,
consisting of policies and priorities, investments, and research and extension, thus requires different
disciplines, instruments, variety of inputs, and distinct mandates.
The Phase I1Project loan is expected to deepen these reforms led by the Peruvian private sector, and to
improve public sector management, while giving continued attention to social demands such as the
inclusion of indigenous populations and rural women. A substantial portion of the rural communities
living in geographically dispersed areas lacks appropriate knowledge, experience, and skills required to
become members of modernized and efficient farms and agribusinesses. To assure the participation of
traditionally excluded sectors of the population, such as indigenous populations (representing 15 percent
of the population of Peru) and rural women in general, special efforts have been made to target
investments and to ensure their active participation in the modernization efforts. For example, in Phase I,
a pilot study developed with rural communities in Huancavelica demonstrated the existence of the
demand for innovation services in certain population segments, and the need for assistance with specific
instruments. The competitive grants program, which was the instrument of choice and is successfully
being implemented in Peru, will have various subcomponents to address specific challenges posed by
various populations segments, and to integrate the urgent need to link the extension technology transfer
with adaptive and strategic research, education, mechanisms for improved information flow, and
agribusiness management skills.
The third phase of the program would consolidate systems for policy, regulation, operation and financing
of a pluralistic agricultural technology system. The system would be based on institutional pluralism both
inimplementation and financing. Farmers and other stakeholders would havean increasedparticipation in
the governance of the system. Strategic national research programs would be generating information and


                                                       2

technologies to support adaptive research and extension programs. Agricultural training institutions and
information systems would effectively support the sector technology programs. Competitive allocation of
resources would be central to financing strategies. Inthis way, Peru's agricultural researchand extension
system would evolve with a mix of public and private funding. A permanent Focal Point within the
Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for policy, regulation, public financing and international
cooperation for agricultural technology programs.
The main results from Phase Ihave been the high degree of private group participation -- 86 private
groups participating in the implementation of subprojects, as well as the magnitude and plurality of
institutional involvement -- 200 institutions either as partners or associates are participating in the project.
Over 11,000 beneficiaries (clientes) have benefited from the Phase Iproject out of which 94% are small
producers who are organized in more than 300 associations. The project has leveraged additional
resources -- out of US$12.8 million committed for executing subprojects, 49.6% was co-financed, i.e.,
31.3% of the original target of 12% and the project has established its presence in three macro-regions
and is also operating intwo additionalregions.
With support of the project's decentralized offices, subprojects selection and preparation were conducted
with the full participation of beneficiaries and reflected the expressed demand of producers at local level.
One hundred demand-driven subprojects that were financed by INCAGRO are composed of adaptive
research (24), extension services (33), strategic research (28) and training (capacity building) or research
(16). The 100 subprojects were selected from 1017 proposals (an approval rate of about 10%) This large
number in the list of possible subprojects testifies to the fact that there i s no shortage of proposals both in
number and sub-sectoral composition.
There are also initiatives under implementation to strengthening the full chain of agricultural production
and marketing, especially export markets. The project i s supporting several agro-business initiatives --
some are now exporting their products directly to foreign markets. Other subprojects, such as organic
coffee, are in the process of certifying their products to export directly to foreign markets. There have
also been good results in the livestock area and these will be further assessed when impact evaluation i s
completed.
Reflecting the project's aim of establishing a pluralistic agricultural extension service and technology
generation system, the subprojects are being executed by producers, service providers, private sector
collaborators, and research institutions (including the National Institute for Agricultural Research and
Extension INEA, Research Institute for Peruvian Amazon--IIAP, among others). Some subprojects also
have established partnerships with internationalinstitutions and universities and research institutions from
other countries. This achievement bodes well towards establishing a pluralistic agricultural innovation
and service provision system.
Finally, the project has strengthened the idea that private sector led agricultural innovation system is
feasible. The project has also demonstrated that the public and private sector can collaboratively work
towards improving the agricultural innovation system. In some Regions there are strong collaborations
among all stakeholders in the agricultural sector. According to the extemal review conducted in July
2003, 90% of subprojects are assessed as satisfactory and, in general, the project is on its way to reaching
the triggers established for the initiation of the second phase of the project. The successful achievement
of the PDO augurs well for the second phase of the program aimed at increasing the productivity and
competitiveness of the Peruvian agricultural sector.
In response to the demands for greater local control and full participation, increased political,
administrative, and fiscal decentralization have been designed and implemented by the GOP. InPhase I,
a strategy of a gradual process of decentralization was adopted, and will be extended to the whole country
inPhase 11. The institutional sustainability of such regionalagricultural development activities is an issue
that requires certain preconditions by the regional authorities to ensure opportunities for greater
participation of civic society.     These preconditions include resource availability, current levels of

competence at the regional level, availability of communications facilities, and upgrading of essential
infrastructure.
2. Rationale for Bank Involvement
Relevant Policies and Commitment of the Government
The project, "Research and Agricultural Extension for the Innovation and Competitiveness of Peruvian
Agriculture," is Phase I1of an "APL", which was based on an agriculture sector strategy outlined in a
Policy Letter signed October 25, 1999 by the GOP that emphasized the central role of innovation in
fulfilling its sectoral objectives. That Policy Letter recognized the complementary roles of the public and
private sectors in achieving the stated objectives of the strategy. The Government's commitment to the
strategy outlined in the Policy Letter was illustrated by the successful implementation of Phase Iof the
program, begun in January 2001. The APL program received strong support from the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Despite the substantial progress achieved in the APL
first Phase, there remains a significant unfinished APL agenda.              The Government's continued
commitment to the strategy i s outlined in the new Policy Letter (Annex 15). Public institutions would
play an important role in defining and implementing strategic and regulatory elements of the innovation
system related to the agricultural sector. The focus of this Project on private-sector-led innovation as a
means to enhance competitiveness and reduce rural poverty follows logically from the earlier stated
Government strategy.       Recognizing the need for high-quality agricultural services to improve the
competitiveness and sustainability of the rural agricultural sectoral capacity, the Government included
this project in the World Bank's Peru CAS for FY2003-07 (approved in August 2002 and updated in
2004), and a Program Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant was used for project preparation.
However, the Loan for Phase I1 has since been downsized to US$25m from the original amount of
US$SOmthat was proposed at the beginning of Phase I.       The reasons for such a reduction were the limited
fiscal space allotted in the national budget and the limitations of indebtedness allotted to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
Comparative Advantage of the Bank
Because of the Bank's involvement in the initial design phase of this APL, it i s seen as a long-term
strategic partner in the agricultural innovation system in Peru, and therefore has a comparative advantage
incontinuingits support of this endeavor. The Bank can capitalize on the lessonslearnedfrom Phase 1of
the project, and those from similar Bank-supported projects in other countries in the LAC region and
elsewhere. The Bank has considerable experience in the design and implementation of agricultural
researchand extension projects in Indiaand Kenya, and in other countries in the region such as Colombia,
Ecuador, Mexico, and Venezuela. The Bank has long been viewed as a world leader in financing and
policy support to agricultural research and development (R&D), at both the country level and
internationally (through its support to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
[CGIAR]). The Bank's support to the agriculture sector i s partly responsible for the observed increase in
agricultural output in Peru, where the agricultural production index rose from 121 (1990-99) to 170
(2000-02), using 100 as the base in 1989-91. The Project follows new innovative approaches to lending
for agriculture by the Bank that are characterized by the increased role of the private sector and rural
communities, diversification of supply, diversification of funding, and institutional specialization.

Portfolio of Projects in the Rural Agricultural Sector
Inthe last two decades the Bank has assistedPeru with a number of projects relevant to the ruralagrarian
sector (Annex 2). The Bank programfor FY2002-06 has three maincomponents: (1) to create conditions
to increase economic competitiveness and productivity; (2) to improve social policy efficiency; and (3) to
create a modern, decentralized, efficient state at the service of the people. Currently, all loans in the Peru
portfolio are focused on poverty alleviation. Projects specifically targeted to rural sector poverty include:
(a) FY2003 -rural water and sanitation (US$50 million) and rural education and teacher development



                                                       4

APL (US$52.5 million); and (b) FY2004 -agricultural researchand extension APL Phase I1(US$25.0
million), and Sierra rural development (US$20 million pipeline project).
The portfolio of projects active in the rural sector of Peru and funded by various other donors (listed in
Annex 2) illustrates the active nature of the donor community in assisting the Peruvian economy. The
total investment (US$430.66 million from donors) in agriculture between 1996 and 2005, and for projects
implemented through the MOA, is US$578.48 million, of which US$147.82 million i s counterpart
funding.

3. Higher-LevelObjectivesto Whichthe ProjectContributes
Alignment with CAS
This Project strongly supports the World Bank Group's assistance strategy for Bank borrowers, and is
included in the Bank's lending program for Peru as stated in the CAS, while falling within agricultural
extension and research, the largest sector of lendingto agriculture by the Bank. It contributes to the three
central objectives of the CAS, and to the GOP's strategy o f (i)generating competitiveness and
employment, (iij equality and social justice, and (iii) creation of an efficient state that i s transparent and
decentralized, by improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector and the creation of a
decentralized agricultural innovation system. Equity issues related to empowerment and inclusion of
marginalized groups would be dealt with in various ways, including the continuation of the special fund
for indigenous peoples and women in this project. The Project would also support the Government's
efforts to decentralize the agricultural service sector in the country, and ensure delivery of efficient
services in poverty-ridden rural areas. Overall, the Project would help Peru improve the productivity and
quality of agri-based food products, improve and modernize post-harvest processing, and increase the
efficiency of farm-to-market food chains, leading to increased income and sustainable development
within the framework of environmental and natural resource protection and other safeguards.
Alignment with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
The rural commitment of the APL program in general, and the Phase I1Project in particular, i s well
aligned with the Bank's MDGs for 2015, largely inthe area of eradication of extreme poverty and hunger,
and to a lesser extent to ensure environmental sustainability and to establish a global partnership for
development.      The Project would focus on improving economic opportunities for and removing
constraints on rural poor households, and address some of the issues related to agricultural employment
driven by innovations as a risk-diversification strategy and an escape from poverty.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION
1. LendingInstrument
Phase I1of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL)of US$25.0 million will finance the Project. This lending
instrument was selected based on the needs of the GOP as described earlier to invest in the agricultural
sector. At the initiation of the program, an APL was chosen over that of a specific investment loan (SIL)
for the following reasons: (a) institutional development of innovation systems, and agricultural R&D
itself, are long-term processes that require stable support over many years; (b) the institutions involved
require time to develop strategies, capacities, and alliances, and financing must adapt to institutional
needs as they evolve; and (c) the decentralized provision of demand-driven and co-financed services
represents a fundamental change in the Peruvianinnovation systems, and requires a period of learning and
of adjustment of program strategies as they are developed.             Phase Iexperience has shown that
implementation strategies and institutional needs do change over time, and financing has to be sufficiently
flexible to respond adequately to these changes; and (d) in light of the long period required to succeed
with reforms in the agricultural sector in general, and more specifically in innovations, it i s logical to
separate the loan credit period into three distinct phases, with identifiable triggers.

2. Project Objective and Phases
Program Development Objective
The developmental objective of the Program (up to 12 years and a total projected APL loan of US$
90.87million) is to contribute to the sustainable development of a plural, decentralized, rural-agrarian
system of technological innovation, guided by demand, and led and disseminated by the private sector,
with the purpose of increasing the productivity,and competitiveness of the agricultural sector through the
generation and adoption of environmentally soundtechnologies.
Inthedesignofthe program, consideration was given to supportingacentralized, public system, as inthe
past, or providing all support through the private sector. In line with stakeholder views in Peru at the
time, and consistent with evolving experiences, it was decided to support the development of a
decentralized and demand-driven system that would be co-financed by users and private partners
representing civic society.
The execution of the APL Program was designed to be implemented in three phases: (1) Phase I(IBRD
loan of 9.6 US$ million), of three-years' duration, for the establishment of a Technological Innovation
System, (2) Phase I1(proposed IBRD loan of 25.0 US$ million), of four years' duration, for the scaling
up of the system to cover all regions, and (3) Phase 111(projected IBRDloan of 56.1 US$ million), of five
years' duration, for the consolidation of the system. The total Loan amount for the three periods of the
APL will be reduced to US$9lmfrom the original estimated amount of US$116mbecauseof the present
limitations of fiscal space and the level of indebtedness allotted to the Ministry of Agriculture affecting
Phase I1of the project. The Phase I,            which was concentrated in three regions and expanded to five, has
shown that development of an innovation system with these characteristics i s feasible in Peru, and that
there i s sufficient supply and demand for the types of services beingfinanced by the Project. InPhase 11,
the Project would continue to pursue the objective of expanding the Program scope to all regions of Peru.
This broader scaling up is particularly timely within the context of the recent decentralization (in Peru).
The APL instrument implies the execution of triggers or measures of Project implementation progress,
and meeting its preset obligations in each of the phases before passing to the approval and execution of
the following phase. An External Evaluation Mission reviewed Phase Iadvances, with the specific
mission of verifying whether the triggers had beenreached.
Status of Completionof Triggersof Phase I
Triggers for the initiation of Phase I1were based on the results of an External Review (ER) after 30
months from the date of effectiveness, in July 2003. A team of four independent specialists, with
expertise in agricultural economics, agricultural research, agricultural extension, and project
administration carried out the review. The specific triggers2 for continuing with Phase I1 were: (a)
determination by the ER team that the competitive extension and adaptive research grants program is
operating effectively in three regions, and that at least 75 percent of ongoing subprojects3 had a
satisfactory rating; (b) evidence from the Project-monitoring data and confirmation by the ER team that
the private sector and other stakeholders are co-financing at least 15 percent of adaptive research and
extension subproject costs; (c) determination by the ER team that the Project has a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation system that produces timely information necessary for program management
and evaluation; (d) presentation of priorities for a program of competitive grants to support program
development in strategic research, information, and extension service support programs; and (e) approval

 PAD Phase I,pp. 7-8.
  The term subproject is used to refer to the group of activities that the Proyecto de Investigacidn y Extensidn Agricdla para la
Innovacidn y Competitividad del Agro Peruano (INCAGRO) co-financed with producer organizations that are in strategic
alliance with services suppliers and other collaborators.


                                                                 6

of a strategic plan for the Znstituto Nucionul de Znvestigacibn y Extensidn Agruriu (WIEA), detailing
priorities, activities, and financing.
Of the five triggers agreed on as stated above for initiation of Phase 11, three have been successfully
completed. A fourth (the development of plans for strategic research programs) was partially completed
(three research areas advanced and three others in progress). The reason for the partial completion of this
trigger i s that the amount of work and planning required in producing quality plans was beyond the
capacity of the small unit assigned to this task. However, the work has advanced sufficiently to ensure
that it will be continued into Phase 11. WIEA's Strategic Plan, the fifth trigger, has also been completed,
though it i s not of sufficient quality to merit approval. Nevertheless, since INIEA continues to be
financed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Bank will maintain its dialogue with the Government over
this phase of the program to promote a reform of WIEA that will ensure its proper role as a publicly
financed institution in a modem and pluralistic innovation system. The Govemment has committed inthe
Policy Letter to support an INIEA that is specialized in the execution of researchand technology transfer,
and which would concentrate its resources in a number of strategic programs that are of a strong public
good nature. This would also require that the Ministry of Agriculture would support these strategic
programs. If these conditions are met, the Project through its Strategic Services Development Fund
(FDSE) could co-finance subprojects within these strategic programs.            Given the importance of
smallholder agriculture and its inherent problems, the Project has a special interest in financing such a
strategic program to address these problems for which WIEA i s well positioned to implement, given its
presencein various eco-regions of the country.
Specific Triggersfor Initiation of Phase 111
The specific triggers for the initiation of Phase 111 would be: (a) Establishment of an Agricultural
Technology Focal Point (ATFP) within the MOA, that would be responsible for regulation, priority
setting, and public financing of agricultural technology programs as well as a framework on intellectual
property rights; (b) Positive evaluation of the formation and implementation of action plans of the Macro
Regional Consultative Councils with the participation of the representatives of Regional Governments,
institutions of development, and producers organizations; (c) Positive evaluation of the implementation of
the competitive grants program for extension and adaptive research in all regions and in at least 75
percent of the subprojects; (d) Positive evaluation of strategic research programs in at least three strategic
areas including various product chains implemented in centers of excellence; (e) strategic alliances
formed by public and private sector agents and other stakeholders are co-financing (in monetary terms) at
least 30 percent of adaptive research and extension subproject costs and at least 10 percent in strategic
subprojects.
3. Project Development Objective and Key Indicators
Project Development Objective, Phase II (2005-2009)
The overall objective of Phase I1 i s to contribute to the expansion, strengthening, and institutional
development of the rural agricultural technology and innovation system so it is pluralistic, decentralized,
demand driven, and led by the private sector.          During Phase 11, the project will also establish a
Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point within the M O A that will be responsible for policy
formulation and coordination of public investments, which will contribute to the sustainability of the
agricultural innovation system.
Key Performance Indicators of Phase 11
The overall impact4 of the Phase I1 Project would be evaluated using the following seven key
performance indicators: (i)46,000 producers (direct participants, female and indigenous participants)
participating in extension and adaptive research subprojects with an average of 25% of co-financing

  ~~



  The statedindicators may be refined during midtermreview (December 2006).

Additional performance indicators will be: (a) 28 extension service programs implemented; (b) 9 graduate
degree and sabbatical programs in priority areas co-financed; (c) A web-based information system in
place for science, technology, and innovation for the agricultural sector; and (d) An Agricultural
Technology Focal Point establishedwithin the framework of MOA.
4. Project Components
The total APL Phase I1Project cost is expected to be US$43.11 million (Bank share: US$25.0 million;
GOP share: US$6.06 million; other stakeholders: US$l2.05 million) and be of four years' duration,
beginningJuly 1, 2005. The Project would finance the following four components, the details of which
are given in Annex 4.
Component 1. Strengthening the Marketfor Innovation Services
Expected cost: US$20.94 million (Bank share: US$14.49 million; GOP: US$0.72 million; others:
US$5.72 million).
The aim of Component 1 i s to advance the development of a decentralized market for professional
services for agricultural innovation. It will strengthen producer organizations as beneficiaries of quality
services, and improve entrepreneurial capacity of private service providers. The result will be a more
efficient market for services. Special emphasis will be given to the development of instruments that
would ensure equitable participation opportunities to vulnerable groups such as organizations of
indigenous and women's groups. To realize this objective the component will: (a) finance a Competitive
Fund that will co-finance subprojects in adaptive research and extension based on business plans that
reflect producer demands, including vulnerable groups such as indigenous populations and women's
organizations; and (b) co-finance local participant forums, internships of pre-professionals, and training
workshops, to improve the administrative capacity of organizations and the agribusiness of producers, and
to strengthen the capacity of the suppliers with a managerial orientation to provision of services.
Implementation of the competitive fund will be decentralized at the macro-region level. The participation
of technical representatives of Regional Governments of the macro-regions would be ensured in the
evaluation, priority setting, and negotiation of subproject proposals for the competitive fund. Local
capacity to formulate and implement innovative subprojects that contribute to regional agricultural
competitiveness will be strengthened.
Component 2. Strengthening the National Agricultural Research and Development System
Expected cost: US$14.00 million (Bank share: US$7.27 million; GOP: US$0.40 million; others: US$6.33
million).
The aim of Component 2 i s to strengthen agricultural research and technological development for
innovation in strategic areas of national importance, and to strengthen institutional and professional
competence.     The component would establish support mechanisms for "centers of excellence" in
emerging areas of science and technology, and for regional training programs in high-skill innovation
services that are critical to increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. The component will
manage the Strategic Services Development Fund (FDSE). The FDSE would: (a) invest in the strategic
national and international alliances to co-finance research activities and capacity building, initially in
three high-priority areas-genetic     resources conservation and use, biotechnology, and integrated plant
and animal management-and           which would be gradually expanded to include natural resource

management (NRM);soils and land management, irrigation and water management, ago-forestry, post-
harvest handling and processing, and sustainable agriculture; (b) development of the capacity of public
research institutes to co-finance strategic research activities targeting public funds for the smallholder
agnculture; (c) finance the strengthening of regional training and information programs for extension
service providers and to co-finance cumculums with a focus on capacity building and institutional
development; and (d) co-finance training programs for researchers in specialties includedin high-priority
areas of strategic researchthat require a certain critical mass of professional talent.
This Fundwould also partially finance the development of the public sector capacity to generatescientific
and technological information, to develop new products and processes as a result of research and
development (R&D) in a program of strategic research for smallholder agriculture in Peru, in a manner
where a public research institute concentrate its efforts, technical capacity and financial resources in the
implementation of a number of priority and strategic subprojects of value and delivery of public goods.
Given the importance of smallholder agriculture and its inherent problems, the Project has a special
interest in financing a strategic programto address such problems and for which INIEA i s well positioned
to implement given its presence in various eco-regions of the country. This would require certain
conditions for the reform of INIEA as outlined in the Policy Letter, which accompanies this operation,
and ifmet, this strategic programcould be financed inINIEA.
Component 3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Information Sharing, and Policy for Innovation
Expected cost: US$5.53 million (Bank share: US$2.25million; GOP: US$3.28 million).
The aim of Component 3 i s to develop the institutional capacity of the public sector to formulate and
implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with the private sector, and regulate the quality
of the NAIS. The outcome would be the establishing of a Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point in
a modemized M O A that i s responsible for defining policies, and which would coordinate investments in
this sector. The outputs would be: (a) institutionalization of processes, priorities, and policies to promote
and protect innovations with consensus within the system and policy definition in critical areas such as
promotion of public investments in science and agricultural technology, intellectual property rights, and
public-private partnerships; (b) validation of an M&E system to generate performance measurement
standards to measure the results of modernization of the NAIS services; and (c) a modernized and
systematized information system composed of virtual networks that will increase the sector's capacity to
generate and use systematized and updated scientific and technological information. The activities to be
financed would be: (1) studies and consultations on prospective technologies and technological
forecasting, elaboration of a concerted agenda of the innovation system, identification of the constraints
on the development, adoption, and dissemination of innovations, and defining priorities and formulating
policies in potential strategic areas of innovations; (2) a M&E system for subprojects using measuring
instruments that permit comparison of designs, identify best practices of quality, submit information to
public scrutiny, reward the best subprojects, and ensure the achievement of maximum results and desired
impacts; and (3) an information system that i s in the public domain and enriched with data generated by
subprojects, operational plans, and programs in place, available to all stakeholders participating in
agriculturalinnovations.
Component 4. Project Implementation
Expected cost: US$2.51million (Bank share: US$0.86 million; GOP: US$1.65 million).
The aim of Component 4 is to finance the present INCAGRO-Project Management Unit (PMU), which
would continue to be the implementingagency for Phase 11. The main responsibilities of the PMUwould
be to: (a) implement and monitor the Project at the national level; (b) be the principal contact with the
World Bank in Project supervision and financial management of the Bank's and public investment,
including efficient administration of the organizational structure of the Project; (c) conduct annual
program audits; (d) ensure quality assessments of Project implementation in terms of social impacts and

5. LessonsLearnedand ReflectedinProject Design
Lessonsfrom PreviousBank-Assisted Projects
The Bank has a long history of supporting rural-development-related projects in Peru, including the
Programa Nacional para el Manejo de las Cuencas Hidrolo'gicas y Conservacidn de Suelos
(PRONAMACHCS), rural roads, irrigation, and community development (see Annex 2 for a list of Bank-
funded projects in the rural sector). The experience of these Bank lending programs has provided
valuable pointers to guide future investments inthe rural agricultural sector. The Project would also build
on the Bank's experience in agricultural extension and research projects in other countries in LAC and
other regions.
In addressing issues such as sustainability, commitment by the national government, and poor
implementation raised by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in connection with overall Bank
assistance to Peru (2002)5, this Project is ensuring sustainability by leveraging resources from co-
financers, mainstreaming a competitive grant scheme as part of the GOP strategy for financing of
agricultural researchand extension, increasing the role of producer organizations in the identification and
implementation of subprojects, and increasing institutional plurality on the supply side. Moreover, a
private business group has recognized the successful implementation of Phase Iof the Project by a special
award for creativity in 2003. The Phase IProject, through its two competitive funds (107 subprojects),
has leveraged US$1.04 from both public and private partners for every dollar invested by the Project.

Sixty-seven private groups or institutions are participating in this Project as demanders or suppliers of
services. A special funding window, Huchuy Ayni (Mutual Help), has been established to facilitate the
participation of indigenous peoples.
The lessons learned from Phase Iof the APL Project described below on research, extension, and
institutional framework i s invaluable in the design and implementation of the Phase I1Project. Phase 1,
which initially focused on three regions of the country, and later expanded to five, has shown that a
demand-driven, decentralized, and competitive system for the allocation of resources to research and
extension can be successfully implemented in Peru. This corroborates evidence from similar agricultural
technology and extension projects financed by the Bank in other L A C countries (Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico, and Venezuela) and in the rest of the world (Cameroon, Georgia, India, and Kenya).

On research: Attention to excellence in research quality needs to be enhanced through: (a)
competitively awarding research grants based on explicit economic, eco-regional, social, and technical
criteria; (b) external review of research programs and subprojects at least once during the project life; (c)
active involvement of strong research institutions and universities; (d) effective linkages with
international, regional, and national research centers of excellence; and (e) needs-based training of
participants at all levels of the production chain. A bottom-up approach to determine the needs of the
beneficiaries (clientes) requires involvement of farmers/producers in setting the research agendas,
including special consideration of the needs of disadvantaged groups (that is, gender issues, indigenous
peoples issues, and vulnerable groups). An innovation systems concept that i s fully inclusive of all
players in the demand-supply chain is required to promote synergies among technology generation
(scientists and educators), other market stakeholders (industry, agnbusinesses, and so forth), and
extension service providers and producers. Regional and national level research priority setting and
planning i s required to address the differences in innovation system supply and demand, and to ensure
local ownership by all players, which in turn would lead to a more sustainable system. Rationalizing
existing resources and limiting factors for expansion of facilities are important to developing financially
sustainable research systems.       Policy and regulatory regimes should be favorable to private sector
research and technology spill-ins.
On extension: Extension systems must be adaptable to respond to rapidly changing economic, trade,
and sectoral conditions. Investment in countrywide extension systems may be inappropriate when
there i s a lack of resources or technology to support such systems. Both public and private sector
services should be considered in extension system design, and both traditional mass media and new web-
basedcommunication technologies are appropriate tools for extension use, that is, web-based networking.
Needs-based extension staff training should focus on the training of extension workers to encourage
producer organization participation in extension, in addition to providing technical information and skills
development.
On institutional framework including the role of the Government: A strong Government commitment
i s essential for a sustainable and effective research and extension system.         Developing in-house
socioeconomic capacity and setting up of effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems are
essential to the success of the Project. An M&E system should assess the short- and medium-term
impacts of the Project that result from the development and adoption of new technological interventions.
Both public and private sector services must be involved in strategic plans for implementing rural
agricultural development activities.
Partner Activities in Relationto Bank Assistance
A number of other partners, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the International
Fundfor Agricultural Development (FAD), and the UnitedStates Agency for International Development
(USAID), are active inPeru's development of human resources, infrastructure, and services inrural areas.
While these donor agencies are active in the rural areas, accordingto a country client survey conducted in




                                                     11

2002; the Bank i s recognized for bringing important expertise and intemational experience to Peru and
demonstrating strong leadership in the design and preparation of new and relevant projects.
The lessonsof other donor-funded projects in the sector (see Annex 2) also influenced the Project design,
particularly the need for (a) synergetic input on the role of the private sector in innovation by input from
medium-to-larger-sized agricultural entrepreneurs and multinationals; (b) greater focus on end users,
particularly the disadvantaged groups, by location, ethnicity, gender, age, or education; (c) encouraging
the participationof universities and other institutions of higher education as partners of the NAIS; and (d)
empowerment of regional bodies as knowledge-transfer channels, and integration with the broader
agricultural sector inclusive of the export and tourism sectors.

6. Alternatives Considered andReasonsfor Rejection
Inthedesign of the program, consideration was given to supporting acentralizedpublicsystem, as inthe
past, or providing all support through the private sector. In line with stakeholder views in Peru, and
consistent with evolving international experiences, it was decided to support the development of a
decentralized, demand-driven system that would be co-financed by users and private partners. Phase Iof
the Project, which was concentrated in three regions, and expanded to five, has shown that development
of an innovation system with these characteristics i s feasible in Peru, and that there is sufficient supply
and demand for the types of services beingfinanced by the Project. The proposed Phase I1Project would
continue to pursue the objective of the program, expanding its scope to all regions in Peru, and giving
greater attention to targeting disadvantaged groups, including indigenous people and women. This
expansion is particularly timely within the context of the recent decentralization process established in
Peru, and the implementationof the competitive funds for extension, and adaptive and strategic research,
Another tactical alternative considered and rejected was relying exclusively on the importation of
innovations into the sector. This was based on Phase IAPL experience and that of similar projects in
Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, where it has been clearly shown that developing local capacity i s
crucial to facilitate the importation and fitting of appropriate technologies to local conditions. In this
context, a strategy of developing local and decentralized institutional capacity and stronger and more
qualified human resources, and producing adapted and available technologies to adequately address
specific and localizedproblems i s considered to be a more adequate strategy.
The exclusive support for a single researchand extension institution (that is, INIEA) in Peru was rejected,
because one national institute cannot adequately meet the country's agricultural research needs. This i s
particularly important since a competitive sector demands that a range of options needs to be delivered to
the suppliers and demanders of services. A multi-partner NAIS that includes a strong and active private
sector also improves the sustainability of such a system that adapts to changing needs, andkeeps up with
the rapid advances in science.
The establishment of a GOP-implemented, public-sector-financed extension service would also have
similar disadvantages, in addition to being costly to the economy, whereas private sector participation in
agricultural investments i s seen as improving ownership and efficiency of resource use. The producer-co-
financed strategy was therefore judged the most appropriate, because it pennits the producers to express
their needs while sharing costs, thereby enhancing the financial sustainability of the services.

2. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements. The loan partner and implementing agency
remain unchanged from the Phase IAPL Project.
Loan partner: The Government of Peru.

Implementing agency:Ministry of Agriculture, INCAGRO.
The overall Project implementation responsibilities would remain unchangedfrom the earlier Phase. The
Bank loan will be disbursedby direct payments to a special account.
Co-implementing agencies: Producer organizations, other research and extension services providers
(INIEA,universities, NGOs,privateenterprises).
Potential partners: During the course of project implementation other avenues for collaboration and
potential partnerships with international organizations (see Annex 2 list and CGIAR centers) will be
explored.
3. Monitoringand Evaluation(M&E) of Outcomes/Results
The M&E framework that was refined based on the Phase Iexperience and improved during Project
preparation will be fully operational by the Project effectiveness date. This framework takes into account
that a well-designed system is critical to ensure timely and successful implementation of the Project, and
to enhance its impact for the beneficiaries by the systematic and periodic analysis of lessons learned, and
their effective dissemination. Project monitoringand evaluation would be the responsibility of the Project
Management Unit (PMU). Performance indicators have been established for the Project and its four
components, and are presented in the Results Framework in Annex 3. The M&E system i s based on a
cascade of goals, purposes, results, and activities where higher-order activity, that is, components,
become the purpose of the lower order, that is, the subcomponents. This approach will ensure the
tracking of all activities to the developmental objective of the Project. A participatory approach with end
users i s included in the selection of priorities at the regional level, in the selection of subprojects to be co-
financed, the participation in capacity-buildingevents, and becoming an integral part of the Project as co-
financers would ensure broad participation of the communities and the nation as a whole in Project
outcomes. Participatory monitoring tools would be used as needed to evaluate the participatory indexes
in Project and subproject implementation. The oversight committee will assist in keeping the national
interests within the framework of implementation progress.              The Project design includes baseline
determinations and performance (milestones) indicators to monitor the implementation of the plan. Such
monitoring will consist of an intemal evaluation at the component level, and one at the Project level. The
monitoring will be based on periodic reports.
By using a management information system (MIS) and the financial management system, Project
activities will be kept on track and potential problems identified and appropriately addressed. The PMU
will design the MIS for M&E, reporting formats for each component and decentralized office according
to the target annual performance objectives and monitoring indicators shown in Annex 3. The quarterly
reports will cover the progress in implementation, and milestones in the use of Project funds and impact.
Quarterly technical and financial reports will be consolidated by the PMUinto bi-annual progress reports
to be submitted to the Bank within two months of the end of each six-month reporting period. These bi-
annual reports will also include an implementation plan and activity program for the subsequent six
months of the reporting period. Additionally, independent outsourced external reviews and impact
assessments will be done. A midtermreview will assess the overall progress of the Project. The lessons
learned and recommendations for any needed improvements would be used in restructuringor realigning
the Project plans. Post-project impact assessments will be conducted to improve quantitative assessment
of the Project outcome on the final phase of the APL Project planning.

 4.   Sustainability
 In the last three years, as a result of the interventions of Phase Iof the Project, important lessons of
 institutional changes have been generated in the Peruvian NAIS. These institutional innovations would
 be built into Phase I1of the Project to assure the sustainability of the achieved results.
 Leading role within the MOA and GOP support. In this context, the GOP continued to be fully
 committed to the implementation plans of this Project. The establishment of a policy focal point
 (Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point) within the M O A would ensure GOP long-term
 sustainability and support.

.Mainstreaming the competitive grant scheme. The Project would ensure that the competitive grant
 scheme would be an important component of public resourcesfor innovation, and would help to increase
 GOPNOA funds once the Bank-fundedprogram is completed.
 Institutional analysis of the agricultural innovation system done by this Project has documented a large
 number of institutions active in the sector, its problems, and its capacity to participate in the Project,
 which makes it possible to identify and implement remedies and facilitate the long-term viability of
 innovation processes.
 Role of the producer organizations. The producer organizations assisted and strengthened by the Project
 would continue to operate with increased self-sufficiency in terms of funds generated through
 technological interventions that would help sustain them in the longer term.
 Znstitutional plurality in the NAZS. The diversity and the great number of organizations of existent
 producers would allow the Project to be selective and provide direct support to the most capable
 organizations, while investingintraining and promotional activities to strengthen the capacity of others.
 5. Critical Risks andPossible ControversialAspects
 Main Risks
 Given the broad political and institutional commitment to the APL Program and successful
 implementation of Phase I,it is unlikely that major risks would occur to the design of this Project. A
 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis indicatedthat potential risks involved with
 this Project are: (a) the development of a parallel systemof researchand innovation if it is not possible to
 develop and implement a coherent national policy that integrates INIEA, the major public research
 organization, into an increasingly pluralistic innovation system; (b) the weak capacity of newly formed
 regional governments to participate effectively in the decentralized implementation of the Project; and (c)
 a weak procurement system in the project unit. To address these risks the following steps will be taken:
 (i)redefinition of INIEA's strategy to address its role in a pluralistic system; (ii)strengthening the
 capacity of decentralized offices as well as training for local entities; and (iii) development of a plan for
 strengthening procurement processes.
 The Government has committed in the Policy Letter to support an INIEA that i s specialized in the
 execution of research and technology transfer, and which would concentrate its resources in a number of
 strategic programs that are of a strong public good nature. This would also require that the Ministry of
 Agriculture would support these strategic programs. If these conditions are met the Project through its
 Strategic Services Development Fund (FDSE) could co-finance subprojects within these strategic
 programs. Given the importance of smallholder agriculture and its inherent problems, the Project has a
 special interest in financing such a strategic program to address these problems and for which INIEA is
 well positioned to implement, given its presence in various eco-regions of the country.

 Despite the concerns stated above and risk mitigation measures taken (Table 2), it i s evident that the
 institutional capacity of the borrower to handle preparation and implementation of the proposed Phase I1
 Project of the APL program i s very high. The Project Management Unit has three years of experience in



                                                      14

effectively implementing the Phase IProject, and has hireda capable cadre of professionals with excellent
knowledge of the innovation systemand Bank procedures.

No specific risks have been identified through predecessor operations or from poverty, social, and
financial management. A social assessment was carried out during preparation. Moreover, financial
management and procurement specialists were part of the preparation team. A procurement assessment
rated the risk as high and a plan has been agreed upon to remedy the deficiencies that were identified
duringpre-appraisal.

Possible controversial aspects: Phase I1i s not expected to trigger a threat to stakeholders who might feel
that their interests are threatened by the Project. Phase Ihas supported the development of qualified
private sector providers and, in general, the Project enjoys wide support inthe agricultural communities in
which it works. However, success of such private-led initiatives threatens traditional stakeholders in the
public sector, and this requires continued dialogue to ensure a broad understanding of Project principles.
In addition, the strong support the Project enjoys from other stakeholders should enable it to move
forward.     Phase I1 would also expand activities targeted toward indigenous people, women, and
vulnerable groups.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economic andFinancialAnalyses
The economic and financial analysis of Phase I1of the APL follows good practices inthe World Bank and
i s based on experiences with similar projects in Latin America and other regions. The analysis i s
structured as follows: (a) a brief summary of general issues for economic analysis of research and
extension projects; (b) a brief review of returns to past investments in agricultural research and extension
projects internationally and in Peru; (c) an estimation of potential internal rate of return (IRR) for the
proposed investment based on experiences with the first project phase; and (d) a fiscal analysis focusing
on the potential consequencesof the proposed investment for the government budget.
The evaluation of subprojects of the Agricultural Technology Fund (ATE) of Phase Iindicated potential
economic benefits of investments inthe nationalresearchand extension system to be financed inPhase 11.
The economic and financial analysis was based on data from the M&E database, subproject progress
reports, and assumptions based on the technical expertise of Project Implementation Unit (PMUin Phase
11) staff. Out of the total of 63 adaptive research and extension projects (excluding Huchuy Ayni
subprojects) of the ATF, 29 subprojects have been selected for the evaluation. The selection was mainly
based on data availability and is therefore not a formally randomized selection of all projects. However,
the sample size can be considered as sufficient, represents the different regions and project types, and is
not biased towards successful projects. Since many subprojects are not completed yet, and the M&Eunit
of the PMU i s still working on data collection and analysis the results have to be considered as
preliminary. The economic analysis i s canied out for a 15-year period. The technology adoption and
benefit flow pattern vary depending on the subproject type and the technology type under consideration.
Adoption data are available for the first years after subproject initiation; adoption pattern beyond this time
period is based on assumptions made by the subproject directors.             The "without project" scenario
accounts for average income increases over time, but does not account for adoption of the technology
generatedand/or promotedthrough project activities.

Financial Analysis:
A financial analysis for adaptive research and extension projects was conducted to demonstrate the
profitability of a project from the direct participants' perspective. Since cost recovery mechanisms would
be implemented under the project in the form of beneficiary contributions, this analysis provides valuable
information on the potential willingness of farmers to pay for adaptive research and advisory services in
the future. The financial analysis of an individual extension project, which focuses on organic sugarcane
production, yields a NPV of US$ 850,000 (at a 12 percent discount rate) and an IRR of 48 percent. The
NPV of the aggregatedprojects amounted to US$6.96 million with a financial IRR of 36.5 percent.

Economic Analysis:
Since price distortions in Peru are limited and affect only a few products (mainly sugar, cotton, corn,
milk, and rice) the differences between the results of the economic and financial analysis are small.
However, in cases of price distortions (inparticular import tariffs) adjustments were made to calculate the
economic values. The aggregated economic analysis for the 29 selected subprojects shows that the
economic IRR of the aggregated projects amounts to 34.1 percent. The high IRR i s not surprising
considering the low levels of technology and productivity of Peruvian farmers. These values are
comparable with research and extension projects in other countries. Sensitivity analysis indicates that a 20
percent reduction inproject benefits would lead to an IRR of 14percent.
The calculation of the overall productivity gain required in the agricultural sector to pay the costs of the
Phase I1Project i s another useful indicator for the economic justification of the investment. The analysis
indicates that a productivity gain of only 0.55 percent of the agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP)
would lead to an IRR of 12percent. Compared internationally, the requiredlevel i s very low.




                                                      16

However, due to increased emphasis on fiscal discipline in Peru, it is crucial to estimate the fiscal impact
of the proposed investment. If it were not accounted for the planned co-financing and cost-recovery
mechanisms through service providers and clients, public expenditures would have to increase in real
terms by 37 percent annually after the end of the project. This increase would correspond to an increased
expenditure of US$8 million per year. The incremental public expenditures as a percentage of the total
government budget for the agricultural sector would decrease from 3.5 percent to 3.0 percent. However,
in Phase 11, about 20 percent of these costs have to be co-financed by the producers and executing
agencies. Assuming that about the same amount would be provided by these agencies after project
completion, public expenditures for research and extension have to increase by only about US$12 million
annually, or 55 percent. Although these projections mean a significant increase in financial commitment
of the GOP to agricultural research and extension, the public expenditures would still be low compared to
international levels.
Tax revenue can be an important means of recovering public expenditures. An analysis was conducted
which indicates the potential impact of projected AgGDP growth on the recovery of fiscal outlays through
increased tax revenues. The analysis assumes that 50 to 60 percent of the incremental income of
agncultural producers is spent on goods on which the value-added tax (VAT) (18 percent) i s imposed
(mainly non-food items). Assuming that 60 percent of the incremental income i s spent on taxed items,
and that the co-financing mechanisms would be sustained beyond the end of the project, an AgGDP
growth rate of 2 percent would nearly offset government expenditures.            The analysis reveals that
additional tax revenues due to increased economic activity would substantially contribute to the recovery
of fiscal outlays.
2. Technical
All the proposed activities under the Phase I1Project of an APL on strengthening of the market of
services for innovation, strengthening of strategic competence for research and development,
strengthening policies, information exchange, and quality of services of innovation components have been
demonstrated to be technically feasible by the Phase IProject, and by other Bank and various donor-
funded initiatives and operations inPeru. The rationale, approach, and detailed design of each component
can be found inAnnex 4. The first and secondcomponents are building on Project's first phase leadingto
geographical expansion of the program and a scaling up of the already tested design to extension
approach while deepening the adaptive and strategic research component and shifting the focus from
thematic areas based approach to production chain-oriented approach. The monitoring and evaluation
that was embedded in above two components of Phase Iproject is now placed in the third technical
component in Phase 11. The third component on policy, information, and quality that was greatly
modified during preparation of the Phase I1Project requires intense monitoring to ensure that the set
targets are reached as planned, and the anticipated incremental benefits are realized.
The main instrument of investment i s the use of competitive funds with slight variations to address the
different components, target groups, types of results, and time frame that i s fully tested on various
agricultural technology and extension projects, and is proven to be successful in similar projects in Peru
(the Phase IAPL), other Latin American countries, and elsewhere. A long-term strategic vision in
supporting thematic areas will be fulfilled using the same funding window that i s noncompetitive and
targeted, that is, an FDSE instrument. Other design characteristics (a vertical approach using pilot
studies) in the short term, by using competitive funds with support to strengthen the capacity to produce
quality project proposals by indigenous populations and women's organizations and inclusion of other
disadvantaged groups such as indigenous young people in developing innovative market of services, are
expected in the long run to assist in mainstreaming the participation of all population categories of the
Project by the beginning of Phase 111. Knowledge rescue of indigenous knowledge of plants, crop
species, indigenous agricultural systems, and oral traditions through affirmative selection of extension
subproject proposals are a mainstay of this Phase I1Project.

In relation to the process of expansion of the scope of technological interventions and geographic
expansion of the Project during its Phase 11, a set of criteria were considered in order to select the
decentralized macroregions that will be establishedon an annual basis. These criteria include: (a) the key
variables to define the target population of the Project; as relates to the productive efficiency of the
producers and the degree of market articulation including the presence of agro-industrial chains and
demand for products, public service operators with greater capacity of technological innovation, and
better economic context and infrastructure; (b) the potential of farming and forest resources to respond to
the globalization of the market (potential of impact of the services for innovation); and (c) aspects that
harness the success of the intervention strategy of the Project (greater institutional development, leaders
of produce organizations, greater capacity and disposition to payment for services, and greater relative
development of the market of services for the innovation). The expansion processi s detailed inAnnex 6.
The innovative directions of Phase I1Project design that can be emphasized are: market service driven
approach taken in Component 1; applied research framework leading the Component 2 activities rather
than basic research; and modernized forms of knowledge sharing, e.g., web based extension and
establishing a proactive monitoring and evaluation system in Component 3. Marketability and income
generation potential from the intellectual property and development of patentable knowledge is high in a
research and innovation project of this nature; therefore a study will look at the potential use of IPR and
how to strengthen the national and institutional framework for intellectual property, followed by a pilot
study in APL phase 111. Another innovative instrument of Phase I1 designed to recognize technical
quality and best practices of subprojects fundedby the various competitive funds is "Merit Awards".
A central element in the formulation of the technical capacity strengthening of this Project was
constructed inconsultation with and participationof relevant stakeholders, takinginto account the broader
mandate of Phase I1to the whole country, while addressing population cohorts that are disadvantaged.
The inclusion of an oversight ExecutiveCouncil (ExC) provides the additional level of scrutiny to Project
administration, and provides avenues for including good technical practices in the Project while it i s
implemented, and flexibility in the activity plan to address emerging themes. The Project, within its
institutional strengthening mandated through strategic program funding (FDSE), will mobilize the
participation of national public, private, and regional universities and other private entities involved in
agricultural sciences. The Project also provides the PMUthe opportunity to tap quality technical capacity
as consultants (local, regional, and international) on rapidly advancing fields of sciences such as
biotechnology and molecular biology, information technology, and training (virtual learning, distant
learning, and adult education). The Project would mobilize different types of organized community level
organizations using the well-tested models in other Latin American countries where agricultural
technology and extension subprojects have been successful. The social inclusion in the regional context,
though requiring more intense efforts and also having high risks on delivery, would receive particular
attention during Phase 11. In addition, the Project would attempt to maximize opportunities of
collaborations with various donors of NAIS who are service suppliers and are creating additional
demands as identified inAnnex 3 and their respective implementing agencies.
3. Fiduciary
Financial Plan. The estimated total amount of Project Phase I1(Annex 5) is US$43.11 million for a four-
year period, of which US$25.0 million corresponds to the financing provided by the World Bank,
US$12.05 million corresponds to the co-financing of the implementing agencies (suppliers and
demanders), and US$6.06 million corresponds to the contributions of the GOP. The annual average
expenses would be about US$10 million. At the component level, Component 1is estimated to use 48.6
percent on strengthening the Market for Innovation, 32.5 percent on Strengthening of Strategic Research
and Development, and 12.8 percent on Policy Formulation for Innovation. Administration of the Project
cost would be 5.8 percent. Of the budget total, 28 percent will be leveraged directly by the strategic
alliances, which would support the Project through the investment funds and the windows of direct
attention (suppliers and demanders of innovation services). The above-proposed financial plan takes into


                                                    18

account the wide coverage of the Project in terms of the targeted population, and better diffusion of
interventions of the Government to promote technological innovations in agriculture and to improve the
efficiency of resource allocation to the institutionrepresenting this system.
This financial plan, given in US dollars, estimates an international inflationary factor of 1.9 percent per
year, at an exchange rate of 3.5 soles per US dollar. The physical contingency for civil works was
assumed to be at 10 percent and 5 percent for consulting services, 5 percent for consultancies, and 5
percent for capacity building. For the competitive funds, which depend on demand and local operating
expenses, no allowance was made for fiscal contingency.              All estimates were made taking the
implementation schedule into account. This budget includes a few additional expenses related to the
estimated cost of the pre-feasibility study that will help expand Project coverage in terms of target
population, improve the scope of governmental interventions to promote agricultural innovation, and
achieve better resource allocation among institutions within the system. The audit plan will follow
standardBank practices.
The proposed budget is based on a cost structure that is in agreement with the Project design of four
components, while taking into account that the final budget will be subject to the country's borrowing
capacity.

Procurement.      This evaluation concluded that this Project, to be implemented nationwide in a
decentralized mode of operation, has high risks. To ensure that the unit structure i s strengthened and
adequate trained personnel are involved, the following actions are requiredfor the specific objective of
improving its capacity: (a) preparation of a procurement plan, with a complete systematized information
base for follow-up action; (b) a system of filing and archiving at headquarters and at each decentralized
unit; (c) capacity buildingfor members of the ad hoc Evaluation Committee andthe Specialized Standing
Procurement Committee; and (d) implementation of an integrated management information system. The
details of this procurement action plan are given inAnnex 4.
Financial Management. Overall, during Phase Iof the APL, the Project Management Unit (PMU) has
maintained financial management arrangements, systems, and practices that are satisfactory to the Bank,
and are adequate to provide the Bank with accurate and timely information regarding project resources,
expenditures, and activities.
Entity specific and control risks have been assessed as moderate. During appraisal, the major capacity
constraints related to: a) the inability of the current information system to produce Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs) to support project management; b) inadequate monitoring mechanism for overseeing the
financial operations of the decentralized units; c) record keeping and filing which fragments the audit trail
of transactions; d) the lack of synchronization between project planning, execution of payments and
authorization (within the Ministry of Finance (MEF) of withdrawal application requests to the Bank, and
(e) capacity to transition into Report-based disbursements mechanism.
Whereas in the Phase I,the impact of these constraints was not material, the Phase I1required a quantum
leap, in order to mitigate the risks posed by the expansion in project complexity and scope. As reflected
in the updated Action Plan, the PMU has (1) upgraded the information systems and produced a
comprehensive User Manual which reflects the internal control processes and procedures; (2) the system
has the capacity to produce Financial Monitoring Reports, which can be used as the basis for
disbursement; (3) a Financial Analyst has been hired and trained and monitoring mechanism have been
instituted to oversee the financial operations of decentralized units; (4) record keeping and filing systems
and procedures have been prepared and implemented in order to ensure an appropriate audit trail; (5) the
Draft Operations Manual has been submitted to the Bank for review and comment; and (6) extensive
training sessions to improve Financial, Disbursement and Procurement capacity have been conducted in
two decentralized regions. Once the scaling up of the integrated financial management system i s
satisfactorily implemented, the residual inherent and control risks will be mitigated and the Bank will
have no objection to approvingthe implementation of the new disbursement mechanism.

4. Social
The preparation of the Project has taken into account the key social development goals on increased rural
employment and decreased rural poverty, and a social assessment was done for the primary purpose of
preparing action plans to mitigate social risks and inequities. The social framework of the Project takes
into account inits main instrument of funding, the Competitive funds, the social impact of the Project as a
whole and at the subproject level, by targeting the end beneficiaries as co-participants in and co-financers
of the Project. A central theme and a decentralized mode of operation of the Project requires community
level participation (that is, in regional priority setting for competitive funds and selection of subprojects
for co-financing), and the active participation of other NGOs is designed to ensure that rural poverty
alleviation i s better addressed as a result of the Project outcomes of individual components. Annex 8
discusses the sociocultural and political impacts of interventions on the market of services and on the
innovation system, and the impact on disadvantaged and excluded groups, such as the indigenous
populations and women.
The Project design treats the gender issue in two ways. First, in the selection of subprojects for co-
financing (in terms of extension, and adaptive and strategic research themes), gender balance in
participationi s inherent, while second, it recognizes the imbalance ineffective participation due to gender
inequities that affect women's organizations, and attempts to overcome this by a special fund. The
proposed plans of action for strengthening indigenous populations and rural women are mentioned in the
safeguard section below, and are also described inAnnex 8.
5. Environment
In accordance with Bank policy, an environmental assessment of the impact of the Project was completed.
The Project was rated at the environmental category B, since the Project components were found to have
relatively limited environmental impact potential. According to the analysis, the Project would integrate
good practices on natural resource management (NRM) and environmental indicators accounting for
environmental issues, and the monitoring and evaluation process will include environmental assessments
to mitigate any potential negative impact, and is thereby expected to have an overall positive impact on
natural resources and the environment. Based on the commissioned study entitled, "The Environmental
Hazards of TechnologicalInnovation," an environmentalmanagement plan (EMP) that takes into account
good practices of ESRP i s attached in Annex 10.2 to streamline the strategy and practices that would
eliminate any adverse environmental and social and human health impacts, or offset them or reduce them
to acceptable levels. All the proposals for subprojects of competitive funds, in addition, would include an
evaluation of the environmental impact, including a list of negative impact verification for the eligibility
of proposals of subprojects for funding. According to the study on potential environmental risks of
technological innovations, the following outcomes would be realized: (a) generation of capacity to
achieve a positive environmental impact by using best practices in the technology generation process and
its final product; (b) establishment of critical steps taking into account both proposed technologies and
their immediate effects and medium- and long-term environmental impacts; and (c) introducing
methodshndicators for environmental economic valuation of the proposed technologies and the
beneficiaries.
6. SafeguardPolicies
The safeguard-screening category of the Project is S2.           Most safeguard policies are not triggered
negatively by the Project, and the safeguard policies that might be of concern are given adequate
attention, as described below. Environmental and pest management might be triggered due to the
introduction of new agricultural innovations.          Following the experience of the Phase 1 Project,
environmental monitoring criteria would continue to be included in the subproject evaluation and
selection and as described in the environmentalplan. Pest management safeguards would be activated in
the Project and its subprojects by: (a) advocating integrated pest management (IPM) practices; (b) training
activities related to promoting biological and environmental control methods over chemical pesticides


                                                        20

where possible; and (c) following the World Health OrganizatiodFood and Agriculture Organization
(WHOFAO) guidelines on the safe use of pesticides which are effective only against the target species,
have minimal effects on non-target species and the environment, and have negligible human health
effects.   A pest management action plan developed for the first time for this type of agricultural
technology and extension projects in the LAC region i s given in Annex 10.3. An action plan for the
dissemination of all the Safeguards Plans of Actions was developed during appraisal and will be
implemented. During Project implementation, appropriate IPM and other technical experts, as needed,
would be included in the supervision missions.
The Indigenous People's Development Plan developed during the Phase 1 Project was revised and
updated, taking into account lessons of the pilot studies. Inthe last decade, several social changes have
taken place among the indigenous peoples. Localcommunities have been strengthened, giving rise to the
emergence of territorial and ethnic organizations and national indigenous fronts, which are the focal point
in the proposed interventions to enhance social inclusion and improve overall productivity to alleviate
pervasive poverty. The Project would also strive to ensure that indigenous people would benefit directly
from the Project through a special fundthat will specifically cater to the needs of disadvantaged groups.
The Project has mainstreamed development assistance activities targeted rural women while addressing
the specific needs of this disadvantaged group through a competitive grant scheme for rural women
organizations.

                       Annex 1: Country and Sector or Program Background
                   PERU: Agricultural Research and ExtensionAPL PhaseI1
Sector Issues
This Annex summarizes the principal characteristics of the Peruvian economy and the evolution of its
agricultural sector since the political crisis of 2000, as background to Project Phase I1plans. In the last
decade, limited changes occurred in the agricultural sector and free market operations, with positive
outcomes, such as a positive economic growth and an expanded internal demand for services. The
agricultural sector increased significantly, from 7.3 percent to 9 percent from 1991 to 2002. Note that
during the same period fertilizer supply increasedby 330 percent, while global market fertilizer imports
increasedfrom 43 to 98 percent (Escobal and Valdivia 2004). Duringthe same period, export volume of
agricultural products tripled, reaching US$934 million in 2002, while importation of agricultural products
increased since 1998. The leading agricultural product was coffee, contributing to 31 percent of total
exports (2000-02). Other agricultural products of note were processed or fresh asparagus (13 percent and
10 percent, respectively), wood (9 percent), and mango (4 percent) (MINAG 2003). The main export
destinations were the UnitedStates (31 percent), Spain (11percent), Germany (11percent), and Mexico
(5 percent).
Improvements in the sector occurred in the following areas: (a) an increase in export crops such as fruits
(mango, for example) and horticultural crops (asparagus, for example) cultivated by medium-to-large-
scale producers in the coastal zone, and with better infrastructural connectivity with the international
market; and (b) an increase in artesian products of an agro-tourist nature for the export market. The food
production index of Peru, at 173, (using a base of 100 in 1989-91, World Bank 2004b), i s higher than the
Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) average of 142, and of the lower-middle-income country average of
158. Fertilizer consumption (100 grams per hectare of arable land), however, remains lower at 813 than
the LAC average of 846, and of the lower-middle-income country average of 1,060. The production
increase is mostly due to increased area of production (that is, for rice, maize, and potato) and to new
crop-basedproducts (asparagus and grapevine). The productivity changes for cereal (for example, yellow
maize), coffee, and potato crops, though positive, were minimal. A large disparity in agricultural
productivity continued between the coastal and sierra regions. The need to catalyze rural growth by
improving access to markets, and by increasing the dynamism and competitiveness of all actors (buyers,
sellers, and other service providers), with sufficient attention given to disadvantaged groups (women and
other minorities), and to improve productivity of small- and medium-scale producers, reduce the
transaction costs of market forces, and improve strategic alliances to facilitate agribusiness opportunities
that are more efficient, are factors to be addressedwithin the scope of this Phase I1Project.
About 26.5 percent of the Peruvian population (26.7 millions) is rural (World Bank 2004b), and the rural
economy is characterized by slow productivity growth, low employment-generation capacity, and high
rural poverty associated with severe social problems. The rural agricultural sector continues to be
associated with poverty, despite the presence of an extensive and potentially productive agricultural land
area (about 5.5 million hectares), that is, about 24 percent of the total area, which i s of agro-ecologically
highly diverse (selva, sierra, and coast), and recent improvements in competitiveness, development of
innovation capacity, and other developmental indexes. Agricultural competitiveness and growth are
constrained by: (a) farm size, characterized by a majority of small farms; 24.3 percent of farm units are
smaller than 1 hectare, and 55.4 percent less are smaller than 3 hectares, with the national average farm
size of 3.1 hectares; (b) water scarcities (irrigable land area in Peru i s about 28.4 percent of the arable
area); (c) low and limited access to technologies; (d) scarcity or lack of relevant information; and (e)
public sector institutional problems.
The Government of Peru (GOP) has pursued a comprehensive strategy to address economic growth and
poverty alleviation by increased social spending. The challenges and cause and effect paradigms of the
Peruvian agriculture and livestock sector illustrates the current situation that needs solutions (MOA

2004a, 2004b). The GOP continues to be committed to an open economy, that is, to contributing to
private-sector-led growth, and to sound economic management leading to positive growth in agncultural
gross domestic product (AgGDP) and poverty reduction. An analysis of sector concerns from the onset of
the APL Program in 1997-99 and now (covering 2000-04) indicates that most, if not all, issues raised at
that time are relevant today.

  0 Rural poverty levels and wealth inequities continue to remain high, presenting a d$ficult
    environmentfor sector growth. In 1997, 64.7 percent of rural households were in poverty, and 24.5
    percent were in severe poverty, compared to 40.4 percent of urban households in poverty, and 9.3
    percent in severe poverty. The situation has improved, but the poverty level, malnutrition, and social
    exclusion of disadvantaged groups persist. According to 2002 data, the less educated, older, and
    Quechua or Aymara native speakers dominate the rural poor, irrespective of the region. Peru i s on
    track to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goal target of halving the undernourishment rate by 2015.
    At the same time, income, inequalities and social exclusion in the labor market are higher among
    indigenous and Afro-descendants.
  0 Lack of or weak technological innovation. During 1997-99, the lack of technological innovations
    available to farmers constrained the ability to increase productivity and improve post-harvest
    processing and to market value-adding functions.        Moreover, the level of public investment in
    agricultural research was extremely low, at 0.2 percent of agricultural gross domestic product
    (AgGDP). There have been improvements in the availability of and access to new innovations in the
    agricultural sector due to Bank and other donor interventions (Annex 2), but much of the technology
    transfer to endusers remains undelivered in the regions and to the mainstreampopulation.
  0 Natural resources degradation. During 1997-99, natural resource degradation and lack of attention
    to appropriate natural resource management (NRM) strategies were a serious threat to the
    sustainability of some agricultural production systems. These included salinization in the coastal
    soils due to poor imgation practices, erosion of susceptible soils in the selva and sierra due to poor
    land cultivation practices and overgrazing in the sierra, poor management of forest resources and
    deforestation, and overuse of pesticides. Awareness on the need to address the above-discussed
    issues has been raised, but success stories are few, and are an area that must be addressedwithin the
    National Agricultural Innovation System to mitigate adverse impacts of the use of inappropriate
    agricultural practices.
    Plant and animal health services. During 1997-99, the plant and animal health services of Peru
    were constrained by an outdated legal and regulatory system, limited capacity, and limited funding.
    These factors constituted a major constraint on the country's ability to access the international
    markets, restricting access of farmers to improved planting materials, and exposing the country to
    dangerous pests and diseases. Despite the efforts of the GOP and other donor-funded project
    activities (that is, the Inter-American Development Bank; Annex 2), there are large gaps in the public
    sector for addressingthese issues.
    Rural financial services. During 1997-99, rural financial services were limited, subsidized rural
    credit was less available, and there was widespread rural terrorism. At the time, only 30 percent of
    rural families had access to credit (Alverdo and Ugay 1998). It was deemed that an effective rural
    financial system was necessary to support a vigorous rural economy. Despite establishment of
    various social safety nets, the rural financial limitations continue to have negative impacts on
    development activities inthe agricultural sector, particularly among disadvantaged groups.
    Agricultural market development. During 1997-99, agricultural market development improved,
    with the dismantling of government monopolies and price controls, though the GOP continued to
    intervene in several small programs, which adversely impacted market development. Improved
    market information systems and a new wholesale market in Lima remained priorities for an efficient
    market system that would have spillover effects on the rest of the country. Currently, a decentralized
    marketing infrastructure led by the private sector remains the key to development of the agricultural
    sector and to an efficient and web-enabled market information system for the sector.

ProgramDetails
The three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL), a program for the development of a National
Agricultural Innovation System (NAIS, for research, extension, and knowledge and information sharing)
in Peru financed by the Bank is now in its second Phase. The focus of this Program is based on the
followingprincipals:
0   Institutional pluralism to draw on the comparative advantage and capacities of multiple institutions to
    provide research andextension services;
0   Competitive allocation of funding for research and extension services, with separation of the
    functions of financing and execution of services;
0   Co-financingcosts of research and extension with the providers and users of technology services;
0   Demand-driven provision of services with participation of users in the identification, financing, and
    implementation of such services.
The program purpose was to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector
through the adoption of environmentally sound technologies generatedand disseminated by a modernized
technology innovation system.
Phase Z Details. The Phase IProject development objective was to establish a private-sector-led,
decentralized technology innovation system to increase the adoption of environmentally sound
technologies. The Project, organized around three components (program and policy coordination, an
Agricultural Technology Fund (ATF), and institutional strengthening), achieved the following, measured
in terms of result indicators: (a) the establishment of three functional macro-regional programs of
extension and adaptive research, with private sector and farmer participation (Macro-regions I:Tumbes,
Piura, and Lambayeque; V: Junin, Hudnuco, Huancavelica, and Pasco; and VII: Amazonas, Sun Martin,
and the high jungle of Cajamarca). ATF activities were subsequently extended to two other macro-
regions (Macro-regions 11:Ancash, Lima, and Zca; and N:La Libertad andthe mountains of Cajamarca);
(b) more than 100 operational entities conducted the subprojects with 137 producer organizations
receiving services, with support from 175 collaborating institutions; (c) implementing agencies of the
subprojects include public and private institutions organized into strategic alliances leveragingabout 50.5
percent of subproject co-financing; (d) direct private sector co-financing (monetary) of about 28 percent
of subproject costs; (e) about 32 institutions are implementing the strategic research programs; (f) about
9,000 farmers/producers are directly involved in business plans of extension and adaptive research
subprojects, while indirect participation i s estimated at 27,000 farmers; and (g) limitedprogress was made
in the strategic researchprograms (that is, genetic resources), and some preliminary advances were made
in other strategic research programs such as biotechnology, animal and plant protection, and agricultural
economics.
Phase ZZ Details. The Phase I1Project would be organized around four components, three of which are
technology related, and one of which i s on Project implementation. (See Annex 4 for a detailed
description of the components.) The Program framework described and planned as described above (see
PAD 1999 for details) remains the same, but the instruments to achieve the goals and activities have
evolved based on Phase IProject experiences, and are reflected in the Phase I1Action Plan (Annex 4).
Several groups of institutions have been identified as potential innovation service providers for producer
demands (Table A.1.3).         Productive alliances among private entrepreneurs, nongovernmental
organizations, and government agencies would be strengthened in Phase 11, not only for the market
chains, but also to provide catalytic technical services to jump-start the adoption of market-led
innovations in agricultural ventures. The Project would continue to operate as the promoter of the NAIS
framework of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) within a broader public agricultural sector that involves
other institutions such as the National Agricultural Research and Extension Institute (INIEA) and
publicly funded agricultural universities.

Phase IZZ Details. Phase I11of the Program would consolidate systems for policy, regulation, operation,
and financing of a pluralistic agricultural technology system, leading to increased farmer adoption of
economically and environmentally sound technology. The system would be based on private-sector-led
institutionalpluralism in both implementation and financing. Farmers and other stakeholders would have
an increased participation in the governance of the system. Strategic national research programs would be
generating information and technologies to support adaptive research and extension programs.
Agricultural training institutions and information systems would effectively support the sector technology
programs.    Competitive allocation of resources would be central to the financing strategies. The
involvement of the NAIS thus would be a result of investment by both the public and private sectors,
which are expected to be more dynamic and sustainable. At the end of this Program, a permanent Focal
Point within the MOA would be responsible for policy, regulation, public financing, and international
cooperation of the NAIS in Peru, thereby ensuring continuity of activities and policy direction
commenced duringthe life cycles of the three Projects (APLPhases I,    11,and111).
In terms of individual outputs of the Phase 111Project, it would continue to serve farmers and farmer
organizations throughout the country, and would fund about 1,040 adaptive research and extension
subprojects. An additional 20 grants would strengthen strategic research and extension support programs.
Participating farmers would have demonstrable increases in production and income, and significant areas
would benefit from improved NRM systemsusing new technologies.

                   PERU: AgriculturalResearchandExtensionAPL PhaseI1
Project Description and Development Objective
This Project (of four years' duration, 2005-09) is the second phase of a three-phase Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) (expected overall project costs: 41.98 US$ million; Bank's share: 25.0 million, GOP: 6.39
million, others: 10.59 million) that aims to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the Peruvian
agricultural sector through the generation and adoption of environmentally sound technologies
disseminated by a private-sector-led and decentralized innovation system. Phase I1would contribute to
the overall Project goal by expanding and strengthening a demand-driven rural agricultural innovation
system in Peru that i s pluralistic, decentralized, and led by the private sector. During this phase the
project will be extended nationwide from the five regions covered in the first Phase and will mainly assist
in developing a modernized service market. Phase 11of the project will also establish Technological
Innovation Policy Focal Point within the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) that will be responsible for
policy formulation and coordination of public investments, which will contribute to the sustainability of
the national agricultural innovation system. The primary beneficiaries of the Project would be the rural
poor and vulnerable populations (including indigenous and women) nationwide. The project will
mainstream support to rural women by funding a specialized funding window for rural women
organizations. Two other important innovations with regard to vulnerable groups and sub-sectors are: (a)
higher ratings to proposals of research subprojects designed to rescue indigenous knowledge of plants
and/or indigenous agricultural systems; and (b) informal training of local indigenous young people on
basic skills of veterinary or agricultural practices so as to create improved service market.

The Loan amount for Phase I1of the Project has been reduced to US$25m from an initial amount of
US$SOm proposed at the beginning of the first phase. The reasons for this reduction are the limitedfiscal
space available inthe nationalbudget and the level of indebtednessallotted to the Ministry of Agriculture.
This reduction in the Loan amount in Phase I1will be reflected in a reduced overall Loan amount of
US$9lmfor the combined three phases of the APL compared to the amount of US$116mproposed at the
beginningof the Program.
The Phase I1 Project would continue to be implemented by the MOA (INCAGRO-PMU) using the
ongoing Phase IProject's institutional framework, with some modifications (see Annex 6, Figure A.6.1).
Other key actors in this framework include the M O A and other scientific institutions such as publicly and
privately funded universities, Regional Government representatives, and several alliance partner
organizations representing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and local authorities (municipal,
district, and departmental).
The Project will build on the lessons and experiences of Phase I,such as: (a) the competitive funding
model of agricultural research and extension that worked because of transparency, inclusion, quality,
efficiency, and legitimacy in the eyes of the beneficiaries and financing agencies; (b) investment in
demand-driven research alone is insufficient to address long-term problems where the allocation of funds
to strategic research issues are essential for the viability of a comprehensive program; (c) adequate
attention must be given to ensure dissemination of subprojects that are inherently dispersed, and to avoid
duplication unless it i s warranted due to agro-ecological adaptation and inherent social differences (that
is, preferences of social groups); and (d) continuous monitoring and evaluation (M&E) i s critical to
ensure that this complex, demand-driven, decentralized process produces and transfers high-quality
researchresults to the beneficiaries.
Phase I1follows the premises that: (a) the long-term strategic vision of investments in both adaptive
research and extension capacity and the strategic research capacity of the National Agricultural
Innovation System (NAIS) would yield increased employment generation, and income, and would



                                                       36

improve the well-being of the population; (b) direct involvement and leverage of funds through private
sector participation increases the quality and quantity of the market of agricultural services and products;
(c) broader application of the implementation experiencesand research outputs of Phase Iin three macro-
regions has direct application in all other macro-regions of the country and would reduce the risks of
investment, taking into account the positive and negative lessons; and (d) increased attention i s required
to stimulate or integrate the other scientific players of the NAIS in Project activities, that is, the National
Agricultural Research and Extension Institute (INIEA), the national and regional university system, other
donors that fund agricultural research (Annex 2), international organizations active in Peru, and large
multinationals that are deeply involved in the productionchain.
The components are briefly described below. The technical details and supporting study reports of each
component and the implementation plan are in the Project file. Annex 12 gives a list of all working
papers, reports of commissioned studies, and other documents used during appraisal.

Description of Project Components
The Project would be comprised of four components to be implementedover four years: (a) strengthening
the market for innovation services (Component 1); (b) strengthening the national agricultural researchand
development system (Component 2); (c) policy formulation, information, quality, and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) (Component 3); and (d) ProgramProject implementation (Component 4). The overall
Phase I1APL Project takes a three-pronged approach to expanding and strengthening the rural agricultural
innovation system in Peruthrough three technical components and a Project implementationcomponent.
Component 1. Strengthening the Marketfor Znnovation Services
Expected cost: US$20.94 (Bank share: US$14.49 million; GOP: US$0.72 million; Others: US$5.72
million).
The aim of this component is to advance the development of a decentralized market for professional
services for agricultural innovation.     It will strengthen producer organizations as clients of quality
services, and improve entrepreneurial capacity of private service providers. The result will be a more
efficient market for services. Special emphasis will be given to the development of instruments that
would ensure equitable participation opportunities to vulnerable groups such as organizations of
indigenous and women's groups. To realize this objective, Component 1will: (a) finance a Competitive
Fund that will co-finance subprojects in adaptive research and extension based on business plans that
reflect producer demands, including the vulnerable groups such as indigenous populations and women's
organizations; (b) co-finance local participants forums, internships of pre-professionals, and training
workshops, to improve the administrative capacity of organizations and agribusiness producers, and to
strengthen the capacity of the suppliers with a managerial orientation to provision of services. The
participation of technical representatives of Regional Governments of the macro-regions would be
ensured in the evaluation, priority setting, and negotiation of subproject proposals for the competitive
fund. Implementationof the competitive fund will be decentralized at the macro-region level. The local
capacity to formulate and implement innovative subprojects that contribute to regional agricultural
competitiveness will be strengthened.
Investment Approach.         The strategy of intervention of this component postulates that, through
innovations and increased participation of producers in the market of services and the innovation system,
solutions would be provided for market-related production problems, that is, improved yield and quality,
and agricultural competitiveness, thereby reducing poverty, and making better use of natural resources.
Promotion of development of the market of services specialized in innovation is therefore crucial. On the
demand side, the following problems have been identified: (a) low capacity to pay for services by a
majority of small producers; (b) a tradition of free provision on the part of the public sector; (c) low
valuation of the services of innovation for improvement of competitiveness; and (d) limited information
available on critical aspects of service provision and its advantages. The supply side can be described as:

only source of income. Given the limited array of resources, a structural limitation exists to improve their
well-being through the adoption of innovations that improve competitiveness, thereby reducing their need
to participate in the competitivefunds.
Group II (high productive ejjiciency and low articulation with the market): These are small producers
located in communities and which, over the years, have learned to handle diversified complex production
systems, These producers operate in a framework of risk and uncertainty in production and market, the
restrictions of which limit serious adoption of profitable technologies through the fund. This producer
group will adopt a technology that gives higher yield, but at greater risk. These poor but efficient
producers are continuously looking to improve their production and increase their incomes by improving
their negotiating position with buyers. The lack of working capital, transport costs; reduced scales of
production, absence of a storage infrastructure, and lack of information are major constraints in getting
their productionto the market.
Group III (low productive ejjiciency and high articulation with the market): These producers have
adequate resources to generate full use of the economy, but have low levels of production efficiency.
These systems are well articulated to the market. A major constraint i s lack of knowledge to adopt
technological innovationsthat allow them to improve resource use efficiency and, therefore, its income.
Group IV (high productive ejjiciency and high articulation with the market): These producers have
introduced important technological changes in production through the adoption of technological
innovations, with elevated levels of efficiency in the handling of its production systems and improved
yields and income, obtaining the benefits of modernization. These technological changes include: (a)
production structure (introduction of new cultivars with improved quality with a better cost-benefit ratio);
(b) technology (adoption of new processes, for which the provision of services of extension of quality
played a decisive role); (c) management (development of managerial capacity allowing entry to new
markets); and (d) improved access to limited resources (that is, credit). An important change i s in
forming new gremial organizations and new behaviors in their managementusingan enterprise approach
that allows producer associations to demand better prices differentiated by quality of the product, and to
pay higher prices to members of the producer association.
Agricultural Technology Fund (ATF)for Strengtheningthe Marketfor Innovation Services
To realize the above-stated objectives and reach the targeted beneficiaries, the main instrument of
Component 1 will be a competitive fund that will co-finance the following subprojects, based on a
business plan that reflects producer demands, including the vulnerable groups: (a) Extension services
subprojects; (b) Adaptive Research services subprojects; (c) Capacity-building and technical assistance
(extension) subprojects for the improvement of agribusinesses led by organizations of Indigenous
Populations; and, (d) Capacity-building and technical assistance (extension) subprojects for the
improvement of agribusinesses ledby organizations of Rural Women.
Implementation of the competitive fund would be decentralized by macro-region, region, and local level.
The participation of technical representatives of Regional Governments of the macro-regions would be
ensured in the evaluation, priority setting, and negotiation of subproject proposals for the competitive
fund, The local capacity to formulate and implement innovative subprojects that contribute to regional
agriculturalcompetitiveness would be strengthened.
Key design points of the Component regarding the approach and strategy of intervention are the
following: (a) competitive allocation of resources; (b) co-financing as payment for services on the part of
organizations of producer clients of services. The degree of co-financing will be differentiated depending
on the degree of development of the market for services in the zone, and the type of market and improved
goods; (c) decentralization of the implementationof the fund, which will include the participation of local
actors in the decision-making; (d) allocation of resources will be differentiated according to the
characteristics of the target population to promote equitable participation (special instruments for



                                                    39

populations with particular limitations such as indigenous populations and women's organizations); and
(e) emphasis on strengthening the managerial capacity of agribusiness and organizations of clients and
suppliers.
The competitive fund will have the following support activities:

  0 Participatory local forums for diffusion of the Component; facilitating interactions at the local level of
     service clients and providers, and with regional and local authorities; and promoting diagnostic
     studies on competitiveness at the macro-region level, and the formulation in alliance with regional
     govemments o f action plans inwhich the innovations will play an important role.
  0 Promotional and training workshops in agribusiness methods, such as business plans, service plans of
    extension and adaptive research, logistical frameworks, balanced score card, and so forth. The
    participation of technical representatives of the Regional and Local Governments will be encouraged
    to strengthentheir capacity in technological innovations.
  0 Pre-professional training programs on: (a) practices for the improvement of the formulation and
    execution of subprojects; and (b) strengthening of producer organizations in subjects related to
    handling of design tools and management of agribusinesses such as business plans.
  0 Panels for technical evaluation of subprojects at different stages (profiles, proposals), which will
     include participation of technical representativesof each macro-Regional Government.
(a) ExtensionSubpr0.iect.sbased on business plans that address producer demands and provide solutions
to production and market problems. Subprojects of extension services will consist of the provision of
professional and specialized services oriented to addressing the demand by technical expertise, i.e.,
production, post-harvest processing, and commercialization of farming and forest products; and oriented
to improving administration and management of agribusiness and producer organizations. The priorities
will be based on demand for services as a derivative demand of the market for goods, and in agreement
with the strategic programs financed by the Component 2. Participating institutions will be the different
operators that provide innovation services, from the public and private sectors, including producer
organizations that provide services. On the demand side, the project will support producer groups as
clients of the service that are organized and have the ability to present proposals.           Collaborating
institutions, public and private, can also participate. Participation in the competitive fund must be
organized through the constitution of strategic alliances between these partners, where producer
organizations play the most important role.
ImplementationProtocol. The processof awarding subprojects would have several steps:
Stage 1: Presentation and selection of profiles. The profile of extension service subprojects constitutes
the first element of selection for the awarding of resources, and must contain a clear and concise idea in
terms of the strategy to eliminate or control the identified problem within the context of the Project
objectives. Profiles of subprojects will be selectedbasedon the following criteria: (a) identificationof the
central problem, (b) outputs and sustainability, (c) technical and scientific merit, (d) contribution to the
development of market of services, and (e) strengths of the strategic alliance.
Stage 2: Presentation and evaluation of proposals. The proposal must contain a sustainable business
plan, a service plan (supported by a logical framework and a balanced score card) and a budget for service
costs. The Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) will conduct the technical evaluation of the proposals. The
TEP will be made up of national and international technical specialists of recognized expertise and
experience in evaluation of Extension Services subprojects.           Structuring the TEP will be done in
coordination with the technical representatives of the Regional Governments in each macro-region. With
the purpose of assuring a rigorous evaluation, a two-step approach will be taken: (a) the first stage is
eliminatory, and consists of the evaluation of criteria of output and sustainability, and structure and
content using a business plan and logical framework; (b) in the second stage of evaluation, the following
criteria will be used: technical and scientific merit, contribution to development of the market of services,



                                                       40

strength of the strategic alliance, and social and environmental aspects and agreement with the Project's
high-priority subjects.
Stage 3: Negotiation of the winning proposals with the Special Award Committee. The financial and
technical negotiation will be done with the Special Committee for awarding resources with the purpose of
determining what subprojects will become recipients of the fund. The Special Committee will negotiate
with the representatives of the proposal and interested organizations using the following criteria: (a)
incorporation of recommendations formulated by members of the TEP; (b) incorporation of
recommendations formulated by the Project team; and (c) justification of the Financial Proposal.
Stage 4: Awarding of resources of the Competitive Fund. Grants will be awarded to proponents who
fulfill the requirements established in the Agreement subscribed to, in negotiation with the Special
Committee. Final results of awarding of resources will be witnessed by a notary public and publishedin
the Project web page.
Stage 5: The agreement will be in effect when all parties have signed it.
Amounts and percentage of co-financing: The maximum Project amount will be US$62,500 for
Extension Services proposals. The annual percentage of Project co-financing will be, in average 70%,
depending on criteria indicating the degree of development of the market of services. Around 30% of co-
financing will be by the project partners (strategic alliances), mainly producer organizations. If other
institutions that are part of alliances collaborate with co-financing, producer organizations that are the
clients of the service must obligatorily co-finance at least half of the percentage corresponding to the
alliance (i.e., 15% in average).
Eligible expenditures from the fund are: (a) honorariums of the Technical Coordinator, extension
agents, and legal advisers; (b) consulting services for training and subject matter specialists; (c) training
(cost of short courses, visits, assistantships) covering such areas as travel allowances and transportation;
(d) recurrent expenses (travel allowances, passages, fuel, maintenance of equipment and vehicles,
telephone communication, access to the Internet); (e) goods (material for the activities of extension and
diffusion of results, inputs for demonstration and diffusion of results, and the purchase and renovation of
smaller equipment for extension); (f) expenses of Subproject Administration ("overhead", which is
expenses related to administration of the subproject, such as honorariums of administrators and/or
accountants, and office equipment); and (i)M&Eexpenses (consultancies for activities related to M&E).
(b) Subprojects in Adaptive Research based on business plans that address producer demands and
provide solutions to production and market problems. Subprojects of adaptive research services will
consist of implementing adaptive research experiments to solve problems that limit productivity and
competitiveness of agricultural producers using existing technologies that were successfully verified in
other situations and circumstances, but the results of which have to be adapted for use in specific regions
and locations. In summary, the adaptive research subprojects will allow obtaining solutions that are not
available to the specific problems of a given region. Other conditions of strategic alliances participation,
subproject proposal content, the process of awarding subprojects, amounts and percentage of co-
financing, and eligible expenditures from the fund are similar to the extension subprojects scheme,
described previously.
(c) Capacity-building and technical assistance subprsiects for the improvement of arrribusinesses
led bv organizations of Indigenous Populations (Andean and Amazonian). The objective i s to ensure
that indigenous populations will have equitable access to the market of innovation services, as a mean of
improving their agribusiness, respecting their economic, social, and cultural particular characteristics.
This special fund also attempts to contribute to the improvement of the determinants of social and ethnic
exclusion that indigenous populations face.
"Capacity building services" refers to activities aimed at fostering the development of a body of
knowledge and skills in the producers contractingthe service in question. "Technical assistance services"

are aimed at solving a specific problem, and the provider of the service is not required to transmit their
knowledgeto the producers contracting the service inquestion. Capacity buildingand technical assistance
services come under the heading of extension services. The subproject implementation period will not
exceeda maximum of (12) months.
On the side of the service recipients, groups of producers-men andor women-can participate, provided
they are active members of peasant or native (respectively Andean or Amazonian indigenous)
communities, as the case may be. Producers may be organized as communal businesses, producers'
association or other organization.      On the side of service providers, these can be individuals or
institutions-whether    public or private, national or intemational-engaged in providing capacity building
and technical assistance services. They can also be service providers, indigenous producer organization
leaders, or the organizations themselves, provided they supply this type of services. Individuals or
institutions supporting the organization of producers ("partners") will help formulate and execute the
subprojects. Any other public or private entities with an interest in contributing to the success of the
subprojects are also free to collaborate. Organized indigenous producers and their partners, and any other
interested collaborating entity will make up the Strategic Alliance in charge of presenting subproject
profiles and proposals, and, if they win the award, of executing the subprojects. The Strategic Alliances
are led by the organization of indigenous producers. A beneficiary producer organization must contribute
cash funds to co-finance payment of the services received. Collaborating entities may also contribute
monetary contributions towards the co-financing effort.
ImplementationProtocol. The processof awardingsubprojects will haveseveralsteps:
         Dissemination of information on the finding window and the service market strengthening
         project creating it. Promoters will work in the peasant and native communities coming under the
          scope of the call for proposals to publicize its principal aspects and the Project's intervention
          strategy.
         Local demand identification fora. Local fora pursue two specific objectives: (a) make the
         Project's approach known to producer groups interested in applying, and to service providers
         interested in participating; and (b) facilitate the identification of capacity building and technical
         assistance demands by indigenous producers.          The intent here is to identify and prioritize
         demands at that stage, so that they are used as guidelines in the drawing up of profiles and
         proposals.
          Callfor ongoingpresentation-within     the established deadlines-of    profiles.
          Capacity building workshopsfor drawing up profiles: local training activities will be used to
         build capacities for the presentation of profiles by the producer organizations interested in
         participating.
          Ongoing profile evaluatiodselection: the profiles presented will be evaluated and selected by an
          outside Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). Once a profile i s selected, the producer organizations
          who have submitted it will be invited to draw up and prepare proposals and, in addition, will be
          awarded a prize. The prize will consist of co-financing for drawing up the proposals with the
         helpof trained proposal developers (hopefully, the beneficiaries' future partners).
         Building the portfolio of potential partners: any individuals and institutions interested in
         partnering with the producers' organizations in the preparation and execution of the subprojects.
         Once identified, the potential partners will be introduced to producers with short-listed profiles
         who will choose those they wish to include into their alliances. Once accepted, partners will play
         their supporting role from drawingup the proposal to executing the project.Work on the partners'
         portfolio will begin simultaneously with the call for proposals.
         Personalized advice will be provided for the preparation of proposals.                      Proposal
         developedpartners chosen by the producers with short-listed profiles will provide it on a co-
         finance basis.

        the proposals submitted by producers. Once the capacity building process has beencompleted-
        and provided it is successful-the    service providers will be certified to guarantee the quality and
        relevance of the service they provide for the purposes of meeting producers' demands by
        implementing appropriate methodologies. INCAGRO experts will supply capacity building for
        the service providers, along with other service providers. Once certified, the qualified service
        providers will be introduced to producers with short-listed profiles, who will choose those whose
        services they wish to retain, which will then be included in the producers' proposals. The
        proposals will evaluate the relevance of the service providers and the capacity building and
        technical assistance services they plan to provide. Work on the service providers' portfolio will
        beginsimultaneously with the call for proposals.
     i) Ongoingpresentation-within       the establisheddeadlines-of      profiles.
    j)  Ongoing evaluatiodselection of proposals: once submitted, the proposals will be evaluated and
        selected by an outside Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). During this stage of the process, the
        prize awarded to producer organizations with proposals approved by the TEP will consist of co-
        financing for the execution of the proposal-i.e.,         co-financing for the implementation of the
        capacity buildingand technical assistance plans set forth inthe proposal.
     k) Negotiation of the proposals selected: the producer organizations whose proposals have been
        approved by the TEP will be invited to negotiate their technical and financial terms with the
        ATF's Special FundAward Committee.
     1) Fundaward once the terms of the agreement entered into as a result of the negotiation process
        are met, the ATF's Special FundAward Committee will award to each producer organization that
        has come out the winner the co-finance funds for implementing their proposals.
     m) The contract is signedand INCAGROProject makes the first disbursement.

Unlikethe ATF's regular extension services and adaptive researchfundingwindows, this special funding
window for indigenous peoples (coming under the category of special competitive funds) gives
participating producer organizations the option to reformulate their profiles and proposals (as the case
may be) on an ongoing basis, to allow for the TEP's comments and reservations, and to resubmit them
before the final deadline for the reception of profiles and proposals.

Amounts andpercentageof co-financing: The amounts and percentages co-financed by the Project and
by the producer organizations receiving the services as beneficiaries (and by any collaborating entities)
will vary within a range to be set according to the level of development of the service market relevant for
each subproject, the profitability of the agribusiness in question, and the payment capacity for the
services. It i s estimated that Project's share of co-financing will average 70%. This percentage will be
applicable for each budget item. The remaining 30% will be co-financed-in             cash-by    the beneficiary.
If producerorganizationhasstruckastrategicpartnershipwithoneormorecollaboratingentities,they
  the
can contribute to the cash share of the co-financing, provided the producers' share i s at least 50% of the
remaining30% (Le. at least 15%) of the total.

Eligible expenditures from the fund are: (a) contract services (fees for capacity building and technical
assistance services; fees for legal advisors); (b) consultancy services (consultants on specialized capacity
building and technical assistance services for agriculture and livestock producers; consultants on legal issues
concerning agriculture and livestock producers); (c) capacity building expenses (cost of internships, guided
visits and other training courses for members of agriculture and livestock producer groups; payment of fees for
third party services connected with capacity building activities; per diems, tickets and/or fuel expenses incurred
to enable beneficiary producers to attend the internships, guided visits, short courses, etc.); (d) operation
expenses (per diems, tickets; fuel; maintenance of equipment and vehicles; phone calls; intemet access); (e)
consumables (materials for capacity building and technical assistance, and dissemination of outcomes/results;
inputs for demonstration and dissemination of outcomes/results); (0 equipment and durable goods (minor

defined, incurredto bolsterthe success of the businessplanandincrease the impact of the extensionservices for
agnbusiness improvement.
(d) Capacity-buildingand technical assistance subprojects for the improvement of agribusinesses
led by organizations of rural women, The objective is to ensure that rural women organizations will
have equitable access to the market of innovation services, as a mean of improving their agribusiness,
respecting their economic, social, and cultural particular characteristics. This special fund also attempts
to contribute with the improvement of the determinants of the social, ethnic and gender exclusion they
face. Other conditions of strategic alliances participation, subproject proposal content, the process of
awarding subprojects, amounts and percentage of co-financing, and eligible expenditures from the fund
are similar to the capacity-building and technical assistance subprojects for Indigenous Populations
scheme, described previously.

Component 2. Strengthening the National Agricultural Research and Development System
Expected cost: US$14.00 million (Bank share: US$7.27 million; GOP: US$0.40 million; others: US$6.33
million).
The aim of Component 2 i s to strengthen the agricultural research system in strategic areas of national
importance of the NAIS. The component would support "centers of excellence" in emerging areas of


                                                 45

science and technology that are critical to increasing competitiveness of the agricultural sector. This
component will specifically address issues on: (a) increasing the capacity to generate scientific and
technological information for innovation, and (b) developing competitiveness and capacities for the
management of innovation. A Competitive Fund will be the main instrument used in achieving these
goals.
Justification.  The new opportunities and challenges for agricultural competitiveness are based on
scientific technological developments that in turn contribute more to the added value that comes from the
knowledge. Evidence exists that as markets are opened and subsidies are reduced for producers, the
technical change plays a more critical role in the improvement of agrarian competitiveness. Equally,
because of the signing of the proposed Free Trade Agreements with the United States, the European
Commission, and MERCOSUR, an increase is projected in the demand for cattle products, and for high-
value fruits, vegetables, and other products of agricultural biodiversity. This demand for high-value foods
has immediate implications for research and development (R&D) policies, including the magnitude of
public financing, researchpriorities, the intellectualproperty regulations that affect the incentives derived
from innovation, and the trade regulationdecisions that affect the use of modem technologies.
It has been verified that the agrarian economy of Peru is basedon goods and servicesthat come from their
biodiversity. Currently, 65 percent of agriculture depends on native genetic resources, 95 percent of the
cattle ranches are sustainedon natural grass, and 99 percent of the forest industry uses the natural forests
and native species. In that sense, their characterization, conservation, and use are at the forefront of the
value-added knowledge chain of modem technologies, and to transformtheir comparative advantagesinto
market opportunities. As an example, biotechnology fulfills a key role in the incorporation of value
without neglecting the standardization and quality of end products, especially with reference to: (a)
development and application of friendly technologies of vegetal and animal protection in fragile
ecosystems and of new post-harvest technology; and (b) new emergent R&D areas, associatedwith new
demand for agricultural products and services tied to the development of techniques to handle renewable
natural resources (ground and water), in which farming and forest production is sustained. This implies
initial high-priority interventions in strategic programs of genetic resources and pre-breeding,
biotechnology, and vegetal and animal protection (under a concept of handling integrated pest
management [PM], diseases, and weeds), to be gradually reinforced with other programs like post-
harvest processing,handling of renewable natural resources, and organic agriculture.
During Phase I,  the Project demonstrated the demand for this type of assistance with the response to calls
for proposals on strategic research subprojects where a large number of proposals were received on
subjects related to genetic resources, biotechnology, and integrated pest management. It also illustrated
weaknesses inthe NAIS by the small number of proposals received in thematic areas such as post-harvest
technology. The opportunities and challenges generated by the new investment failed in areas where
R&D was weak, because of a lack of professionals (below critical mass), poorly equipped laboratories,
and a shortage of financial resources. This situation reflects the limited action of the State in relation to
R&D, and the resultant unfulfilled demands for innovation in the sector. These constraints are further
compounded by a lack of vision as regards research programs, and the lack of fundingpriorities.
Strategic Services Development Fund (FDSE)for Strengthening Strategic Research Capacity
Component 2 will administer a competitive fund to co-finance: (a) the development of research
subprojects in high-priority strategic research programs; (b) development of the capacity of public
research institutes to co-finance strategic research activities targeting public funds for the smallholder
agriculture; and (c) the regional implementation of competitive training curricular programs for extension
agents; and (d) the degrees and sabbaticals for specialization in the high-priority strategic programs for
researchersinemerging national and regional "centers of excellence."
(a) Strategic research subproiects. This fund will finance the generation of scientific and technological
information and technological development of new products and processes as a result of R&D in strategic



                                                      46

programs of three selectedhigh-priority thematic areas. At the beginningof the Project, priority strategic
programs will be: (a) Genetic Resources and Pre-Breeding, (b) Agro-Industrial Biotechnology, and (c)
Integrated Plant and Animal Protection (with emphasis in IPM). From the second year, and gradually,
three new priority programs will be integrated on: (d) post-harvest technology, (e) Renewable Integrated
Natural Resource Management (INRM including land, water and agro-forestry), and (0 Conservation
Agriculture.
This Fundwould also partially finance the development of the public sector capacity to generatescientific
and technological information, to develop new products and processes as a result of research and
development (R&D) in a program of strategic research for smallholder agriculture in Peru, in a manner
where a public research institute concentrate its efforts, technical capacity and financial resources in the
implementation of a number of priority and strategic subprojects of value and delivery of public goods.
Given the importance of smallholder agnculture and its inherent problems, the Project has a special
interest in financing a strategic program to address these problems and for which INIEA i s well
positioned to implement given its presence in various eco-regions of the country. This would require
certain conditions for the reform of INIEA as outlined in the Policy Letter, which accompanies this
operation, and if met this strategic program could be financed in INIEA.
Priority Setting: Workshops would be convened at the national level to prioritize target areas of strategic
research programs, accreditation programs for pre-professionals, and regional priorities, which would be
approved by the Executive Council (ExC). The Policy Focal Point under the guidance of the Science
Council (SC) will identify these priorities based on the NAIS agenda, to address researchable issues and
their impact.
Participating organizations: The institutions involved at the national and regional level will be
universities; research institutes; governmental laboratories; experimental stations; NGOs, and agri-
businesses and producer organizations with demonstrated capacity, institutional commitment, and
availability to maintain and finance, through networks and regional or national strategic programs, in a
sustainable manner. The participants' potential to form strategic alliances, will be representedby: (a) a
local institution leader; (b) integrating a critical number of national or regional and international
institutions; (c) complementing specialties; (d), resources and equipment; and (e) the comparative
advantages of each partner. The competitive fund will finance the research subprojects, as well as
strengthening human capacity and infrastructure, with a vision to form "centers of excellence." The
potential clients of the fund will be about 600 research groups in plant genetic resources; about 100
groups in zoo-genetic resources; more than 210 groups in different areas of the agro-industrial, nutrition,
and ecological biotechnology; and about 50 groups in phyto- and zoo-sanitary research. A large majority
of these groups have weaknesses in quality, resources, and access to updated scientific information and
sources of financing.
Presentation of strategic research subproject profiles:       The Project Management Unit (PMU) will
organize a call for profile proposals (pe@les) in the priority areas.         This call would include the
publication of the rules and regulations that govern the Fund and the adjudication of the proposals. This
would be in accordance with the procedures statedin the OperationalManual (OM), and the various steps
followed would be similar to those described in Component 1. The P M U would also publish workshop
events that would orient the client in project formulation and the requirements neededfor participation in
the fund.
Presentation of strategic research subproject proposals: The PMU will make the second call for the
Technical and Financial Proposals from institutions the profiles of which were selected in the first stage,
giving them the standard electronic formats per the OM. The PMU will also ratify the programming of
capacity-buildingworkshops for this stage.
Revision of profiles and strategic research subproject proposals: The PMU will check the profiles and
proposals for their fulfillment of and conformity with the legal conditions demanded, with emphasis on

of competence required and the required specialties, capacities, abilities, and skills. In the first year, an
occupational analysis and priority setting for three macro-regions will be done (Phase 1 co-financed
subprojects on extension services). Gradually, priorities for the seven other macro-regions will be set, so
that at the end of the third year all macro-regions of Peru will be covered.
Participating organizations: The qualified institutions are universities (especially agrarian), institutes for
agrarian technical education, training centers for agrarian-rural development, and public and private
institutions that establish alliances with scientific, regional, or national research and innovation
institutions for development. The first approach will capitalize on the experience of Phase 1 macro-
regions where institutional weaknesses were identified in the regional training programs, especially by its
isolation from the national education system. A total of 20 potential educational organizations will
participate in this competitive fund, which can establish strategic alliances with 40 NAIS and/or
international programs, for the incorporation of experts in competitive subjects, with the of objective of
offering these curricular programs to more than 500 extension agents working with 30 extension service
operators. The PMU will gradually incorporate the new regions for financing of Curricular programs,
contracting consultancies to establish the macro-regional baseline, which will include: (a) identification of
actors in the market of services to be developed; (b) identification of competencies that are demandedfor
the sustainable rural development of the region; (c) identification of institutional and professional
capacities to address this demand; (d) decentralized promotion of training programs; and (e) estimation of
the amount of partial subsidies necessary to establish curricular programs that allow institutions to
establish or share the extension services for regionalrural development.
Presentation of profiles of curricular programsfor training of extension agents: The PMUwill convene
at the macro-regional level a first call of Profiles by interested institutions. Awarding of resources will be
competitive according to the priorities identified, establishing the institutional, legal, and financial
requirements, and the criteria of selection, evaluation, and qualification, accompanied by a standard
electronic format of the standard profile and groups of the legal requirements, per OM guidelines. The
PMUwill also call for the programming workshop, targeting directors, specialists, and planners of the
interested institutions to implement training in the formulation of profiles and proposals of curricular
programs, strategy development, and intellectual property issues.
Presentation of proposals of curricular programs of training of extension agents: The PMUwill make a
second call of the Technical Proposals and Financing of the Curricular Programs to the institutions the
profiles of which were selected in the first stage. Standard electronic formats will be given for the
presentation of the technical and financial proposal (OM guidelines).             The PMU will ratify the
programmingof training workshops inthis second stage.

Revision of profiles and proposals of curricular programs of extension agents:              The profiles and
proposals will be revised by the PMU, which will verify the fulfillment and the conformity of the legal
conditions neededto participate in the program, with emphasis on strength and pertinence of the strategic
alliance and specialists team, the institution, the alliance, hiringof professionals, and their regionalorigin.
In each stage, the PMU will contract, according to OM guidelines, individual consultants for the PET,
with a minimumof six members, by region, including: an expert each in training competence evaluation,
adult education methods, and education technology, and at least three experts in specific thematic areas.
The criteria for selection of profiles will include: (a) the coherence of the competency to be reached with
the identified training needs, (b) the technical merit of the methodology and proposed instruments of
training, (c) the institutional capacity developed or to be developed to ensure sustainability of the
proposed curricular program, (d) its contribution to the improvement of quality and competitiveness of
extension services, (e) its contribution to regional agrarian development, and (0 its potential for
replicability and accessibility to the target population.
The criteria of evaluation and qualification of the technical merit of the proposals will include: (1) the

   Postgraduate Research Fellowship Program. The competitive fund for research scholarships for
researchers will finance sabbatical and post-degree training, directed to professional researchers of
agricultural sciences involved in public and private research institutions that receive incentives to become
national or regional centers of excellence. The level of training and specialization at the Masters or
Doctorate levels will be determined by the needs of the professional critical mass to strengthen high-
priority strategic programs, as elaborated earlier in the document.       The PMU will follow awarding
procedures as indicated in the OM. A package of postgraduate scholarships will be awarded, with the
objective of providing national or international experience. The identification of prestigious academic
centers and the selection of candidates, and the management of handling of postgraduate programs will be
according to the priorities indicatedabove.
Priority setting: The thematic areas of training and specialization will be selected from the priorities of
each region, and at the national level as generatedby each Strategic Research Program, having considered
the necessary professional critical mass for the efficient management, generation, and use of scientific
information, technological innovation, and regional and national agrarian competitiveness.
Postgraduate programs with potential for being selected: The entities contracted for the management of
research scholarships will identify the postgraduate programs in the prioritized thematic areas, and in
national or international universities, and will produce a database based on the criteria of quality and
pertinence. The selection of the postgraduateprograms will take into account the historical prestige of the
academic center and its postgraduate program, the educational platform of the university, national and
international educational visitors, and research themes within the program to be developed by the
scholarship holders. The entities contracted for the management of research scholarships will present a
potential program to the PMU. The PMU will review the strict fulfillment of the requirements and will
ask for the specialized opinion of the SC, and report their recommendations for approval by the ExC.
Sabbatical and Postgraduatefellowship candidates: The professionals of regional or national institutions
who conduct researchin priority themes will be the potential candidates. The institution will have to be a
participant in the Project as a center of excellence, and present a plan in agreement with the identified
priorities in the innovation system. The researchers will have to demonstrate their bond with the
institution, and to guarantee their return to the same after completing their studies, and also present a
high-quality research proposal within their center of excellence.           The entity contracted for the
management of research fellowship program will receive the proposals of candidates and, according to

Component 3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Information Sharing, and Policy for Innovation
Expected cost: US$5.53 million (Bank share: US$2.25 million; GOP: US$3.28 million).
The aim of Component 3 is to develop the institutional capacity of the public sector to formulate and
implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with the private sector, and regulate the quality
of the NAIS. The outcome would be the establishment of a Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point
in a modernized MOA that is responsible for the definition and implementation of policies that promote
and provide incentives on activities and investments in science, technology and innovations inthe sector.
The outputs would be: (a) institutionalization of processes, priorities, and policies to promote and protect
innovations with consensus within the system and policy definition in critical areas such as promotion of
public investments in science and agricultural technology, intellectual property rights, and public-private
partnerships; (b) validation of an M&E system to generate performance measurement standards to
measure the results of modemization of the NAIS services; and (c) a modernized and systematized
information system composed of virtual networks that will increase the sector's capacity to generate and
use systematizedand updated scientific and technological information.
Investment approach. DuringPhase 1of the Project, the decentralized technological program was begun
in three macro-regions I,V, and VI1 (see Annex 6, Table A.6.1). These three macro-regions were
selected based on their potential for increase in production, present relative deficiency of technological
services, and the existence of producer organizational capacity and interest. InPhase 11, the Project will
continue in those three macro-regions, and then gradually expand to the other regions, installingtwo new
units in the second year, and three more in the third year. This component responds to the need to
emphasize the intention of the Project to institutionalize, within the public agrarian sector (MOA), a focal
point for policies, standards, and promotion of an NAIS. Most of the institutions supported by Phase Iare
expected to compete for funds in Phase 11, which will assist in creating a critical mass of interventions.
The Phase Iset of subprojects also provides useful information to establish quality standards at the
process level, and for impact analysis. The identification of these implementation standards permits
establishment of emergent best practices more precisely in Phase 11, and to disseminate these best
practices for public and private resource allocation. This will have a positive effect on proposals of
quality standards and the generation of an agricultural information platform, and for better definition of
public sector policies.    The subprojects completed in Phase Iand in progress are the "seeds" or
gravitational centers that attract the next set of actors in the system, to establish physical and virtual
networks.
Responsibilities. This component would have the following responsibilities:




                                                     52

        to set up an efficient M&E systemto coordinate and provide feedback on all components and co-
        financed subprojects, and to propose best-practice standards for the benefit of research and
        extension services;
        to develop a sustainable information platform on science and technology, quality standards, and
        NAIS researchers (research and extension agents of the system) profiles, that is continuously
        updated;
        to propose definition and periodically review strategic programs of science, technology, and
        innovation with the private sector, and set priorities and agendas for these programs.
Activities of Component 3: The activities to be financed would be the following (Tables A.4.9 and
A.4.10): (a) studies and consultations on prospective technologies and technological forecasting,
elaboration of a concerted agenda of the innovation system, identification of the constraints on the
development, adoption, and dissemination of innovations, and definingpriorities and formulating policies
in potential strategic areas of innovations;       (b) an M&E system for subprojects using measuring
instruments that permit comparison of designs, identify best practices of quality, submit information to
the public scrutiny, reward the best subprojects, and ensure the achievement of results and desired
impacts.   The M&E system will therefore collate lessons based on the total Project, individual
subprojects, and related other projects, and maintain a system of continuous learning and feedback
leading to formulation of "sector quality standards" which, as best practices, will be diffused and also
recognized by means of appropriate awards; and (c) an information systemlplatform that is in the public
domain and enriched with data generated initially by subprojects, operational plans, and programs in
place, andlater by other actors of the sector and will be made available to all stakeholders of NAIS.

Implementation of the Project
Overview. The institutional framework of the Proyecto de Investigacidn y Extensio'n Agricdla para la
Innovacidn y Competitividad del Agro Peruano (INCAGRO) established by the Government under the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) during Phase Iof the APL Program that was proven effective would
continue to be used to implement the Phase I1Project. The Project Management Unit (PMU) would carry
out the overall coordination of the Project, with the oversight of the Executive Council (ExC) at the
national level, assisted by Macro Regions Consultative Councils (MRCC) in each region.                  The
composition of the PMU and implementing responsibilities of the subunits for each component are
described in detail in Annex 4 (also refer to Figure A.6.1). The PMU that is placed within the MOA
(operational line ministry) but outside the established institutional framework for agriculture or science
and technology provides the desired neutrality to address crosscutting issues entailed by the Project's
action plans, and to interact with various ministries on different issues. With regard to the flow of funds,
the M O A will conclude a loan agreement, and the Bank loan will be disbursed by direct payments to a
special account, and the fund disbursements will be channeled through the INCAGRO-PMU. A detailed
flow of funds for each component, and for funds targeting subprojects and decentralized units (DUs) is
described inAnnex 7.
Project Oversight and Advisory Functions
The Executive Council (ExC) i s the highest oversight body of the Project, which will be made up of high-
caliber people with appropriate technical knowledge and experience. The ExC, constituted by Ministerial
Resolution, will be presided over by the Minister of Agriculture that will provide policy direction for the
Project would include specialized committees for, inter alia, science, finance, and programs. The ExC
will have nine members, including the Chair of the Committee. The other members will be selected and
designated based on the merit of their outstanding work in the following sectors: (1) public and private
agricultural research; (2) public and private agricultural extension; (3) science, technology, and
innovation; (4) natural resources and the environment; (5) financing; (6) agricultural-based industry and
agro-export; and (7) vulnerable groups (organizations of rural women and indigenous communities). The
Executive Director of the Project will act as the Secretary of the ExC, being an ex officio member. The
Operational Manual (OM) of the Project that was approved by Ministerial Resolution will establish the
operational procedures of the ExC. The functions of the ExC will include: (a) selection of the Executive
Director; (b) approval of the OM; (c) approval of ExC regulations; (d) evaluation of the Project and
program implementation; (e) approval of the Annual Operational Plans; (f) revision and approval of the
periodic and annual reports; (g) approval of the annual budgets; (h) general evaluation of outputs; and (i)
providing information and analysis to the Minister of Agriculture on technological policies and proposals
of changes in programs and national policies on science, technology, and innovation. The members of the
ExC will be periodically changed without affecting the continuity of Project activities or losing the
strategic approachas statedin the OM.

Project Staffing Structure
The PMU staff composition and workflow, and decentralized Project implementation structure,
workflows, and staffing details are given in Figure A.6.1. The PMU would provide support for Project
coordination and administrative staff, procurement, financial management, reporting, and M&E for all
components. The Executive Project Director would report to the Deputy Minister of the MOA. The
PMUwill, among other things, act as the overall Project signatory in all agreements with subproject co-
financing and implementingentities.




                                                     57

The Executive Management of the PMU will be composed of four staff (1) the Executive Project
Director, who would be responsible for facilitating the interactions among different operational
components and Project units, and promoting development of activities of high technical and scientific
quality. Additional responsibilities will be to: assure the efficient administration of resources and M&E
activities of the Project, offer technical and scientific leadership to the Project, implement the decisions of

The process of expansion of the Project during its lifetime will be staggered annually as indicated in
Table A.6.2. A set of criteria that have been considered to select the decentralized macro-regions on an
annual basis will be accompanied with administrative offices established in each macro-region to
facilitate the administration of Project interventions. These criteria were: a) the key variables usedfor the
definition of the target population of the Project, as related to the productive efficiency and degree of
market definition and relationships with the market (presence of agro-industrial and product chains in
relation to the demand, public service operators and their capacity for technological innovation),
economic and infrastructure context; b) the potential for farming and forest resources to respond to the
globalization of the market (potential of impact of services for innovation); and c) aspectsthat harness the
success of the intervention strategy of the Project (greater institutional development - leading producer
organizations, greater capacity and disposition to the payment for services and greater relative
development of the market of services for innovation). Based on these criteria, the following sequence of
entry into decentralized macro-regions has been defined (Table A.6.3). The shaded boxes correspond to
the opening of new decentralized offices in the various DU's.

Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)Scheme
The M&E process has two objectives: (a) to attain efficient administration of resources and deliver the
planned Project deliverables, and (b) to ensure collaboration among diverse actors in order to multiply
benefits for the NAIS.
Implementation Mechanisms. Under the leadership of INCAGRO-PMU, the M&Eteam will produce the
Annual Operation Plans, Regional Annual Operation Plans, Semi-Annual Monitoring and Evaluation
Reports, External Evaluation by an independent entity, and Operational and Subproject Manuals, as
required. In addition to the subprojects evaluations using set indicator targets, the M&Eteam would also
consolidate information on the rural agricultural sector for the benefit of the Project. The quality of
delivery would be ensured by M&E analyses of the co-financed subprojects in comparison to market,
sector, and global standards.

Subproject Monitoring and Evaluation
Subproject Implementation at the Local Level.         The subproject cycle would include three stages:
formulation, implementation, and evaluation. The responsibility for formulation and quality of design
will reside with the respective promoters of the subproject proposals. In each cycle of the calls for
proposals, the selection of subprojects for funding and their implementation would be done in a public
and open manner using an appropriate tool kit expressing the current NAIS standards, and to orient the
operations to include recent advances in innovations. The monitoring process of subprojects duringtheir
implementation stage would ensure meeting set standards by adjusting as needed and by improving the
efficiency of resource allocation and use within the agreed activity plans. Since the final Project
beneficiaries are the rural small producers, they would play a key and active role in assessingthe delivery
of results of subprojects and the quality of services. Special attention would be given to the new
subprojects and to new alliances and partner institutions to ensure that the agreedrules are followed. The
main contribution of the Project is to follow a stringent and effective selection process, thereby assigning
the scarce resources to the most promising proposals, and to provide incentives to the implementing
agencies to make efficient use of such resources and achieve the most outputs as possible.
The PMU will enter into agreements with subproject implementing agencies (producer organizations,
community-based organizations, nongovemmental organizations (NGOs), universities, and other
organizations) to transfer the project funds as grants of the relevant Competitive Fund in order to execute
the subprojects at the local level. The Operations Manual will detail the ground rules for approving and
implementingthe subprojects.
Flow of Funds. In accordance with the institutional and implementation arrangement described above,
funds will flow from the PMU to the respective subprojects. The intermediary beneficiaries would be
public institutions, public-private partnerships in research, other alliances such as NGOs, producer
organizations, agribusiness consortiums, and so forth. The final targeted beneficiaries of this Project
would be the rural farmers, producers, agro-entrepreneurs, and consumers or end users, including
vulnerable groups such as indigenous populations and women.
Responsibilitiesof the M&EPlan
Planning. A Planning Specialist would be contracted by the ExC to: (a) document and guide the
directives on sector planning, orientation of the ExC, coordination of the administration of units, the
Annual Operational Plan (OP) that serves as the base for Project implementation, and the calendar of
agreements; (b) elaborate the continuing modifications and updates of the OP, and report advances,
modifications, and adjustments of the OP as needed; (c) evaluate the implementation progress of the OP
and prepare a Final Executive Report; (d) on behalf of the Project Director, using periodic progress
information provided by individual units, prepare Project information sheets for the use of various
national organizations and the Bank; and (e) prepare terms of references and monitor the work of Project
consultants.
Technical Team. A team of five Specialists would provide the necessary multidisciplinary expertise
requiredby the subprojects. The profiles of these Specialists are: (1) Unit Head; (2) Policy Specialist, to
conduct studies on agricultural productivity, ex ante and ex post analysis of economic impact, agricultural
income, and market studies, institutional development and investments in technological programs and
evaluation of the analytical framework of the NAIS; (3) an Agricultural Specialist, to conduct studies on
the impact of proposed technologies and their reliability, research and experimental design, and studies on
new farming systems and opportunities; (4) an Environmental Specialist, to conduct studies that aid in
developing procedures to mitigate adverse impact on the environment at the agricultural, community,
national, and regional level; identify negative impact potential of subprojects and recommend alternatives
to reduce damage; plan activities with beneficial environmental impacts and advise the Project on
environmental safeguards and give appropriate advice on ESRP; and (5) an Information Specialist, to
prepare and administer an up-to-date digitized database (management information system [MIS]) that



                                                     62

would serve subproject M&E and all other NAID stakeholders. It would also house all metadata related
to production systems, actors, technologies, and innovationsystems.

Provincial Level.     The Provincial level DUs would have two Subject Matter Specialists and an
Administrative Assistant to follow the Project and subproject M&E plans at the local level.
Informution Flow. The Project is expected to generate information at two levels: at the subproject and at
the component level. The subproject-generatedinformation would be kept up to date in the web-based
information system, and would ensure transparency of Project management. The information generated
from each component would be used for overall Project evaluation, and for monitoring of individual
activities and to keep all interested parties informed. This i s the responsibility of the Planning and Budget
Specialist adjunct to the Executive Project Director.
The key monitoringtools for M&Eand for information sharing will be composed of five elements:
(a) Management Information System (MIS). The MIS would be based on quarterly reports generated by
    each component units. All subproject proposals would include baseline data, performance and impact
    indicators, and targets and M&E plans. Project-implementing agencies would be responsible for
    reporting, and the Regional unit heads and the M&E unit would be responsible for assuring
    compliance with the reportingrequirements. The M&Eunit would maintain the consolidated Project
    database that would contain performance data and impact indicators, and would provide quarterly
    reports to the PMU and Executive Committee outlining the progress and problem areas. Regional
    unit heads and the M&E unit would evaluate the subproject implementation semiannually using a
    highly satisfactory (HS), satisfactory (S), moderately satisfactory (MS), moderately unsatisfactory
    (MU), unsatisfactory (U), and highly unsatisfactory (HU) rating scale, presented in the semiannual
    report and usedas a guide for corrective measures;
(b) Impact Case Studieswould be conducted to measureprogramoutcomes;
(c) Special studies would provide guidance on program impacts and ways of improving program
    efficiencies and effectiveness;
(d) Strategic Program Peer Reviews. These would assess strategic program development subprojects
    with respect to technical direction of the programs, their scientific quality, program performance,
    institutional linkages, and potentialimpacts; and
(e) Annual Program Pe$ormance Reviews. These would assess the program operations, procedures, and
    functioning of the PMU. The third program review would be a special review to assess triggers and
    plans for Phase I11of the APL program, which would be undertaken in the third year of the Project by
    a team of four external consultants (two internationaland two local) over a period of three weeks.
Capacity for maintaining the quality standards. To ensure the meetingof quality standards of M&E, the
DU personnel would receive training throughout the life of the Project to strengthen their capacity to
evaluate the subprojects and provide assistance to extension service providers. The Project will actively
participate in various technology networks and other sector and donor-funded projects and donor
coordination forums to upgrade knowledge in new methodologies and techniques of M&E, and to update
the awareness of the Government, donor community, and civil society on the Project outputs. Project
specialists would also participate in knowledge-building training. A training workshop mode would be
usedfor this purpose.

               Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements

                   PERU: Agricultural Researchand ExtensionAPL PhaseI1

A Joint Financial Management and Disbursement Assessment were performed by the regional Senior
Financial Management Specialist (FMS) and LOA Senior Finance Officer, in accordance with OP/BP
10.02 and the Guidelines for the Assessment of Financial Management Arrangements in the World Bank
Financed Projects. The evaluation was performed on site during the pre-evaluation mission from August
25 to 27, 2004 and updated during the appraisal mission on October 26 to 28, 2004. During the period
leading up to negotiations, technical guidance was provided to the INCAGRO team with respect to the
actions detailed in the Action Plan preparedduringappraisal.
On February 21, 2005 and before negotiations, the Senior Financial Management Specialist (FMS) visited
the project to review the documents and evidence in support of the completion of the Action Plan which
was agreed during appraisal.
Executive Summary and Overall Conclusion
Overall, during Phase Iof the APL, the Project Management Unit (PMU) has maintained financial
management arrangements, systems, and practices that are satisfactory to the Bank, and are adequate to
provide the Bank with accurate and timely information regarding project resources, expenditures, and
activities.
Entity specific and control risks have been assessed as moderate. During appraisal, the major capacity
constraints related to: a) the inability of the current information system to produce Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs) to support project management; b) inadequate monitoring mechanism for overseeing the
financial operations of the decentralized units; c) record keeping and filing which fragments the audit trail
of transactions; d) the lack of synchronization between project planning, execution of payments and
authorization (within the Ministry of Finance (MEF) of withdrawal application requests to the Bank, and
(e) capacity to transition into Report-baseddisbursements mechanism.
Whereas in the Phase I,   the impact of these constraints was not material, the Phase I1requireda quantum
leap, in order to mitigate the risks posed by the expansion in project complexity and scope. As reflected
in the updated Action Plan, the PMU has (1) upgraded the information systems and produced a
comprehensive User Manual which reflects the internal control processes and procedures; (2) the system
has the capacity to produce Financial Monitoring Reports, which can be used as the basis for
disbursement; (3) a Financial Analyst has been hired and trained and monitoring mechanism have been
instituted to oversee the financial operations of decentralized units; (4) record keeping and filing systems
and procedures have been prepared and implemented in order to ensure an appropriate audit trail; (5) the
Draft Operations Manual has been submitted to the Bank for review and comment; and (6) extensive
training sessions to improve Financial, Disbursement and Procurement capacity have been conducted in
two decentralized regions. Once the scaling up of the integrated financial management system i s
satisfactorily implemented, the residual inherent and control risks will be mitigated and the Bank will
have no objection to approvingthe implementationof the new disbursement mechanism.

Organization and Staffing
Details of the project implementationstructure, workflows and staffing have already been describedinthe
Annex 6, and overall, there i s adequate capacity (numbers, experience, and qualifications) in the Finance
and Administration Unit of the PMU, to handle budgeting, procurement, accounting, internal controls,
and reporting functions. In order to scale up and respond to the increased scope and operation of the
Phase 11, recommendations have been made to further strengthen the organizational capacity, and a new
position of the Financial Analyst has been created and filled, to provide financial supervision of the
decentralized unitsin each macro-region (see the map).



                                                      64

AccountingPoliciesandProcedures
The project will be implemented in accordance with the: 1) National Control System, which is regulated
by the Supreme Audit Institution; and 2) the National Accounting System, regulated by the Accountant
General. The chart of accounts used in the first phase (based on the Plan Contable Gubemamental del
Sistema Nacional de Contabilidad) has been adequately adapted to reflect the new project design, i.e.,
components, disbursement categories and financing sources and accounts will continue to be prepared on
a cash basis. The PMU has prepared a draft Operational Manual that had been reviewed by the Bank
before negotiations. Bank's comments will be included inthe final version of the Operational Manual.
BudgetingProceduresandImpactonFlow ofFunds
Planning and Budgeting will be in line with general government procedures regulated by the Annual
Budget Law operatedunder the Sistema Integrado de Administracion Financiera (SIAF).The Procedures
in effect under APL Iwill continue inforce and budgetary control will consist o f (1) timely preparation
and approval of annual programs and budgets (at the three levels, Le., Central INCAGRO-PMU,
Decentralized Units (DUs) and Beneficiary Institutions); and (2) verification that budget information is
entered and available in the accounting systemto allow timely recording of commitments, payments and
accruals. Since the ability to make projections of cash flow requirements will be a key to successful
implementation of report-based disbursements, in the Phase 11, the Project will need to successfully
remedy the lack of synchronization among project planning and execution of payments and authorization
within the MEF of withdrawal application requests to the Bank, which was a major contributor to bottle
necks to disbursements, under the Phase I.To mitigate this risk, the Project will need to prepare and
analyse on a quarterly basis budget execution variances.


DisbursementArrangements
DuringPhase 1of the APL, disbursement arrangements were based on the traditional transaction-based
mechanism. Given the nature of this project and that the bulk of disbursements for the subprojects (which
represents more than 80% of total project) are processed in tranches in accordance with the financing
agreements with beneficiaries resulting from each competitive fund, and to facilitate alignment of the
project request for disbursements with the allocated budget for this project for each year of
implementation, the Bank team evaluated the possibility of transitioning this project from the current
disbursement arrangements (transaction-based) for the Phase Iinto Report-based for Phase 11. As
described previously, a time-bound Action Plan including scaling up of the integrated financial
management systemwas agreedupon with the PMUto be completed before negotiations of the loan.
At appraisal, the Bank team reviewed with the project staff the progress made and followed up on the
Action Plan, taking stock of items which were still in progress or pending to be addressed or completed,
with particular emphasis in evaluating the readiness of preparingFinancial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)
(including reports required to support Report-based disbursements, and the adequacy of system to
generate such reports). Due to delays experienced by the Project with preliminary activities for the
systemenhancementsfor the integrated financial management system, the Project at the time did not have
the capacity to transition into Report-based Disbursements. As described in the Executive Summary
section of this Annex, the Bank team evaluated the completion of the actions completed to scale up the
integrated financial management system before negotiations, and the project has the capacity to prepare
FMRs in support of disbursements. However, given that any system enhancements requires a period of
testing and implementation, the continuation of current disbursement arrangements (transaction-based)
for the Phase Iis kept as a choice for the Phase IIin case there i s any need to switch to transaction-based
mechanism during implementation. Thus, the following sections include provisions to cater for each
option.

SpecialAccount,FundsFlow and ReportingRequirements
Irrespective of the disbursement mechanism to be implemented for this project, and to facilitate project
implementation, the project will have access to funds advanced by the Bank to a Special Account in US
dollars for processing disbursements to beneficiaries, for those eligible expenditures under project
activities. The Special Account (SA) will be opened by the borrower inBanco de la Nacidn (Government
commercial bank) and will be managed by the central INCAGRO-PMU established within Ministry of
Agriculture responsible for implementing the Project (no sub-accounts for decentralized regional offices

have been considered or approved as the central PMU is responsible for financial management and
disbursements of project funds).
Funds deposited into the Special Account as advances (depending on the disbursement mechanism) will
follow the Bank's disbursement operating policies and procedures established for each mechanism as
described in the Legal Agreement and in the DisbursementLetter as the case may be.
The specific detailed funds flow for the subprojects (each competitive fund may entail different funds
flow arrangements to the ultimate beneficiary) will be describedin the Operational Manual, and the Sub-
Project Operational Manual, but in general terms, a community-driven development (CDD) approach will
be used to the extent possible and provided the central INCAGRO-PMU will exercise its fiduciary and
oversight role with the decentralized regional units and executing entities (beneficiaries) in each region.
Funding to executing entities will be made based on lump-sum amounts approved in the Annual
Operating Plan for each executing entity at beginning of the year and under the basis of the financing
agreement signed among INCAGRO and each beneficiary. The financing agreement i s described in the
contract signed between INCAGRO and each beneficiary executing entity after awarding the contract.
The initial tranche payment is considered as an advance until progress is reviewed by INCAGRO and
documented in the first Technical and Financial Report of each executing entity. As subsequentprogress
payments are made to executing entities, INCAGRO-PMU should maintain appropriate internal control
mechanism and supervision through out the subproject implementation so as to ensure that subproject
activities for which financing was provided through transfers of loan funds made to executing entities are
completed before the loan closing date.
Transaction-based disbursements: In this case, an Authorized Allocation (AA) for advances made into
the Special Account will be established. This AA would be set to a maximum of $2,000,000 and the
project could request such advance as neededonce the loan i s declared effective.
Once the initial deposit(s) has been provided, the PMU will submit subsequent withdrawal applications
requests for replenishments to the Special Account on a monthly basis. All withdrawal applications will
be fully supported by appropriate supporting documentation (Le. invoices, receipts, and any other
evidence of payment) except for those expenditures for contracts not subject to prior review and for which
the Bank has approved the use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), as referred to in the Legal
Agreement and the Disbursement Letter. The Central PMU in INCAGRO will be responsible for
preparing and submitting withdrawal applications to the Bank. All supporting documentation of
withdrawal applications (including those for which SOEs are used) should be retained by the PMU at its
central location and be available for review by the Bank supervision missions and independent auditors.
Withdrawal from the loan account could be made on the basis of SOEs for the following expenditures:
(a) contracts for goods costing less than US$200,000 equivalent, (b) contracts for consulting firms costing
less than US$50,000, (c) contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$25,000, (d) works, (e)
training, (f) all subprojects, and (g) operating costs (Table A.7.2).

Report-based Disbursements: In the case that withdrawals of loan proceeds are made using Report-
based disbursements, the Bank will deposit into the Special Account an amount which the Bank has
determined, based of the reports submitted (FMRs and additional reports for disbursement purposes) that
i s requiredin order to finance eligible expenditures during the next two period (no more than 6 months)
following the reportingperiod of such FMRs.
The core FMRS will include:
a) A financial section specifying sources and applications of project resources and a statement of
     investment by project components/activities reporting the current quarter and the accumulated
     investment against ongoing plans;
b) An output monitoring section that: (i)     describes physical progress in the implementation of the
     project, both cumulative and for the period covered by the report; and (ii)
                                                                               explains variances between
     the actual and previously forecast implementationtargets; and
c) A procurement section setting forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures
     under contracts financed out of the proceeds of the loan, as of the end of the period covered by the
     report.
To support report-based disbursements, the following additional reports have been discussed and review
by the Bank. The format and content of such reports has been agreedupon before negotiations:
     a) Special Account Activity Statement;
     b) Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures (for those expenditures subject to prior
         review and below prior review other than subprojects);
     c) Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures for subprojects (which are not subject to
         Bank prior review).
The format and content for reporting the Forecast of expenditures for next two reporting period (i.e. 6
months) has not been reviewed before negotiations as the PMU will prepare this report in line with the
budget submission to MEF using the Budget module in SIAF. Given the nature of the subprojects
(demand-driven through competitive funds) and the timing of disbursing the funds through the
implementation cycle (maximum 3 years) per subproject, particular attention was given to discuss the




                                                    68

design (format and content) of the disbursements under this component based on the new disbursement
mechanism and the experience so far with the phase Iof the APL.
Incase of Report-based Disbursements,the borrower should submit withdrawal applications as follows:
    (a) Initial Withdrawal Application: A request for withdrawal of loan funds using the appropriate
        form (1903) provided by the Bank, along with the project's expenditures forecast for the next two
        reportingperiods; and
    (b) Subsequent Withdrawal Applications:         A request for withdrawal of loan funds using the
        appropriate form (1903) provided by the Bank, along with the FMRs for the period ended, the
        Special Account Activity Statement (including Bank statement), and any other applicable
        Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures, and forecast for next two reporting
        periods.
Under this mechanism, only the reports listed above are submitted to the Bank with the withdrawal
applications. All documents supporting the reported expenditures should be maintained by INCAGRO-
PMUand madethem available for review by Bank supervision missions and external auditors.
As with the case of transaction-based disbursements, direct payments to consultants and service
providers, and reimbursement to the Government for pre-financed Bank's share of project expenditures
will be available to the borrower and set out inthe Disbursement Letter.

RetroactiveFinancing
During negotiations, the borrower requested and the Bank agreed to include $400,000 equivalent for
retroactive financing with respect of payments made for eligible expenditures under categories (1)
through (4) and after March 1, 2005.

ExternalAudit
The auditors have issued unqualified opinions of the project financial statements over the years of its
implementation and, overall, the Project has consistently taken timely and complete corrective action to
address weaknesses identified by the auditors. In addition, the Project has consistently delivered audit
reports when due. The Project therefore is expected to continue to provide the Bank annually with
financial statements for the P M U audited by an independent auditing firm acceptable to the Bank and
underterms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank which will include an opinion on the project financial
statements and a management letter on the internal control structure. Annual audit reports with the
related statements will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the Borrower's fiscal
year. All supporting records would be maintained at the Project site for at least one year after the
completion of the Project. The Bank's audit guidelines will be used by the Borrower in determiningthe
format and content of the annual financial statements and in preparing the audit TORS. The costs of the
Project audits are subject to financing from loan proceeds.

FinancialManagementSupervisionduring implementation
Given the expanded scope of the Project, supervision activities will be expanded to include a visit to
/review of the financial operations of at least one new decentralized unit, in addition to review of the
FMRS, annual review of external audit.

                    PERU: Agricultural ResearchandExtensionAPL PhaseI1
A. General
Procurement for the proposed Project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," dated May 2004; and "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," dated May 2004, and the
provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The general description of various items under different
expenditure categories is indicated below. For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior
review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank Project team in the
Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated twice yearly or as requiredto reflect the actual
Project implementationneeds and improvements in institutional capacity.

ProcurementMethods
The procurement methods and the contract values for the use of each procurementhelection method are
presentedin Table A.8.1.
Procurement of Works. Due to very limited requirements identified at the Project design stage, no
major civil works contracts would be financed at Project implementation. Minor works to be procured
under this Project will consist of the rehabilitation of Project offices and network installation of computer
equipment in the Lima Project office, three existing regional offices, and eight new regional offices at
different points in time as Project implementation progresses. Use of International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures for procurement of works i s not expected.
All contracts for works estimated to cost US$250,000 equivalent or less per contract will be procured
with the use of price comparison from at least three price quotes obtained from local qualified contractors
under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts. Total amount of works above is expected not to exceed, in the
aggregate, US$O.11million.
Procurement of Goods. Goods to be financed under the Project will consist of supply of vehicles,
computer, and office equipment for new regional offices in eight different regions to be procured at
different times duringProject implementation. They will be grouped and sized in packages to meet the
needs of each group of regional offices planned to start operations in different years of the Project. Due
to the expectedpackagesizes, there will be no contracts to awardunder ICB procedures.
Vehicles for the Proyecto de Investigacidn y Extensidn Agricdla para la Innovacidn y Competitividad del
Agro Peruano's (INCAGRO's) new Project offices at the regional level will be grouped to form packages
to be procured under NCB procedures. Whenever feasible, they will be grouped in packages estimated to
cost US$50,000 equivalent or more per contract, but less than US$200,000 equivalent.
Procurement of computer equipment will provide for PCs, laptops, servers, laser printers, and software,
while office equipment will include copy machines, air-conditioning, scanners, digital cameras, and office
furniture for start-up of new regional offices. Except for a first-year package of computer equipment to
be procured with the use of NCB procedures, all goods will be procuredwith the use of Price Comparison
(shopping) procedures from quotations obtained from at least three local qualified suppliers. Goods
grouped under packages estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or more but less than US$200,000
equivalent per contract, will be procured with the use of NCB procedures. Contracts with an estimated
value of less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract will be purchased through Price Comparison. Total
amount of goods contracts to be financed under this Project i s estimated at US$0.6 million.
Procurementof Non-ConsultingServices (includingtraining-relatedexpenses). The Project would
finance contracts for the provision of services other than consulting services for such training-related
activities as workshops, seminars, consultation meetings, study tours for participating agency staff


                                                      70

working in Project activities, and so forth. Expensesto be financed will consist of travel, subsistence, and
per diems for trainers and trainees, registration fees, and training materials and the logistics for organizing
training events. Total amount of non-consulting services to be financed under the Project would not
exceedUS$1.9 million.
Selection of Consultants.      Contracts for employment of firms and individuals will be procured for
evaluation of subproject profiles and for proposals for several different studies and training, supervision
of subprojects, monitoring and evaluation, project management services, baseline studies for indigenous
groups, project midterm evaluation, impact evaluation, policy-related studies, technological perspective,
development of management information systems, and project financial and procurement audits. Total
cost of consultant contracts to be financed underthe Project are expected not to exceedUS$2.4 million.
Contracts for employment of firms will be procured through use of Quality-Cost Based Selection
(QCBS), Least-Cost Selection (LCS), and Consultants' Qualification Selection (CQS) and Single-Source
Selection (SSS) methods.
In addition to the services noted above, consulting services for employment of individual consultants
under subprojects will be procured by participating communities with the use of Commercial Practices,
acceptable to the Bank, and described in the Project Operational Manual, based on the comparison of
qualifications and criteria such as academic background, experience, knowledge of local conditions and
language, and overall suitability for the assignment. The comparison of qualifications will be carried out
with due consideration of at least three candidates who shall meet minimumrelevant requirements. The
consultants will be selected on the basis of the best qualified among the candidates considered for a
particular assignment.
Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$350,000 equivalent per contract may
be comprised entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the
Consultant Guidelines..
Operating Costs.       Expenses on account of Project management and monitoring, including office
supplies; utilities; rent; communication expenses, includingthe telephone, the Internet and fax; vehicles;
office  equipment and computer operation and maintenance; transport; travel; subsistence; per diems;
supervision costs; and Project staff salaries would be financed as operating costs and procured using
comparison procedures, whenever possible, and the implementing agency's administrative procedures
which were reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank. Under this category, the Project will finance
dissemination and advertisement services on spot radio, the print media, and television for promotion of
competitive matching grants for execution of subprojects. Non-consulting services would be procured
with the use of either direct contracting or price comparison (shopping) procedures and the use of sample
documents acceptableto the Bank for the latter. Expected total costs would not exceed US$5.3 million.
Subprojects (Matching Grant Fund). The Project would finance demand-driven research and
agricultural extension subprojects proposed by agricultural communities or associations of communities
using matching grants mechanisms. Subprojects would be evaluated and selected in accordance with
specific evaluation criteria to be described in the Project Operational Manual. Subproject maximum size
will not exceed US$lOO,OOO equivalent, of which about 15 percent will be made available by
participating communities as counterpart funds, and 20 percent as government counterpart funds.
Subproject may encompass consultant services, training expenses, small goods, very small works, and
seed capital. Although no procurement of goods above $50,000 equivalent per contract is expected,
Bank prior review would be performed whenever packages of such value or more were feasible.
Procurement of goods and works funded under subprojects would be carried out with the use of
Community Participation procedures following to the extent possible shopping procedures, as described
in the Operations Manual. Total expected amount of grants for the purposes noted above would not
exceedUS$32.6 million.

    B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto Implement Procurement
Procurement activities will be carried out by INCAGRO, the Government entity responsible for
implementationof the first Agricultural Researchand Extension Project. At the central level, the Project
Management Unit (PMU) i s staffed by 17 officials, including Project administrative staff and one
Procurement Officer. In addition, as new regional offices are incorporated into Project implementation,
INCAGRO will need to gradually hire additional Project and administrative staff to enable a decentralized
Project implementation approach. Eventually, hiring of staff in regional offices is estimated to reach 43
staffers. Gradual incorporation of staff at these offices i s foreseen to take place within the first 14months
after implementationbegins.
The Operational Manual (OM) will describe both institutional and implementation arrangements; the
organizational structure and functions proposedfor Project implementation and coordination; and detailed
procedures for procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants for mandatory use of
INCAGRO offices at all levels, and participating communities.               Standard Project documents for
procurement of goods and works, request for proposals from consultant firms, and standard letters of
invitation and forms of agreement for selection and contracting of individual consultants agreed for the
Project will also be included inthe OM.
Capacity assessment exercises of INCAGRO as Project agency to implement procurement actions were
performed by Keisgner D. Alfaro, Senior Procurement Specialist, in April and June 2004.                   The
assessment was largely based on the review of agency past performance, the current organizational
structure for Project implementation, and arrangements and procedures used for management of
procurement and contract administration, including internal procedures for functioning of the Evaluation
Committee and interactionwith the Procurement Officer.
Issues identified as potentially affecting Project implementationinclude: (a) some degree of uncertainty in
respect of the PMU's organization to be adopted for implementation of the Second INCAGRO Project
and the extent to which the organizational and implementation arrangements will remain the same as
currently in place. The latter will be largely contingent on the outcomes of a study contracted out to
specialized consultants that will incorporate a proposal for this agency to operate under a decentralized
implementation approach in approximately 11 regional offices, out of which 8 will be created; (b) poor
performance in procurement by Evaluation Committee members, particularly for the selection and
employment of consultants, due to insufficient knowledge of Bank procurement and selection guidelines
and inadequate and inefficient work arrangements; (c) the lack of an integrated project management
information system for monitoring, control, and reporting purposes that would otherwise enable decision
malung and increaseproject coordination; and (d) the needto reinforce INCAGRO's project filing system
at the central level and provide existing and new regional offices with a similar and coherent system.
Corrective actions agreed for the mitigation of these shortcomings are: (1) submission of a proposal for
implementation of decentralized arrangements to be agreed at loan negotiations or earlier; and (2)
implementation of revised procurement arrangements discussed and agreed during the appraisal mission
that include the participation of a Procurement Officer in the Evaluation Committee for ensuring proper
use of Bank procurement procedures and for provision of increased coordination and expediting; and
provision of Bank procurement training to Project agency staff, including the Committee's members, not
later than the Project launching mission; hiring of a specialized consultant for design and implementation
of a new project filing system at the central and regional levels, and implementation of an integrated
project management information system through the development of a procurement module within the
financial management system and their interconnection through inter-phase software. These initiatives
are all included in the Procurement Improvement Action Plan included in the Agency capacity
Assessment Report and agreed to duringthe appraisal mission.
The overall project risk for procurement is high.

C. ProcurementPlan
At the project appraisal, the PMUsubmitted a global procurement plan for the project lifetime that served
as a basis for the identification and setting of thresholds and procurement methods to be used. Upon
Bank review of such plan and incorporation of comments, a revised version was finally agreed. This plan
shall be cleared before loan negotiations.
Twice-yearly reviews of procurement and selection plans shall be submitted not later than January 31 and
July 31 of each year of project implementation.
D. PriorReview Thresholds
Table A.8.1 summarizes the thresholds for use of different methods and for prior review assigned in
accordancewith the risk level assigned in the agency capacity assessment report, and which correspond to
those assigned to high-risk agencies, consistent with thresholds issued by the Regional Procurement
Advisory Office for LatinAmerican and Caribbean countries, per e-mail dated 12/27/2002.

                              Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
                    PERU: Agricultural Researchand ExtensionAPL PhaseI1
Economic andFinancial Analysis
The economic and financial analysis of Phase I1 of the Agricultural Research and Extension (R&E)
Project (APL 11) follows good practices in the World Bank, and i s based on experiences with similar
projects in Latin America and other regions. The analysis i s structured as follows: (a) summary of
general issues for economic analysis of R&E projects; (b) review of returns to past investments in
agricultural R&E projects internationally and in Peru; (c) an estimation of potential internal rate of return
(IRR) for the proposed investment based on experiences with the Project Phase I;and (d) a fiscal analysis
focusing on the potential consequences of the proposed investment of the government budget.
General Issues for Economic Analysis of R&E projects
The Good Practice Note, "Ex-Ante Economic Analysis in AKIS Projects-Methods                  and Guidelines,"
(Horstkotte-Wesseler and others 2000) summarizes issues for economic analysis of World Bank-funded
R&E projects. The Note emphasizesthat the calculation of a single summary measure should not be the
major objective of the economic analysis of R&E because it i s usually subject to a wide range of
assumptions. Rather, the priority should be mainstreaming economic analysis into a process of evaluating
costs and benefits for more efficient resource allocation within the R&E system. Therefore, general
support and capacity building within the national research and extension system (NAIS) should be
undertaken to conduct ongoing economic analysis for effective evaluation, priority setting, and impact
assessment. Since the larger share of resources in R&E projects i s allocated to institutional and human
capacity building, the economic analysis of a whole project i s not very useful, and economic analysis of
individual investments within the project may be more appropriate and warranted. The recommended
model for evaluation i s the economic surplus method (or a simplification thereof). The exact model type
i s determined by the activities to be financed by the project, analytical capacity, and data availability.
Returns to Past Investments for Agricultural R&EProjects
Many ex post economic analyses have shown high rates of return to investments in agricultural R&E.
Alston and others (1999) conducted the most comprehensive review of literature on this topic. The study
reviewed 294 studies (including extension) reporting 1,858 estimates of returns on investments in
Agricultural R&E. After eliminating extremes, the remaining 1,760 estimates indicatedan average return
of 73 percent per year. These results confirm the conventional view that returns on investments in
Agricultural R&E i s relatively high. Returns averaged 88 percent on investments in research alone, 79
percent on extension alone, and 45 percent on R&E combined. The report argues that the lower estimates
for R&E combined might be because the corresponding studies captured more of the total costs of the
technology innovation process. No evidence was found of declining rates of return in recent years, and
little consistent difference among regions. Rates of returns were similar across all research categories
except for naturalresource research, where lower rates of return were mainly due to the longer production
cycle. There is no reason to believe that economic rates of return in Peru would be substantially below
that level. Alarcon (1999) and Ganoza and others (1990) analyzed potential rates of return to investment
in researchand extension in the country, and showed comparable levels of IRR. Fano and others (1999)
conducted a study on expected impacts of 12 technologies developed by the National Agricultural
Researchand ExtensionInstitute (INIEA), and estimated an average net present value of more than US$3
million, and an average rate of return of 24 percent (ranging from 11 percent for quinoa varietal
development to 39 percent for cotton technology development).
Estimate of IRR for Investments inthe Agricultural R&E Project
A share of resources within the Agricultural R&E Project is allocated to institutional development or
capacity building of the NAIS system in Peru. As discussed, economic analysis for the whole Project is

EconomicAnalysisfor Overall Project: An estimate of the IRR for the overall Project was not attempted
for the reasons stated above. However, the calculation of the overall productivity gain required in the
agricultural sector to pay the costs of Project Phase I1i s a useful indicator for the economic justification
of the investment.      The analysis includes the total annual Project costs, including institutional
development, and assumes a time lag for initiation of benefits of four years. It i s projected that the
maximumbenefits will be attained after eight years from the start of Phase 11. The analysis indicates that
a productivity gain of only 0.55 percent of the agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP) would lead
to an IRR of 12 percent. Compared internationally, the required level is very low. In many countries,
expected productivity gains from agricultural researchof between 0.5 and 1.5 percent per year of AgGDP
have been reported.
FiscalAnalysis
Peru's significant achievements in terms of economic growth, poverty reduction, and improvements in
social indicators up to 1997 have been partially set back lately by ensuing persistent slowdowns in
economic activity, political uncertainty, institutional weaknesses, poor governance and, in particular,
fiscal indiscipline. Since 1999, Peru's fiscal stance has been fragile due to expansive fiscal policies and
other unfavorable domestic and external developments. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit significantly
increased from 0.4 percent of GDP in 1997 to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2000, only to be slightly reduced to
about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2001 (World Bank 2003). The success of the envisioned economic reform
programin Agricultural R&E will depend to a great extent on how quickly the current administrationwill
be able to restore fiscal discipline, reorient the budget toward pro-poor expenditure, and improve the
efficiency of public expenditure.

In this context of scarce financial public resources and increased focus on pro-poor expenditures,
Agricultural R&D has the potential to play an important role. The preliminary results of the economic
and financial analysis indicate that the investments in R&E would be economically and financially
justified. These results are supportedby highreturns on past investments inPeru and other countries, and
the conventional view and empirical evidence that investments in agricultural research have major
positive impacts on poverty reduction (Fan, Zhang, and Zhang 2000; Fan, Hazell, and Thorat 1999;
Thirtle and others 2003). Due to the economic importance and potential of agricultural production in
Peru, and the need of the agricultural sector to become more competitive to fully exploit the opportunities
provided through the prospect of new trade agreements with the UnitedStates, the European Union (EU),
and MERCOSUR, a significant increase in public funding for agricultural research and extension is
essential. The Agricultural R&E Project i s an important step inthis direction. However, due to increased
emphasis on fiscal discipline, it i s important to estimate the fiscal impacts of the proposed investment.
Base Analysis: The fiscal analysis aims at assessing the likelihood that sustainable local sources of funds
will be available at the end of the Project to take over from funds provided under the Project. The current
public expenditures for R&E are compared with the projected demands on public expenditures for
sustaining Project activities after the completion of the Project Phase I1in 2009. Table A.9.3 illustrates
the scenario where the planned cost recovery and co-financing mechanisms are not in place after the end
of the Project, which in turn would result in an increase of public expenditures for agricultural R&E in
real terms of 44 percent annually. This increasewould correspond to an increased expenditure of US$9.8
million per year, which is less than 0.1 percent of the total government budget in 2002, and 3.5 percent of
the budget for the agricultural sector in 2002.

versus one-off investments such as technical assistance. The calculation of a factor for recurrent costs i s basedon the relation of
the recurrent costs inthe last year of the Project Phase I1to the average annualrecurrent costs o f the Project.

Co-Financing and Cost Recovery: The fiscal impacts of the planned investments into the national R&E
system depend significantly on implemented co-financing and cost recovery mechanisms. The analysis
above i s conservative by assuming that total investment costs of the competitive fund have to be covered
by public expenditures after the Project i s phased out (Phase I1of APL, in 2009). In Phase 11, about 20
percent of these costs have to be co-financed by the producers and executing agencies. Assuming that
about the same amount would be providedby these agencies after project completion, public expenditures
for researchand extension have to increaseby only about US$8 million annually, or 37 percent (see Table
A.9.4).    The incremental public expenditures as a percentage of the total government budget for the
agricultural sector would decrease from 3.5 percent to 3.0 percent. Inaddition, the researchinstitutes that
would function as training and information centers for extension service providers are expected to move
to a charge-back system under which they would recover the costs partially for the training courses.
Moreover, it is planned that the producers would be increasingly charged for receiving advice from the
extension agencies. Preliminaryanalysis suggests that use of levies would be financially feasible for most
commodities (Alarcon 1999). These measures would further decrease the amount to be provided by the
government.

 It has to be noted that agricultural GDP growth accounts for incremental returns to land, labor, and capital, whereas incremental
grofits account for returnsto land and labor only.
 The National Household Survey (ENAHO) conducted by the Znstituto Nucionul de Estadistica y Censos in 2002 estimates that
ruralhouseholds spendon average 50 percent of their total income on non-food items. Therefore, the analysis is conservative in
assuming that only 50 to 60 percentof the incremental income i s spent on non-food items, on which the VAT i s imposed.

    1. StrategicContextandRationale:theEquityPrinciple
The Project's target population i s defined by the minimum levels of productive efficiency and market
articulation required to expect effective and beneficial participation by small producers inthe market for
innovation services and the innovation system in general. Given this framework, during Phase Iof the
Project, studies aimed at better identifying the characteristics of the target population; and establishing
whether the target population might contain segments participating under conditions of inequity in the
activities developed by the Project to promote access to the service market were carried out. The
emphasis laid on the equity principle is related to two fundamental aspects: (a) it i s important to
understand equity as the manner in which the overall organization of a society-not              only of its poor or of
any particular group--enables or impedes access to tangible and intangible resources to develop its
capacities; (b) the implications of applying this principle to the way a Government (and, therefore, the
Project) act regarding its responsibility to increase opportunities for its citizens, especially those in the
most vulnerable segments".
The initialstudies carried out" revealed that producers inpeasantcommunities (indigenous populations in
the high Andes) were engaged in a variety of agribusiness activities as a way to increase their income.
Furthermore, to improve their market articulation they had an unsatisfieddemand which was importantly
associatedto access to specialist professional services enabling them to improve both the productivity and
product quality of their businesses and the management of their marketing channels, negotiation power,
their share of the net marginof commercialization, andprofitability. Inaddition, it was possible to verify
the limitations faced by this type of producers in accessing the said specialized service market, which
presentedextremely low levels of development inthe study area (Huancavelica),as well as in other areas
with similar characteristics. This was due not only to limitations and poor dynamism of markets of goods
and services, poor socioeconomic infrastructure, absence of information at all levels, but also to poor
institutional development of supply of services-a           state of affairs that aggravated the uncertainty and
ignorance of producers as well as of the potential providers of services. Other socioeconomic limitations
related to the cultural, social and economic characteristics of this type of indigenous producers-
indigenous mother tongue, phenotypic features, geographical origin, clothes, traditional know-how
applied to the management of their biodiversity resources, low holdings of such private assets as formal
education, low access to public goods and services, etc.) determined exclusion processes that created the
need to have a differentiated strategy to promote the fair participation by these producers in the market of
services and in the NAIS. Finally, these initial studies warned that women producers pertaining to these
indigenous populations had even more limited access to the service market as demanders of services due
to existing gender inequities'*. In responseto these initial findings, between August 2004 and June 2004,
the ATF implemented a pilot fundingwindow designated "Huchuy Ayni", in the Huancavelica region for
the co-financing of capacity building and technical assistancefor the improvement of agribusinessesrun
by producers in peasant communities. The lessons learned from, and the findings of, this pilot are
presentedinthe next section.

For Phase 11, the Project decided to continue implementing the Indigenous Peoples Action Plan that had
been prepared as a part of Phase          II3. To that end, improvements were introduced in the intervention
strategy for this segment of the target population, including specific strategies for work with indigenous
peoples in the high Andes and the Amazon region. The Plan will make it possible to foster equitable
access by producers in indigenous communities to the innovation services market as a way to improve
their agribusinesses and attend to the demand for better market articulation. Working with this population
group into an action strategy i s consistent with the national policies of promotion of segments of the
populationthat have been or are affected by exclusion and discrimination processes.In fact, documents of
such major national policy (including agricultural policy) relevance as Peru's National Agreement,
explicitly state this ~bjective'~:Of the various groups facing the situations of discrimination and social
inequity emphasized by the Agreement, the ones most relevant to the Project's intervention strategy are
"women" and "the members of ethnic communities" (indigenous populations among them), who have a
large presenceinrural areas ingeneral and inthe agricultural sector inparticular.
As regards the Agricultural Policy in particular, the document prepared by MINAG's Agricultural
Planning Office in 2004, entitled "Bases para una Poli'tica de Estado en la Agricultura del Peru"',
specifically states that ... the role and the logic of public intervention should go beyond the mere
`administration' of the market" and ... public rationality should not be associated only to the idea of
                            "

                                            "
competitiveness and efficiency", but also to the constant search for equity. In this sense, it points out that
"the State should bear a responsibility for improving the quality of life and opportunities of its citizens,
especially those in the most vulnerable segments, such as the rural poor. This strategic objective is
associated to the need to articulate agricultural producers in poor and extremely poor areas ... to the
markets ..."     15.  For its part, the document entitled Lineamientos de la Poli'tica Agraria del Perh
highlightsthe importance of supporting "low-income agricultural producers organized and presenting a
market articulation potential ...". The need i s stressed to "provide small producers in traditional and
subsistence agriculture ... with equitable and sustained market articulation". It also states that
"competitiveness and equity mechanisms need to be developed in order for traditional and subsistence
agriculture groups to achieve better market integration."'6.
The indigenous peoples, who have a significant presence in Peru's rural areas and agricultural sector, are
characterized by higher levels of poverty than the non-indigenous segment of the population. In fact,
according to a recent study describing the situation of Peru's indigenous population based on the
ENAHO 2001 survey, it i s estimated that, whilst 46,8% of the total population i s below the poverty
threshold, in the indigenous segment the poverty incidence i s as high as 63.8% (in the non-indigenous
segment of the population, the poverty incidence stands at 42.2%). One half of the indigenous people
below the poverty threshold are in a situation of extreme p~verty'~.              This is the rationale of the Project's
intervention strategy which emphasizes actions specifically focused on the indigenous segment of the
population within the context of its general policy of promoting equitable access to the innovation
services market in order to improve agribusiness competitiveness.
As a part of the preparation of Phase I1 Project and the present Action Plan, a study was carried out for
the purpose of updatingthe Plan that had been used for Phase I,             which had placed special emphasis on the
proposed guidelines for work with Amazonian indigenous peoples". This study was complemented by

one on the design of the instruments to be implemented to achieve the objectives proposed in said Action
Plan. This second study has been entitled "Design of aFundingWindow for the Co-financing of Capacity
Building and Technical Assistance Subprojects for the Improvement of Agribusinesses Led by
Amazonian Indigenous Peoples". The study will make it possible to define the guidelines for the funding
windows to be implemented for this type of producers, as well as to help improve the design of the
competitive fund for Andean indigenous peoples. Moreover, the inputs obtained as a result of the
implementation of Phase I,as well as those derived from studies and field work carried out within the
framework of the preparation of Phase 1119,will provide valuable input for a general strategy for action
with Andean and Amazonian indigenous peoples, to be made a part of this Action Plan, as well as the
instruments best suitedfor the achievement of the expected results. The general guidelines of the Action
Plan and its implementationtools are described inthe following sections. Finally, it shouldbe mentioned
that, although high Andes and Amazonian indigenous populations tend to be concentrated in the poorest
segments of the rural area, they also present more dynamic segments in terms of technology and market
insertion. The explicitly differentiated work to be performed with these groups during Phase I1will
amount to an effort aimed at identifying their contribution to innovation and technological development
as much as at promoting equitable participation in the service market by these segments of the target
population.
    2. Indigenouspeoples'demandfor innovationservicesasrevealedbythe"HzxhuyAyn?' pilot

Between August 2004 and June 2004, as a part of Phase Iof the Project, the ATF implemented a pilot
funding window in the Huancavelica region for the co-financing of capacity building and technical
assistance for the improvement of agribusinesses run by producers in peasant communities. The peasant
communities were taken as the organizational referent of Andean indigenous populations present in the
area. The funding window was given the Quechua name of "Huchuy Ayni" (small mutual help). Its
principal objective was to empower and strengthen producers' capacities for managingtheir organizations
and their agribusinesses, as well as their service contracting capacity. The underlying aim was to use these
services to improve the agribusinessesdeveloped by these indigenous producers, and to foster attention to
their newly-founddemandfor better market articulation.
As a result of the implementation of the Huchuy Ayni funding window, resources were awarded to a total
of 16 subprojects. The funding window covered 5 out of the 7 provinces in the Huancavelica region
(Acobamba, Castrovirreyna, Huancavelica,Angaraes and Huaytard). It elicited much interest, as shown
by the fact that a very significant number of communities submitted project profiles. Their number (50
peasant communities) represented 22% of the total number of communities in the 5 provinces (427).
Information dissemination, promotion and training could not be brought to all communities. However, in
nearly 100% of those contacted the response was positive, which indicates that there remains untapped
demand in this segment of the population. In the five province covered by the call for proposals, the
population registered in the communities"               numbered 55 thousand families.           Of these, 1,169 were
included in the applications submitted through the project profiles presented. Ultimately, 320 families
representing 0.6% of the total received funds.
Some of the lessonslearnedfrom the Huchuy Ayni experience follow:
a) The aim of improving market articulation through a strategy designed to improve competitiveness via
     specialized innovation services i s indeed viable for producers with these characteristics, although it
     also requires the implementation of strategies responding to their peculiarities, and the limitations
     inherent to their ethnicity (indigenous mother tongue, geographical origin, discrimination, dearth of
     rightsof access to, anduse of, resources, etc.);


l9 In2004, the ATF team carried out extensive field work in the departments of Puno and Loreto (Reserva Pacaya Samiria), in
order to complement the field work envisaged in the studies for the design of the funding windows for Amazonian indigenous
peoplesand women's organizations.
2o No more than 70% of the families registeredlive inthe community.


                                                             82

    In areas, such as this, featuring a predominance of indigenous population, the Project can benefit and
    achieve greater impact by introducing the cultural dimension, and incorporating these peoples'
    ancestral and traditional practices, uses and customs;
    These economies hold significant agribusinesses potential associated to a great variety of products,
    many of which linkedto the sustainabledevelopment of biodiversity;
     There i s little presence of public institutions and private operators able and willing to support
    producers' activities with a sustainable market approach. Most of those present show serious
    deficiencies in the use of the instruments available for designing and managing agribusiness projects,
    which makes it all the more difficult for them to meet producers' demands. Most institutions still
    follow a food security-based philosophy combined with welfare-oriented practices. Nevertheless,
    there exist a group of service providers interested in acquiring greater strength in order to make their
    undertakings more businesslike by deepening their reconversion process and acquiring the capacities
    that may enable them to meet producers' demands associated to the need to improve their
    agribusinessesby offering them quality services at market prices;
    The Project had to invest considerable effort and resources in order to provide producers and their
    partners with the professional consultancy services necessary on an ongoing basis to enable them to
    meet the established technical and institutional accreditation requirements and compete for the funds.
    Given that an outlay of funds of this size i s unlikely to be repeated, it is necessary to implement
    strategiescomplementary to the competitive fundas such;
    There exist new producer organizations-many          of them consisting of young producers-with       a
    strong interest in developing successful rural agribusinesses. Their potential multiplier effect should
    not be ignored;
    On the other hand, there also exist producer organizations that still display distorted forms of
    behavior, where passivity and opportunism hold sway, with little initiative to lead changes in their
    own communities.         This behavior, unfortunately, is reinforced by some nongovernmental
    organizations (NGOs) and public organizations managing relations in the zone with an authoritarian,
    vertical, political patronage-basedstyle;
    The empowerment potential of the funding window mechanism was made evident as producer
    organizations were able to choose their partners to work with in drawing up and implementing their
    subprojects, to contract service providers, and in general to manage the money for implementingtheir
    subprojects. This will allow beneficiary producers to develop their own agribusiness initiatives by
    solving problems and implementing improvements of their choice without having to establish
    relations of dependence on or commitment vis-&vis local institutions that often impose restrictive
    conditions on their decision-making capacity, in addition to distorting their true demands for better
    market articulation;
    The Huchuy Ayni experiment has made evident thatthose producers in peasant communities are
    willing and able to pay in order to co-finance the costs of capacity building and technical assistance
    when they help them with production and market articulation problems as identified by them. The
    diverse strategiesto make cash co-financing possible should be considered at on a case-by-case basis
    to allow for greater flexibility and successful implementation of the objectives; and
    Finally, the role of local public actors, regional governments, and the competent authority of the
    Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in the region i s critical to the successful implementation of a funding
    window, for without their support in terms of information dissemination, promotion and training,
    negotiationof the winning proposals would be impossible.
As it will be seen inthe following sections, these conclusions were inputs for the present Action Planwith
Indigenous Peoples, and were used in the development of the specific guidelines for the high Andes
indigenous populations inparticular.

     3. InterventionStrategy ofthe strengtheningthe Marketfor InnovationServices Componentfor Work
         withAndeanandAmazonianIndigenousPeoples
The intervention strategy of the Project for the promotion of the equitable participation by Andean and
Amazonian indigenous peoples in the service market for services and the innovation system i s based on
the development of two levels of action:
  Indirect Project intervention. Aimed at contributing to the improvement of issues relatedto the cultural
  and socioeconomic milieu of the indigenous peoples, which are key for improving the Project's chances
  of success: land use regulations (land titling, etc), access to and sustainable use of resources, ethnic
  discrimination, awareness of duties and rights, among others, and
  Direct Project intervention. Aimed at improving equitable participation by this type of producers inthe
  service market-mainly      as clients, but also as providers-for the strengthening of their agribusinesses.
At the first level, the role of third party public or private stakeholders will be critical, given that the
Project's only role will be that of initiative facilitator and promoter. At the direct intervention level, the
Project will have the lead. This strategy will require the gradual intervention of the Project inthe various
areas where these population segments live, initially through pilot programs. The areas of intervention
will be selected according to criteria designed to increase the chances of success. Later, instruments will
be implemented for more generalized intervention. Both levels of action are envisaged in the Indigenous
Peoples Action Plan. The level of direct action will be developed mainly through the implementation of a
competitive fund to co-finance the capacity building and technical assistance subprojects for improved
agribusiness under the managementof this category of producers.
Finally, it i s important to mention that the treatment of population groups excluded from the service
market, as i s the case with Andean and Amazonian indigenous peoples, i s addressedby all three Projects
of Phase I1of the Program. The Strengthening the Service Market essentially consists of implementing
the Action Plan designed for the work to be performed with this segment of the target population. This
involves not only organizing the calls for proposals and performing whatever support activities are
required, but also attending to issues related to the formalization of producer organizations and dealing
with-albeit    indirectly-with   other issues relating to the cultural and socioeconomic milieu in which the
indigenous peoples live. The Strengthening Strategic Research and Development Capacities component
will help develop a supply of services tailored to the specific needs of these population segments. Finally,
the Policies, Information and Innovation Services Quality component will generate ongoing information
about the supply and demand of services, in addition to providing quality incentives for those services in
the form of awards.
     4. MainGuidelinesoftheActionPlanwithIndigenousPeoples
4.1 Main Objective and Specific Objectives of the Action Plan
The central objective of the Action Plan with Indigenous Peoples is to promote equitable participation by
these producers in the service market and the innovation system as a way to improve their agribusinesses
while respecting their socioeconomic and cultural peculiarities, as well as helping reduce the causes of
their social and ethnic exclusion. The Action Plan's three specific objectives-two       on the side of service
demand, one on the side of service supply-are:        (a) Empower and strengthen the capacities of indigenous
producers as customers requiring services enabling them to improve their agribusinesses; (b) Strengthen
the organizational and entrepreneurial capacities of indigenous producers; and (c) Promote a supply of
services appropriate for working with indigenous producers, including indigenous producer organization
leaders as suppliers of services.
By empowering and strengthening indigenous producers as demanders of specialized innovation services,
it i s hoped to increase their organizational and entrepreneurial capacities as a way to improve their
agribusinesses, their income, and, ultimately, their well being. For this to be possible, it i s necessary to
foster the supply of quality services using methodologies appropriate for this target population, ensuring


                                                         84

that technologies are adopted, information i s handled and management i s improved as required by the
producers as beneficiaries. Indigenous producer leaders may assume the role of quality service suppliers
themselves, provided they have the necessary capacities. What follows i s a brief presentation of the
guidelines of the Action Plan with Indigenous Peoples. The work to be done with indigenous populations
in the high Andes (mostly located in the central and southern highlands (sierra), and comprised of
Quechua and Aymara ethnic groups), and the work to be done with Amazonian indigenous populations
(mostly located in Amazonian Peru, zones of high and low forests where there i s a great diversity of
ethnic groups, including Ashaninka, Bora, Cocama,Huitoto, Jibaro, Ocaina, Omagua, Quichua, Yagua,
and Yanesha).
4.2 IndigenousPeoples inthe HighAndes
Based on the experience of the Huchuy Ayni pilot carried out with the communities of the Huancavelica
region, the following issues will be addressedby the Action Plan with indigenous populations in the high
Andes:
    Duringthe first year, and gradually duringthe following years, the Project will expand the scope of
    its calls for proposals for peasant communities beyond the Huancavelica region, to include other
    areas where communal organization predominates and where the prevailing conditions allow greater
    possibilities of success in improving agribusinesses through the provision of services, in terms of
    stronger producer organizations, and in relation to the supply of services. In these areas competitive
    funding will be used to co-finance capacity building and technical assistance for agribusiness
    improvement subprojects conducted by producer organizations inpeasant communities;
    In areas in which promising experiences of agribusinesses are being developed and expressing the
    existing demand, communities will be selected that have identified opportunities for businesses to
    arise from the sustainable local natural resources. Also, areas will be selected in which livestock
    (cattle) activity i s most important for generating income. This choice i s justified by the greater
    relative importance of the market for private professional services meeting the demand from livestock
    breedersinpeasantcommunities;
    The selected areas must have access to a first-order (primary) market, to ensure greater agribusiness
    viability. Also, those areas where there is a significant presence of local capacities for agribusiness
    managementwill be preferred;
    The potential for future economic development will be targeted by only admitting for consideration
    proposals envisaging the sustainable development of local biodiversity by producing, processing, and
    marketing specific natural resources. Proposals for ecotourism or other rural agribusinesses will also
    be admitted for considerations that combine the sustainable resource development with traditional
    practices of the indigenous peoples, so that their identity i s also strengthened;
    The level of institutional development of the indigenous peoples will be taken into account in the
    selection of beneficiaries, by giving preference to zones that have well developed communal
    organizations. These organizations must be important allies of the Project, involved from the start by
    disseminating information on the Project's objectives, planning local actions, organizing events and
    capacity building activities, disseminating information to support their members' entrepreneurial
    activities, and providing social control to ensure the successful implementation of the subprojects to
    be co-financed;
    Throughout the implementation of the competitive fund for peasant communities, the Project will
    develop actions to help mitigate critical negative factors and ensure the success of agribusinesses led
    by communal producers. Special efforts will be made to build local capacities for the formulation,
    implementation, and management of business plans, both for service providers and among leaders of
    producer organizations. To that end, special care will be taken to improve capacities in the handling
    of such tools as businessplans, balanced score cards, logical frameworks and budgets; and
    Actions will be developed to empower producers as demanders of services and implementers of the
    subprojects to be co-financed by INCAGRO. The structure of the strategic partnership implemented

    by an individualor institutionpartnering with it in formulating and implementing the subproject.
4.3 Amazonian IndigenousPeoples
The study prepared to develop the guidelines for action with Amazonian indigenous peoples (Smith2004)
proposes as a general strategy that, during an initial period of at least two years and based on work done
in specific areas, a development model be established for entrepreneurial activities among Amazon
indigenous populations. The model will promote the basic conditions and know-how required to improve
competitiveness and achieve a good market position. To that end, proper attention will be paid to such
actions as may contribute to land use regulation, as well as to the provision of training and consultancy
services supporting the sustainable development of natural resources within the framework of viable
business management. As to the instrument to be used to achieve the objectives of the Action Plan, the
Smith study recommends that a program be implemented to support agribusiness proposals through
competitive fundinginthe form of a fundingwindow designed in accordance with the cultural framework
of the given people, and ensuring equal opportunities of access. Emphasis i s placed on the crucial
importance of contacting the indigenous peoples to ensure their active participation in designing the
implementation instrument, and later in its implementation; and of enlisting the knowledgeable advice of
people familiar with the people and the communities in question. The details about the instrument
designed for Amazonian (and Andean) indigenous peoples are set forth in the next section of this
document. The operational plan will consider the following:
    During an initial period of at least two years, the Project will limit its attention to a few areas
    inhabited by indigenous communities inthe Amazon where prevailing conditions offer better chances
    of success in improving agribusinesses through services. Duringthis period, the Project can trial and
    consolidate various methods for supporting the indigenous economy;
    Duringthe first two years of Phase 11,four pilot cases will be selected-two       pilots each in the high
    forest and low forest zones. This will make it possible to experiment with very different ecosystems
    and different natural resources;
    In principle, each pilot case must have access to a first-order (primary) market, to facilitate business.
    This would limit the selection to zones of easy accessibility to Zquitos, Pucallpa, Puerto Maldonado,
    Leticia-Tabatinga, Tarupoto,and to the roadnetwork of the CentralForest;
    Only proposals envisaging the sustainable development of natural resources will be admitted for
    consideration. This includes areas where the existence or proposed creation of communal forest
    reserves or the titling of extensive forest areas open possibilities of future economic development
    based on the sustainable development of such resources in the form of extraction, processing and
    marketing, or ecotourism;
   The level of institutional development of the indigenous peoples will be taken into account in the
    selection of beneficiaries, by giving preference to zones that have better developed communal and
    inter-communal organizations. These organizations must be important allies of the Project, involved
    from the start by disseminating information on the Project's objectives, planning local actions,
    organizing events and capacity building activities, disseminating information to support their
    members' entrepreneurial activities, and providing social control to ensure the successful
    implementationof the subprojects to be co-financed;
    The existence of public or private institutions working in the same area andor on similar issues will
    also be taken in to account given their potential as strategic partners of the Project. The institutions
    that work directly with Amazonian indigenous peoples inPeru are few. Of those few, very few indeed
    focus their work on economic development, production alternatives, and micro-businesses for
    agribusiness development. The institutional offer in the areas selected for implementing the pilots
    will be evaluated with a view to explore the possibilities of establishing strategic partnerships; and
    Duringthe first year at least, the Project will develop actions to help mitigate critical negative factors
    and ensure the success of the intervention. These actions will include land use regulation (land titling,

    etc.) the formulation and implementation of management plans, and the dissemination of knowledge
    on market conditions andhow to prepareabusiness plan.

   7. FinancingtheAndeanandAmazonianIndigenousPeoplesActionPlan

Table A.10.1.A.3 shows how the Andean and Amazonian Indigenous Peoples Action Plan will be financed.
The main sources of financing are the World Bank, Matching Funds from the Peruvian Government, and
Strategic Partnerships (mainly producers receiving the services as beneficiaries). The funds from the first
two sources are equivalent to the resources of the Project for Strengthening the Service Market (ATF)
which i s to implement the Action Plan. The resources that will be contributed by the partnerships are
basically the co-financing of the subprojects to be executed by the producers receiving the services as
beneficiaries.

              Planfor DisseminationoftheAndeanandAmazonianIndigenousPeoplesActionPlan

Inordertoensurethat theAndean andAmazonianIndigenousPeoplesActionPlan reachesthemain
stakeholdersinvolved, the following guidelines have been drawn up for its dissemination:
a.Dissemination of the Action Planthrough the INCAGRO web site and the MINAG portal, ensuring that
  updated information i s posted in these virtual media about the activities and events conducted by the
  ATF inconnection with the Plan.
b.Dissemination of the Action Plan through events introducing INCAGRO and the ATF in the regions,
  both former ones and new ones, where the Project will be working in Phase 11, in coordination with the
  Regional Government authorities, local authorities, and representatives of the agencies and institutions
  of the public andprivate sector.




                                                   89

c.Dissemination of the Action Plan at the Local Fora to be conducted in the regions in which Phase I1
   will be operating.
d.Dissemination of the Action Plan through specially trained promoters conversant in the indigenous
   languages predominant in the areas where the call for proposals will be issued (Quechua,Aymaru and
   other native languages like those for the Ashaninka, Yanesha, Bora, Huitoto, Cocama, Quichua,
   Omagua, Jibaro, Yagua, Ocaina and other ethnic groups). These promoters will travel to the peasant
   communities, native communities, and other local groups in these areas in order to make public the
   Plan's objectives, the characteristics of the funding window competition, and requirements for
   participation therein.
e.Dissemination of the Action Plan through a brochure to be distributed in local newspapers in the
   regions in which the Project i s to promote the Plan, explaining its goals and expected results.
f.Hiring of the services of a social communicator to design a communication strategy in the regions
   where the Project will work in Phase 11, particularly with regard to the execution of activities in the
   framework of the Action Plan.
The approximate total cost of the Dissemination Plan is US$60,830, corresponding to the Promotion and
Disseminationitem inthe budget contained inTable A.lO.1.A.2.

                      Annex 10.l.B: RuralWomen's OrganizationsActionPlan
1.Strategic ContextandRationale:
The emphasis laid on the equity principle i s related to two fundamental aspects of equity. On one hand, it
i s important to understand equity as the manner in which the overall organization of a society-not               only
of its poor or of any particular group-nables        or impedes access to tangible and intangible resources to
develop its capacities. On the other, the implications of applying this principle to the way a Government
(and, therefore, the Project) acts regarding its responsibility to increase opportunities for its citizens,
especially those in the most vulnerable segments           'l. The initial studies carried outz2revealed that
organized groups of rural women producers were engaged in agribusiness activities involving growing
and breeding a wide variety of crops and livestock, and included production, processing and marketing
activities. These producer women had an unsatisfied demand to improve their market articulation as a
way to increase their income. The strategy for improving that articulation was significantly associated to
access to specialist professional services enabling them to improve both the productivity and product
quality of their businessesand the managementof their marketing channels, their negotiation power, their
share of the net marketing margin [net margin of commercialization] and their profitability.
However, in those areas where women producers engage in production and other business activities, the
service market evinces all the limitations identifiedfor the rural milieu in general. Those limitations are
even more serious in those areas where indigenous peoples live (the initial studies were focused on high
Andean locations with a predominantly indigenous population, such as the Huancavelica region). Market
development in this area is extremely low because of the poor dynamism of the goods and services
markets, the poor social and economic infrastructure, the lack of information at all levels and the low
institutional development of the service supply-a          state of affairs that further aggravates the state of
general uncertainty and lack of knowledge prevailing among producers as much as potential services
providers. In addition to all that, women producers were found to have only limited participation as
demanders of services. This was associatedto exclusion processes brought about by the cultural, social
and economic characteristics of women in that milieu as much as by gender inequities proper. In general
terms, rural women producers are a very vulnerable segment of the population because they suffer not
only gender discrimination but also ethnic discrimination as members of indigenous Andean or

Amazonian ethnic groups.23.On the side of service supply, women's limited participation as service
providers was found along with the absence of a gender approach to service provision in general. Hence
the ,need to implement a differentiated strategy to promote equitable participation by these women
producers inthe service market and the innovation systemi s required.
Inresponseto thesefindings, theATFdecidedto prepareaRuralWomen's Organizations ActionPlanto
be implemented during Phase 11. This Plan will make it possible to adequately promote women
producers' participation in the innovation service market from a gender equity perspective, as a means to
improve women producers' agribusinesses and to attend to this newly found demand for better market
articulation. Working with this population group in an action strategy i s consistent with the national
policies of promotion of segments of the population that have been or are affected by exclusion and
discrimination processes. In fact, documents of such major national policy (including agricultural policy)
relevance as Peru's National Agreement, explicitly state this objective24 "Eleven - National Policy:
Promoting Equality of Opportunitieswithout Discrimination.
Of the various groups facing the situations of discrimination and social inequity emphasized by the
Agreement, the ones most relevant to the Project's intervention strategy are "women'' and "the members
of ethnic communities" (indigenous populations among them), who have a large presence inrural areas in
general and in the agricultural sector in particular. As regards Agricultural Policy in particular, the

de Estado en la Agriculturu del Peru'", specifically states that ... the role and the logic of public
document prepared by MINAG's Agricultural Planning Office in 2004, entitled "Basespara una Politica

intervention should go beyond the mere `administration' of the market" and ". .. public rationality should
                                                                                    "


not be associated only to the idea of competitiveness and efficiency", but also to the constant search for
equity. Inthis sense, it points out that "the State should bear a responsibility for improvingthe quality of
life and opportunities of its citizens, especially those in the most vulnerable segments, such as the rural
poor. This strategic objective is associated to the need to articulate agricultural producers in poor and
extremely poor areas ... to the markets ..."25. As mentioned before, the highest level of poverty is found
in the rural areas in general and among the indigenous population in particular26 and this is even most
critical when the specific situation of women i s analyzed, in particular those who are not family heads.27.
This means that among the target population of the Project, there is a higher level of vulnerability among
the women working in productive activities. This is the rationale of the Project's intervention strategy
which emphasizes actions specifically focused on rural women producers within the context of its general
policy of promoting equitable access to the innovation services market in order to improve agribusiness
competitiveness.
As a partof the preparation of PhaseI1del Project andthe presentAction Plan, a study was carried out for
the purpose of drawing up the main guidelines of the latter, as well as a study on the design of the
instruments to be implemented to achieve the objectives proposed in saidAction Plan. This second study
has been entitled"Design of a FundingWindow for the Co-financing of Capacity Buildingand Technical
Assistance Subprojects for the Improvement of Agribusinesses Led by Organizations of Rural Women".
Also taken into account were the inputs obtained as a result of the implementation of Phase I,as well as

those derived from field work carried out within the framework of the preparation of Phase I128.The
general guidelines of the Action Plan and its implementation tools are described inthe following sections.
Finally, it should be mentioned that, although women producers tend to be concentrated in the poorest
segments of the rural area, they also present more dynamic segments in terms of technology and market
insertion. The explicitly differentiated work to be performed with these groups during Phase I1 will
amount to an effort aimed at identifying their contribution to innovation and technological development
as much as at promoting equitable participationinthe service market by rural women.

2. The ChallengesFacedby RuralWorkingWomen
A study carried out to prepare the guidelines for the Rural Women's Organizations Action Plan made the
following findings inrelation to the condition of women producers::29:
     Rural women perform very important roles infamilybuilding, inincome generation and in communal
     life. There is, however, a lack of perception of these roles by most people in the community-not
     least the women themselves-which          hampers human and economic growth inthe rural milieu. On the
     other hand, women do not live alone. They live in a society with culturally and historically
     established relationship systems that are determinant in every sphere of activity. Our analysis must
     therefore have a comprehensive approach and a gender perspective.
     The limitations and opportunities which women must face for their own development are generated
     by the peculiar and complex relationships they establish with respect to men, which vary on a case by
     case basis according to specific factors, such as the geographic location, the production system and
     the culture. Itis necessaryto consider social differences andproceedaccording to context.
     Any programs, projects or activities addressing women must also consider a strategy for husbands
     and families. Their cooperation i s a necessaryfactor of equitable family development.
     Young women and men and the immensely valuable human capital they represent must receive
     adequate attention. Young women in particular show a sense of responsibility with regard to the tasks
     assumed or the commitments made that makes their active involvement in future activities
     particularly usefuland necessary.
     Poor communities, who are the majority in Peru, are going through a process of deterioration in their
     gender, generational and communal relations. The weakening of social relations within these
     communities further deteriorates the quality of life for community members and hampers their
     projection into the future. No community aspiring to develop can do without the constructive
     contribution of the majority of its members. On the contrary, it must make the most of each member's
     specific skills and capacities and harness them for the common good of the community. To have each
     age group develop a vision and mission for the future would contribute greatly to its development.
     If implementedwithout a duly differentiatedapproach, credit and grant programs will usually widen
     the gap already separating the social groups in a community, because those who are living in better
     conditions take more and better advantage of the support received. This has been seen even in the
     poorest communities. It i s necessary to have those programs implemented equitably and in a
     differentiatedway to avoid risks or power conflicts within the community.
     By focusing their intervention on specific social groups, development support programs can put the
     specific virtues, capacities and skills of men, women, older people, young people and children to
     work for the growth of their community.
     To enhancethe sustainability chances of an investment such as the one the ATF plans to make by co-
     financing services to improve agribusinesses managed by rural women's organizations, it i s
     necessary, in parallel to the competitive allocation of resources, to develop a capacities building

    program which should include gender aspects and credit culture for men and women.
    Given that gender equality is still a goal to be achieved, actions must be promoted that tend to build
    objective equity, thus eliminating the vast gap between theoretical equality under the law and the
    existing very real inequality. Awareness raising regarding access to credit, training and resources
    control must go hand ina hand with a strategy to fight self-exclusion.
    Whatever approach i s chosen for the intervention, it must take into account a holistic view of
    women's lives which encompasses their three main three roles-in         the family, at work (production)
    and within the community. Even though ATF's envisaged intervention only addresses one of these
    roles-production-the     interventionstrategy must take the other two roles into account.
    Women are used to repeat, from one generation to the next, stereotypes and myths that hamper their
    progress and participation in the production systems. A joint review of this challenge would help
    create the appropriate conditions for thinkingabout and identifying the main issues involved.
    Women do not favor their daughters' involvement in the organizations-especially the federations-
    because they hope they will have a different future, free from needs that have to be met through an
    organization. This idea helps neither the emergence of a new leadership nor the dissemination of
    knowledge among girls. In each project prepared on the basis of an organization, it i s necessary to
    include training activities for girls in order to create the conditions for democratic and independent
    leadership.
3. InterventionStrategy of the Strengthening the Market for InnovationServices Component for
RuralWomen's Organizations
The intervention strategy of the Project for the promotion of the equitable participation by rural women
producers in the service market for services and the innovation system i s based on the development of
two levels of action as described in section 10.A.l. At the first level, the role of third party public or
private stakeholders will be critical, given that the Project's essentially only role will be that of facilitator
and promoter. At the direct intervention level, the Project will have the lead. This strategy will require
the gradual intervention of the Project in the various areas where such organized groups of women
producers live, initially through pilot programs. The areas of intervention will be selected according to
criteria designed to increase the chances of success. Later, instruments will be implemented for more
generalized intervention. Both levels of action are envisaged in the Rural Women Organizations Action
Plan. The level of direct action will be developed mainly through the implementation of a competitive
fund to co-finance the capacity building and technical assistance subprojects for improved agribusiness
under the management of this category of women producers. Finally, it i s important to mention that the
treatment of population groups excluded from the service market, as i s the case with rural women
producers, i s addressedby all three Projects of the INCAGRO Program usinga three-pronged approach.
The Project for Strengthening the Service Market essentially consists of implementing the Action Plan
designed for the work to be performed with this segment of the target population. This involves not only
organizing the calls for proposals and performing whatever support activities are required, but also
attending to issues relatedto the formalization of women producer organizations and dealing with-albeit
indirectly-with   other issues relating to the cultural and socioeconomic milieu in which the women
producers live. The Project for Strengthening Strategic Research and Development Capacities will help
develop a supply of services tailored to the specific needs of this population segment. Finally, the Project
for Policies, Information and Innovation Services Quality will generate information on ongoing basis
about the supply and demand of services, in addition to providing quality incentives for those services in
the form of awards.
4. MainGuidelines of the RuralWomen's OrganizationsAction Plan
4.1 CentralObjective andSpecificObjectivesof the ActionPlan
The central objective of the Action Plan with Rural Women's Organizations i s to promote equitable
participation by these women producers in the service market and the innovation system as a way to
improve their agribusinesses. Equal opportunities for women producers to participate in the service


                                                      93

  market will be promoted also as a way to help reduce the causes of their social and ethnic exclusion. Due
  account will be taken of their socioeconomic and cultural peculiarities. The Action Plan's three specific
  objectives-two      of them on the side of service demand, one on the side of service supply-are:        (a)
  Empower and strengthen the capacities of women producers as customers requiring services enabling
  them to improve their agribusinesses; (b) Strengthen the organizational and entrepreneurial capacities of
  women producers; and (c) Promote a supply of services appropriate for working with women producers,
  including women producer leaders as suppliers of services. By empowering and strengthening women
' producers as demanders of specialized innovation services, the project will increase their organizational
  and entrepreneurial capacities as a way to improve their agribusinesses, their income, and, ultimately,
  their well being. For this to be possible, it i s necessary to foster the supply of quality services using
  methodologies appropriate for this target population, ensuring that technologies are adopted, information
  i s handled and management i s improved as required by the women producers as beneficiaries. Women
  producer leaders may assume the role of quality service suppliers themselves, provided they have the
  necessary capacities.
  The empowerment and strengthening of women producer organizations will also help gain for the latter
. members' democratic attention to their needs anddemands, within a context of democratic insertion into
  their respective communities' political life for joint work with their male counterparts. Fulfilling these
  objectives will require of the Project to perform actions from a gender equity perspective. The focus will
  be on strengthening the members of families, groups and organizations in accordance with their specific
  conditions within their gender relations systems, so as to build integrated democratic spaces and solid
  families providing the institutional foundation for rural development. In this sense, support for women
  producer organizations must never lose sight either of its ultimate purpose and temporary status, or of the
  principles of integrationanddemocratic representation.

  4.2 Action PlanPolicy Guidelines
  The implementation of the Rural Women's Organizations Action Plan with a gender equity perspective
  requires takinginto account the followingpolicy guidelines:
  a) Facilitate and support the participation of women-organized       or not-in  the Project's benefits, using
       a gender and human development approach, and an equity perspective;
  b) Recognize that group and individual participation and growth of women's organizations is a process
       to be fostered by implementing ongoing capacity building, accompanying and monitoring actions;
  c) Incorporate men-family            members, authorities and communal leaders-into  the actions supporting
       women;
  d) Develop actions to support women and their organizations3', as well as the young, wherever and
       whenever necessary, always seeking gender integration;
  e) Adopt a comprehensive approach to the life of organized women, based on understanding that their
       role as producers cannot be supported without taking into account their roles within the family and
       the community; and
  f) Facilitate group processesof adoption and reinforcement of value conducive to human development,
       such as solidarity, reciprocity, honesty and hard work, as a basis for strengthening capacities and
       sustainablelocal development.
  4.3 Actions andStrategiesProposed for the Project's Indirect Intervention
  What follows is a description of actions and strategies proposed in the study for the preparation of the
   Rural Women's Organizations Action Plan. The recommendations regarding the Project's contribution at
  the indirect intervention level are complemented with references to the cultural and socioeconomic milieu
  inwhich women producers operate.

                                                                 94

Objective 1: Organized women acquire the knowledge required to improve their opportunities to
participate. Actions: (a) Build their capacities in terms of ability to improve their roles and family
relationships; (b) Build their capacities in terms of ability to take care of their own health; (c) Buildtheir
production and marketing capacities and (d) Build their effective organization and democratic leadership
capacities.
Strategy: (a) Identify the various types of organizational progress and classify the organizations for
purposes of support strategy implementation; (b) Make arrangements with women group leaders for the
involvement of the various social groups, with a special focus on the youngest; (c) Make arrangements
with educational institutions of recognized standing; (d) Make arrangements with thematically specialized
institutions; and (e) Strengthen capacity building and technical assistance service providers by issuing
gender quality and human development certifications.
Objective 2: Women's organizations access theproductive resources they need to be competitive in terms
of quality and market position. Actions: (a) Help organized women to formalize their land titles and
water access rights; (b) Systematically provide the organizations with timely information on production,
marketing and other opportunities; (c) Look for innovative ways to facilitate the acquisition of animals,
seeds, tools, equipment and other inputs by women's organizations; and (d) Do research on the current
constraints affecting the various types of women peasant organizations, in order to facilitate members'
access to production and managementresources.
Strategy: (a) Ensure coordination with the competent agencies of the sector and the local authorities, and
make arrangements with them for training their officials on gender and human development issues; and
(b) Implement short applied research actions through agreements with higher education institutions and
professionals from local NGOs.
Objective 3: Women's organizations engage in direct relations with other organizations from the modern
sector. Actions: (a) Supply information on the various types of organizations they may do business with,
including exact contact data; (b) Inform and instruct organized women on an ongoing basis regardingthe
laws and rules governing their production activity; (c) Invite women's organizations to meetings, fairs,
seminars, etc. where they can enter direct relations with organizations from the modem sector; and (d)
create and update on an ongoing basis a database containing information on ruralwomen's organizations,
their products, skills and condition; and make it available to entrepreneurial organizations operating in the
agricultural sector.
Strategy: (a) Make sure local authorities and leaders are aware of the support expected of them for
women's organizations. Inthat context, it will be useful to raise their awareness of gender relations and
human development; (b) Strengthen the democratic leadership of women leaders by means of workshops
designed to promote their personal leadership, and accompany those processes on an ongoing basis; (c)
Make arrangements for exporters' organizations, business associations, financial agencies, etc. within the
sector to put the resources offered by women's organizations to best use; and (d) Stipulate agreements
with specialized local institutions (ONGs, universities) providing for capacity building, information
facilitation, awareness raising of authorities and leaders. Make the gender quality and human
development certification a part of such agreements.
Objective 4: Organized women receive recognition and support from their relations and social milieu.
Actions: (a) Hold periodic workshops on human and family relationships for organized women's family
members; (b) Strengthen organized women's personal and group processes by holding periodic
workshops on human and family relationships and leadership; (c) Involve all family members on
domestic role issues; and (d) Support the community's mixed-gender organizations, as well as women'
organizations, in the production of services supporting the domestic role, such as the supply of basic
information on how to runa home, to look after small children, old people, etc.
Strategy: (a) Establish agreements with local institutions specialized in quality capacity building on this
subject; (b) Consult with women in the organizations and their relations on their domestic problems and




                                                      95

needs; and (c) Discuss the values of human development with communal authorities, and foster activities
on their part supportingwomen's domestic role and organization..
Objective 5: Organized women and their organizations take part in identifying the community's
challenges andpotential strengths, and in communal decision making. Actions: (a) Use capacity building
to enhance the role of communal participation by organized women; (b) Raise the awareness of male
authorities and leaders of the importance of stimulating and supporting women's and women
organizations' participation in communal planning and management; (c) Make arrangements with
communal authorities for the representation of women's organizations in the community's decision
making process; and (d) Foster a close connection between women's organizations and mixed-gender
organizations within the community, and work for the former to build mixed-gender spaces in their
activities.
Strategy: (a) Wherever possible, use specialized organizations and/or professionals certified in gender
quality and human development in the implementation of awareness raising and capacity building
actions-whether    for men or women; (b) Keep communal authorities and leaders informed on what will
be done to facilitate women's representation in decision making processes on issues affecting the
community, and commit them to the process; and (c) Encourage young, single women to participateinthe
processes strengthening women's organizations in communal management. This will involve promoting
their participation in adult, family and organizational spaces, as well as providing them with incentives
(including certificates or other forms of individualrecognition).
As the next section will show, some of these recommendations have been built into the design of the
competitive fund for organized women producers. We are referring, inparticular, to the recommendations
relating to capacity building on market and agribusiness issues for women producers; capacity building
and certification on gender quality for service providers; promotion of young people's involvement. The
remaining recommendations will be implemented as a part of the indirect intervention actions to be
developed by the Project with the support of the relevant public and private institutions.

4.4 Scenarios for inviting women to submit proposals and the cross-cutting promotion of the gender
approach
Inconjunction with the implementationof a gender approach through the RuralWomen's Organizations
Action Plan, a set of scenarios needs to be considered in which differentiated measures will be applied
depending on the soundness of the women's organizations, or women's democratic and equitable
participation in the case of mixed-gender organizations, and the conditions for the implementation of the
fundingwindow. Also, a general strategy is proposed for cases in which the Project is intervening or has
intervened in support of producers' organizations as a result of the implementation of Phase I.Inthis way,
the diversity of situations surrounding the women's organization and the women's conditions for
participating will be taken into account.
a) In those cases in which the Project i s already intervening or has intervened in support of producers'
    organizations in general as a result of the activities carried out inPhase I,
                                                                               the results achieved will need
    to be strengthenedby promoting an equitable participationof women and young adults in the activities
    and benefits of the subprojects;
b) Inthe case of well-run women's organizations, which are already generating income and which seek to
    improve their profitability and growth, these will be invited to participate in the competitive fund
    created in the framework of this Action Plan. Using profile and proposal evaluation criteria, the
    incorporation of young adults in specific subproject activities will be promoted;
c) In the case of mixed-gender organizations that are democratic and strong, the possibility will be
    evaluated of allocating equitable participation quotas per gender in order that such organizations may
    enter the fundingwindow. Inthis case, the mixed-gender organizations will be trained, usingstrategies
    differentiated per gender, in family and community relationships with equity and human development;
    this training will be incorporated into the activities prior to implementation of the subproject.



                                                      96

     Subsequently, during the execution of the subproject, similar activities will be conducted for
     reinforcement purposes. The incorporation of young adults in specific subproject activities will be
     promotedusingprofile and proposal evaluation criteria; and
d) Inother scenarios in which the conditions are still insufficient interms of the degree of development of
     the women's organizations, support will be given to build the capabilities of these organizations,
     seeking to provide follow-up on their processes. One contribution will be the provision of integral
     training services under contracts or agreementsas the case may be. These organizations will participate
     inthe fundingwindow from the secondor thirdyear of Phase 11,butnot before then.
Based on these criteria, areas will be identified for the execution of diverse pilot experiences, depending on
the characteristics of the context in which the women's organizations are functioning. Successful cases
have previously been identified in other interventions, in different parts of the country, such as: i)
Development of the Puno-Cusco Corridor Project; ii)El Centro de Investigacidn, Educacidn y Desarrollo
(CIED) in Cajamarca; iii)SEPAR Seivicios Educativos Promocidn y Apoyo Rural in the Mantaro Valley;
iv) The Carob-tree project Consolidacidn y Validacidn del Manejo Integral de 10s Bosques Secos de la
Costa Norte del Peru` [Consolidation and Validation of the Integral Management of the Dry Forests in the
Northern Coastal Area of Peru]; v) Proyecto de Manejo de Recursos Naturales en la Sierra Sur del pais -
MARENASS [Project for the Management of Natural Resources in the Southern Andean Highland Area of
Peru -     MARENASS]; vi) CEDAP (Centro de Desarrollo Agropecuario) [Agriculture and Livestock
Development Center -CEDAP] inAyacucho; vii) CEDECUM inPuno; viii) Rural Roads Program; ix) The
experience of the Fondo Contravalor Peru'-Canadd.

7. Financingthe RuralWomen's OrganizationsActionPlan
Table A10.1.B.3 shows how the budget for the RuralWomen's Organizations Action Plan will be financed.
The main sources of financing are the World Bank, Matching Funds from the Peruvian Government, and
Strategic Partnerships (mainly beneficiary women producers). The funds from the first two sources are
equivalent to the resources of the Project for Strengthening the Service Market (ATF) which i s to
implement the Action Plan. The resources that will be contributed by the partnership are basically the co-
financing of the subprojects to be executedby the women producer beneficiaries.

Annex 10.2 The Environmental Impact Analysis and ProposedAction Plan
EA Category: B
1.Strategic Focusof the Project
The APL second phase Project sets out the expansion of a decentralized system of technological
innovation with the final objective to contribute to the generation and dissemination of sustainable and
environmentally safe technologies. This implies the involvement of innovation agents in a sustainable
strategy of natural resources use in all actions involved in technological changes in the improvement of
yield and competitiveness of farmingand forest-basedactivities.
Inthe first stage, the Project has been successful: (a) in introducing the criteria of environmentalimpacts
as a requirement of the qualification of technical quality in the selection of proposals on subprojects; (b)
to give special attention to the search for changes in agricultural practices and development of new
practices that have a significant effect on the natural resources of the system of production in different
agro-ecologies; and (c) to collect basic data on effects and environmental impacts of a critical number of
subprojects of technological innovation, identifying reasons of internalization of practices to mitigate
potentialenvironmentalimpacts duringthe technological adaptation processes.
An Environmental Mitigation Action Plan to mitigate potential adverse effects of the Phase I1Project,
since the latter through its different components, would play an important role in the technological
innovation process such as:       (a) expansion of technological innovation at the national level and
incorporation of new regions where the natural resources could undergo potential positive or negative
effects;  (b) changes in farming practices and the use of technological or consumer goods that are
associatedwith natural resources such as water, land, fauna and flora, and the need for sustainableuse of
fragile mixed farming systems; and (c) changes in livestock management associated with better natural
resource management and biodiversity conservation, implying a need for new adjustments in the
production systems.
Therefore, the Project while co-financing the services associated with technological changes must also
contribute to inducing the sustainable handlingof natural resources at a decentralized level, with strong
emphasis of such a paradigm in the new regions. The Project must also contribute to the strengthening of
the local management capacity in natural resources use, to encourage yield improvement and
competitiveness based on the generation and dissemination of environmentally safe technologies, and on
stimulating the social recognition of environmentally friendly practices.

Planof Actionon EnvironmentalEvaluationandManagement
The objective of the plan i s to incorporate environmental aspects in all relevant activities and technologies
proposed and financed by the Project and determine the potential impact on the environment prior to and
at time of project formulation to continue during implementation and post-impact analysis. The Phase I1
Project will contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally safe technologies and to
this endthe following actions areproposed:
1) Drawing up a Study on the MinimumPrior Conditions to be met by the subprojects, and establishing
the operational indicators that will be used as a filter for the approval of the subprojects before the
beginning of the secondphase. This means that the following activities needto be carried out:
     1.1) include in the requisites the minimum operational indicators that the subprojects applying to
     participatein the system should contain; and
     1.2) incorporate into the subproject follow-up and assessment system the indicators by which the
     subprojects are to be measuredand/or evaluated.
2) Draw up a "Methodological Validation Study on Effects and Impacts per type of Subproject,
intervention sites, and impact areas". This should permit, first and foremost, the generation of a standard
instrument for the evaluation of potential environmental risks of new technologies to be introduced. This
involves such tasks as:
     2.1) implementing an Environmental Management Plan that will forecast the direct, indirect, and
     cumulative impacts, and induced risks that could be caused to the different environmental
     components;
     2.2) using representative environmental variables to identify impacts and justify the scale, level of
     resolution and volume of data, replicability of the information, definition of impact thresholds, and
     identification of both critical or inadmissible impacts and positive impacts;
     2.3) awareness of the existing regulations and national standards and geographic area of intervention;
     and
     2.4) hiring an expert (using Project Component funds) to carry out the validation study and resulting
     EnvironmentalManagement Plan for use as a managementtool and for subsequentM&E.
3) Promote by means of the calls for grant proposals and by conducting local and regional fora, an
environmental awareness-raising process; requiringthose entities that take part in the system to carry out
a positive environmental management process (total quality) on the contents of their processes and end
products, with emphasis on aspects that have the greatest impact on the environment, and which will be
given greater weight inthe selection process.
This process implies carrying out awareness-raising andtraining activities both within the Project and for
the public, including:
     3.1) training the Project personnel, especially the personnel for the new regions, in the knowledge,
     management and application of the minimum environmental indicators and their use in M&E
     activities;
     3.2) extending training activities to the personnel of the organizations executing subprojects financed
     with Project funds; and
     3.3) preparing the pertinent training and extension materials.
4) Creating award mechanisms whereby the Project will be able to reward the participatingorganizations
whose proposals contribute efficiently to: improving the rational use of natural resources; the
implementation of good farming practices; the implementation of management plans for forests and
natural forest land; improvement of irrigation infrastructure; and the economic valuation of natural
resourcesinterms of their diversity and demand. This activity would include:
     4.1) earmarking about 20% of the Component 3 budget to be spent on prizes for subprojects meeting
     the environmental objectives of the Project strategy.
     4.2) hiringan expert to evaluate the environmentalquality of the subprojects.
5) Entering into agreements with organizations that are competent in forecasting and controlling
environmental risks, in order to help:


                                                      101

    5.1) improve the regulatory framework for technological innovation; and
    5.2) coordinate with the national regulatory institutions assistance for compliance with, or the
    application of, existing environmental regulations.
6) Periodic evaluation of the Environmental Management Plans drawn up by the subprojects, which
should include, among other aspects:
    6.1) the development of capacities of executors and producers;
    6.2) the action plan, basedon the results of minimumindicators, duly scheduled and budgeted; and
    6.3) the drafting of specific reports on the advances of the Environmental Management Plans and
    compliance therewith.
7) Conducting mid-term and final evaluations of the results achieved by applying the technologies
proposed by the Subprojects, in order to assess the environmental benefits obtained, taking into account
the quality of the processes and the end product in connection with the business plans. It will be
necessaryto:
    7.1) hire two impact assessment experts, one for the mid-term phase and the other for the final phase,
    to perform the evaluation of effects and impacts of the proposed technologies, as well as the
    environmental benefits obtained, this evaluation i s to be madeup to 2007; and
    7.2) produce evaluation reports in each phase, the results of which will be systematized and inserted
    into the management information system.
8) Updating and dissemination of current regulations with regard to natural resource management in
terms of quality management, total quality, social impact, biosafety, and others.
9) Subprojects should conduct environmental valuation exercises (costhenefit), and for this purpose it i s
proposed to:
    9.1) encourage the executing organizations to conduct an environmental valuation exercise of the
    benefits they propose to obtain through technologies already implementedor to be implemented; and
    9.2) facilitate the training of experts in environmental economic valuation, so that they will be able to
    assist any subprojects requiring help. This would be cost-shared with the organization(s) conducting
    the exercise.
10) Extracting from the subprojects all possible lessons that may suggest ways of improving the
legislation on environmental issues, interms of both planningand management of natural resources.
The legislation that serves as a support for the proper management of the Subprojects should also be
known and taken into account in the subprojects' M&E process. It should also be taken into account in
the process of evaluation of the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) during the funding window
competitions, so that considerations of regulatory aspects may also be used in the scoring and final
qualification.

Financing the Action Plan for Environmental Risk Prevention
Table A.10.2.3 shows how the Action Plan will be financed. The main sources of financing are the
World Bank, Matching Funds from the Peruvian Government, and Strategic Partnerships. The funds
from the first two sources are equivalent to the resources of the Project for the generation of policies,
information, and quality of the innovation services which will enable the Action Plan to be executed. The
resources to be contributed by the partnerships are basically the co-financing of the subprojects to be
executed by the producers receiving the services as beneficiaries.

1.PESTMANAGEMENTSTRATEGY
In the second phase Project of the APL program and according to the environmental assessment
conducted, the Bank's Pest management policy 31 (OP4.09) would be invoked to develop and implement
ecologically based integrated pest management (IPM) strategies in all subprojects co-financed by the
Project in the agriculture sector where pest managementissues may have a potentially deleterious impact
on human health andenvironment.
The Project implementation team of Phase 1 has been successful in: (a) addressing procurement,
handling, application, and disposal of pest control products and monitoring the impact of pesticide use;
and (b) monitoring changes in agricultural practices and growing new crops and cultivars where
significantly different IPMmeasures were taken; particular attention was given to crops such as cotton,
vegetables, fruits, and rice, which are often associatedwith heavy use of pesticides (refer to Bank's policy
on OP 4.01, Annex C). Similar approacheswould be taken in the second phase but due to the scaling up
of the project nationwide additional attention will be given to train personnel inthe new regions about the
safeuse of pesticides and environmentally sound integrated pest managementprocedures.
A pest management planwas deemednecessarydue to Project interventions within Components 1and 2
that would: (i)  Change cultivation and management practices and use of newly improved cultivars and
crops that may have better pest tolerance; (ii)      Potential increased use of pesticide with agricultural
intensification; and (iii)Potentialuse of pesticides with introduced crops or cultivars in a geographic area
where it has not been cultivated previously.
The pest management plan inpreparation will address following issues:
(a) all subprojects receiving finance for procurement of pest control products from the Projec may be
used to purchase pest control products, the following products classified as "Class 1A and LB" and
specified "Class 2 formulations" usingguidelines of WHOPCS 200232;
(b) all subprojects receiving finance for procurement of pest control products directly or wil provide
credit that may be transporting, storing, or disposing environmentally significant and substantial
quantities of highly toxic pesticide materials for use under the Project will request a hazard assessment as
part of the subproject proposal indicating risk mitigation plan within the Environmental Plan (see section
A.10.2.);
(c) the Project in its subproject selection and monitoring would include financing for relevant support to
develop and implement an integrated pest management (IPM)program, aimed at reducing environmental
and health hazards associatedwith pest control and the use of pesticides;
(d) duringproject implementation, the Agricultural Specialist of the M&EUnitwith assistancefrom other
appropriate technical specialists would evaluate subproject proposals for their contribution to IPM
strategy, based on local conditions. Where there i s an identified need to strengthen the local capacity in
IPM,the national and internationalexpertise and available facilities of other institutes will be usedunder
a collaborative agreement with the Project; and
(e) the Project, to satisfy the requirements of the rules and regulations of the country, the IPM strategy of
the Project, and policy requirements of the Bank will establish collaboration with the Sewicio Nacional
de SunidadAgruria (SENASA), which i s the National Focal Point for the approval of pesticides for use in
Peru.

2. PEST MANAGEMENTACTION PLAN
Stage I: Includedinitial reconnaissanceto identify the main pest problems and their contexts (ecological,
agricultural, public health, economic, and institutional) and define broad parameters for evaluation at
Appraisal by the Component 2 with technical assistance from a Pest management specialist.
Stage ZI:      Development of specific operational plans to address the pest problems identified as a
component of the project itself. These activities may include and not be limited to:
(i)implementation and dissemination of the list of pest control products authorized for procurement (as
described earlier Class IA, IB and some Class I1formulations that are prohibited and the specified safe
products - Class I1onwards);
(ii)development of IPMapproaches (biological control, cultural practices in habitat management, use of
resistant or tolerant varieties, replacement of pesticide use to the minimum with other environmentally
safe practices) and generalpolicy compliance with the Bank's Policy OP4.09;
(iii) theProjectcomponent3activitiesandinrelationtotheEnvironmentalPlan,identifyactions
     within
required:     (a) to improve the policy, economic, institutional, and legal framework for regulating,
procuring, and managing pesticides that are consistent with an IPMapproach and are sustainable; and (b)
the proposed mechanisms for financing, implementing, monitoring, and supervising components relating
to pest management or pesticide use, including any role envisaged for the private sector including local
nongovernmental organizations;
(iv) depending on the nature and complexity of the pest management and pesticide-related issues

  parameters for Project 2 evaluation with technical assistance from a specialist in pest and disease
  management33.Studies will be commissioned from consultants. The expected results are as follows:
  1. Present and potential pests and diseases, relevant to the activities of INCAGRO Projects 1 (FTA) and 2
     (FDSE).
  2. Pest and disease management practices currently in use and practices proposed to be carried out by
     INCAGRO Project 2 (FDSE).
  3. Parameters for evaluation (which should be performed continuously) of current and proposed pest
     management strategies, and recommendations for their adaptation if necessary.
  4. Priority given to encouraging the development of I P M approaches (biological control, cultivation
     practices in specific habitats, use of resistant or tolerant varieties, replacement o f minimumpesticide use
     with other environmentally safe practices), through subprojects co-financed by the FTA and FDSE, in the
     framework o f activities to strengthen the Strategic Programme for Plant and Animal Research and

I2: Use and handling of pesticides The National FocalPoint for the approval of pesticideuse in Peru i s
                                       -                                                                        15.OOO
 the NationalAgricultural HealthService (SENASA). A list of pesticides authorizedfor procurement should
 be drawnup and disseminated; and pest controlproductsconsideredsafe should also be listed. The costs of
 preparingthe documents andpublishingthem for their dissemination shouldbe coordinated with SENASA.
 INCAGRO will be expected to co-financethese costs up to a maximumamount of US $ 15,000.00. This
 coordinationwith SENASA shouldresultinthe following productsfor publication:
 1. Current situationof pesticideuse and review of the use of pesticides proposedor forecast in an ecology
    strategy:
 2. List of pesticides in use in the country, including the crops or vectors on which they are used, and
    classification of the pesticides (of the commercial formulations) based on the WHO classification of
    forbiddenpesticides.
 3. Descriptionof pattems of use in Peru, ascertainingwhether the pesticides are being used in a context of
    integratedpest management(IPM).
 4. Evaluationof end users' capacities and competence to handlethe products with an acceptable marginof
    risk, as aresultof familiarity with the circumstancesforecastfor the use of pesticides.
 5. Selection of pesticides authorized for procurement using funds allocated by Projects 1 (FTA) and 2
    (FDSE) of the INCAGRO Programme.
 6. Inventory of new, less hazardous products available, and of new techniques such as biological pest
    control andtraps.
 3: Policies, legal framework and institutional capacity      -To systematize and assess existing national      20,000
 policies on integratedpest management (IPM) and integratedvector management (IVM) and the extent of
 their integration and coherence with Peru's strategies and policies for agricultural development; also, to
 assess the coherence of the INCAGRO Programme strategy and implementationtools with said policies.
 The terms of reference of the studies requiredshouldbe reviewedby SENASA andby INCAGRO, in order
 to guarantee:
 1.Evaluation of Peru's legal framework for controlling the distribution and use of pesticides, and the
    measuresto be taken by organizations executing the subprojectsco-financedby INCAGRO.
 2. Evaluation of the regulations for promoting integrated pest management and associated standards,
    ascertaining to what extent they are applicable in the activities of INCAGRO Projects 1 (ATF) and 2
    (FDSE).
 3. Descriptionand evaluationof both the national capacity and the capacity of the regions for developing
    and executing an ecologically sound strategy for integratedpest management(IPM) and for integrated
    vector management(IVM).
 4. Ongoing revision of the political, economic, institutional, and legal frameworks for the regulation,
    acquisition,and management of pesticidesconsistent with the IPMapproachon a sustainablebase.
 5. Identification of improvementin the general policies to encourage the development of IPM alternatives
    (biological control, cultivation practices in specific habitats, use of resistant or tolerant varieties,
    replacement of minimum use with other environmentally safe practices), in keeping with Peruvian
    legislation, with regional and intemationaltreaties Peru has subscribed to, and with World Bank Policy

 in everything to do with the ecological strategy for pest management. The costs of this activity will be
 includedinthe activities of the INCAGRO follow-up andassessmentsystem (Project 3). It includes:
  1. Follow-up and assessment plan, specifying those responsible for its execution, the experts required by
    this plan, andthe costs involved.
 2. Determination of risk evaluation indicators, for evaluating potential environmental, occupational, and
     public health impacts associated with the transportation, storage, distribution, and use of the proposed
     products,under local conditions,andthe risks associatedwith the disposalof the containers.
 3. Guidelinesregardingpre-requisites and measures requiredfor reducingspecific risks associated with the
     use of pesticidestaken into accountby INCAGRO.
 4. Proposal of mechanisms for the financing, execution, follow-up, and supervision of the components
     associated with pest management or the use of pesticides, including preventive roles for the private
     sector; localnon-govemmentalorganizations are not excludedfrom playing such roles.
 5. INCAGRO, in its processes of selection and follow-up of subprojects will include assistance for the
     development and execution of integrated pest management (IPM) programs in order to reduce
     environmentalandhealthrisks associatedwith pestcontrolandthe useof pesticides.

               Banco Mundial.

               La Carta refuerza el objetivo central de politica agraria del Estado peruano. expresada en
               documentos oficiales del Sector, cual es el de elevar la rentabilidad y la competitividad del
               sector agrario, dinamizando el empleo y reduciendo la pobreza rural, en el marco del rol
               subsidiario del Estado, el us0 eficiente de 10s recursos publicos, e l manejo sostenible de 10s
               recursos naturales y la preservacion de la calidad del medio ambiente.

               Para alcanzar dicho objetivo, el Gobierno se propone continuar con el proceso de
               modemizacibn del sector, orientado a la construccibn de una plataforma de servicios, la cual
               permitira incrementar la competitividad de 10s productores agrarios, haciendo posible
               afrontar de manera eficiente 10s nuevos retos y oportunidades que se generaran como

          CARTA DE POLITICAS DFI, GOBIERNO DEI, PERi AL HAXCO MtINDLAL,
         COX RELACION        A LA FASE 11 DEL PROC;UMA              INCAGRO: INNOVACION Y
                          COMPE'TITIVLDAD PARA EL AGKO PERUANO

      1.    IntroduccMn

      1.    La presente Carta de Politicas expresa e l comprolniso del (iobiemo del Peril con 10s
      objjetivos del Programa lNC'AGR(.) Plantea 10s ajustes neccsarios a la Carta del atio IO00 y
      las lineas estratkgicas para el tbmento y desai-roilo de un sistema abierto y descentralizado de
      c iencia, tecnologia e innovacih agaria, pronioviendo 10s cambios institucionales necesarios
      y tin us0 mas eficiente y equitatibu de 10s rectirsos publicos.

      2.    El Estado Peruano tiene coni0 objetivo central de politica agraria el de elevar la
      rentabilidad y la competitividad del sector agrario, dinamizar el empleo y reducir la pobreza
      niral, en el marco del rol subsidiario del Estado, el us0 eficieiite de 10s recursos publicos y el
      manejo sostenible de 10s recursos naturales y el ambiente.

      3.    Para alcanzar este objetivo el Gobiemo se propone continuar con el proceso de
      modemizacion del sector, orientado a la construccibn de una plataforma de servicios
      (tecnologia, informacibn, sanidad y tittilacion de tieras) que permitira incrementar la
      competitividad de 10s productores agrarios, haciendo posible afrontar de manera eficiente 10s
      nuevos retos y oportunidades que se generaran como consecuencia de la globalizacion y de
      10s tratados de libre comercio.

      4.     El Estado Peruano reconoce que el foment0 y desarrollo de la ciencia, tecnologia e
      innovacion agraria es un factor fundamental para el aumento de la productividad y el
      desarrollo nacional en 10s diferentes sectores, tal como lo expresa la Ley Marco de Ciencia.
      Tecnologia e Innovacion Tecnologica No28303, promulgada el 23 de julio de 2004. Ademas,
      es consciente de la necesidad de mirar 10s procesos tecnologicos con una perspectiva de
      mediano y largo plazo, y con ello, de planificarlos con una vision estratkgica que incluya 10s
      cambios institucionales necesarios y el us0 mas eficiente de 10s recursos.

      5.     El P e d tiene en su agenda la consolidation de un proceso de descentralizaci6n
      formalmente iniciado en el 2003, que time como principales objetivos 10s de promover una
      distribucion mas equitativa de la riqueza economica y el bienestar social delpais, asi como la
      posibilidad de una mayor representatividadde las regiones en el Gobiemo Nacional. Esto, sin
      duda, afectara positivamente todos 10s procesos de promocion de mercados y de generacion
      de actividad economics en el pais, niarcando un nuevo desafio para la generacion,
      adaptacion, difusi6n y us0 de tecnologias.

      6.     Finalmente, el Estado Peruano reconoce su responsabilidad de elevar la calidad de vida
      y las oportunidades de 10s ciudadanos de 10s sectores mas vulnerables, como la poblacion
      rural. Esta responsabilidad esta asociada con la necesidad de promover sostenidamente la

I .',
    . capacidad de 10s productores agrarios para acceder a 10s servicios de innovacion y su
   '  articulacion al mercado. Por esta razon, las inversiones que apunten a reducir las brechas
      tecnologicas o atenuar 10s procesos de exclusi6n hacia determinados grupos de la poblacion
      serin tambikn considerados en el Programa INCAGROFase 11.




                                                                                                       1

           11.   El rol del Estado en la modernizacion institucional del sistema de ciencia.
                 tecnologia e innovacion en el sector agrario y comproinisos del Gobierno

           7.    El aumento de la competitividad an 10s iniercados globalizados demanda introducir
           cambios en 10s roles tradicionales que sc han venido asignando ai sector piiblico y privado 4
           en las estrategias para el desanullo teciiologico agrario En e l anibito de la investigacibii).
           desarrollo tecnologico sc observa: a) una crecientr diversification institucional en la CLI;II
           ademas de las entidades piibltcas nacionales e tntemacionalcs tradicionales, estan surgknclo
           nuevos actores como centros academicos, cmpresas, organizaciones no gubemamentales           >
           gremios del sector privado; b) una mayor pluralidad en cl tinanciamiento publico y privado; y
           c) una creciente articulaci6n con 10s procesos de innovacih que incluyen sistemas comn
           control de calidad, bienes de la biotecnologia, derechos de propiedad intelectual y patentes,
           entre otros

           8.    Este escenario exige a1 Estado definir su rol y politicas en materia de inversion de
           recursos publicos para la innovacion tecnologica, en un marc0 de politicas que involucren
           tanto al sector publico como a1 privado, de manera que se den condiciones para que se
           progrese en e l desarrollo de la innovacion tecnologica que el pais requiere. Este marco debe
           partir por reconocer la pluralidad de la estructura institucional para la innovacion, y la
           separacidn de 10s roles institucionales para atender las tres dimensiones del sistema:
           formulacion de politicas, financiamiento y ejecucion de actividades.

           9.    En tal sentido, el compromiso del Gobiemo es apoyar y acompafiar el proceso de
           cambio necesario para la modemizacion del sistema de ciencia, tecnologia e innovacion,
           creando la institucionalidad publica especializada en la formulacibn e implementacion de
           politicas y prioridades para la innovacion y en el financiamiento del sistema, y asignando
           fondos publicos que apoyen la pluralidad y descentralizacion de la ejecucion de las
           actividades de innovacion tecnologica.

           10. En el contexto de este compromiso y en e l marco de separacidn de roles y de la
           modemizacibn del sector, el Ministerio de Agricultura asegurarh:

                  a. Que el Programa INCAGRO, a travCs de sus mecanismos de financiamiento,
. ' . , '
       . .       contribuya: i)al desarrollo sostenible de un sistema agrario de ciencia, tecnologia e
                 innovacihtecnologica plural, descentralizado, orientado por la demanda y liderado por
                 el sector privado; ii)a orientar 10s cambios institucionales necesarios, madurando hacia
                 la especializacion de 10s roles amba mencionados;

                  b. Que el instituto de investigacion del sector sea una institucion especializada en la
                 ejecuci6n de la investigacion y transferencia tecnologica, aprovechando sus ventajas
                 comparativas asociadas a su presencia en las diferentes ecoregiones del pais, de tal
                 manera que concentre sus esfuerzos, capacidad tecnica y recursos financieros en la
                 ejecucidn de un numero suficiente y priorizado de programas y proyectos de valor
                 estratCgico, en 10s cuales el caricter de bien publico este reconocido.

           111. Los retos para la inserci6n competitiva de la agricultura peruana en la
                 globalizacibn

            It. El sector agrario peruano viene atravesando un proceso de transformacion para
           responder al entomo dinamico de la sociedad mundial. Este proceso deberia contribuir con



                                                                                                          L




                                                              122

               s

  12.       El Sector se cncuentra frente al reto de lopIoI icr competitivo dentro de sisteinas de
  producci6n y comercializaci6n. caracterimdos por 1`1        rliliirenciaci6n de productos, en 10s
  wales CI6xito esta fundamentado por el desaiTollo dc liis ventajas cumpetitivas que pemiitan
  satisfacer la demanda a nivel iiacional e intcmictonal por productos de calidad. Estas
  caracteristicas del inercado han incrementado las nccesidades tacnologicas, las que ya no solo
  se refieren al product0 si no mas bien a todo e l proceso de produccion incluidas ias buenas
  practicas agricolas, de post-cosecha, de procesamiento y manufxtura, las certificaciones, las
  denominaciones de origen, la clasificacion o estandarizacion, el empaque, la inocuidad de 10s
  alimentos, y 10s medios de almacenamiento transporte.
                                                  >

  13. Es de esta manera, que las tecnologias y procesos basados en el conocimiento,
  generados y difundidos por un sistema de ciencia, tecnologia e innovacion plural y
  descentralizado, cobran vital importancia, porque e s t h permitiendo, y continuaran haciendo,
  que la agricultura aborde este desafio de manera constructiva para aprovechar mejor 10s
  potenciales beneficios de 10s acuerdos multilaterales y bilaterales, no solo por su impact0
  direct0 en la reduccion de costos de produccion, aiimento de productividad y competitividad,
  sino tambien por el mayor acceso a nuevos mercados y creacion y adaptacion de nuevos
  productos, ampliando de esta manera las probabilidades de generation de riqueza para el
  pais.

  14. Sin embargo, la extrema fragmentacion de la propiedad y el escaso desarrollo o
  inexistencia de mercados claves (entre ellos, 10s de servicios a la produccion, a 10s
  agronegocios y a la innovacion tecnologica), han limitado el surgimiento de una agricultura
  competitiva. Esta situacion se manifiesta, entre otras formas, en el crecimiento lento de la
  productividad agropecuaria, en la baja capacidad de generacion de empleo, y en 10s
  problemas que caractenzanenla actualidad al medio rural, destacando la pobreza rural.

   15. Enel cas0 de 10s mercados de servicios destacan la limitada valoracion y capacidad de
  pago de 10s servicios de una gran parte de 10s pequefios productores por la baja rentabilidad
  de sus bienes finales; la poca expenencia de 10s proveedores privados para atender a
  pequefios productores, las dificultades de 10s proveedores para acceder a conocimientos e
  informacion tecnica que les pemiita mantener una oferta de calidad, y la limitada vocacion
  privada en la provisi6n de servicios predominando las practicas "asistencialistas" en dicha

i provision. Hasta el momento, el Estado ha tenido un dkbil papel en promover y regular estos
  mercados y en algunos casos ha contribuido a distorsionar la asignacion de 10s escasos
  recursos disponibles.

   16. En este escenario, el reto para el Estado es contribuir al desarrollo de estos mercados,
   mediante la promotion de servicios especializados y de calidad, subsidiando parte de 10s
  costos de transaccion que en la actualidad constituyen barreras al funcionamiento eficiente de
   10s servicios para la innovacion.




                                                                                                    3

           IV. [,os objetivos del Programa de largo plilzo y 10s comproinisos del Gobierno

           17.   El Programa de largo plazo es el marco de referencia y la visiiin a futuro del Estado
           peruano para mejorar la innovacion y competitividad del agro. El t'rograma se esti
           implemcntando en el Ministerio de Agricullura de manera gradual y con objetivos y metas
           para cada una de sus tres Fases: Fase I:de establecimiento de nn sistema desccntralizado de
           innovacihn en tres regiones; Fase 11, de espnnsi6n del sistcnia a nivel nacional; y Fase 111, de
          consolidaci6n de un sistema de ciencia, tecnologia e innovacion plural, dcscentralizado,
           orientado por la demanda y liderado por el sector privado.

           18.   Este Programa de largo plazo es parcialmente tinanciado con recursos de
           endcudamiento extern0 de un APL (".4daptable Program Loan" o Programa de Prestamo
           Ajustable) del Banco Mundial, con el compromiso del Gobiemo del P e d de cofinanciar de
           manera incremental cada una de las fases.

           19.   El objetivo del Programa de largo plazo es incrementar la productividad y rentabilidad,
           asi como mejorar la competitividad del sector agrario, mediante la generacidn y adopcibn de
           tecnologias sostenibles y ambientalmente seguras.

           20.   Para contribuir al loyo de este objetivo, e l Gobiemo del Peni se compromete a: a) dar
           sostenibilidad a las politicas de desarrollo cientifco y tecnologico y con asignaciones
           presupuestales adecuadas a las demandas de dichas politicas; b) fortalecer la institucionalidad
           y crear 10s arreglos institucionales necesarios, respetando la especializacion de roles e
           incentivando la coordinacion entre 10s actores, tanto publicos como privados; y c) invertir en
           la mejora continua en la formacion y calificacion de recursos humanos e infraestructura
           necesaria para la innovacibn.

           V.     Los logros del Programa de largo plazo hasta el momento

           21.   A principios del presente siglo, el Gobiemo del Ped enuncio 10s lineamientos de un
           Programa de largo plazo para fomentar la innovacion y la competitividad en la agricultura.
           Ese Programa que dio lugar a1 Proyecto de Investigacion y Extension Agricola (PIEA)
           conocido como INCAGRO (Innovaci6n y Competitividad para e l Agro peruano), fue
           concebido para desarrollarse en 3 fases, de 3,4 y 5 aiios respectivamente, anticipandose que
                              de activadores de cada fase, es una condicion necesaria para iniciar la


                      objetivos especificos de la Fase Iheron: a) Promover un mercado eficiente de
          .`6\erviciosbasicos que incrementen el conocimiento, mejoren las capacidades de las personas y
           * .
     .     flue contribuyan directamente a incrementar la innovacion tecnologica y la competitividad en
\    `.>,laagricultura; y b) apoyar a algunas instituciones para el desarrollo de su capacidad, a fin de
     . . ' que cumplan en forma mas efectiva una responsabilidad estrategica en la definicion y
           administraciondel marco normativo y que ofrezcan 10s servicios estrategicos pertinentes a la
           labor del Estado.

           23.    En relacion a1 primer objetivo especifico, el Programa ha completado 14 concursos
           pdblicos para la adjudicacidn de recursos del Fondo de Tecnologia Agraria (FTA) y del
           Fondo para el Desarrollo de Servicios EstratBgicos (FDSE), a traves de 10s cuales se ha
           adjudicado un total de 123 subproyectos [36 de servicios de extension, 27 de servicios de


                                                                                                          4




                                                             124

ciiciitan con el apoyo de mas de 200 instituciones colaboradoras.

24.    ,\lrededor de 9,000 productores agrarios estin participando directaiiicnte en 10s planes
de negocios de 10s subproyectos de servicios de extensi6n y de inoestigacion adaptativa, y
otros 1.500 en subproyectos de investigacibn estralegica, infomacibn y capacitacion. Se
estima que a l menos 30,000 agricultores estan sieiido alcanzados por 10s beneficios de la
actividad de 10s subproyectos cofinanciados y que e l Area bajo tecnologia mejorada alcanzaria
una superficie no menor a 25,000 hectareas.

25.    En relacion al segundo objetivo especifico, e l Programa apoyo la preparacion del plan
estrategico del INIA (ahora INIEA). La evaluation que se ha hecho considera que el plan
final publicado por el INIA requiere mayores esfuerzos de esta instihicion para la definicih
de su vision, mision y papel eskategico que debe tener en el marco de un sistema de
innovacibn tecnolbgico plural y descentralizado.

26.    En cuanto a 10s programas de investigacion estrategica, se ha conseguido logros
parciales, como es el cas0 del programa de recursos geneticos, asi como algunos avances en
10s programas de biotecnologia,proteccion animal y vegetal, y economia agricola. Respecto a
10s programas de apoyo a la extension (capacitacion c informacion) no ha habido progresos
en terminos de planes elaborados aunque s i se ha ganado experiencia e informaci6n y se han
identificado programas promisonos en 10s concursos convocados por el FDSE.

27.    De una manera general, durante la Fase Iel Programa gano experiencia y mejorb el
posicionamiento del Estado en la dimension del financiamiento del sistema, a traves de sus
fondos competitivos, alentando una dimension mas plural, descentralizada, diversificada,
especializada y cofinanciada tanto a nivel del financiamiento como a nivel de la ejecucion de
servicios para la innovacion y de acciones de investigacih y desarrollo tecnol6gico.

VI. L a propuesta para la Fase 11

28.    El objetivo de la Fase I1 (2005-2009) del Programa INCAGRO es contribuir a la
expansion, fortalecimiento y desanollo institucional del sistema de ciencia, tecnologia e
innovacibn agraria.

29. AI respecto, para la Fase I1del Programa el Estado peruano se compromete a proveer
10s recursos necesarios de contrapartida al financiamiento del prestamo del Banco Mundial
para la ejecucion de este Programa. Asimismo, se compromete a disponer 10s arreglos
institucionales pertinentes al interior de sus organismos publicos descentralizados y proyectos
especiales para que sintonicen sus estrategias de intervencion con la modalidad empleada por
el Programa y asi no generar distorsiones y confusion entre 10s demandantes de servicios
agrarios.

30.    Adicionalmente, una vez que la evaluacion extema de niedio termino haya considerado
que 10s activadores para la Fase 111han sido satisfactoriamente alcanzados, el Gobiemo del

 POLICY LETTERSUBMITTEDBY THE GOVERNMENTOF PERU(GOP)TO THE
                                               WORLDBANK

     REGARDINGPHASEI1OFTHE INCAGROPROGRAM:INNOVATIONAND
                        COMPETITIVENESSINAGRICULTUREINPERU


I. Introduction

1. This policy letter articulates the Government of Peru's commitment to the objectives of the
INCAGRO Program (Innovation and Competitiveness for Peruvian Agriculture). It addresses the
adjustments that need to be made to the 1999 Letter and the strategic guidelines for promoting and
developing an open and decentralized system for applying science, technology, and innovation in
agriculture, while fostering the institutional changes necessary, as well as the more efficient and equitable
use of public funds.

2.    The Peruvian Government's core agricultural policy objective i s to increase the profitability and
competitiveness of the agricultural sector, to promote employment and reduce poverty in rural areas, to
use public funds efficiently, and to manage natural resources and the environment in a sustainable
manner.

3.    To attain these objectives, the Government intends to forge ahead with the modernization of the
sector, focusing on building a services platform (technology, information, health, and land titling) to
support Peruvian farmers to be more competitive and thus be efficiently equipped to face the new
challenges and opportunities createdby globalization andfree trade agreements.

4.    Thus, as stated inFramework Law No. 28303 promulgated on July 23, 2004 on Science,
Technology, and Innovation, the Peruvian Government recognizes that the promotion and development of
science, technology, and technological innovation in agriculture are fundamental to increasing
productivity and enhancing national development in the various sectors. It i s also aware of the need to
take a medium and long-term approach to technological processes and hence plan them with a strategic
vision in mind. T h i s includes the institutional changes that are necessary as well as the more efficient use
of resources.

5.    Peru i s engaged in consolidating a process of decentralization, officially initiated in 2003, aimed
principally at promoting a more equitable distribution of economic wealth and social welfare, as well as a
more representative role of the regions in national government. These efforts will undoubtedly boost the
development of markets and new economic activity throughout the country, posing a new challenge for
the generation, tailoring, anddissemination of technology.

6.    Finally, the Peruvian Government acknowledges its responsibility for raisingthe standard of living
and opening up opportunities for citizens inthe most vulnerable sectors, such as the rural population. This
responsibility goes hand in hand with the need to foster, on a sustained basis, the ability of farmers to
have access to innovation services, and thus to markets. It i s for this reason that consideration should also
be given in the INCAGRO Phase I1program to investments designed to narrow technological gaps or to
mitigate processes that exclude specific population groups.


11. The Role of the Government in the Institutional Modernization of the System of Science,
      Technology, and Innovation inthe Agricultural Sector and Commitments of the Government


                                                       130

7.    The increased competitiveness of globalized markets calls for changes in the roles traditionally
assigned to the public and private sectors in technological development in agriculture. In agricultural
sector research, the following can be observed: a) an increasing diversity in terms of the institutions
involved, whereby in addition to traditional international and national public entities, new actors
are emerging such as academic institutions, businesses, non-governmental organizations and private
sector associations; b) a larger volume of public/private financing; c) increasing linkage with processes
of innovation that include such systems as quality control, biotechnological resources, intellectual
property rights, and patents, among others.

8.    This situation requires the Government to define its role and policies with respect to investment of
public funds in technological innovation, within a policy framework involving both the public and the
private sector in order to create the conditions for enhancing the rate of technological innovation in the
country. This framework must first recognize the many institutions involved in innovation and the
separation of institutional roles in order to address the three dimensions of the system: policy formulation,
financing, and the execution of activities.

9.    Inthat regard, the commitment of the Government is to support and monitor the process of change
necessary for modernization of the system of science, technology, and innovation, thereby creating the
public institutions that are specialized in the formulation and implementation of policies and priorities for
innovation as well as the financing of the system, while assigning public resources that support activities
inmany areas andthe decentralization of the execution of technologicalinnovationactivities.

10. Inthe context of this commitment, andwith a view to the separation of roles andthe modernization
of the sector, the Ministry of Agriculture will ensure that:

       a. The INCAGRO Program, through its financing mechanisms, contributes: i)to the sustainable
      development of a system of agricultural science technology, which i s plural, decentralized,
      demand-driven, and led by the private sector; ii)to the orientation of the necessary institutional
      changes, which will eventually lead to specialization of the roles mentioned above;

       b. The research institution established in the sector specializes in the performance of the research
      and the transfer of technology, thereby taking advantage of its comparative advantages derived
      from its presence in the different ecoregions of the country, in such a way that it concentrates its
      efforts, technical capacity, and financial resources on the execution of a sufficient number of
      prioritized programs and projects of strategic value, in which the nature of public funds i s
      recognized.


111. The Challenges Facing the Competitive Integration of Peruvian Agriculture into the Process
      of Globalization

11. The Peruvian agricultural sector is undergoingaprocessof transformationas it seeks to respondto
the dynamic global environment. This process should contribute to enhancing conditions that link small-
scale agriculture, which i s the predominant form of farming in Peru, to access to agroindustry and
national and internationalmarkets, inparticular inrelation to receipt by these farmers of a greater share of
the profit generated by agricultural activity, within a context of symmetrical and equitable relations
between the different actors inthe farming sector.




                                                       131

12, The sector's challenge is finding ways to compete in a marketing systemcharacterized by product
differentiation, where success is determined by the ability to develop competitive advantages that enable
national and internationaldemand for quality products to be met. These characteristics of the market have
increased the need for technology, no longer just in relation to the product itself, but also to the whole
production process, including sound agricultural practices, post-harvest handling and processing,
certification, labeling of origin, classification or standardization, packaging, food safety, and means of
storage andtransportation.

13. This is what makes technologies and processes based on know-how, and generated and
disseminated in a plural and decentralized science, technology and innovation system, so crucial, because
they will enable agriculture to react constructively to this challenge and take full advantage of the
potential benefits of multilateral and bilateral agreements, not just because of their direct impact in terms
of reducing production costs, enhancing productivity and competitiveness, but also because they afford
increased access to new markets and induce the creation and adaptation of new products, thereby
improving the chances of generating wealth for the country.

14. However, the highly fragmented ownership of the land and the absence of key markets (including
services for production, agribuisness markets, and technological innovation), have stymied the
development of a competitive agricultural sector. This i s evidenced by, among other things, sluggish
growth in agricultural and livestock productivity, scant capacity to generate employment, and the
problemstypical of rural areas today, above all, rural poverty.

15. In the case of the services market, the following is observed: a limited appreciation for and
capacity of many small farmers to pay for services due to low profit margins on their end-products, a lack
of experience of private providers in dealing with small farmers, difficulties of suppliers in gaining access
to the technical information and knowledge that permit them to maintain the quality of their supplies, and
the reluctance by private entities to provide services, a practice that leads to the perpetuation of
"subsidization" of provision of services. To date, the Government has played a largely ineffective role in
promoting and regulating such markets and in many cases has contributed to distortions in the allocation
of the scant resources available.

16. Against this backdrop, the challenge for the Government is to contribute to the development of
these markets through the promotion of specialized quality services, by subsidizing part of the transaction
costs which, at the moment, constitute a barrier to the efficient functioning of innovation services.


IV. The Objectives of the Long-TermProgramandthe Commitments of the Government

17. The long-term program serves as a frame of reference and provides the future vision in Peru in
order to improve the innovation and competitiveness of farming. The Program i s being gradually
implementedin the Ministry of Agriculture, with objectives and goals for each of the three phases: Phase
I,establishmentofadecentralizedsystemofinnovationinallthreeregions;Phase11,expansionofthe
system at the national level; Phase 111, consolidation of a plural system of science, technology, and
innovation, which i s decentralized, demand-driven, and ledby the private sector.

18. This Program is being partially financed with external resources borrowed from the APL
(Adaptable Loan Program) of the World Bank, with the commitment of the Peruvian Government to co-
finance eachphase incrementally.




                                                      132

19. The program's long-term objective i s to increase productivity and profitability, as well as enhance
the competitiveness of the agricultural sector by adopting sustainable and environmentally safe
technologies.

20. Inorder to contribute to the achievement of this objective, the Government of Peruundertakes to: a)
ensure the sustainability of the scientific and technological development of policies, using budgetary
allocations that match the needs of these policies; b) strengthen institutions and establish the necessary
institutional rules, while respecting specialization of roles and encouraging coordination among both
private and public actors; and c) invest in ongoing training and updating of the skills of human resources
and the infrastructure necessaryfor innovation.


V.    Achievements of the long-term program to date

21. At the turn of the century, the Government of Peru announced guidelines for a long-term program
fostering innovation and competitiveness inagriculture. That program, which gave rise to the Agricultural
Research and Extension Project (PEA) known as INCAGRO, was conceived as a three-phase program,
of 3, 4, and 5 years duration respectively, whereby the achievement of some trigger indicators in each
phase would be a precondition for the start of the nextphase.

22. The specific objectives of phase Iwere: a) to promote an efficient market for basic services that
expand knowledge and build human capacity and contribute directly to increasing technological
innovation and competitiveness in agriculture; and b) to support a number of institutions for capacity-
building, so that they can more effectively fulfill a strategic responsibility in the definition and
administration of a normative framework, which offer strategic services that correspond to the
Government.

23. With regard to the first specific objective, fourteen public bidding processes have been held to
award contracts, financed with FTA and FDSE funds, for 123 subprojects: 36 involving extension
services, 27 in adaptive research services, 28 in strategic research, 16 in extension support services
(training and information), and 16 in extension services for the pilot ("Huchuy Ayni" or small-scale
mutual assistance) in Huancavelica. The total amount awarded over the three years exceeds US$6.7
million, and involved a monetary and non-monetary co-financing commitment by strategic partners
(services operators and farmers' organizations) of nearly US$6.6 million. Over 100 operators are running
the subprojects, with the support and collaborationof more than 200 institutions.

24. Approximately 9,000 farmers are directly involved with the businessplans of the extension services
and adaptive research subprojects and another 1,500 are participating in strategic research, information,
and training. It i s estimated that at least another 30,000 farmers are benefiting from co-financed
subprojects and improved technology will be used in an area of at least 25,000 hectares.

25. Insofar as the second specific objective is concerned, the Program supported the preparation of the
strategic plan of the INIA (currently known as the INIEA). The evaluation indicates that the final plan
published by the INIA requires major efforts on the part of this institution to define the vision, mission,
and the strategic role that it must play in the context of a plural and decentralized technological
innovation system.

26. Some progress has been made with strategic research programs; for example with the genetic
resource programs and with biotechnology, animal and plant protection, and agricultural economics. In
the case of extension support programs (training and information), no progress has been made in terms of



                                                    133

the plans formulated, but experience and information have been acquired and promising programs
identified with the help of the FSDE.

27. Ingeneral terms, Phase Iof the Project has gained experience and has strengthened the position of
the Government in its financing of the system through its competitive funds, while encouraging a more
plural, decentralized, diversified, specialized, and co-financed dimension with respect to both financing
andthe provision of services for innovation, researchandtechnology development activities.


VI. The Proposalfor PhaseI1

28. The objective of Phase I1(2005-2009) of the INCAGRO Programis to contribute to the expansion,
strengthening, and institutional development of the agricultural science, technology, and technological
innovation system.

29. Thus, for Phase I1 of the Program, the Peruvian Government has undertaken to provide the
necessary counterpart funds to World Bank financing for the execution of this Program. It also undertakes
to make the appropriate institutional arrangements within its decentralized public entities and special
projects in order to synchronize its intervention strategies with the methods used by the Program in order
to avoid distortions and confusion among those requiring agricultural services inthe field.

30. Inaddition, once the mid-term evaluation indicates that Phase I1activities have been satisfactorily
achieved, the Government of Peru will make a commitment to issue a call for proposals from the entities
of the system, which will take place between 2008 and 2009, by providing 100% financing from its
budget funds which may be eligible for Phase I11 Loan financing. This will demonstrate both the
commitment of the Government to guarantee and replicate more widely the success achieved
with innovation and competitiveness inagriculture.

31. Building on the achievements mentioned above, and in line with the idea of expanding and
strengthening the plural, decentralized, demand-driven science, technology, and innovation system, ledby
the private sector, the objectives establishedfor Phase IIare to:

         a. Contribute to the decentralized development of the market for specialized services for
         agricultural innovation throughout the country by co-financing 188 sub-projects for extension
         services, 75 subprojects for adaptive research, and 330 training and technical assistance projects
         for the poor who require access to the services market. The funds to be earmarked for co-
         financing extension subprojects and adaptive research account for 86 percent of the total amount
         to be invested inthis objective, while the training and technical assistance subprojects account for
         14 percent. Through this subproject, it i s estimated that the needs of 46,000 organized farmers'
         who use the service will be met; As users of the services, farmers will provide US$5.72 million in
         co-financing, which, on average, represents30 percent of the total cost of subprojects.

         b. Increase support for at least six agricultural technology strategic programs, thereby
         contributing to the institutional reorientation towards centers for excellence in research and the
         co-financing of 48 projects for strategic research. Support will be provided for regional capacity
         building by co-financing 30 subprojects for training extension agents and 9 programs for
         providing incentives to researchers for sabbatical and post-graduate studies. It i s estimated that
         the co-financing of the executing entities of these 78 subprojects will amount to US$6.33 million.

        c. Foster strengthening of the system of science, technology, and agricultural innovation, and, in
        so doing, strengthen a system for monitoring and evaluation that identifies and recognizes
        best practices in the provision of services and innovative processes in the agricultural sector; and
        implement a system of scientific and technological information for the sector, as well as
        established priorities for that system.

        d. Contribute to the strengthening of the capacity to formulate policies to promote agricultural
        technologicalinnovation, within the framework of a modernizedMinistry of Agriculture.

32. Recognizingthe needto develop institutional capacities inorder to strengthen specialized entities in
every aspect of the agricultural science, technology, and innovation system, Phase I1seeks to integrate the
three technical projects of the Program, as an efficient management unit, with a flexible organizational
structure:



      Project 1. Strengthening the Innovation Services Market. The objective of this Project i s to
      move ahead with decentralized development of the market for specialized innovation services, by
      contributing to the strengthening and empowerment of farmers' organizations requiring services;
      fostering an entrepreneurial approach to the provision of quality services; and synchronizing the
      supply and demand for services so that the market can function efficiently. The Project will co-
      finance: a) usingcompetitive funds, extension services and adaptive research subprojects, based on
      business plans that reflect producer demands, including those meeting the demands of vulnerable
      groups, such as indigenous populations and women's organizations; b) local participatory groups,
      internships (prhcticas pre-profesionales), promotion and training workshops, and technical
      evaluation panels, all of which will be geared to enhancing farmers' organizational management
      skills and agribusiness capacities, as well as to boosting supplier capacities by fostering an
      entrepreneurial approach to the provision of services. INCAGRO will guarantee the participationof
      the technical representatives of the Regional Governments of the macroregions where activities
      related to this project are beingcarried out, particularly in connection with the use of competitive
      funds for aspects related to the publication, evaluation, and negotiation of subprojects. Inaddition,
      the use of the competitive funds will take decentralization factors into account, as well as their
      macroregional, regional, and local implications, with a view to strengthening the capacities of local
      players in the formulation and execution of technological innovation projects to enhance the
      competitiveness of regional agriculture.


      Project 2. Strategic Skills for Research and Development. The objective of this Project i s to
       strengthenresearchandtechnology development for agriculture inareas of the science, technology,
      and innovation system that are of national strategic importance, by helping to build institutional
       and professional skills. The Project should establish support mechanisms for: a) the strengthening
       of centers of excellence in emerging areas of science and technology and b) the establishment
       of regional programs offering training in high-skill innovation services, which are vital for
       increasing agricultural competitiveness. The Project will administer a competitive fund which will
      finance: a) sound national and international strategic partnerships for co-financing the development
       of researchcapacities and activities, initially inthree priority areas: conservation and use of genetic
      resources, biotechnology, and integrated protection of plants and livestock products, and then
       gradually accompanied by three new priority programs - natural resource management (including
       soil and land management, water management and irrigation, and agroforestry), post-harvest
       handling and processing, and conservation agriculture; b) capacity-building of public research
       institutions in order to co-finance research activities that are of strategic value, in which the nature



                                                      135

      of public funds is recognized and integrated into a strategic research program for small-scale
      agriculture; c) regional extension worker training programs to co-finance curricular programs
      focusing on skills and institutional development; and d) incentive programs for researchers at
      national and regional centers, which co-finance post-graduate and sabbatical professional training
      fellowships in special fields within strategic research priority areas that require a professional
      critical mass inline with institutional development.

      Project 3. Policies, Information, and Quality of Innovation Services. The objective of this
     .Project i s to buildcapacity in the public sector to formulate and implement innovation indquality-
      related policies for a plural, decentralized, and demand-driven modern system of science,
      technology, and agricultural innovation. The result should be the building of capacity within the
      Ministry of Agriculture in order to determine policies and coordinate investment with the private
      sector, with a focal point being identified within the Ministry of Agriculture. This objective will be
      the result o f a) the establishment of an institutional framework for the procedures, priorities, and
      policies for the promotion and protection of innovation which are widely accepted within the
      system; b) the ongoing improvement of the processes and results of the activities related to
      technological innovation and social control in the use of resources; c) the availability and use of
      scientific and technological innovation in the activities and decisions related to agricultural
      innovation. The Project will: a) finance studies and events related to prospective technology,
      specify innovation priorities and policies, and define new strategic research areas; b) monitor and
      evaluate the subprojects that are co-financed, within the framework of the National Public
      Investment System by preparing standardization indicators and developing mechanisms for
      the recognition of best practices related to innovation and competitiveness; c) finance the
      implementation of a scientific and technological information platform for the system.

      Organization. In order to guarantee plurality, decentralization, and the participation of the
      different players in the system at the national level, the Program will be directed by an Executive
      Board, which, for management purposes, will be composed of specialized committees. At the
      regional level, the Programwill have Macroregional ConsultativeCouncils (CCMs).

      The Executive Board will be chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and will be composed of 9
      members. These persons will have a genuine interest in promoting the objectives of the Program,
      will be prominent citizens whose prestige and experience are recognized, and will truly represent
      the scientific, business, social, and environmental spheres, and possess experience in formulating
      policies that foster technological innovation.

      The Program Management Unit (PMU), whose function i s to administer and finance the Program,
      inaccordancewith acceptedtechnical, economic and financial, social, and environmental processes
      and procedures, will be composed of an Executive Directorate and four units, three of which will
      be technical, and the other, administrative. It will have eight decentralized units, which, in turn,
      will be supported by the same number of Macroregional Consultative Councils (CCMs).


VII. The triggers for Phase I11of the Program

33. The triggersfor Phase I11will be basedon the findings of an external review. These triggers are: a)
establishment of a focal point for policies to support agricultural technological innovation within the
Ministry of Agriculture, responsible for regulation, establishment of priorities, the channeling of public
financing, and a suitable framework for the recognition of intellectual property rights; b) the positive
evaluation of the formulation and implementation of actions plans by the CCMs, with the participation of
the representativesof Regional Governments, development institutions, and farmers' organizations; c) the


                                                     136

positive evaluation of the competitive funds of Project Iin all regions, with the satisfactory performance
of at least 75 percent of the subprojects assigned; d) the positive evaluation of at least three of the
strategic programs financed by Project 2; e) verification that the strategic partnerships are co-financed
with monetary resources that amount to at least 30 percent and 10 percent of the cost of the subprojects
assignedby Project 1and Project 2, respectively.


VIII. PhaseI11of the Program

34. During Phase I11of the Program, the Government will consolidate a decentralized, plural, and co-
financed system of science, technology, and agricultural innovation, with public and private financing
assistance.

35. To attain this objective, the investment made by the Government in the system will have led to the
specialization of institutionalroles and to the strengthenedperformance of both the players in the services
markets as well as the research and technology centers for excellence. This will position the system to
implement an agenda that i s in keeping with the ongoing challenges of globalization and social needs,
thereby permitting the more efficient use of the resources that are invested by the Government in the
system, channelingthem towards highstakes public issues.

36. Because of the need to improve and maintain agricultural competitiveness in economies that are
becoming increasingly open, both public and private investment must be increased on a sustained basis
well beyond the end of the Program.

37. To that end, and as a result of the Program, the system will have plural and decentralized
institutions and an appropriate policy and regulatory framework, which will pave the way for efficient use
of the resources of both the public and private sectors. Inthat context, the commitment of the Government
will be to keep investment levels inline with its responsibilities.
