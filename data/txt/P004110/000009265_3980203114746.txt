KOREA
PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
Loan and Program Summary
Borrower:        The RepubLic of Korea
Amount:          $100 million equivalent (including capitalized front-end fee)
Terms.           15 years including thr'oe years of grace, with interest at the
standard variable rate.
Program
Description:  The basic objective of the science and technology education
sector program is to improve the quality of science and tech-
nology education in Korea, in contribution to the country's
skill, knowledge and technological requirements in the 1980s
and beyond. The sector program includes policy and institu-
tional changes and selective investments designed to:
(a) control the quality oe graduate- and college-level educa-
tion; (b) concentrate graduate education in a few key institu-
tions; (c) strengthen an institution for research funding and
promotion; (d) improve collaboration between academic institu-
tions and research institutes; (e) establish an institution
for advanced training and research and development in science
education; (f) adjust the college admissions procedures to
reward student achievement in school, including performance in
laboratory-based assignments; (g) introduce new secondary
science courses with a greater emphasis on practical work;
(h) strengthen monitoring and evaluation procedures;
(i) recruit and upgrade teaching staff; and (j) improve facil-
ities and equipment. The overall program, of which a part
would be financed under the proposed loan, would comprise
about five national programs, for accreditation assistance,
research grants, staff development, equipment for secondary
schools and regional science centers, and studies, and about
60 subprojects for equipment requirements of specific graduate
schools and colleges.
By 1990 the sector would supply about 7,000 students per year
at the graduate level in science or engineering, 18,000 per
year at the college level in science or science education, and
400,000 students per year from general high schools with an
improved science curriculum. The proposed loan entails some
risk with regard to complexity of policy and institutional
changes and the management burden. A system of program
monitoring, including annual Joint and mid-term reviews by the
Bank and the Borrower, would substantially mitigate this risk.

KOREA
1.  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      If Korea is able to sustain rapid economic growth, by the mid-1990s
it will emerge as an industrialized export-dependent economy with a rapidly
declining reliance on agriculture. Production systems will become more skill-
and knowledge-intensive and employ more advanced technologies. To achieve
this deepening of the nation's industrial structure, science and technology
will play an important role in exploiting the nation's growth potential. This
larger role for science and technology within the Korean economy requires
major investments In scientific and eechnological infrastructure and in man-
power development. Government projects that: the ratio of research and
development (R&D) spending to GNP will grow from about 0.7% in 1979 to 2.1% by
1991; the proportion of that investment undertaken by private industry will
increase from 34X in 1979 to 60% in 1991; personnel in R&D will grow from
16,000 in 1979 to about 110,000 in 1991; and the number of scientists, engin-
eers, technicians and craftsmen in high technology fields overall should
experience a corresponding increase from 640,000 (or 4.7%    the labor force)
in 1979 to 1,400,000 (or 7.6% of the labor force) itl 1991.'_
1.02      In recognition of the priority of manpower deve'.opment, the program
for higher technical education in Korea (Loan 1800-KO approved February 19, 1980
in the amount of $100 million) addressed the need for improvement in engineer-
ing and management education and technician training. The focus of attention
under the proposed loan is graduate training and research in science and
engineering fields and science education at the college and secondary
levels. For the sake of convenience, science education and related graduate
training and research in science and engineering are called science and
technology education. Science and technology education is defined as the
&ector in this report. Science and technology education, encompassing about
98 colleges and over 800 general high schools (GHSs), is largely under the
supervision of the Ministry of Education (MOE). The Ministry of Science and
Technology (MOST) is responsible for a major graduate school and research
institute, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),
other research institutes, and a research foundation, the Korea Science and
Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). A large private education sector, accounting
for about 75% and 45% of enrollment at the college and secondary levels
respectively, complements public education. It operates under close super-
vision by Government, including government regulation of fees, and efZectively
expands educational opportunity in both urban and rural areas without social
bias. Both public and private colleges and schools charge fees with the
direct cost to students of private education varying from 40% to 70% above
1/   The Fifth Five-Year Science and Technology Development Plan, 1982-86,
MOST, 1981.

that of public education. Over the last decade education has expanded rapidly
at all levels in Korea.  Full enrollment of the primary school age group was
achieved by 1975; over 80% of the corresponding secondary age group is
currently in school. The share in higher education has increased sharply to
about 25% in full-time studies in 1983.
1.03      In order to meet the expected demand for higher technical and scien-
tific manpower, expansion of training capacity in selected fields is required,
particularly at the graduate level. Given the current state of educational
development in Korea, an approach that emphasizes quantity alone would be an
inadequate response. New positions opening up within industry, in government
research institutes, and in higher education demand advanced knowledge and
skills. The quality of education that is required is much higher than the
current, average standard in Korea, particularly with respect co an
experiment-oriented approach. Rather than a major expansion of training
capacity, the overriding goal is qualitative improvement to be acco7plished
through policy and institutional change and selective investments.-
Science and Technology Education at the Graduate and College Levels
1.04      Science and technology education at the graduate and college levels
is strong in the relatively bigh standards al.ready achieved in a few univer-
sities and research institutes.  It is weak in:  (a) the failure to apply
standards of quality control and to concentrate resources, particularly for
graduate education, ln a few, select institutions; (b) the curtent low level
of research activity; (c) the overall shortage of qualified faculty; and
{d) the inadequate and poorly equipped facilities of many institutions.
1.05      Quality Control.  There is wide variation in quality within the
system of 98 colleges 3ind universities (21 public, 77 private) with science or
engineering programs._' With the exception of undergraduate programs in
engineering and in colleges of education, this diverse network of institutions
is not subject to rigorous, periodic evaluation and there are no clear guide-
lines as to what constitutes acceptable standards. This lack of quality
control among institutions leads to fragmentation of courses and failure to
identify critical areas for remedial action, and adversely affects the quality
and relevance of training. Since necessary conditions for graduate education
can be satisfied in only a few institutions, Korea confronts a difficult
challenge of strengthening selectively the system of graduate education. A
long-term blueprint is required for the development of graduate education in
2/   Korea: Sector Survey of Science Education, IBRD Report No. 3775-10,
January 12, 1982.
3/   Within these institutions are 313 science departments that offer the
bachelor's degrees, within which 120 departments offer the master's
degree and 85 offer the doctorate. There are 25 departments of science
education at the bachelor's level. To these are added 346 departments of
engineering, within which 179 offer the master's degree and 120 offer the
doctorate.

the sciences and engineering that is at once more concentrated and specialized
and that meets objective standards of quality. In science education, Govern-
ment has not addressed the need for advanced training in Korea for faculty of
the scien.ce education departments of the colleges of education.
1.06      Research.  Faculty  iesearch is an essencial component of excellence
in graduate- and college-level programs. However, research grants from all
sources have averaged only $4,000 each. Limited research funds ot MOE have
been allocated on an Lnstitutional basis and for research projects of short
duration.  An institution for promotion of academic research in scien_e and
technology exists in KOSEF established in 1977 under the MOST. It tunds
research and scholarly publications and provides assistance for advanced
training in high priority fields. Effective use of additional research funds
depends upon improvement in KOSEF's management capacity.
1.07      With the exception of the KAIST, with both graduate training and
research programs, the network of approximatel', 120 government-sponsored
research institutes is isolated from the syst .m of higher education.  These
institutions could provide services of teaching and research supervision for
graduate students. With respect to science education research, the leading
colleges of education and education research institutes, like the Korea
Education Development Institute (KEDI) and the National Institute for
Eauca'!Thaal Research and Training (NIERT), have not recruited sufficient
numbers of appropriately trained faculty or personnel.
1.08      Supply and Qualifications of Faculty.  The shortage of qualified
faculty adversely affects the quality of instruction. For colleges of natural
science and of education the student:faculty ratio has steadily increased from
19:1 in 1970 to 28:1 in 1983. In colleges of engineering, with assistance
under Loan 1800-KO, the student:faculty ratio has fallen from as high as 45:1
in 1980 to 38:1 in 1983 but remains short of the target of 21:1 set for
1986. The typical teaching load has also risen. In 1970 46% of faculty
members in science and engineering taught more than 10 hours per week; by 1983
over 60% taught in excess of 10 hours. In 1983 more than 68% of faculty were
on part-time appointments. Only 50% of faculty in colleges of natural
sciences possess the doctorate; of these, approximately one-half have obtained
their advanced degree in traditional Korean graduate programs and stand in
need of postdoctoral research training. In the science education programs of
the colleges of education, less than 35% hold a doctorate; only 3% hold a
doctorate in science education. Among engineer:ag faculty members only about
35% hold a doctorate.
1.09      Facilities and Equipment.  Expenditures on facilities and equipment
have increased, but have not kept pace with increases in enrollment. MOE
estimates that at the college level, laboratory facilities are only 70% of the
official standard. Available equipment in science programs is only 40% of the
official stardard. If the gap in equipment requirements for graduate educa-
tion in both sciences and engineering is included, the figure is closer to 25%



-.4-
of current need. -a  Within graduate-oriented unlversLties, the need is also to
assure the availability of research equipment carefully selected to match
faculty competencies and requirements. WithLn the colleges of education,
additiL.al investment in teaching equipment is a prerequisite for the
reorientation of instruction toward development of skills in problem solving.
In all cases the shortage of facilities and adequate equipment and materials
reinforces the reliance by instructors on the lecture approach and reduces the
possibilities for experimental work hy students.
ScLence Education at the Secondary Level
1.10      Secondary science education in Korea is comparatively strong in high
student achievement on tasts of scientific knowledge. It is weik in: (a) the
failure to provide students opportunity to supplement this knowledge with
experience in experimental procedures; (b) the absence of a system for science
curriculum development based on continuous assessment and policy studies;
(c) college admissions procedures that do not take sufficient account of
students' achievement in school including experimental work; (d) the lack of
adequate programs for staff development; and (e) the shortage of laboratory
facilities and equipment in GHSs and regional science centers (RSCs).
1.11      Practical Science Activities.  There ls a question of balance in
Korean secondary science education. Korean students perform very well on
tests of scientific knowledge. In contrast they possess little opportunity to
complement this knowledge with practical science skills. Results of a recent
international study of achievement in science subjects suggest that, as
measured against a group of developed and developing countries, Korean stu-
dents performed above average and at or just below the high est standard
attained in the restricted domain of scientific knowledge.- ALt the same time,
an analysis of skill development in laboratory settings places Korean children
near the bottom of the list of comparator countries in terms of access to and
proportion of time spent in laboratory exercises.
1.12      Curriculum Development and policy Studies.  Materials for high
school science are produced by private publishers using authors approved by
MOE and materials based on MOE guidelines. This policy is successful in that
standard texts are available at reasonable cost to students throughout the
country. A shortcoming is that these texts are not subjected to evaluation
and revision; they are not generally supported by reference guides and
manuals; and there is insufficient ongoing research, development and evalua-
tion on which new curricula and materials can be based. An institutional base
foi coordinatien of the disparate functions of science curriculum design,
4/   The standard equipment lists were revised and updated by MOE in 1983.
The new standard corresponds to about $2,UOO per undergraduate student,
and $4,000 per graduate student.
5/   Korea:  Sector Survey of Science Education, IBRD Report No. 3775-KO,
January 12, 1982.



materials preparation, teacher retraining, and program evaluation and feedback
is also lacking.
1.13      College Admissions.  The centrally-managed college admissions exam-
ination has been a powerful influence within secondary science education,
since teachers and students give priority attention to preparation for that
examination.  Korea has only recently begun to adopt a more flexible syste!m of
college admissions. In 1982 a studen,'s high school record accounted in some
regions and institutions for 30% of the score on which admission is based. As
recently as 1979, no weigiht st all was give'a to the 4igh school record.
1.14      Training _  Sw..;e Teachers.  The present system of staff devel-
opment for science teachers is characteri;:ed by an emphasis on content and
theory rather than methodology and practical skills relevant to schon. situa-
tions.  Although the approximately 3,600 secondary science teacher..  possess
university degrees, they are not well-a.zquainted with laboratory procedures
and demonstration techniques. Nor are they trained in techniques of student
performance assessment, including. evaluation of students' experimental work.
1.15      Science Education Facilities and Equipment.  The level of laboratory
facilities is about 75% of requirenents in GiSs and RSCs. Measured against
the standard of proposed new coursee with more laboratory based units, avail-
ability of equipment is abouL 55% with an average of eight children per equip-
ment set at one time. Under these circum%tances, a sizeable proportion,
possibly as high as 80% of students, would heve no significant time in per-
fo.uiing science experiments or in learning to set up and use laboratory appa-
ratus.
Manpower XIonitoring
1.16      Since 1980, Government has introdiced changes that are g7nding to
make the supply of high-level manpower more responsive to dema .,- Manpower
planning has improved through a manpower analysis system under the coordina-
tion of the Inter-agency Committee for Manpower Development and Promotion
chaired by the Economic Planning Board (EPB). Entrance quotas have been made
more 'lexible and are now set at the college level, with allocation to depart-
ments determined within each college. There is need, however, for further
improvement.  The information base on relative supply and demand of science
and technology manpower is not fully exploited and made available to decision
makers. Academic institutions and students generally possess less information
about career choices than could readily be made available.
Education Investment and Financing Gap
1.17      As part of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (FFYP) 1982-86, Government
prepared a set of overall targets and a financing plan for qualitative
improvement in all levels of education. The budget of MOE during the FFYP is
estimated to average about 21% of the central government budget, or 4% more
6/   See SAR para. 4.05, Loan 1800-KO.



than the average of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The actual level for 1982 was
20.6%; for 1983 it was 20.9%; the estimate for 1984 is 21.8%.  This share
corresponds with an increase in spending by HOE from an average of 3.2% f GNP
in 1980 and 1981 to a projected average of 3.8't of GNP during the FFYP.7   In
order to pay for the increased cost of education, a special education tax was
introduced in 1982. The overaLl targets for educational development to 1986
are very ambitious by comparison with historic levels and depend heavily on
the special education tax.
l.18      Even if public spending on education meets planned goals, a
financing gap of about 15% exists for private institutions that account for
about 40% of total spending on education and training in Korea. Private
colleges already demonstrate lower unit costs than public institutions, yet
they fulfill an important public service in satisfying the demand for
education beyond that met by public institutions. Fees for private
institutions account for as much as 90% of their recurrent expenditure.
Although the fees that private Institutions are allowed to charge are
considered adequate, Government should review them annually and revise them if
necessary. Government should also consider introduction of student loans,
greater use of tax exemptions on private donations and increased public sub-
sidy, by means of, for example, grants for staff development and loans for
laboratory equipment.
Government Strategy and Bank Role
1.19      In the late 1960s and 1970s, Korea emphasized investmeat in indus-
trial education with the prospect of relatively quick return as skilled labor
was drawn into an expanding industrial system. In a planned transition to
more skill-intensive, high technology production, Korean educational planners
have adopted a longer term strategy designed to: (a) produce an appropriate
number of qualified manpower in the sciences, engineering and management via a
development program for higher education; and (b) strengthen the foundations
of science and technolovy within society through improvement of science educa-
tion at the secondary level.
1.20      Bank group lending gs closely paralleled the increasing sophisti-
cation of the Korean economy._  The Bank's initial involvement in the sector
under four loans/credits emphasized vocational and technical education at the
secondary and post-secondary levels. The completion of the fourth education
project in June 1983 marked the end o. this phase.  The Bank's current lending
71   The average share of slending by ministries of education as a proportion
of GNP for the East As a Region is about 3.2%.
81   Government has also receivea financial assistance for educational
development from the United States Agency for International Development,
United States Export-Im2ort Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japanese
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, though the amount is insufficient
particularly for the development of the science and technology education
sector.



-7-
strategy in education, as increasingly in other sectors in Korge9, calls for
sector loans addressing broad policy and institutional issues,- ' The fifth
loan (Loan 1800-KO), under the program for higher technical educationi, was
approved in 1980 with the primary objective of raising the quality of higher
technical education to the standards needed for industrial development in the
1980s. This objective is being substantially realized. Government has
strengthened manpower planning; it has made more flexible the procedures for
student entry to academic programs within colleges of engineering;
accreditation agencies have been established for three academic areas; and it
has prepared a study of the financial status of private colleges of
engineering and subsequently provided more than $100 million in additional
public funds to these institutions. Given the rapid increase in student
enrollments in 1980 and 1981, however, the student:faculty ratio in colleges
of engineering has declined more slowly than originally projected. Since
1982, Government has reduced new enrollments and continued to recruit
additional faculty with the result that the student:faculty ratio has declined
from 50:1 in 1979 to 38:1 in 1983.  However, the target date of December 1986
for reducing this ra-ti to 20:1, as agreed under Loan 1800-KO, is no longer
realistic. During negotiations of the proposed loan Government and the Bank
agreed on a multi-faceted approach to program monitoring, with annual reviews
and the setting of interim targets, including indicative annual enrollment
levels (paras. 2.18 and 3.14). Agreement was also reached on changing the
target date for achieving the 20:1 ratio to June 30, 1990 to correspond with
targets under the proposed loan. Physical implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily and on schedule with 92% of loan funds committed to approved
subprojects and national programs. Ongoing Bank dialogue with Goverament has
focussed on further policy and institutional changes that together with
selected investments would promote Government's strategy for the development'
of science and technology education.
1.21      OED audit reports have been prepared for the first three education
projects and concluded that projects were in general well-conceived and suc-
cessfully implemented. Other points of interest are the need for:
(a) advanced project preparation before approval; (b) greater focus on policy
analysis and evaluation; and (c) improved local management procedures to
expedite procurement. These lessons were incorporated in the design of Loan
1800-KO and have also been incorporated in the proposed program for science
and technology education.
9/   The Technology Development Project, approved in March 1982, a second one
planned for FY85, and the Small and Medium Machinery Industry Project,
approved in December 1982, directly embrace and promote the technological
development of Korean industry.



2*  PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
Program Obiectives
2.01      The principal objective of the program would be to bring the quality
of science and technology education up to standards required for an industrial
system that will be, at once, more skill- and knowledge-intensive and employ
more advanced technoLogies, This objective of qualitative improvement trans-
lates into a strategy to: expand selectively graduate education in science
and engineering and strengthen the research content of advarcsd training;
raise average stanadards of college programs in science and science education;
and increase the study of science subjects and introduce a more experiment-
oriented science curriculum at the secondary level. As described in the
Action Program on Sector Polic:es and Institutional Development (Annex 1), to
implement this strategy the Government would: (a) introduce new and revised
policies guiding the development of education programs in science and techno-
logy; (b) effect institutional changes to strengthen sector management; and
(c) improve the financial position of sector institutions by reducing the
investment gap. The Bank has received a Policy Letter for science and tech-
nology education, submitted by the Minister of Education with the concurrence
of MOST, outlining the Government's obje tives and proposed Action Program
with respect to policy and institutional changes. The Action Program includes
a schedule for implementing the measures proposed. The Action Program agenda
from 1984 to 1990 is as follows:
At the Graduate Training and Research, and College Levels:
(a) control quality of graduate programs in science and engineering and
college programs in science by establishing accreditation committees
under the Korea Council for University Education (KCUE);
5b) concentrate resources for graduate education in science and
engineering in a few graduate-oriented universities and research
institutes and prepare a long-term development plan for graduate
training in science and engineering;
(c) expand the programs and strengthen the management of KOSEF, the key
institution for promotion and funding of science and technology
research;
(d) improve collaboration in graduate education and research in science
and engineering among graduate schools and research institutes;
(e) establish within the network of colleges of education and education
research institutes a specialized center, Korean National University
of Teacher Education, for graduate training and research in science
education;
(f) increase the supply and improve the qualifications of faculty
members in science,'science education and engineering; and



-9-
(g) improve laboratory facilities and provide equipment essential for
teaching and research in graduate schools, research lnstitutes and
colleges that qualify under the program.
At the Secondary Level:
(a) design and introduce new science curricula at the high school level
with greater emphhsis on experimental work;
(b)  establish within HOE the ~cience Education Development Committee
(SEDC) to oversee and coordinate the separate activities of
curriculum design, materials preparation and evaluation, teacher
retraining, and overall program evaluation and feedback;
(c) introduce systematic monitoring and evaluation of secondary science
education;
(d) adjust college admissions procedures to enable colleges to select
students by taking into account students' achievement on both the
entrance examination and the school record, including practical
work;
(e) recruit additional science teachers and laboratory assistants and
design and implement staff development programs for science teach-
ers, education specialists and admiaistrators in GHSs, RSCs, and the
central agencies of MOE; and
(f)  improve laboratory facilities and provide GCSs and RSCs essential
items of equipment for science teaching based on the requirements of
the new curricula.
Sector Planning and Finance
(a)  continue to strengthen the system of manpower monitoring by syste-
matic reporting on findings of technical manpower studies and diffu-
sion of these findings within the system of universities and
colleges and by improving college services of student career coun-
selling;
(b)  monitor closely student enrollment and annual projections of future
enrollment in terms of key indicators of qualitative improvement;
and
(c) strengthen the financial base of private educational institutions by
channelling sector loan funds to private institutions for staff
development and equipment, providing additf8yal public subsidies,
and adjusting student fees when necessary.-
10/ Policies with respect to sector finance are discussed in Chapter 4.



- 10 -
These policy and institutional changes are discussed below. For brevity of
presentation, graduate tra'ning and research, and college-level science edu-
cation are discussed togetner since many policy and institutional issues.apply
to both. A section on proposed changes in secondary science education folLows
and the chapter concludes with a section on sector planniag. The program
would include expenditures on cuxrriculum development, policy studies, research
grants, development of new institutions, teacher recruitment and training,
equipment and materials, and bLildings.
Graduate Training and Research, and College Levels (Proposed outlay: graduate
training and research, approximately $193 mlllion; and college level, approx-
imately $159 million, both net of contingencies).
2.02      Quality Control.  Under the proposed program, the Government would
expand the system for assessing the mality of education and establishing
appropriate standards (para. 1.05) .- Two further elements of this system
would bL developed, namely accreditation committees for colleges12f natural
science and for graduate departments in science and engineering.- Their
scope of responsibility would cover private as well as public institutions
under MOE. Under the Action Program, accreditation committees would be organ-
ized by June 30, 1985 under KCUE, an indepeadent association of the 98 col-
leges and universities in Korea, founded in 1982 with financial assistance of
Government. Accreditation committees would on occasion include representa-
tives of private industry.  Terms of reference for the accreditation commit-
tees have been reviewed by the Bank and are satisfactory. Program quality
would be assessed at KAIST by means of external review by a visiting
committee. Program costs associated with accreditation include financing of
foreign specialists.
2.03      Concentration of Graduate Education.  A major objective of the
program is to concentrate resources for graduate education in a few graduate-
oriented universities (para. 1.05). This would be achieved as follows: (a)
under the guidelines for allocation of loan proceeds (para. 3.11), no more
than 15 subprojects for science or engineering graduate programs would be
financed with the result that 10, and quite possibly fewer, individual gradu-
ate-oriented universities would receive program funds; (b) the allocation of
KOSEF research grants under competitive procedures would result in increased
resources for the relatively stronger graduate-oriented institutions that are
able to formulate high quality research proposals (para. 2.04); and (c) Gov-
ernment would undertake in 1984-85 a study of the future development of gradu-
ate education in science and technology.  Terms of reference for this study
Lj/ Under Loan 1800-KO, three elements of this system were established:
(a) the Korean Engineering Education Board; (b) the Korean Management
Education Board; and (c) the Technician Education Research Institute.
12/  Independent accreditation for colleges of education is not required as
the quality standards for these teacher training institutions are
controlled directly by the Teacher and International Education Bureau
(TIEB) of MOE.

have been reviewed by the Bank and are acceptable. Program costs would
include facilities and equipment for graduate-oriented institutions, including
KAIST (para. 1.07 and Annex 2), assistance for faculty recruitment and
development (para. 2.07), short-term specialists to advise on graduate
programs, and tr.e study on graduate education in science and technology.
2.04      Research Promotion and _unding.  Under the program, the Government
would expand the operations of KOSEF and strengthen its capacity to manage a
larger research program directed at 15 priority fields identified by KOSET
planners as critical for long-term economic and industrial development
(para. 1.06 and Annex 3). KOSEF budget would grow from about $6.0 million in
1983 to about $24.0 million in 1988 in 1983 prices and finance about
1,600 research grants over that period. Loan assistance would represent a
decreasing share of the totaL KOSSF program or from about 25% in 1984 to 10%
in 1988. In order to strengthen the management of the foundation, the program
would also provide fellowships for staff training and specialist services for
external review of KOSEF research activities.
2.05      Collaboration between Graduate Schools and Research Institutes.
Greater efficiency in the use of available resources for training and research
would result from enhanced cooperation between academic institutions and
research institutes (para. 1.07). Under the Actioa Program Government would
promote cooperation as follows: graduate and post-doctoral study and research
at KAIST would be financed from existing scholarship funds for master's and
doctoral graduates from Korean universities and for university faculty; the
approximately ten major research institutes would each designate by June 30,
1985 a training coordinator for supervision of research training of graduate
students assigned by the universities; members of research institutes would
serve as adjunct professors in university-based graduate progrAms to enrich
courses and improve research perfornmance; and KOS5F would encourage
researchers based in universities and research institutes to. prepare joint
research proposals.
2.06      Graduate Education and Research in Science Education.  In order to
strengthen graduate training and research in science education (para. 1.07),
Government would establish a new college of education, Korean National Univer-
sity of Teacher Education, as a center of excellence for training high-level
manpower for teacher education and for research in science education. Subpro-
W      ject application and appraisal reports for Korean National UniveTSity of
Teacher Education have been reviewed by the Bank and are of an acceptable
standard of quality. Program costs would include facilities and equipment for
Korean National University of Teacher Education and assistance for faculty
recruitment and development (para. 2.07).
2.07      Faculty Recruitment and DeveLopment.  A main requirement for improv-
ing the quality of higher leveL science and technology education is to elimi-
nate shortages and increase the supply of well-qualified staff (para. 1.08).
Under the program, the supply of teaching staff would grow from about 6,000 to
14,000 faculty members. Bank staff estimates for staff requirements to 1990
are shown in Table 2.1. The expansion of teaching staff would be achieved
by:  (a) increasing output from local graduate programs in the sciences and
engineering; (b) recruiting Korean graduate students on completion of their



- 12 -
training abroad; (c) providing speciaL incentives, including travel and
housing benefits and an initial research fund, for repatriation of Korean
scientists and engineers working abroad who would assume teaching assignments
in graduate schools; and (d) inviting adjunct professors from research
institutes or industry to offer special coureis, to direct graduate research,
and to assist in curriculum pLanning. Repatriation of Korean scientists and
engineers abroad is part of a quite succassful ongoing initiative of
Government and would be contimued after the program with government financing.
Table 2.2 indicates the estimated number of additional faculty members from
each source. Annex 4 shows the planned expansion of domestic graduate
programs and the estimated supply of new faculty from that source.  At the
projected level of faculty recruLtment, by 1990 the average teaching load for
full-time facul,y would be about 10 hours per week and the proportion of
faculty on full-time appointments would average 50%. The prospects for
expanding domestic graduate programs depend on the recruitment of additional
professors and students to enter graduate school and eventually teaching. To
improve incentives, Government has chosen to increase average salaries for
teachers in public institutions in the period 1984-86 at a rate approximately
2 percentage points above generaL civil service salary increases. The share
of scholarship funds devoted to graduate education in pubLic and private
institutions would increase from 7.5% of all funds for scholarships for higher
education to 15% by 1986 (or from about 25% to 50% of graduate students).
IAIST students are already provided fellowships to cover full cost of tuition
and maintenance. The qualifications of existing faculty members would also be
improved under the program (para. 1.08). By June 30, 1990, a larger propor-
ticn of staff would hold advanced degrees, as shown in Table 2.3. Upgrading
of current faculty would be accomplished by strengthening and expaading local
graduate programs; providing overseas fellowships for training and research
opportunities abroad; and organizing workshops and seminars to familiarize
faculty with recent developments in their fields or new approaches to
teaching. Program costs associated with faculty recruitment and development
include repatriation assistance for about 120 professors and approximately
15,000 man-months of overseas training for about 1,260 current faculty
members. Government has agreed that fellowships would be awarded in accor-
dance with selection criteria and procedures acceptable to the Bank.

2.08      Facilities and Equipment.  The program aims at increasing laboratory
facilities to 85% and equipmenl provisions to about 70% of the official stand-
ard in science, science education, and graduate engineering (para. 1.09).
Full attainment of the standard would require unrealistically hig 3lnvestments
in the near term and would need to be deferred to a later period.-3J The
proposed investment in facilities and equipment for colleges of natural
science and colleges of education under the program would enable colleges to
increase laboratory work in science and science education from about 10% to
about 30% of class time.
Secondary Level Science Education (Proposed outlay, approximately $191 mil-
lion, net of contingencies)
2.09      Science Cur,,.culum.  In order to improve the effectiveness of
science education within GHSs (para. 1.11), the Government would offer high
school science courses on two levels, ordinary and advanced, with requirements
in each of biology, chemistry, earth science and physics for alL students.
About 140 experimental units would be introduced in the courses with the
result that approximately 20% of instructional time would be devoted to
experimental work. This plan would be implemented progressively from 1984 and
reach full scale within the approximately 800 GHSs by 1988. It would use as
supporting infrastructure 13 RSCs in the nine provinces and four principal
cities that would provide:  supplemaatary and enrichment practical classes for
students; student guide sheets and teachers' guides for experiments; equipment
testing, supply and repair; and in-service training for science teachers.
Eleven RSCs are in operation; two more will be opened, one each in 1984 and
1985.
2.10      Science Education Development Committee.  Government would establish
by mid-1984 the SEDC to oversee planning and implementation of the secondary
science program, particularly curriculum and materials development, staff de-
velopment and procedures for program monitoring and evaluation (para. 1.12).
The SEDC would include a director and a staff of about 1C senior science edu-
cators, at least 2 each in biology, chemistry, earth science and physics. The
director would be assisted by an advisory panel, composed of scientists,
science educators, administrators and distinguished representatives of the
private sector, and would report directly to the Director General of the
General Education Bureau (GEB) of MOE.  Terms of reference for the SEDC work
program have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. SEDC would
coordinate the development of curriculum for the new science courses via
contracts with the colleges of education and KEDI (para. 1.12). Based on
annal performance evaluation and assessment of curricula and materials by
teachers and staff of the RSCs, SEDC would recommend adjustment and
improvement in texts and materials for final introduction in 1988. Program
costs would include equipment and materials for preparation of new science
curricula, overseas fellowships and specialist services.
13/  It would require additional new investmcnts of approximately $120 million
for present enrollment and $105 million for increased enrollment at
college level between 1984 and 1989.



- 16 -
2.11      Program Evaluation.  To support regular review and updating of
policies for secondary science education (para. 1.12), performance monitoring
and evaluation would be introduced under the Action Program by June 30,
1985. The mcnitoring system would be coordinated by SEDC and the work carried
out under coAtract by specialist; in the colleges of education, KEDI, NIERT or
by prlvate consultants, An in-depth evaluation of secondary science achieve-
ment would also be conducted by NIERT as the Korean component to the Second
International Science AchLevement Study, organized under the auspices of the
International Association for Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Another
proposed study is the preparation of a plan for improving, by means of in-
service tralning, the skills of secondary level science teachers in assessing
stutent achievement, particularly in their experimental work (para. 1.14).
Under the Action Program, the plan for developing teachers' assessment skills
would be implemented from June 30, 1985 via in-service training programs of
the colleges of educat,-on and RSCs.  Terms of reference for the plan for
program monitoring and the plan for improving teachers' assessment skills have
been reviewed by the Bank and are satisfactory.
2.12      College Admissions Procedures.  A study on the college admiss!ons
procedures would examine measures to improve the college entrance examination
system as a tool for both student selection and reinforcement of science
curriculum goals (para. 1.13). It would lead to further adjustment in the
admissions procedures that would reward student achievement in new secondary
science courses by providing colleges a standard record of school-based
achievement, including performance on experimental assignments. Terms of
reference for this study have been reviewed by the Bank and are acceptable.
The study would commence September 1984. The findings of the study would be
implemented in the admissions cycle for the 1987 academic year.
2.13      Recruitment and Staff Development.  Introduction and management of
the new science courses in GHSs require recruitment of additional science
teachers and laboratory assistants (para. 1.11). MOE has a plan for increas-
ing recruitment from about 350 science teachers per year to approximately
700 teachers per year between 1984 and 1988 from among the 5,000 graduates
annually of the colleges of education and colleges of natural science quali-
fied for secondary school science teaching. HOE also plans to recruit an
additional 1,300 laboratory assistants by June 30, 1990 from among the ample
supply of graduates of the junior technical or teacher training colleges in
order to raise the average of laboratory assistants from less than one to two
per GHS.
2.14      In-service training for science teachers and administrators in the
GHIs, and for education specialists in the RSCs and central agencies of H0E
(p&ra. 1.14), would be provided through courses conducted by colleges of edu-
cation and workshops managed by the 13 RSCs. About 240 staff would also par-
ticipate in overseas training in curriculum development, evaluation tech-
niques, and equipment maintenance and operation. Some 430 man-months of
fellowships for specialized courses of three months duration and 480 man-
months of training of six months duration would be arranged as a combination
of course work and internships. Government has agreed that overseas
fellowships would be awarded in accordance with selection criteria and
procedures acceptable to the Bank.



- 17 -
2.15      Facilities and Equipment.  The deficit in laboratory facilities
would be reduced to 15% by 1990 with finance provided from the special educa-
tion tax or from private sources (paras. 1.15 and 1.18). For those schools
that are not scheduled for expansion of laboratory facilities in this period,
partial implementation of new courses would still be possible by means of more
intensive use of existing facilities, including use outside regular school
hours and temporary use of facilities of adjacent schools or the centralized
laboratories ot the 13 RSCs.
2.16      The overall deficit in required science equipment would be narrowed
to about 15% by provision of equipment to each of the 800 GHSs. Each of the
RSCs would receive from the program four complete sets of equipment to cover
the experimental units in the new high school science courses; equipment for
enrichment and teacher training; audio-visual aids; and equipment for a
central maintenance and repair workshop and two vehicles.
Sector Planning
2.17      In order to make the science and technology education sector more
responsive to economic factors, Government would report more systematically on
manpower to colleges and universities, seek to improve student guidance ser-
vices and monitor closely enrollment in relation to program objectives of
qualitative improvement (para. 1.16). Under the Inter-agency Committee for
Manpower Development and Promotion, both MOST and MOE would make available
manpower information that could guide in the preparation of institutional
development plans. The Higher Education Bureau (HEB) of MOE would encourage
and assist colleges and universities to establish or strengthen student career
guidance and placement services, including liaison with industry, and would
organize workshops for officers in charge of such offices.
2.18      Annex 5 summarizes surveys and labor market indicators of relative
supply and demand of science and technology manpower. In broad terms, the
planned investment in training scientists and engineers throughout the 1980s
should satisfy in quantitative terms the anticipated expansion of employment
in related occupations. A sharp increase in projected employment of science
and technology manpower is explained by expected growth in spending on R&D,
further development of the network of public research institutes and planned
improvements in the network of colleges and iuniversities. Government
recognizes, however, the trade-off between quantitative expansion in numbers
of scientists and engineers trained and key objectives of improving the
average quality of higher education in science and technology. On the basis
of experience gained under Loan 1800-KO, the Bank and Government have agreed
to adopt a multifaceted approach in monitoring progress in implementing the
sector program. Indicators for monitoring the program would include: (a)
student: teacher ratio; (b) proportion of faculty with the doctorate; (c)
proportion of full-time faculty; (d) average teaching load per week; and (e)
indicative annual enrollment levels. Other factors affecting college enroll-
ments such as aggregate size and employment prospects of high school
graduating classes, development of the junior technical college system and
fees structure would also be analyzed. These indicators would be analyzed
during each annual review to be held between the Government and the Bank
during which agreement would be reached on the targets to be monitored in the
following year.

3. MANAGEMENT AND tMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Management arrangements have been organized by the Government to
facilitate execution of the sector program and include: (a) a sector approach
to management; (b) appropriate arrangements for organization and staffing;
(j) well-defined implementation procedures, including guidelines and criteria
for allocating loan funds; and (d) a feasible implementation schedule.
The Sector Approach
3.02      The program fox science and technology education would build upon
and expand the program for higher technical education ass'.sted under Loan
1800-KO. As in the earlier program, the proposed prograw would be composed of
national programs (approximately five) and subprojects (about 60). National
programs represent actions that would potentially beneflt the entire sector or
subsectors and include: the program of research grants under KOSEF;
accreditation assistance; staff development programs via overseas and local
training, and repatriation of Korean scientists and engineers abroad; equip-
ment for approximately 800 GHSs and 13 RSCs; and studies, Bank loan funds
earmarked for national programs would be provided by the Government to the
beneficiary institutions under eligibility criteria and guidelines acceptable
to the Bank. Subprojects in contrast would be tailored to meet the needs of
individual institutions that apply under the program. Subprojects with about
10 graduate schools of science and engineering, 30 colleges of natural science
and 20 colleges of education are expe,cted to be supported under the proposed
loan. Each subproject would provide equipment and would be processed by the
Government in accordance with guidelines and criteria agreed with the Bank.
3.03      Given Government's success in managing the program for higher
technical education under Loan 1800-KO, deliberate effort has been made to
rely on the borrower as regards: conformity with agreed procedures in prep-
aration and approval of national programs and subprojects; and application of
agreed eligibility criteria and guidelines in allocation of loan funds.  In
accordance with the agreed eligibility criteria and guidelines, MOE would
appraise and approve national programs and subprojects for institutions under
its jurisdiction. MOST would supervise the national program of research
grants managed by KOSEF and the KAIST subproject. Implementation of the
program would be carried out within the existing organizational set-up of MOE
and MOST. This approach would be the most efficient way to execute the devel-
opment program. It is also a desirable way of further institutionalizing
program management capacity in government agencies.
Organization and Staffing
3.04      The Government has devised an effective organization plan and an
adequate staffing plan for implementing the program (Annex 6).
3.05      MOE Orga-iization (Annex 7).  The MOE organization plan relies on
existing line agencies, builds on their strengths and includes appropriate
checks and balances. Responsibility for implementation of national programs
and subprojects would be under the Vice Minister of Education and divided



- 19 -
between the Ed&cation Facilities Bureau (EFB) for physical aspects; and the
Higher Education Bureau (HEB), Teacher and International Education Bureau
(TIEB) and General Education Bureau (GFB) for educational aspects. The EFB
would be responsible for general coordination of the programs under the Vice
Minister, liaison with the Bank and reporting to Government and the Bank on
progress of the MOE program. EFB in conjunction with the Office of Supply,
Republic of Korea (OSROK) would also have overall responsibility for the
procurement of educational equipment and delivery to MOE project institu-
tions. The HEB would manage the educational aspects of graduate programs in
science and engineering and college-level programs in science; the TIEB would
manage corresponding programs for colleges of education; and the GEB would
manage the development program for science education at the secondary level.
The Director General of the EFB would be the Executivs Director of the MOE
portion of the proposed sector loan and report to the <'ice Minister. Three
persons, one each in HEB, TIEB and GEB, would be designated subcomponent
managers.
3.06      MOST Organization (Annex 8).  Under the overall coordination of the
Office of Planning and Management (OPM), a line agency of MOST, KOSEF and
KAIST would be responsible for implementation of their own share of the sector
program. Both KOSEF and KAIST have strong records in implementing previous
externally and locally financed program-,a OPM would be accountable to the
Vice Minister of MOST and responsible for reporting to the Government and the
Bank on progress under KOSEF and KAIST.  Within KAIST, the Office of Inter-
national Programs would implement the faculty development program and procure
equipment in conjunction with OSROK. Within KOSEF, the Program Promotion
Department would be responsible for managing research grants as adjudicated
and approved by KOSEF. The Director of OPM would be designated executive
director of the MOST share of the program and would be assisted by the
Director of the Program Promotion Department of KOSEF and the Director of the
KAIST Office of International Programs.
3.07      Staffing.  Government has taken steps to ensure that the implementa-
tion agencies would have sufficient competent staff to manage the proposed
sector program. Under MOE, the staffing level of the key agencies, EFB, HEB
and TIEB is adequate to carry out their scheduled actions under the prcposed
program. The Science and Vocational Education Division of GEB, however, would
increase the number of officers from the current level of nine to approxi-
mately 15 by June 30, 1984.  The OPM is adequately staffed, as is the KAIST
Office of International Programs. The KOSEF Program Promotion Department
would increase from the present seven employees to 10 by June 1985, and the
total number of staff at KOSEF would increase from 25 to about 45 by 1988.
This proposed increase is reasonable. Both MOE and KOSEF have also arranged
for outside assistance to complement permanent staff capability, particularly
with respect to technical areas of responsibility.  MOE would use a task force
of distinguished educators for technical review of national programs and sub-
projects. A contract under 1800-KO was signed with the chairman of the task
force for that purpose in November 1983. The KOSEF grants committee is
composed of 15 leading scientists and engineers. It also employs five
university faculty members as part-time consultants in program planning.



- 20 -
Implementation Procedures
3.08      Under Loan 1800-KO the Government used procedures acceptable to the
Bank for equipment procurement and technical assistance management. These
same procedures would be used for the proposed sector loan. Implementation
procedures would also incorporate several improvements designed to accelerate
implementation, including appointment of technical review committees and
processing of subprojects well in advance of the effective date of the loan.
3.09      Implementation under KOS.  Based on the preparation documents, HEB,
TIEB and GEB have already formulated national programs under MOE. MOE has
also advised institutions about requizements for subproject applications and
invited applications. Subprojects would then be prepared by individual insti-
tutions and submitted as subloan applications for processing by MOE (Annex 9).
Based on a recent survey of graduate- and college-level institutions, there is
sufficient interest among eligible public and private institutions to utilize
fully the Bank loan funds (para. 4.09).
3.10      During negotiations, four representative subloan applications and
appraisal reports (one of each kind, a graduate program in science, a graduate
program in engineering, a college-level program in science, and a college-
level program in science education) were reviewed by the Bank.  The quality
and standards of preparation and appraisal in these four cases were found to
be acceptable to the Bank. The Bank would only exercise ex post review of
additional subprojects on a sample basis during review missions.
3.11      Eligibility criteria and guidelines have been reviewed by the Bank
and are satisfactory. These include: (a) general criteria for the approval
of national programs and subprojects (Annex lOa); (b) specific criteria and
guidelines for allocation of loan funds under national programs (Annex 10b);
and (c) specific criteria for eligibility ot subloan applications and
guidelines on the allocation of loan funds under subprojects (Annex lOc).
Government has agreed to approve national programs and subprojects according
to these agreed criteria and guidelines.
3.12      Implementation under HOST.  Under MOST, procedures are in place for
implementation of the KAIST subproject ($1O.O million including contingencies)
and the KOSE1 national program ($12.0 million including contingencies).  Due
to its special role as the largest institution for graduate training in Korea,
the KAIST subproject was appraised directly by the Bank and was found accept-
able in all technical and e6acation aspects. The KAIST subloan exceeds the
maximum amount under graduate subprojects ($5.0 million). This is justified
by lts central role in producing high-level manpower in science and engineer-
ing fields. Under the Director of the KAIST Office of International Programs,
equipment specifications and bidding documents are being prepared and will be
completed by March 1984. The facuLty development program has been designed
and would be ready for implementation following loan effectiveness.
3.13      KOSEF has established procedures for implementation of the national
program for research promotion and funding (Annex 11). Research grants would
be approved in open competition twice a year by a formal KOSEF selection
committee. Once approved, grants are made to the researcher's institution.



- 21 -
KOSEF would maintain an approval ratio of about one of every three proposals
and support on the order of 10% of the doctoral-level researchers. 4pproxi-
mately 75% of research grants would support the work of university or college-
based researchers; the remainder, researchers in public research institutes.
3.14      Program Monitoring.  Under MOE corresponding division directors
would be responsible for monitoring the progress of national programs and sub-
projects. Up-to-date information would be collected and semi-annual evalua-
tion reports prepared. These reports would form the basis for comprehensive
annual reviews with the Bank, during which targets for the following year
would be set, and an in-depth mid-term review. The Bank and Government have
agreed: (a) on key performance indicators and first year and mid-term
targets, including indicative annual enrollment levels; and (b) that the
annual comprehensive review would take place by October 31 annually, and the
mid-term review by October 31, 1987 (Annex 12). The timing for the mid-term
review is linked to full implementation of the Action Program, expected in
1990. The role of the Bank would be to hold discussions on policies affecting
the subsector, check overall progress on institutional reforms, make random
checks on national programs and subprojects to ensure that they conform with
agreed criteria, and compare actual achievements with targets while focusing
on the causes and effects of any significant deviations.
3.15      Implementation Schedule.  The Government's total investment program
in science and technology education would be implemented over the six years
from January 1984 to December 1989. The Bank's financial involvement in the
program would be a time slice covering approximately 14% of costs during the
period from July 1984 to June 1988 (Annex 13). The schedule of implementation
for the entire program is realistic. All MOE subproject applications are
expected to be prepared, appraised and tentatively approved by the Minister
before loan signing and procurement of subproject equipment through OSROK
would proceed soon after loan signing. KOSEF national program and KAIST
subproject are likewise at an advanced stage of preparation.. All subprojects
and national programs funded by the Bank would be completed by June 30, 1988.
4. COST AND FINANCING
4.01      Costs are defined as the investment program for the science and
technology education sector for J4iy 1984 to June 1988, of which the proposed
loan would finance a time slice.-- The level of the investment program is
14/ The Government has formulated a six-year (1984-89) investment plan for
science and technology education. This plan with an investment estimated
at $1.0 billion equivalent (1983 prices) covers two plan periods, includ-
ing part (1984-86) of the Fifth Plan and part (1987-89) of the Sixth
Plan. Bank support is being proposed for the period July 1984 to June
1988. This phase has been costed separately and is referred to as the
Government's investment program.



- 22 -
appropriate to effect the proposed policy and institutional changes and quali-
tative improvement in the sector. The investment program is economical amd
would be financially feasible.
Investment Program
4.02       'The investment program 1984-88 for public and private science and
technology education is costed at $542 million net of contingencies and $695
million with contingencies (Annex 14). The allocation of investment betweea
components shows that graduate education and research would receive $193 mil-
lion; college level $159 million; and secondary level $191 million, net of
contingencies (Table 4.1). The public share of the investment program is
estimated at $391 million net of contingencies. The Investment program for
private institutions is estimated at $152 million net of contingencies.

4.03      Base costs refer to April 1984 prices.  Civil works are estimated on
the basis of EPB's standards for building unit costs and are reasonable;
equipment costs are based on the estimated cost of reseaTch equipment at the
graduate level and on standard equipment lists for the college and secondary
level updated in 1983 and are reasonable.  The technical assistance component
would include 116 man-months of specialist services; 16,260 man-months of
overseas fellowships; and repatriation for 120 scholars. Thb5?an-moath Cost
of overseas fellowships is expected to average about $1,500 - and the cost
of each repatriation about $25,000 including an allocation for travel and
related expenses, an allowance for housing and a research start-up fund.
About five policy studies and 1,600 KOSEF research grants would be included in
the sector program. The costs of each policy study and of each KOSEF research
grant are expected to average $140,000 and $25,000, respectively.
4.04      The contingencies estimated at $153 million would bring the total
investment program to $695 million. Physical conting,incies represent 102 and
price contingencies about 18% of the base cost. Price contingencies are cal-
culated on base costs plus phyrsical contingencies and estimated oa the basis
of 3.5% in 1984, 8.0% in 1985 and 9.0% from 1986 to 1988 in both local and
foreign costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at 20% for civil works;
90% for equipment; 90% for specialist services; 100% for overseas training;
100% for repatriation; 50% for studies; and 60% for research grants. The
foreign exchange cost of the total investment program Ls $349 million or 50%
of total cost. The estimated investment program includes duties and taxes
amounting to about $21 million (about 3% of total program cost). The Govern-
ment and private institutions would finance taxes and duties. Imported
instructional equipment and foreign specialists' services are exempted from
taxes.
Recurrent Cost Implications
4.05      The additional recurrent expenditures generated by the investment
program are within the financial capacity of Government and the private insti-
tutions. The combination of higher standards and some enrollment expansion
would lead to higher recurrent expenditures. For the public sector these
additional expenditures would average about 1.0% of the annual budgets of MOE
and MOST between 1984 and 1988 (Table 4.2). For private Institutions total
additional recurrent expenditures would average about $40 million or about 10%
of their 1983 annual expenditure.  Under the Action Program, Government would
review student fees annually and authorize adjustments if necessary. Growth
in income from endowments, direct grants from private scurces and Government,
as well as other public subsidies, would also be utilized to meet the
recurrent costs of private institutions. The increase in fellowships and
scholarships would assist students in meeting tuition and related costs and
broaden access to higher education.
15/ Because of price changes since 1980, this figure is higher than the
$1,300 per man-month of overseas fellowships used in Loan 1800-KO.

Financing and Bank Contribution
4.06      Table 4.3 outlines the proposed financing plan for the investment
program. The Government would undertake 62% of the investment program and
private Korean sources 24% (both including all the costs of civil works). The
proposed Bank loan of $100 million equivalent (including front-end fee of
$0.2 million) would cover 14% of the total investment program. The loan would
represent 29% of the estimated foreign exchange component.
4.07      The Government's investment program is within the financial capacity
of MOST and MOE. The peak yearly capital investment would be roughly
$100 million in 1988.  This would represent about 42 of the projected annual
budget for MOE and HOST in 1988 or about 18% of the projected capital expen-
diture. These are reasonable proportions in view of the urgency for improve-
ments in science and technology education. Capital expenditures in private
institutions would be financed mainly from revenues from fees and investments
including endowments, contributions from the private sector and, in some
cases, loans from commercial banks. In the 1984-88 period these sources ari
expected to generate about $200 million in current prices, or 85% of the total
investment in private institutions. The remainder would be met from the
proposed Bank loan through subloans to these institutions.

level; and $11.2 million for secondary level science education, each including
contingencies; and $0.2 million in front-end fee (Annex 14, Tables 3 and 4).
These amounts were determined by the Governtnent in accordance with overall
priorities and relative need for foreign exchange by component.



- 26 -
Financing of Private IZstitutions
4.09      Assistance for private colleges and graduate schools under sub-
projects would be financed through subloans by the Government to the private
institutions. Private institutions would receive subloans on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. It is expected that the terms of the
subloans would be the same as those of the Bank loan. As an added incentive
to private institutions, the Government has agreed to prepare each year during
the program a financial plan for prlvate graduate schools, colleges and high
schools to ensure the enhancement of their quality in accordance with the
objectives of the program, and in consultation with the Bank, on the occasion
of each annual and the mid-term review, proceed to implement this plan.
Assistance for private institutions under national programs would be part of
the financial plan and is expected to be on a grant basis.
Procurement
4.10      Procurement arrangements under the proposed program are summarized
in Annex 15. Civil works, none of which is financed by the Bank, would be
procured through established local procedures. The proposed loan woula
finance about $74 million equivaLent of equipment, books and materials. In
continuation of the threshold applicable under Loan 1800-KO, equipment pack-
ages of $500,000 equivalent or more would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Equipment
items which cannot be grouped to form bid packages of $500,000 equivalent or
more would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, under
government procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank, subject to an
aggregate total value not exceeding $11 million equivalent (about 15% of the
total value of equipment financed under the loan). Miscellaneous equipment
items in packages each not exceeding $50,000 equivalent, and in aggregate
$700,000 equivalent (or 1% of the estimated amount of equipment financed under
the loan), could be procured through direct purchase on the basis of at least
three price quotations. Local manufacturers are expected to bid, especially
on equipment for the secondary level, and would be extended a 15% preference
margin, or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower, on bid evalua-
tions. Instructional materials and books would be procured through direct
purchase after negotiation for discounts. All consultants would be selected
in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the
basis of the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants. Contracts for
studies would be approved and awarded by HOE; contracts under KOSEF research
grants would be approved and awarded by KOSEP. These contracts would be
reviewed on a sampLe basis by visiting Bank missions.
4.11      OSROK wias not required to refer to the Bank for prior review of the
estimated 6,000 contracts for equipment or technical assistance under Loan
1800-KO, but rather retained bid evaluation reports, documents and contracts
for selective ex post review by Bank staff during missions. This procedure,
which worked to the Bank's satisfaction as confirmed by regular sample review
of documentation, would be continued under the proposed program. Based on an
analysis of the profile of contracts under Loan 1800-KO, Bank field review of
about 3% of contracts (about 150 contracts above $100,000 each) would cover
about 40% of the total value of all contracts estimated to number about 5,500e



- 27 -
Disbursements
4.12      The proposed sector loan of $100 million would be disbursed on the
basis of: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures of imported equipment includ-
ing books and materials, or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equip-
ment; (b) 65%. of the cost of other local expenditures for equipment; (c) 100%
of the expenditures for specialist services, overseas fellowships, studies and
repatriation of Korean scholars from abroad; and (d) 60% of the expenditures
for research grants. In order to facilitate Bank processing of disburseament
applications a minimum level for withdrawal applications of $10U,000 has been
set. The estimated disbursement schedules by year and semester are given in
Table 4.4. The proposed program would be implemented over a four-year period
commencing from July 1, 1984. The completion date would be June 30, 1988 and
the closing date June 30, 1989. This period is judged feasible because
perfornance on Loan 1800-KO is satisfactory and, according to the schedule of
implerientation, all subprojects would be processed and preparation for pro-
curement of goods and Bervices would be at an advanced stage by the effective
date of the loan.

schedule in subproject processing by comparison with the schedule under
Loan 1800-KO.

4.13      In reference to documentation of disbursement applications, for con-
tracts exceeding $100,000 two copies would be submitted to the Bank. For the
large number of contracts below $100,000 (para. 4.11), statements of expendi-
ture (SOE) would be used. In this case contracts and supporting documents
would be retained in one location each for KOSEF and MOE, and made available
for review by visiting Bank missions. Disburaements aisinst SOES would be
made on the basis of a consolidated summary, each not less tnan $100,000O
Disbursements against other program expenditures would be mado against full
documentation.
4.14      Under the proposed loan, special accounts would be set up for the
disbursement of KQSEF research grants, for XAIST and for MOE. These accounts
would be set up and maintained in US dollars at the Korea Exchange Bank at
Seoul, Korea. For each special account, applications for replenishment would
be submitted quarterly, or more frequently if necessary, with SOEs as
supporting documentation. The Bank and Government have agreed that opening of
the special accounts for KOSEF, KAIST and MOE would be a condition for dis-
bursement under thelr respective categories.
Accounts and Audit
4.15      Government would establish and maintain separate accounts to record
expenditures of proceeds. Auditing of accounts, including documentation of
SOEs, would be performed by an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank.
Annual audit reports would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of
the Government's fiscal year. The Bank is satisfied with present auditing in
Korea. Six months after the closing date Government would submit a project
completion report to the Bank.
5.  BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      The proposed sector program represents a new approach to improving
science and technology education, as one element of a broad effort to raise
the technological level vf industry. It focuses on government action with
respect to sector policies and institutions that together hold far-reaching
change in the management and performance of science and technology educa-
tion. These adjustments would improve sector management through actions to
set academic standards, concentrate resources for graduate education, increase
research activity ia priority fields, and strengthen sector planning and
program evaluation. They would improve sector performance through actions to
increase the supply and qualifications of teaching staff, improve facilities
and equipment and increase resources devoted to practical and laboratory-based
educational activities. At the graduate and colige levels, by 1990 student:
faculty ratios would average 20:1; average teaching load would be approxi-
mately 10 hours per week; about 50% of all faculty would be on full-time
appointments; and the proportion of faculty holding the doctorate would reach
65% in science, and 50Z in science education and in engineering. The shortage
of laboratory facilities would be reduced to 15% of the official standard.
The deficit in equipment for research and teaching would be reduced to an
average of 30. of the official standard. At the secondary level, all students

in GHSs would study four science subjects; 140 experimental units would be
introduced in these courses; about 20X of instructional time In science would
be devoted to experimental science; and the overall deficit in laboratory
facilities and science equipment would be narrowed to about 15X each. By 1990
the science and technology education sector would graduate approximately 7,000
students per year at the graduate level in science or engineering; 18,000
students at the college level in science or science education; and 400,000
students per year from GHgs with an improved science curriculum. As a result
of this program these graduates would be of higher quality and in fields of
evident national priority.
5.02      While providing substantial "enefits, this program comprises mani-
fold changes. It would be complex to -axecute and would impose a significant
management burden on Government. Due to the significance, complexity and
management load of this program, there is a risk that delays may occur.
However, features of program design and lessons from the program for higher
technical education (Loan 1800-KO) incorporated into this program reduce this
risk significantly. First, the main agencies involved participated exten-
sively in the sector survey in 1981 and 1982 and in the identification and
preparation of the program, including revised policies, institutional changes,
and guidelines and criteria for approval of national programs and
subprojects. Second, the management system and operating procedures have been
designed to allow for adjustment during implementation by mutual agreement of
Government and the Bank following annual joint and mid-term reviews. Third,
the schedule for subproject processing and equipment procurement has been
significantly advanced by comparison with the previous program. In sum,
Government's familiarity with the content of the program, its commitment to
the objectives, the flexibility of program design, and the borrower's
experience and competence combine to reduce risk to acceptable levels.
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECMMENDATZ0IN
6.01      The Bank has obtained assurances from the Government on the
following matters:
(a) the time schedule for implementation of actions and attainment of
targets set out in the Policy Letter and Action Program submitted to
the Bank (para. 2.01);
(b) fellowships would be awarded in accordance with selection criteria
and procedures acceptable to the Bank (paras. 2.07 and 2.14);
(c) Government would approve national programs and subprojects according
to agreed criteria and guidelines (para. 3.11)
(d) the performance indicators, first year and mid-term targets,
including indicative annual enrollment levels, and reporting
requirements (para. 3.14);
(e) timing of annual and mid-term joint reviews (para. 3.14);



- 30 -
(f)  in order to finance subprojects with private institutions,
Government would enter into subloans on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.09).
(g) Government would prepare each year during the program a financial
plan for private graduate schools, colleges and high schools and, in
consultation with the Bank on the occasion of each annual and the
mid-term review, proceed to implement this plan (para. 4.09);
(h)  minimum level for withdrawal applications of $100,000 (para. 4.12);
(l)  KOSEF, KAIST and HOE would each open a special account priot to
disbursement (para. 4.14);
(J)  audit reports would be submitted by Government to the Bank within
six months of the end of each Government's fiscal year (para 4.15);
and
(j)  completion report would be prepared by the Government and submitted
to the Bank within six months of the closing date of the loan
(para. 4.15).
6.02      Subject to the above conditions the proposed program constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Republic of Korea of $100 million
equivalent, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, at
the standard variable interest rate.

KOREA
PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
Korea Science and Engineering Foundation
1.        The Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) was established
in 1977 as a non-profit foundation under the adminlstrative control of MOST.
The Board of Trustees is composed of representatives of Government, the acade-
mic community and the private sector. The current President of KOSEF is the
Minister of MOST. As recorded in the KOSEF charter, the objective of the
Foundation is to contribute to the advancement of science ard technology
through fostering research, enhancing science and technology education and
promoting international exchanges in the areas of science and technology.
This objective is served through several KOSEF funded activities: a program
of research grants for basic and applied research; a program of graduate
research fellowships; fellowships for advanced study abroad; finaacial assist-
ance for publications; and international cooperation involving scientific
exchange, joint research, and visiting research fellowships. This program is
managed by a permanent staff of 25 under the Secretary General and a set of
committees composed of leading scientists and engineers (Chart 1). KOSEF
financial resources are composed of income from an endowment fund, annual
budgetary allocations under MOST, and other sources, such as donations from
national or international sources. The KOSEF budget in 1983 was about
$6.0 million. This is projected to increase to about $24.0 million by 1988 in
1983 prices. IBRD loan assistance would represent a decreasing share of KOSEF
total program or from about 25% in 1984 to 10% in 1988.
2.        A major objective of the proposed sector program is to help raise
the level and quality of research, both as a contribution to advanced training
in science and technology and as part of the national drive to promote
research and development of relevance to Korean industry. During 1982, KOSEF
organized a nationwide review of the state-of-the-art in scientific and
technological areas of relevance to Korean industrial and economic develop-
ment.  This exercise was carried out by a cross-section of leading Korean
scientists and technologists. Panels of experts analyzed each major field and
subfield by discipline, assessed the calibre of research personnel and their
contribution, identified weaknesses and recommended levels of research funding
and related assistance for training to raise the quality of vork in 15
selected fields to international standards./l The expanded program of
research grants would be directed at priority fields such as mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biological sciences, materials science, geoscience,
computer science, mechanical engineering, electronics, electricity, chemical
engineering, architectural engineering, civil engineering, nuclear
/1   Reported in Development Strategies for Priority Subfields In Science and
Technology, KOSEF, March 1982.

engineering, and agriculture and fishery.  Tentative allocations have been
assigned to each of these fields for program planning. The overall estimated
balance in these planning figures is 60% of research funds for busic or pure
sciences and 40X for engineering fields.
3.        Although tentative allocations by priority field Liave been assigned,
research program funding targets would be reviewed and revised annually by
KOSEF.  This annual program planning would be based upon:  an evaluation of          
ongoing research projects; formulation of priorities by subfield based on
present scope, level and quality of researce, international comparison and
development plan; and formulation of priorities by principal field based on
potential contribution to industrial and social development, relative weak-
ness, international comparison and demand for doctoral level manpower.
4.        In response to a general announcement indicating priority fields,
applications would be received and subjected to peer review by a roster of
consultants maintained by KOSEF. Proposals recommended for further considera-
tion would then be examined by a formal KOSEF selection committee. Once
approved, grants are made to the researcher through his/her institution.
These procedures are standard and have been modeled upon systems in place in
corresponding agencies in the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and the
United States, among others.

PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
Science and Technology Manpower
1.        Plans for strengthening Korean scientific and technological capacity
are necessarily dependent on plans to produce an appropriate number of quali-
fied persounal for industry, research institutes and academic institutions.
That Korea firms face R&D manpower difficulties is corroborated by the results
of a 1979 survey of 150 large firms conducted by the Federation of Korean
Industries. Less than 50% of firms considered their technical staff as fully
qualified and less than 40% were satisfied with the capability of R&D per-
sonnel.  Lack of appropriately qualified personnel, especially at the profess-
ionaL level, was reported by most companies to be a major problem in running
R&D facilities.  For establishment of R&D facilities, recruitment of high-
level personnel again ranked first among .the stated difficulties.
2.        Shortage of qualified manpower, especially persons with relevant
industrial experience, is also a constraint in the operations of the govern-
ment-funded research institutes. In 1981 the approximately 120 government
research institutes employed over 4,600 researchers, including 600 PhD
holders, 1,200 master's graduates and 2,800 with the bachelor's degree.
Further growth in the number and proportion of persons with the master's or
PhD degree is foreseen by government officials. A major drive is also
underway to recruit personnel who possess not only necessary academic creden-
tials but experience in research management and leadership. Likewise, the
demand for college and university faculty in science and engineering fields
has increased as student enrollments have doubled since 1978. And Government
seeks to upgrade skills of existing faculty through support of advanced
training in Korea and abroad.
3.        Relative demand for qualified manpower in science and technology is
further evident from general labor market analyses. Earnings differentials in
Korea between persons qualified in science and engineering at the university
and graduate level and those of secondary or lower education have widened
since the early 1970s. Based on annual surveys by the Ministry of Labor,
average monthly earnings of science and engineering graduates over secondary
graduates, increased from a ratio of 1.75 in 1971 to 2.30 in 1979 or by
31.4%. Whether this ratio will increase or decrease in the 1980s depends on a
combination of factors. Not the least of these factors is the capacity of
Korea to satisfy the demand for qualified personnel.
4.        Projections of enrollment and output in graduate and college level
programs in science and engineering for the period 1983 to 1990 are contained
in Tables 1 and 2. MOST, KEDI and KAIST have recently carried out projections



ANNEX 5

-40-
of future demand of scientific and technical manpower.-/ When these figures
were compared with the supply estimates, the results from these different
approaches were broadly comparable. In general, these studies portray differ-
ing conditions across the three major categories of scientists, engineers and
technicians. A shortage of scientists, generated largely from within the edu-
cation system and research institutes, is anticipated throughout the decade
suggesting that science education should grow modestly during the Fifth and
Sixth Plan periods. In contrast, the supply of engineers should approximate
demand through the end of the 1980s. This anticipated balance reflects major
investment already planned in this decade to expand and upgrade undergraduate
engineering education. The major imbalance, a significant surplus, is fore-
seen in supply and demand for technicians. However, this category of manpower
is also the most elastic. These graduates of two-year junior technical
colleges have a range of choice on completion of their programs. A select few
may seek to enter four-year colleges to improve their credentials. Those who
enter the labor force directly may shortly progress to the upper ranks of
skilled workers and craftsmen. The more able may even displace engineers from
certain intermediate industrial posts that engineering graduates have tended
to fill in Korea. Manpower projections by MOST also anticipate excess demand
for skilled workers in the second half of this decade. An ample supply of
technicians, trained at the junior college level in close association with
industrial conditions and needs, might provide the needed cushion.

PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
General Criteria for Approval of National Programs and Subprojects
1.        Government would appraise and approve applications for national
programs and subprojects on the basis of three criteria: relevance, feasibi-
lity and efficiency. These criteria should form the basis by which the
appraisal committee would arrive at a consensus, although it is recognized
that the weight assigned to individuaT. factors may vary by level and type of
program.
Relevance to Program Objectives
2.        Applications would be evaluated to determine the degree to which
they meet overall program objectives of quality improvement. Particular care
would be taken to ensure that a close fit exists between the proposal and the
cause of quality problems identified by the institution in its five year
development plan (e.g. inadequate curricula, staff or equipment shortages).
The analysis of relevance would cover the following topics:
3.        Enrollments.  Whether projected rates of enrollment expansion are
consistent with the overall manpower development plan of the Government and
would permit improvements to take place as measured by the key indicators.
For undergraduate institutions preference would be given to those with no, or
only moderate, increases in enrollment.
4.        Staffing.  In view of the importance of faculty development,
preference would be given to proposals which include graduate programs for
increasing the supply of faculty or which include strong undergraduate faculty
development programs. The evaluation would cover both the quantity and
quality of faculty as follows:
(a) Quantity. Present student:faculty ratios would be compared with
target ratios and a determination would be made whether the targets
are consistent with overall planning figures.
(b)  Quality.  Present proportions of trained faculty and the proportion
on full-time appointments would be compared with target proportions
and a determination would be made whether the targets for the insti-
tution are within targets for the whole system.
5.        Curricula.  Whether the planned changes would meet requirements of
industry, government research institutes and/or academic institutions. Propo-
sals would be evaluated for the extent to which changes in teaching programs
would: (i) increase the proportion of student time spent in practical labora-
tory work and in basic science/engineering; (ii) consolidate existing programs
(e.g., introduce interdisciplinary programs); (iii) introduce in-service
programs for collaborative training and research arrangements with research



48i-                          ANNEX 10a
Page 2
institutes or industry; and (iv) introduce new teaching methods aimed at
problem-solving.
6.        Physical Facilities.  Whether the increase in equipment and
buildings is needed to implement new teaching programs or achieve a higher
allocation of student time in laboratory work. Preference would be given to
institutions poorly endowed at present with laboratory and teaching equipment,
as indicated by the percentage of the MOE's equipment standard met by field.
Feasibility
7.        Feasibility, or the degree to which the proposed action could in
fact be implemented, would be an important appraisal consideration. This
criterion would be separated into considerations related to staffing,
management, finance and physical feasibility.
8.        Staffing.  The proposed level of staff recruitment would be compared
with past achievements. The incentives being given to recruit and retain
staff would be examined in depth in order to ascertain whether the proposed
staff development plan could in fact be implemented as planned.
9.        Management.  The ability of the institution to manage the subproject
would be examined in terms of adequacy of the proposed organizational struc-
ture, clarity of procedures, as well as the number and qualifications of staff
assigned to handle subproject execution. Commitment of the subborrower to the
subproject would be an important consideration and would be measured by the
standard of the institution's five-year development plan and its efforts at
raising financial resources in addition to student fees.
10.       Finance.  The following topics would be reviewed:  the financial
capacity of institutions to maintain operation of the institution at higher
levels of quality, such as lower student:faculty ratios, competitive salary
schedule, budget for equipment maintenance and repairs. This would cover
financial analysis of the institution's ability to service debt including the
proposed sub-loan. In those instances where the level of student fees is
inadequate to provide sufficient finance for quality improvement (i.e., to
introduce new teaching programs, recruit more and better trained staff and
operate better equipped laboratories), the Government would consider
authorizing an increase in the level of fees. Preference would be given to
subprojects of private institutions able to present evidence of financial
support from industry (i.e. matching grants).
11.       Physical.  This consideration would include such topics as the
adequacy of support services for accommodating equipment and its maintenance
and repair.
Efficiency
12.       The third general criterion of efficiency would be used to assess
whether the proposed action could be implemented at reasonable cost. This
consideration would include the following aspects:



- 49_                           ANNEX lOa
Page 3
(a) Unit capital costs. Whether the investment cost per student and per
graduate would be reasonable.
(b) Utilization rates. Whether space utilization and equipment use
would be sufficiently intensive (e.g., whether expensive equipment
items would be shared between departments). Priority would be given
to equipment in the order of frequency of use.
(c)  Staff work schedules.  Whether staff would have adequate (but not
excessive) weekly workloads.
13.       For each program area H0E would apply standards and acceptable
ranges for the above factors, e.g., student:faculty ratios, space utilization
rates, staff workloads, and unit costs and would specify any targets which may
accompany the appraisal and approval. MOE would convey the results of its
appraisal to the institution and would receive periodic reports from the
institution on progress toward goals and the achievement of targets set by
MOE. MOE would terminate any subproject which is not achieving its targets
over a reasonable period of time.

PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
Eligibility Criteria and Guidelines for National Programs
1.        National programs under HOE have been designed by Government and
reviewed by the Bank. The actual approval of actions within each national
program is contingent o3n each request satisfactorily meeting each of the three
general criteria: r *vance to program objectives; feasibility in terms of
degree to which actiom can be achieved; and efficiency or cost-effectiveness
of proposed action as compared with possible alternatives. Further specific
criteria and guidelines would be applied to each national program as follows:
Accreditation
2.        The national program for accreditation includes two subprograms:
accreditation -for colleges of national science and accreditation for graduate
programs in science and engineering.  Drawing upon tte personnel of the KCUE,
the accreditation committees would assess the quality of existing training
institutions; set minimum training standards (in terms of staff, curriculum,
equipment and facilities); propose remedial measures to correct quality
deficiencies; and, ultimately, extend accreditation through the MOE. In
addition, the accreditation committees would sponsor studies on topics of
common interest, such as curriculum or education finance, and organize
workshops and seminars for professional development.
Staff Development
3.        Staff development includes three national programs:  repatriation,
overseas fellowships and local training. Draft terms of reference, including
qualifications of candidates, selection procedures, description of training
programs, and arrangements for management of staff development have been
reviewed by the Bank. The appropriace bureau of MOE and KAIST would in all
cases make direct arrangements with the recipient institutions. Due to the
large number of persons to be selected from distinct client groups for a
variety of training courses, the Bank and Government recognize that fellowship
fields and prototype courses would be adapted to meet the particular require-
ments of trainees during implementation.
4.        Repatriation.  The primary objective of repatriation is to increase
the supply of highly $;ualified personnel for graduate instruction and research
guidance. MOE and KBIAST have developed standard contracts specifying
responsibilities and benefits of personnel recruited overseas for repatriation
to Korea. They have also established standard qualifications (in terms of
advanced degrees, length of experience, record of research, priority fields)
and selection procedures.

ANXEX lOb
Page 2
5.        Overseas Fellowships.  The objective of overseas fellowships
included under the program is staff development of institutions included under
the sector program. Overseas training would be approved and financed only for
those programs where equivalent training is not yei. offered within Korea. For
each category of overseas training HOE has established qualifications for
candidates (in terms of language proficiency, age and experience, length of
service required on return to Korea) and selection procedures (nomination by
home institut-on, selection panel, standard budgets, award letter).
6.        Local Fellowships.  The objective of local fellowships is staff
upgrading for personnel in sector institutions. Under the components for
graduate education and research and for college-level programs, the local
training would include master's and special doctoral programs at KAIST or
graduate-oriented universities, as well as occasional workshops and
seminars. For secondary science development, local training would include
workshops and in-service training programs of RSCs or colleges of educatlon.
For science teachers and education specialists, the specific content of work-
shops and fellowship training w^uld be prepared, justified and approved on the
basis of the revised roles and i-.ctions of the clients. Emphasis would be
given to upgrading pedagogical and technical skills required for meeting the
objectives of the development program. Training would support the introduc-
tion of new science curriculum, instructional materials and related teaching
techniques. Priority in approval of training courses would thus be given to
resolving particular shortcomings in student performance (i.e. as in practical
laboratory-based work).
National Program for Equipment for General High Schools
and Regional Science Centers
7.        The objective of the national program to provide essential science
teaching equ4pment to GHSs and RSCs is to support implementation of the
experiment-oriented curriculum at the secondary level. All 800 GHSs and 13
RSCs are eligible. The target is to bring equipment availability mp to 85% of
the estimated requirement based on the new courses in each GHS and to provide
each RSC four complete sets of equipment and additional equipment for teacher
training, audio-visual support, maintenance and repair workshop and
vehicles. Approximately one half of the equipment requirements for GHSs under
the program would be provided under the loan and one half by local Doards of
education. Equipment requirements for each RSC would be financed under the
loan. In accordance with financing guidelines, approval for equipment for
each GHS would be based on:  (a) availability of, or completion schedule for
new, laboratory facilities; (b) schedule for science teaching and laboratory
use that meets program goals; (c, schedule for science teacher participation
in retraining courses; (d) recruitment plan for laboratory assistants; (e)
inventory of existing serviceable equipment; and (f) list of additional items
required to achieve program target. For the RSCs, approval for equipment
would be based on: (a) availability of necessary, or completion schedule for,
laboratory facilities; (b) staff recruitment and development plan; (c)
inventory of existing serviceable equipment; and (d) list of additional items
required to achieve program target.

Studies
8.        The chief objective of studies to be financed under the program is
to support the development of sector policies or to design actions for policy
implementation. Four studies have been identified: plan for the development
of graduate education; surveys of student achievement in secondary science
education; development of a plan for enhancing teachers' skills in evaluation;
and a study of college admissions procedures. It is expected that these
studies would be undertaken largely with the use of local consultants. Any
further studies identified during program implementation would necessarily
satisfy the general criteria and serve the same objective.

PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
Eligibility Criteria and Guidelines for Allocation of Loan
Funds under Subprojects
Objectives
1.        The objective of the sector program is to improve the quality of
education in science and technology. Improvement of quality is defined as
achieving a closer match between knowledge and skills of graduates and the
requirements for technological change and industrial development. This would
be accomplished through policy changes, institutional development and selec-
tive investments via national programs and subprojects. National programs
deal with assistance that would benefit the entire sector or subsector.
Subprojects would address the needs of specific academic institutions,
particularly with respect to equipment requirements at the college and
graduate level. The eligibility criteria and general guidelines for
allocation of loan funds under subprojects are subject to amendments and
modifications from time to time, after the Government and the Bank have
exchanged views and reached agreement on such amendments and modifications.
Eligibility Criteria
2.        For an institution to be eligible for receipt of loan proceeds under
subprojects it must meet the following criteria:
Graduate programs: (a) the institution is a graduate school of national,
public or private university/college with colleges of science and/or
engineering; (b) as regards size, the science graduate program must have
at least three departments of basic science; the engineering graduate
program must have at least three departments of engineering; (c) the
existing staff in the three or more departments of science or engineering
must include at least nine faculty members with doctorate degrees and at
least two in each department; (d) the student bod in the graduate
programs in 1983/84 must exceed 40 enrolled for master's and doctorate
degree programs in science or engineering; (e) the graduate programs must
have been in operation for at least three years as of Se->'.ember 1983; (f)
the faculty concerned must be able to produce evidence of productive
research activities (e.g., (i) institutional research grants awarded by
KOSEF or other research funding institution; (ii) institutional research
budget; and (iii) theses or papers accepted for publication); and (g) the
institution must have a development plan for five or more years with
emphasis on demonstrating how quality improvements would be achieved
within the program concerned.



ANNEX lOc
54                              Page 2
College programs: (a) the institution is a national, public or private
university/college with faculties of science and/or education; (b) as
regards size the university/college must have at least three science
departments; and in the case of colleges of education it must have
operated at least two departments of science education before September
1984; (c) the ex4sting staff in the three or more science departments
must include at least 12 full-time faculty members each qualified to
teach science; the existing staff in the two or more departments of
sc4ence education must include at least two full-time faculty members
qualified to teach subjects in science education; (d) as regards student
enrollment, the number of entering students in the college of science
must be in 1983/84 in excess of 120 in basic science departments; the
number of entering students in the college of education must be in
1984/85 in excess of 20 in each science education department; (e) the
institution must have been in operation for at least four years by
September 1984; and (f) the institution must have a development plan for
five or more years with emphasis on demonstrating how quality improvement
would be achieved for the program concerned.
General Guidelines for Allocation of Loan Proceeds
3.        The following guidelines would be used by the Government for the
approval of institutional subprojects:
Overall allocation of fund. It is expected that the overall allocation
would not exceed: $20 million for science graduate programs; $10 million
for engineering graduate programs; $30 million for science college
programs; $10 million for education college programs; $10 million for
secondary-level science programs; and that the total allocation would not
exceed $70 million. (Not including KAIST; see Note /a below.)
Concentration of funds.  Within the above ceiling for each category of
programs, it is further expected that there would be no more than 15
subprojects for science and/or engineering graduate programs; no more
than 35 subprojects for science college programs; and no more than 25
subprojects for education college programs.
Regional distribution of funds. For science and engineering graduate
programs, at least 30% of its share of loan funds would be allocated to
institutions outside the Seoul area. For science and education college
programs, at least 50% of loan funds under that category would be
allocated to institutions outside the Seoul area.
Participation of private institutions. About 30% of the share of loan
funds for graduate and science college programs would be allocated to
private institutions and about 40% of the share of loan funds for
education college programs would be allocated to private institutions.

Maximum and minimum allocation per subproject. The maximum and minimum
allocation per subproject would be as follows:
Programs                        Maximum                   Minimum
Graduate level /a                      $5.0 million             $0.5 million
Colleges of Natural Science            $3.0 million             $0.3 million
Colleges of Education                  $1.0 million             $0.1 million
/a The graduate-level programs at KAIST would exceed $5.0 million. Due to
its size and the emphasis placed on doctoral education and research, this
institutional subproject has been appraised separately and therefore would
not be subject to the max.num limitation as set in this document.

Xey Performance Indicators
1.        The principal objective of the sector program is to raise the
quality of science and techinology education to the standards required for an
industrial system that will be more skill- and knowledge-intensive and employ
more advanced technologies. As summarized by the Action Program, to achieve
this objective, Government would: introduce new and revised policies; effect
institutional changes to strengthen sector management; and improve the finan-
cial position of sector institutions by reducing the investment gap. For
monitoring progress with respect to these changes, Government and the Bank
have agreed on the following key performance indicators. They would form the
basis of progress reports and be reviewed jointly by Government and the Bank
on an annual basis and on the occasion of the interim review.
