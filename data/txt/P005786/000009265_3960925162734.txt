MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJEC'. Project Completion Report on Republic of Yemen
Fifth Education Project (Cr. 1340-YEM)
Attached i; the Project Completion Report on Republic of Yemen - Fifth
Education Project (Cr. 1340.YEM) prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office. Part It was prepared by the Borrower.
Despite a difficult political and macroeconomic environment, the project was
appropriate to the human resource development policy priority of the Borrower and adequately
matched to implementation capacity in its relative simplicity of designL As the second in a series
of five projects supporting primary teacher training and nonformal vocational skills and literacy
training, the project is rated as satisfactory in outcomes. It exceeded its targets in terms of
student intakes and graduates, except for the Basic Training Facilities of which only one of five is
operationaL The objective of reforming the teacher training curriculum was achieved, though
whether it has been implemented is not reported. A three-year delay in closing was due to
uncommitted project funds being allocated to provide equipment for schools financed under a
previous project and unanticipated procurement problems.
Istitutional development is rated as partiaL Project training was accomplished,
despite delays in technical assistance, and foreign experts were all replaced by Yemenis.
However, given inefficiencies in management of the nonformal facilities, institutional capacity
building could not be completed during the life of the project.
Sustainability is uncertain despite borrower commitment to human resource devel-
opment and follow-up IDA assistance. The uncertainty stems from the risk that facilities may not
be maintained, despite an ongoing maintenance study, and that staff capacity to implement new
teacher training programs is not yet proven.
The data provided in the PCR support its major conclusions, with some ntriguing
gaps in analysis of key aspects such as progress on meeting gender-related objectives.
It is intended to audit the project in the future as a cluster with ongoing projects.

PROJECT COQLETION UEPOR=
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth
Education project in the Republic of Yemen (Yemen) , for which an International
Developyent Association (IDA) Credit (1340-YEM) in the amount of SDR 9.2
million was approved on March 22, 1983. The credit was closed on June 30,
1992, three years behind schedule. It was 94 percent disbursed and an amout
of SDR 535,017.05 was cancelled with effect on November 30, 1992.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Middle gast and North Africa Reqional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, P.rts I and III), and the Borrower (Part 11).
The preparation of the report was facilitated by data col1ctd
during a project completion mission to Yemen in October 1992. The PCX ia
based, inter alia, on information contained in the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and the
Borrower, internal IDA memoranda and interviews with Yemeni Gover,ment
officials who were closely aseociated with the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION EPO=
EVAUATTON SUMWARY
O* ectLveu
1.         The objectives of the project were: {a) to increase the supply of
Yemei primary school teachers by expanding teacher training and to impro 
the quality of the Yemeni teaching force through revised curricula for primary
teacher training institutes (PTTIs); and (b) to increase litexacy and the
acquisition of basic vocational skills relating to agriculture, village and
community life, traditional crafts and home and family life for rural
adolescent and adult men and women. To achieve these objectives the project
included congtruction, equipmnt and furniture for four PTTIs and three
district training centers (DTCU)I establishment of a basic training facility
(UT?) to fund local development activities with a training element. Under
this facility, construction, equipment and furnishings and the operating costs
of DTC activities were to be supported; and technical assistance (TA) relatad
to the improvement of teacher training curricula and management, further
support for the project implementation unit/school building unit (PIU/SBU)
including fellowship training, a DTC, and a preinveetment study.
Imn1ementation Exrerience
2.         The project had a good beginning with marginal delays experne
with regard to the award of civil works contracts* The original cm           of
the project were implemented satisfactorily and the project would have been
completed as scheduled but for a Gover_ment request that the scope of the
project be expanded to include the financing of: (a) three additional PTTIs -
two of which were cancelled due to delays in approving their civil works
tenders and the third could not be completed before the project closd and wa
financed by the Government instead of MDa (b) imported materials for civil
works which had become very expensivel and (c) equipnmet and furniture fco
seven schools that were financed under earlier MDA projects and are presuy
undergoin rehabilitation under the Sixth Education Project (Credit 1470-MN).



- iv -
Financing activities that were not part of the appraised prject was posibls
due to the availability of uncommitted project funds which resulted fro
devaluation of the Ymeni. Rial. While local inilatior accelerated due to
devaluation later on, the earlier tenders wero not affected.
3.         Technical assistance (fellowship trainng and the use of foreign
experts) was carried out under a mnangement services contract which proved to
be effective and efficient. The merica-Mideast Educational and Traing
Sarvi-ms, Inc. (AmIDEAST) contract with the Government for TA i
proveJ4 useful, especially in consideration of the lesson learmed during
impldmentation of the Fourth Education project (Credit 1203-TAM - wich clatd
in December 1989), which had long delays in TA start-up and execution becaue
of poor organization In selecting and dispatching fellowship trainees and
employing of experts.
4.         Delays in implemenuation of the civil works componet were in part
due to the absence of a price escalation clause in contracts; specially attar
the devaluation of the Yemeni Rial. Also shortage of imported material in
Sana'a and other major cities delayed construction activities. Moreover,
USAID decided not to proceed with cofinancing the credit's TA in support of
the PTTI curriculum development plan because its agreed proposal to utiliz an
American  niversity a the contrar for the TA component wa not accepte by
the Govnt when the project started. In spite of these variances from the
planned objectives, the project achieved considerably more than anticipated by
the appraisal tea in 1982. This was in large part due to the close
collaboration between IDA and the Gont  d the willingness of all
parties to restructure project objectives to facilitate a new national
identity following the country's unification and to introduce additional
improvmts and adjustments to the PTTI system.
Resultg
S.         The four PTTSa, three DTCs and five front lin  units were
constructed and equipped. The quality of construction was uniformly good but
the maintenance of the institutions will have to be closely monitored. The
completion of the main objectives of the project significantly conti        to
the impre t of the PTTI system through improved training and the
Ymenization of project management at the PIU. Through the OTCs and front
units, skilled training and literacy programs in remote areas will be
yrovided. TRA was carried out by the AMlZAST under a management services
contract which contributed to the officiey of its impl ntion. Ibaft
twenty PlI  staff recived  fellowships for Amrican, Egyptian and Canadia
niversities for training in project maagmnt and, most importantly, the
nian foreign experts who supported the PID at.1ts inception were all repacd
by Teman personnel by the cloing of the Fifth Education protect. Ti
studies wer finished as planned - an evaluatio  of the OMCs and feasiblity
studies to support future project preparation.



SultaLnatix t
6.          Primary teacher training and the PTTI eystem have been given
priority tO meet the country'. urgent need for Yemen- teachers, particularly
in rural areas. The project has increased the stock of primary teachers (by
about 700 teacheze per year), which will reduce the dlpendence on foreign
teaches at a time when severe budgetary constraints make it necessary to toe
up resources for future investments in the country's education and trainin
y       A cmpeenive preventive maintenance study, financed und  the
Teachr Traiaing Project (Credit 1773-YEM), Is in progress to ensure the
upkeep of institutiops.
Lessons Leamnd
7.         The principal lessons learned through the project's  ple_
phase is that there are trade offs between adding new components for the
purpose of utilizing un':omiitted funds and risking implementation delays y&U
beyond the original closing date and sharp increases in prices.

S.          Proiect Backaround
1.         Sector Dewelopment Obiectives. The project was prepared and
appraised for the northern governorates (the foruer Yemen Arab Republic)
during 1982, when the Second Five-Year Plan (1982-1986) was launched. Tbh
country had grown during the 1970. from an isolated and highly traditional.
country with a very low national inco m, derived almost exclusively from
agriculture, to one characterized by very rapid economic growth in the =odmzc
sector, fuelled by remittances from migrant workers and grants and transfer
payments frcm neighboring states, notably Saudi Arabia. During this period,
primary school-age enrollment rose from about 125,000 to almost 600,000,
representing 49 percent of the school-age population. A diversified secondary
school system was developed and the University of Sana,a was established. In
spite of these progressive enrx &.ent statistics, the lack of modern education
facilities prior to 1970 had resulted in a very high illiteracy rate of 79
percent by 1979.
2.          During the early 1980., the balance of payments deteriorated as
the demands on Government expenditures grew at a rapid pace in connection with
its goals to establish essential physical infrastructure, develop the
agricultural sector and improve social services, while at the same time
Government revenues, mainly custom duties, increased quite slowly, The
growth of school enrollments and the education sector budget were particularly
significant, as tho Govermment realized that, in the absence of a rapid
expansion of the school system, the trained manpower urgently raquired for
national development could not be produced. The necessary expansion of the
school system necessitated increased expenditures on education and the



2-
importation of large numbers of expatriate staff. The Goveriments choice of
expanding the school system as rapidly as possible and accepting the need for
Increased budgetary support for education was critical in resolving the major
education issues facing the country at the time, namely: (a) a shortage of
Yemeni school teachere; (b) impediments to the flow of studento through the
system; and (c) inadequate financing for education.
3.         Policy Context.  The project was timely ar,2 wipported the
objectives of the Second Five-Year Plan which were qu..: ambitious and
necessitated a major transfer of resources from other o.c,..ors to invest in
human capital. The plan called for& (a) improving the twuality of primaxy
education through extension and improvement of the training of teachers,
increased provision of educational materials, and further provision of
appropriately equipped classrooms; (b) extending and improving Yemeni teacher
training to includes a new approach to training of teachers and including iL-
service training for existing teachers, new institutions in rural areas for
primary school teachers to meet the large deficit in rural teachers,
particularly for girls schools; (c) expanding efforts to eradicate adult
illiteracy and to provide more basic skills training for adults in rural areas
by expanding the number of DTCs and the number of village units; (d)
overhauling the administration of education through a review of the existing
structure with a view to improving efficiency and a long-term program of staff
training and upgrading.
4.           D a's ongoing strategy for the education sector supported these
broad objectives that would sustain the previous investments for the forxer
northern govern'rates made under the First and Second Education projects
(Credits 421 and 611-YAR). These projects provided support for expanding
teacher traininq, established training programs for skilled workers and
middle-level technicians, and introduced the basic training scheme; continued
support and assistance to the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the improveent
of school administration functions and strengthening the local capacity at the
FIU/SBU to design and supervise the construction of school buildings as well
as the management of projects. Moreover, the evaluation of the basic training
scheme proposed under the Fifth Education project (Credit 1340-YEM) provided a
mechanism to review the operation of the DTCs and to recommend ways and mens
suitable for ensuring the effectiveness of the Borrower's program of non-
formal comiumity-based education. The preinveutment studies provided the
basic design for further institutions financed under subsequent IDA projects.
C.          Project Obiective and QomMonents
5.          Prpoect Objectives.  The objectives of the project included
assisting the Government in its goal of building up the stock of YImni
teachers through a first 'tranche' of PTTIs in rural areas. It also included
further support for the DTC network of basic training nd literacy centers for
mn and wOmen in rural areas and provided a ET?. To accomplish thse broad
targets, the project focused on:
(a)  increasing the supply of Yemeni primary school teacher by
expanding teacher training and improving the quality of the YOt



teaching force through revised curricula for PTTXU; and
(b)  increasing literacy and the acquisition of basiv vocational
okills relating to agriculture, village and community life,
traditional crafts ard home and family life for rural adolescent
and adult men and women.
6.          Prolect Comnonents.  At appraisal, the project consisted of the
following components:
(a) construction, equipment and furn=.ture for: four PTTIs and
three DTCs;
(b) a BIT comprising five front line units to assist in funding
local development activities with a training element. The
facility supported construction, equipment and furnishing and the
operatir7 coats of DTC activitieso and
(c) TA related to the improvement of teacher training curricula
and management, and further support for the PIU/SBU including
fellowship training and two studies.
7.         When substantial cost underruns (about US$3.0 million) were
realized in 1986 due to a favorable exchange rate b .ween the US Dollar and
the Yemeni Rhal as well as a highly competitive construction industry,
Government requested and IDA approved the inclusion of three additional PTTVr,
in 1987 (at Dajil, Kadab and Odein in the Hodeidah, Tais and Ibb
governorates). Two of these additional PTTXB were later cancelled due to
difficultiAs in finalising their tenders and the third experienced
construction delays which delayed its completlon beyond the project closing
date, forcing the Government to finance it on its own. In mid-1989, an
addltlonal US$O.S5 millLon, identified as project cost underruns, were
utillzed to finance the furnLture and equipment for seven schools which had
been financed under earlLer IDA credits for the Yemen Arab Republic (the First
and Second Education Projects - Credits 421 and 611-YAR). These schools are
being rehabilitated under the Sixth Education Project (Credit 1470-YEN)
D.          Proiect Deioan and Organzation
8.          The project was designed and organized to respond to the goals of
the Second live-Year Plan (1982-1986), wlth specific regard to improving
teacher trainLng, increasing the literacy rate in rural areas and providing
basic vocational and other skills training.  These interventLons ware timely
and assisted in meeting the identified needs of the sector. The project was
prepared by the  overnment wlth IDA assistance and incorporated sao  of the
key targets of national development, particularly with regard to the
preparation for Y_enniation of the countrys teachig force and the reduction
of expatriate as1sitance in the managemnt and devlopment of projects. In
ths respwet, the project provlded for considerable fellowship training for
PlO staff, which was completed successfully.



-4-
9.         The design concepts underlying the individual componezts were
appropriate when the project was prepared and continue to be relevant at the
project's aompletion. They ares
(a) The Primar -Teagher Training Ingtitutes f0=T111, which were
introduced under the First and Second Education Projects (Credits
421 and 611-YAR), were included under the Fifth Education project,
wlth the aim of increasing the supply and quality of Yemeni
teachers through the oetablj*hment, equipping and furnishing of
teacher-training facilities in rural areas. These areas were
carefully selected and three new PTTIs for boys and one for girls
were constructed. It was decided that the boys, PTTIs would
include boarding accommodations for about 90 percent of the
expected enrollment (which would facilitate the enrollment of boys
living outside the immediate location of the schools). There was,
on the other hand, no need for boarding facilities for the girls,
due to the institute's location in a governorate capital and the
preference that girls reside with families rather than stay in a
boarding facility. Development of the PTTI curriculum for the new
five-year training program specifically designed for prospective
teachers was also identified as a vital part of the plan for
improving the primary teacher-training system. In this
connection, TA (expert services) was providnd under the project
for the Directorate of Teacher Training, to coordinate the
curricula revisions proposed by the team of consultants.
(b)  District Trainlna Centers (DTCs). Based on the successful
experience of the DTCs which were financed under the First and
Second 2ducation projects, they were again included under the
Fifth Education project, to expand training and educational
opportunities for the non-literate adolescent and adult population
in rural areas. The three centers financed provided literacy
classes and featured intensive vocational skills training in
subject areas such as carpentry, automotive mechanics,
electronics, welding, plumbing, and agricultural extension. These
training activities were to be monitored by a local board at the
district or community level, which in turn was to report to the
National Board for Non-Porml Education, originally formed under
the First and Second Education projects and composed of senior WOE
personnel.
(C) Te Basic Training FaciltY was initiated under the Second
Education project, whereby a basic training fund was set up to
establish village  front-lne' unlts ln areas surrounding the main
enaters. The concept of the 'front-line' unit was well conceivWd
and proved to be beneficial to the rural areas. However, the
units were designed without hostels, which was somewhat
disadvantageous in view of their remoteness in relation to the
areas they were intended to serve. Moreover, their programs have
ben standadized, while, in retrospect, there should have been
ore flexibility and variety in the courses offered to better suit
the local needs and demands of the surrounding communities.



- 5 -
(d) The Taqhnical Agsiosance component was particularly critical
to the success of the Government's plans to improve and Yemnniu
the teaching force so as to reduce the substantial drain on
Government resources caused by the excessive use of expatriate
teachers. Moreover, an opportunity was provided for PIU staff to
be trained so that they could assume full responsibility for
project management and the various tasks associated with the NOR
8IBU. As a result, PSU expatriate support was planned during the
implementation phase of the project.
10.        the project design and organization incorporated the lessons
learned during the implementation of the previous projects in the education
sector, which included: (a) the selection of a management agoncy to impleaent
the project's TAt and (b) avoidance of the use of short-term specaliats for
ad-hoc assignments. Most importantly, the project provided suetainability for
the programs introduced under previous projects and continued these programs
to their full development.
B.          Proiect lmolementation
11.        The oriqinal components were completed satisfactorily.  The main
variances in the planned versus actual implementation of components relate to
the time taken to complete (a) the civil works (due to contractors' financial
difficulties and the lack of a price escalation clause for civil works
contracts); and (b) procurement of equipment and furniture for the various
institutes financed under the credit. Considerable delay occurred when USAID
decided not to proceed with its original intention of cofinancqng the credit's
TA in support of the PT?T curriculum-development plan.
12.        Some of the variances were unavoidable, such as the unanticipated
favorable exchange rate in the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Ye  i
Rial which proved to be a worthwhile opportunity for financing the
construction of additional now PTTis and the rehabilitation of equipment and
furniture for other institutions financed under the first and second education
projects. The three new PTTm., which were added to the project in late 1987
after unutilized project funds becAme available, could not be completed,
however, due to lengthy delays in the approval of civil works tenders by the
High Tender Board (HTh) and, as a result, two of the additional PTT s ws=d
cancelled (Dajil and Xadas) and a third at Odoin was not fLnished by the
project's closing date. The difficulties experienced in the approval process
for tenders could have been minimized through a closer working relationship
between the PfU and aTn personnel.
13.        The country's unification wa clearly not foreseen when the
project's implementation phae wa planned. However, lt did not adversely
affect the progres of project activities, as might have been expected due to
the complexity of merging the two education systems. Intead, Government
officials and IDA quickly mobilized their efforts to adjust the PTi structure
to meet the revised priorities of the system.



14.        The project risks identified at appraisal were minimized during
the project's implementation as: {a) the PTT! curricula was modified even
further than envisaged at appraisal so as to better reflect the priorities of
the northern and southern governorates (the unified Yemen) and, moreover, the
potential risk of low enrollments at the PTTs did not materialize; instead,
additional PTIrs were needed and there is currently serious overcrowding at
some of these facilities; (b) the DTCs and the IT? continued to be successful
in providing training in rural areas, although their administration did not
develop an expected due to the inability of the National Board for Non-Formal
Education to manage the system effectively or provide the necessary policy
planning ^,*isaged for the BTF at appraisal, particularly after the country'f
unification process when the bureaucracies of the two countries merged.
15.        The actions and decisions which impacted most on the project's
implemxntation relate to IDA's approval of the Government's request to finance
additional PTTlS, which necessitated extensions to the original closing date
of the credit. This decision did not prove to be as effective as envisaged,
as serious delays occurred, not only because of the HTB approval process, but
also because civil works were delayed when contractors encountered financial
difficulties because of the devaluation of the Yemeni Rial and the subsequent
steep increase in the cost of imported materials. In this connection, IDA
also agreed to finance the cost of imported materials to facilitate the
construction of the institutes.
3--        Proiect Results
16.        The main results of the project are highlighted in Part III of
this report (Statistical Information). The data indicate that the original
components, although seriously delayed beyond appraisal estimates, were
successfully completed; namely, the construction, equipping and furnishing of
the four original PTT1s, the three DTCs and five front line units for the BTF,
as well as TA related to the improvement of teacher training curricula and
support for training at the PIU/SBU. The completion of the main objectives of
the project significantly contributed to the improvement of the PTTI system
through improved training and the Yemenization of project management at the
PIU.
17.        Civil works for the original institutions were finished before the
project's original completion date (June 1989) while equipment and furniture
procurement was delayed to c.oincide with the completion and hading-over of
the institutes. TA was packaged during the latter half of the project's
implementation (a contract with the AMIDEAST to manage the TA was signed in
July 1990) and fellowship arrangements and the use of expert services were
efficLently monitored. Specifically, about twenty PW staff were trained at
American, Igyptian and Canadian unlverLties in project management-related
subjects. The original nine experts who supported the PIU at its inception
were all replaced by Yemeni personnl by the project's closing. Two studLe
were finished as planned - an evaluation of the DTCs and feasibility work to
support future project preparation.

18.         The three PTTIa added during the project's implementation were not
completed due to lengthy delays in the approval of their tenders. The
completed institutions were well constructed, but in some cases have been
subject to severe over-crowding and inadequate maintenance. The girls' PTTZ
at Hajjah (built under the project) La being used by the University of Sana'a,
as it was agreed that the older existing facility would continue to be used as
a girls' PTTI while the newly-built school would better serve the town if used
as a faculty of the university. This allowed the young women of Hajjah to
attend classes there rather than leave the town, which is not acceptable from
a cultural standpoint.
19.         The three DTCa have been functioning satisfactorily since late
1987, with about nine trades being taught. Their continued efficiency will
depend primarily on the maintenance and upkeep of teaching aides and equipment
and improved transportation to the centers from the main districts. The front
line units were not provided with boarding facilities, which was shortsighted
in view of their distance from the rural communities. Training provided under
the project in support of the PIU will significantly assist in building
institutional capacity within the MOE to manage and implement new projects and
programs.
0.          Proiect Sustainability
20.         The Government is fully committed to human resource development,
particularly in the area of primary teacher training. It has conducted an
extnsaive review of the PTTX system to ensure ies future viability and has
adopted rec-  mendations to rationalize the system to meet the current needs of
the unified country. The project has increased the stock of primary teachers
(by about 1000), which will reduce the dependence on foreign teachers and free
up valuable resources for future investments in the country's education and
training system. A comprehensive preventive maintenance study (financed under
the Teacher Training Project - Credit 1773-YEM) is now being conducted to
ensure the upkeep of institutions.
H.          IDA Performance
21.         From inception, IDA project-management staff monitored the,
progress of project activities consistently while providing assistance to the
Government in formulating action plane to ensure effective and efficient
execution of the projects components. rDa endeavored to maintain the same
supervision and monitorLng team associated with the project during its
implementation phase and this was successfully achieved - t! a task manager
remained the same from the third year of the project's implsmentation cycle
through Its closing six years later. This consistency in IDA project
management facilitated the dialogue with senior-level Government officials on
pertinent iplmentation iLsues and solution and fostered a good working
relationship that enabled prompt resolution of problems, and the receptivity
of suggestions to improve project outcomes. As a result, the project was
restructured on more than one occasion to meet changin Government priorities,
particularly when the country was unified in 1990.



22.         In this regard, senior IDA Management supported project management
(both IDA staff and local government managers), acted promptly on requests for
project amendments, and actively endeavored to facilitate credit amendments to
utilize uncommitted funds brought about by cost underruns and the need to
adjust for a new national climate following the unification of the country.
The unification brought about the need to restructure the PTTI system and
overhaul and upgrade the institutions financed under earlier IDA credits.
Moreover, IDA management agreed to release unexpended project funds to expand
activities in conformity with project objectives as well as extend project
closing dates to permit the completion of project activities. IDA also
facilitated the development of programs through the use of its own staff
expertise - a senior procurement advisor assisted the Government in attempting
to resolve civil works procurement issues in connection with price escalation;
senior disbursement personnel conducted a seminar for local staff; and a
senior ILO specialist, at IDA initiative, assisted PIU staff in the
preparation of equipment lists based on the revised PTTI curricula. IDA
maintained a schedule of not less than two supervision missions per year at
mid-point in the project's implementation phase to ensure project viability.
IDA staff used these occasions to share, inter alia, its management and
implementation expertise with PIU personnel.
I.          Borrower's Performance
23.         A good deal of effort was exercised by the Borrower in ensuring
that project effectiveness and start-up experienced minimal delays. However,
implementation of a critical aspect of the project's objectives was seriously
delayed when the Government did not indicate their dissatisfaction during
credit Negotiations I with USAID's choice of an American university as the
contractor for expert services in connection with the PTTI curriculum
development instead of using Arabic speaking consultants from the region. IDA
supervision missions highlighted this problem from the project's inception and
reported delays by USAID in releasing the funding for this activity due to
lack of agreement between USAID and the Government on the use of expert
services for the task. The planned funding by U3AID for the TA component
failed to materialize and the curriculum for the PTTI was later developed
under a management services contract with the AMIDRAST as part of a packaged
TA program.
24.         The MOs responded expeditiously to IDA's recommendations in
connection with issues raised by the various supervision missions. This
greatly facilitated the project'. implementation progress and contributed to
the success of its components. On the other hand, the procurement process for
civil works was delayed because of cumbersome bureaucratic approval processe
and actual disbursement performance was well below appraisal estimates. Al
credit covenants were complied with.
1J it was clear from the agreed Mlnutes of Negotiations of the credit,
that the Xastern Michigan University would develop the curriculum
for the PTTIs.



J.          Borrower-IDA Relations
25.         A close working relationship between IDA eupervision staff and the
PIU greatly assisted in the efficiency of project monitoring. This was
possible because of the consistency of the IDA project-management team members
who participated in supervision missions and managed the Yemen portfolio of
projects under implementation for the last six years of the project's
Lmplementation. Moreover, in spite of absences for training abroad, financed
under the project's TA component, the PIU team was well-coordinated throughout
the project's implementation period and new team members were trained
satisfactorily to take over project management duties while othera were being
trained overseas.
26.         IDA's effectiveneas was greatly enhanced by the willingness of
senior MOB and Ministry of Planning and Development (MOPD) personnel to meet
with missions and carefully review IDA recommendations on project issues and
activities. The IDA and Government teams were always willing to listen to
each other and accommodate reasonable requests. This was particularly useful
in view of the changes in administrative and managerial personnel at the
ministries during the project's implementation period. The Government's
cooperation with IDA was exemplary and IDA management at middle and senior
levels consistently supported the Government's requests and suggestions for
modification of the project to the satisfaction of all parties. Moreover,
Government officials closely followed IDA's suggestions for improving project
performance, particularly with respect to the implementation of agreed action
plans.
K.          Consultinx Services
27.         At the inception of the project, the use of consultant services
was delayed due to difficulties experienced in obtaining USAID cofinancing to
develop and prepare the curriculum for the PTTIs as originally planned. This
was caused primarily because of reluctance by USAID to release the funds
without a firm decision between the concerned parties on the source of the
consultants to be employed. The USAID cofinancing did not materialize,
thereby delaying the preparation of the PTTI curriculum by several years. It
was later completed under the management services contract between the
Government and the AMIDEAST. USAID preferred that the Rastern Michigan
University be utilized due to their experienco with the Yemeni educational
system, while the Government preferred to use experts from Arabic speaking
countries.
28.         There was considerable reluctance on the part of the Government to
use foreign experts who were considered to be too expensive. However, during
the latter years of the project's implementation, Government agreed to
'package' all TA under the project (along with TA from the Sixth Bducation
project and the Teacher Training project - Credits 1470 and 1773-YEN) under a
management services contract with the AMIDEAST. This step greatly improved
the development of project-related TA activities and made its implementatioc
more efficLent and effective.

L.          Protect Documentation and Data
29.         Project records at IDA headquarters, including the working papers
of the preparation missions, as well as project monitoring information
obtained at the PIU in Sana'a, were very well documented and proved invaluable
during project supervision and evaluation. Due to consistent and timely
supervision by TDA.personnel and the participation of all PIU staff, including
senior ministerial officials during the supervision process, all necessary
documentation and data were readily available when needed. The SAR proved to
be an effective and useful tool for all concerned officials in the field and
ID= staff who managed the project during its implementation. Moreover, the
Credit Agreement was clear and concise, thereby facilitating the
implementation process, particularly when amendments to the credit description
were proposed as the scope of the project increased.
30          Progress reports, prepared by the PIU, were well-documented and
timely. This greatly facilitated the work of the supervision missions. The
various aide-memoires prepared by MDA staff and consultants during the
project's implementation, as well as relevant Government reports, were also
very useful in monitoring the project and documenting its implementation
experience. Data for the PCR was well-prepared and compiled by PIu personnel,
along with the information provided at the project sites.
M.          Conclusions and Lessons Learned
31.         Implementation of the project provided the opportunity to learn
that:
(a)  there are trade offs between adding new components for the
purpose of utilizing uncommitted funds and risking
implementation delays well beyond the original closing date,
and sharp increases in prices;
(b)  many of the civil works difficulties experienced during
project implementation resulted from unexpected steep
increase in local prices due to the devaluation of the
Yemeni Rial. These problems may have been minimized if
price escalation clauses were utilized for the civil works
contracts. Government, however, rejected this options
(d)  the importance of Arabic-speaking experts from the region
for project TA sbould have been considered and agreements
reached at the project design stage. Disagreements later
with the cofizancier - in this instance USAID - resulted Ii
cancellation of funds.

PART rI: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION FROM T=E BgCOVER' S PERSPECTIVE
PROJECT IM2LEMENTATION
32.        The original project components were in general executed,
delivered and operated by end users in a satisfactory manner.
33.        Civil works contracts had experienced certain difficulties at the
start and final construction stages due to the devaluation of the Yemeni Rial
against freely convertible currencies, and as a result, cost of imported
building materials rose steeply. With no adjustment rate of devaluations
and/or fluctuations allowed in civil works contracts, progress of works sloved
down and standards fell but not by the same rate of price increases, partly
because of the provision of building materials to the affected contractors by
the Bank.
34.        The technical assistance was awarded as one package which proved
to be the most practical way of carrying out the technical assistance
components. The Education Project Implementation Unit has benefitted from the
support provided in the project. About twenty staff members went for
specialized training to Canada, the USA and Bgypt.
35.        As mentioned earlier, the project had experienced some
difficulties when unexpectedly, the cost of building materials rose due to the
devaluation of the Yemeni Rial. Plenty of the time and efforts were
generously devoted by Government and Bank Officials to resolve this problem
and reduce its impact on the related contractors, not only the projects
involved in this credit but also in the Sixth Education project.
36.        World Bank staff members responded and extended cooperation to the
Yemeni officials during the project implementation period, whether in regard
to resolving implementation problems or utilization of the savings available
which contributed to the successful project implementation and to better
utilization of credit funds for the following additional components:
(1) Constructing, equipping and furnishing of three PTTis (only one
PTTI is executed);
(2)   Additional equipment for five institutions built under earlier IDA
projects.
37.        In addition, the package type contract for the technical
assistance component was accounted - otherwise not possible - for expediting
disbursement of the uncommitted funds.
38.        Civil works contracts are usually the main reasons for project
completion delays.

nd assisted the Government with the diversification of secondary education In the area  of
aericulture and livestock training and also with the training of Governrent empLoyees at
the National Institute of Administrative Services.  The Fourth Education Project (Cr 1203)
in the aeumt of US$12 millon was appraised in 1981 and assisted the Government In
diversifying secondary education and financing a facility at the University of Senae&. It
also established the Education Resoarch and Oevelopment Center which assists the Government
in addressing education issus and in developing palicies. Both projects ware ceopleted
suc:cessfully.

FACILITy 3
Cofmentst TUB PTTIs include enrollees of both the three-year and five-year
programs.
1/  The bulk of these students (3644) are at the Dhamar MTI, which is
seriously overcrowded with some classes consisting of 100 students. Its
boarding facilities are designed to house 180 students but currently house a
minimum of 280 students.
2V Each DTC has the potential capacity of train about 2,400 people per year
by providing two four-month skills courses annually in two shifts.
I/ Only one of the S Front Units is functioning at full capacity at this
time.
