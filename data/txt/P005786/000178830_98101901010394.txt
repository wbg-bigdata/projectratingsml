YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic Background
1.01     In 1970, the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) was an isolated and nignly
traditional country, with a very low national income derived almost
exclusively from agriculture.  Tne conclusion of tne civil war in that year
permitted a start to be made on the pressing task of developing the country.
Since 1970, much has been achieved: for example, a central administration has
been established, a small but thriving modern sector of the economy exists,
and many infrastructural projects have been completed. Accomplishments in the
human resources sector are equally dramatic. In 1971, 125,000 children were
enrolled in primary schools of some sort, representing 12% of the school-age
population. By 1981, this figure had risen to almost 600,000 and represented
49% of the school-age population. A diversified secoadary school system is in
existence and Sana'a University is now well established. However, an
inevitable legacy of the lack of modern education facilities prior to 1970 is
a very high illiteracy rate (79% in 1979), and the development of the
education and training system to its present state has oeen a major challenge
to the Government.
1.02     The recency of modern development in the YAR is indicated by tne fact
that it was not until 1974 that formal economic planning began, with the
Three-Year Development Program, 1974-76, which was followed by a more
ambitious First Five-Year Plan, 1976-81. The emphasis in both these plans was
on the establishment of essential physical infrastructure, the development of
agriculture, and the improvement of social services. While the period 1975 to
1980 was a relatively successful one in terms of economic growth, tne living
conditions of a majority of the population remain inadequate; access to safe
water is available for no more than 17% of the population, life expectancy is
presently around 42 years, infant mortality rates are exceptionally high, and
the adult literacy rate is in the region of 21%.
1.03     The Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86) has been launched at a time when
the economy is growing less quickly. The years 1975-78 saw very rapid
economic growth in the modern sector, fuelled by remittances from migrant
workers and grants and transfer payments from neighboring states, notably
Saudi Arabia. However, since 1978, the balance of payments has deteriorated
dramatically; imports have soared while exports and worKers' remittances are
now declining. The Government's budgetary position has deteriorated markedly:
the demands on the Government have grown inexorably, while tne revenues,
mainly customs duties, have been increasing only slowly.



-2-
1.04      The growth of school enrollments and tne educatjor^; -I
therefore, of heightened significance.  Tne Government faces tLle
without expanding the school system it cannot produce trained rnnn>-nu:
urgently required for national development.  However, the resulc if
the school system is to increase the cost of education and requires
importation of large numbers of expatriate staff.  Government policV,
to expand the school system as rapidly as possible, and to accept
increased budgetary support for education.  Much of the recurre-.t e   a 
budget is accounted for by the salaries of teachers, and tule highi
of expatriate teachers in the YAR exacerbates the problem (para.
Recent Developments in the Education and Training System
1.05      Education Administration.  The Ministry of Education (MOE)
responsibility for all aspects of formal education below universi-y .e,
including provision and administration of teachers, location of schools,
development of curricula and instructional materials, administration oI
nation-wide examinations, educational planning and organization of the
inspectorate.  It shares management of these tasks with governorate edAur -.
offices. The General Directors of the Governorate Offices, together wit
ministry officials, form an Advisory Council to the MOE which particiDates
setting policy. The 11 governorate offices of education have considera-le
influence on education within the governorates, at least in part because o
their close relationship with the Local Development Associations (LXDAs              T
LDAs are the focus for local development in the YAR, and consist of the L
community and their leaders. An LDA network exists throughout the YAR, and
their local organizations are represented nationally by the Confederation of
Yemeni Development Associations (CYDA) which has its headquarters in Sana'a.
In recent years, the MOE has consolidated its control over some functions tbac
have, in the past, been shared with the governorates, such as decisions aboul
location of schools, in order to rationalize the functioning of the system.
The MOE has begun a five-year program of inservice training for its
administrative staff, which will take place in the YAR as well as abroad
Technical assistance (TA) for this program is being provided by funds in the
third education project (Credit 915-YAR) and through a United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) project of institutional support to the
MOE.
1.06      Primary Education (Grades 1-6).  Enrollment in primary schools nas
been growing rapidly in the YAR. Since 1978/79, the annual rate of increase
has been 33%.  Providing classrooms, teachers, and materials has been a majo^i
challenge in recent years and not surprisingly the ratio of teachers to
students declined from 1;43 in 1978/79 to 1;49 in 1981/82.  The average nusz:b
of students per school rose from 147 to 157 over the same period.
1.07      In 1981/82, about 12% of primary school students were girls.  While
up very slightly from 11%  in 1971/72, this figure remains the lowest in the
world. It is government policy to provide schooling equally for boys and
girls, and mixed classes in primary schools are not uncommon. Although
strongly embedded social customs limit girls' participation in education,
their numbers in schools grew by 27% from 1979/80 to 1980/81.



- 3 -
1.08     Secondary Education (Grades 7-9 and 10-12).  Lower secondary schools,
called preparatory schools in YAR, are open to all students who have passed
the primary school leaving examination. Almost all students at this level
follow a general program. Exceptions are those wno attend vocational training
centers (VTCs) or who enter the new five-year teacher training program
(para. 1.19). Enrollment in lower and upper secondary has been increasing Dy
20% annually from 1978/79 to 1981/82. Enrollments in lower and upper
secondary in 1981/82 were 35,200 and 10,300, respectively, representing 7.2%
and 2.5% of the corresponding school-age group.
1.09     A variety of specialized schools and programs exist at the upper
secondary level, including a health manpower training institute, two technical
schools, two agricultural schools, a livestock school, and commercial and
teacher training programs. (One technical school, the agriculture schools,
the livestock school, and five teacher training institutes have been built
with IDA financing.)
1.10     Most of the specialized programs have only recently oegun (or are yet
to begin). All of them have experienced recruiting difficulties as a result
of a shortage of eligible students and the higher prestige of the
pre-university programs offered in general secondary schools. Vigorous
recruiting, including use of incentives, expansion (albeit slow) of the
eligible pool of entrants, and good employment records of graduates from some
specialized programs are working to alleviate the recruiting problems.
1.11     University of Sana'a.  The University has five faculties:  Commerce,
Law (Sharia), Arts, Science, and Education which, in 1980/81, enrolled 4,300
students, i.e., about 1% of the corresponding age group. Two new faculties,
medicine and engineering, are being established, the latter with IDA support.
The University, while well staffed, depends heavily on expatriate faculty.
The College of Education, which in 1980/81 had an enrollment of 700, trains
secondary teachers. It has recently undergone reorganization, introducing a
credit system and better methods of tracking progress of individual students.
These measures are expected to decrease the time required to receive a
degree. Also, the College now requires students receiving financial support
to maintain an adequate attendance record. Shortly after this policy was
instituted, about 200 students left the College; the long-run effect is
expected to be a considerable improvement in the efficiency of the program and
the quality of graduates.
*            1.12     Out-of-School Education.  Illiteracy in the YAR is widespread.  The
1975 census reported that the illiteracy rate amongst the population aged 10
to 45 was 74% for males and 97X for females. The formal school system is
*            expanding rapidly, but without affecting the educational status of those too
old to enter school. This low level of literacy is a major constraint to the
development of the country, and not least in agriculture, the sector from
which most Yemenis derive a living. Basic skills training for adults in rural
areas has become more important since modern technology is now an integral
part of the rural economy. With the advent of roads have come vehicles,
pumps, tractors, and power generating plants. Maintaining this equipment
calls for skills new to rural Yemen.



-4-
1.13     In response to tnis need, the MOE's department of non-formal
education began in 1976 a program of establishing district training centers
(DTCs) in small towns and literacy training centers in villages which provide
literacy classes and basic skills training for men and women.
1.14     Under the first and second education projects (Credits 421-YAR and
611-YAR), seven DTCs were established at Zabid, Baijil, Hajja, El Kaida,
Amran, Saadah and Al Beida. Each center has a capacity for training in small
rural communities surrounding the center. It took time for the DTC network to
operate at full effectiveness and for the opportunities available to be
exploited fully by the local population. The concept of locally based,
out-of-school training centers was new, both for government officials and for
potential participants. Establishing the DTCs and the village units was,
initially, physically difficult, as a result of the relative inaccessibility
of several of these centers in the late 1970s. Despite these difficulties,
and as a result of the diligence and enthusiasm of the MOE's Department of
Non-Formal Education and the staff in the centers, in the two years of
effective operation, 17,000 persons have participated in the program. Courses
in agricultural skills, women's crafts and home economics, health and
nutrition, as well as literacy and basic skills training in carpentry,
electricity and automotive mechanics have, and are being provided in remote
rural areas through the DTC network. Of the 1,800 completing the basic skills
training courses, over 200 are known to have been employed by the Government
or industry in the district. The majority has moved into self-employed
categories or are applying their newly-acquired skills to their work
environment. In addition, 10% of the 10,000 literacy students completed
sufficient courses to qualify them to enter the first grade of lower secondary.
1.15     The program is now well established both in the MOE and in the
participating communities, and is in high demand amongst communities at
present without facilities. Several multilateral and bilateral donors,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteer aid organizations use the
network of DTCs and village units as a framework through which to transmit
other social or educational programs. For example, the United Nations'
Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) uses the DTCs as centers to train local
instructors for its literacy work. The forthcoming literacy campaign, to be
executed in conjunction with the United Nations' Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Arab League Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (ALESCO) will also use the DTCs and village units as
training centers.
Educational Issues
1.16     The Government has accomplished a rapid expansion of the education
system throughout the 1970s from a very small base. The pace of expansion,
the growing demands on the system from the population, and the increasing
diversity and complexity of the educational system have presented the
Government with new challenges. The major issues facing the Government are:
(a) shortage of Yemeni school teachers; (b) impediments to the flow of
students through the system; and (c) education finance.



1.17     Teacher Training.  The YAR has relied on expatriate teachers for the
development of the modern education system. From 1978 onwards, the number of
expatriates grew considerably, from 3,360 in 1978/79 to 5,500 in 1979/80 and
to some 14,000 in 1981/82. As a result, the Government has turned with
renewed emphasis to building up the indigenous teacher training system. At
the core of the system is a three-year upper secondary level (grades 10-12)
program, located in major cities throughout the country. This program was
supplemented by a three-year lower secondary (grades 7-9) program, also
located in major cities. Neither program produced an adequate number of
graduates to meet the demand for teachers in the country. In an effort to
increase the number of Yemeni teachers, an attempt was made to condense the
three-year program into 24 months (grades 10-11) which proved too arduous.
Moreover, the three-year lower secondary program (grades 7-9) produced
graduates who were judged to be too young and too poorly prepared to begin
teaching immediately. Attrition rates were unduly high in this program also.
As a result, and as a means of increasing the quality and quantity of primary
school teachers, the three-year lower secondary (grades 7-9) program is being
phased out and replaced by the new five year post-primary program which is
being run in conjunction with the existing upper secondary program.
1.18     The teacher training program has experienced severe problems in
recruiting students. Several factors have contributed to this. The most
important are the very small output from lower secondary schools, in
comparison with the number of available upper secondary level places; the
attractiveness of the incentives provided by specialized secondary schools in
such fields as agriculture, technical subjects and communications; and the
higher prestige and financial rewards of careers other than teaching.
1.19     The new five-year program represents the latest stage in an evolving
system of teacher training. It would try to integrate eventually basic
teaching principles with subject content appropriate to teaching at the
primary level. Establishing the new program in existing facilities has
already begun. The Government expects the new five-year post primary program
to recruit an adequate number of students for several reasons: (a) rural
schools will draw on populations that have not yet been reached: boys and
girls whose parents are unwilling to have them move to cities to continue
their education; (b) the teacher training institutes will be the only
post-primary schools in the rural areas to provide incentives; and (c) in each
location, the Government plans to establish a teacher training program before
installing any new general lower secondary programs.
1.20     A new teacher law, which became effective in September 1981,
substantially improved the conditions of service for teachers. It:
(a) grants an incentive allowance of 20% of basic salary, in addition to all
other allowances provided for by law and in addition to all otner occupation
and specialization allowances granted to government employees; (b) creates the
position of senior teacher, with a salary supplement; (c) authorizes teachers
to take study leaves with full salary and allowances; (d) authorizes inservice
training and study tours abroad; (e) provides salary increments for completion
of training courses; and (f) exempts male teachers from military duty. Both
the Government and IDA expect that the combination of better targeted
recruitment, incentives and improved terms of service will make teaching a
more attractive career and improve the drawing power of teacher training
programs. Preliminary data for 1982/83 indicate that the new incentives are
proving effective in attracting students to the teacher training programs.



- 6 -
1.21     Yemenis who take advantage of the new program and who wish to enjoy
exemption from military services are expected to work as teachers for a
minimum of five years. While this rule will be difficult to enforce in the
YAR, it is expected that wastage from the new program will be low.
1.22     Despite these efforts to increase the supply of Yemeni teachers, the
demand for teachers is likely to be higher than the rate at which Yemenis can
be trained. Table 1 shows that the number of expatriate teachers is expected
to rise to 22,500 by 1986/87 from its 1980/81 level of 9,200. This growth of
teachers has serious implications for the recurrent budget for education
(para. 1.26).

1.23     Flows Through the System.  The achievements of the MOE in increasing
the number of school children in school are tempered by the relative
inefficiency of the primary school system. Drop-out and repetition rates are
currently very high, and only about 15% of all first grade enrollees graduate
from the sixth grade. The ramifications of this situation are felt throughout
the educational system. In 1976/77, the number of school children in primary
school grade six was 11,800, which represented 6% of all primary school
enrollments. By 1980/81, their number had risen to 20,400, but that figure
still represented only 5% of all primary school enrollments. These small
proportions in the sixth grade largely reflect the rapid inceases in the lower
grades of primary schools.
1.24     The high attrition rates have several causes.  Standards of education
are low in terms of teacher quality; provision of educational materials is
limited; classrooms are overcrowded; and the pupil teacher ratios are high
(49;1). Many primary schools are incomplete because facilities cannot
accommodate all six grades of primary schools. In 1980/81, only about 25% of
the primary schools offered six grades of instruction. About 50% of primary
students attend these complete schools; another 25% attend schools that have
four to five grades. The result of incomplete schools is to terminate



- 7-
prematurely the education of those children enrolled in them which in turn is
reflected in high drop-out rates. In addition, young boys leave school
prematurely to work on farms, and traditional attitudes to women's education
also probably account for some early leaving amongst girls.
1.25     The Government is attempting to remedy this inadequacy as rapidly as
feasible. The MOE is giving top priority in the school building program to
adding the one or two classrooms needed to complete these schools. In the
Second Five-Year Plan, no new primary schools will be built before the
additional classrooms required to complete schools are built; this will
substantially increase the number of children who have the opportunity to
complete primary schooling. The qualifications of teachers have improved
substantially as untrained Yemeni teachers are replaced by trained expatriate
teachers; the total number of teachers has risen dramatically in the past
three years, although the teacher pupil ratio has declined from 1;43 in
1978/79 to 1;49 in 1981/82 (para. 1.06). The Educational Materials Production
Center (EMPC) is now being upgraded and expanded. There is now every
likelihood that, taken together, these measures will improve retention rates.
However, it will be several years before improved retention rates translate
into significantly larger numbers in the post primary education system.
1.26     Education Finance.  Expenditure on education has risen dramatically
through the 1970s and mirrors the growth in school enrollment. By 1981,
education expenditures represented about 11.5% of all government expenditure
and were 5.3% of GNP. In 1981, education capital expenditures absorbed 9.7%
of the national capital expenditure budget and 13% of the national recurrent
budget. These data indicate that education has become a major item in
Government expenditure, and clearly educational expenditures will have to be
closely monitored in the future.
1.27     The present structure of school enrollment and the plan of the MOE
both indicate a growth in school enrollments of at least 11% annually
(Annex 1, Table 2). Moreover, further diversification and expansion is
envisaged at secondary and higher levels of education. If the targets of the
Second Five-Year Plan are realized, then by 1986 the Government will be
allocating a sum equivalent to about 12.3% of GNP to education, which would be
amongst the highest in the world. This target is attainable with external
support at the level the YAR has enjoyed over the past five years and which is
reasonable given the relatively low level of educational development at
present.
1.28     Total unit costs of education, which are US$317, US$616, and US$601
for primary, lower secondary and upper general secondary, respectively, are
high for three reasons:
(a)  Enrollments are low, the result of incomplete primary schools and
high rates of dropping out.
(b)  The education budget is financing both the capital costs and the
recurrent costs of education when other similar countries have an
already established stock of capital assets. This situation is the
result of the fact that the YAR commenced modern educational
development only recently.



- 8 -
(c) Teacher salaries are high compared with GNP per capita. As a
minimum, as of 1981, a teacher would earn US$8,000 per year, while a
teacher with an M.A. obtained overseas would earn US$16,000. These
salaries are 19 times and 37 times GNP per capita in 1981,
respectively. These high salaries paid to teachers reflect the
priority which the Government accords to the establishment of a
well-trained cadre of Yemeni teachers. These salary levels are
comparable with the private sector and compare favorably with
Government salaries.
1.29     The Second Five-Year Plan anticipates educational expenditure of
YRIs 2.3 billion, of which it is expected that 68% will be financed from
external sources.  The Government has collaborated with a wide range of
international agencies, such as IDA and the United Nations' Development
Programme (UNDP), and numerous bilateral agencies. Prominent amongst these
are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and USAID. The Government anticipates continuing to
work with external agencies and is optimistic that its ambitious development
and financing objectives will be achieved. However, it is essential that
steps be taken to limit the growing cost of education by using resources more
efficiently. The MOE has already begun taking some steps to lower unit costs
by ensuring contractual obligations of minimum acceptable class contact hours
for expatriate teachers, and by encouraging the recruitment and retention of
Yemeni teachers. A recent Bank study of education administration and finance
is proposing other measures to recover educational costs, such as charging
fees for educational materials used in school and introducing, albeit
gradually, user charges for education. This study and conclusions remain to
be discussed with the Government. The recommendations will be pursued in
follow-up projects after government officials have had sufficient time to
digest and reflect on them.
Educational Policy and Strategy
1.30     The educational objectives of the MOE in the Second Five-Year Plan
are ambitious and imply a major transfer of resources from other users to
investment in human capital. The program for the education sector outlined in
the Second Five-Year Plan comprises the following elements;
(a) improvement of the quality of primary education through extension and
improvement of the training of teachers, increased provision of
educational materials, and further provision of approriately equipped
classrooms;
(b) extension and improvement of Yemeni teacher training to include: a
new approach to training of teachers, including in-service training
for existing teachers, a post-secondary teacher training institute,
and new institutions in rural areas for primary school teachers;
(c) further development of vocational and technical training through
upgrading VTCs, upgrading and increasing the technical secondary
schools by re-equipping some schools and establishing a new technical
secondary school in Hodeidah;



-9-
(d)  provision of technician training at the post-secondary level in an
institute to be established in Sana'a;
(e)  diversification of university education to include an engineering
department, a medical school, and an agricultural department;
(f)  the expansion of efforts to eradicate adult illiteracy and to provide
more basic skills training for adults in rural areas by expanding the
number of DTCs and the number of village units; and
(g)  overhaul of the administration of education through a review of the
present structure with a view to improving efficiency and a long-term
program of staff training and upgrading which will take place within
the country and abroad.
1.31     Outside the MOE and the University, the National Institute for Public
Administration (NIPA) provides in-service training for government employees.
This type of training is an essential component of the Government's strategy
of improving and upgrading civil servants, and will be expanded in the future.
IDA Lending Strategy for Education and Training
1.32     IDA lending strategy to the YAR has reflected the Government's
priorities in establishing a modern education system from a very low base in
1972. Initially, IDA focussed on basic education, particularly teacher
training and basic skills and literacy training in rural areas. The first
education project (Credit 421-YAR for US$11.0 million, appraised in 1972 and
completed in 1980) provided support for expanding teacher training and
establishing training programs for skilled workers and middle-level
technicians and introduced the basic training scheme. According to the
conclusions of the completion report for the first education project (no
Project Performance Audit Report has yet been undertaken), the project also
assisted the MOE in the improvement of its school administration functions and
strengthened the local capacity to design and to supervise the construction of
school buildings. The second education project extended the initiatives of
the first project in teacher training and basic education. It established the
basic training fund as part of the basic training scheme. Tnis project was
completed satisfactorily in 1982 and a completion report is being prepared.
In the third education project (Credit 915-YAR for US$10 million, appraised in
1979), IDA assisted the Government with the diversification of secondary
education, to encompass agriculture and livestock practices training, and also
with the training of government employees at the National Institute for Public
Administration (NIPA).
1.33     The fourth education project (Credit 1203-YAR for US$12 million,
appraised in 1981) assisted the Government to diversify university education,
and financed an engineering faculty at Sana'a University.  It also established
the Educational Research and Development Center (ERDC) which will assist the
Government in addressing educational issues and in developing policies. In
order to encourage Yemenis to become teacher trainers, a supplementary fund
for their salaries was included in the project. The third and the fourth
projects are proceeding satisfactorily.



- 10 -
1.34     The Second Five-Year Plan was issued during 1982 and priority areas
for IDA lending in the education sector have been identified and agreed with
the Government. The first priority is that of basic education and teacher
training, with particular attention to the development of women In education
and employment in rural areas. The second is management training, which will
be achieved through further support of the Government's inservice training
facilities for men and women. A third is the extension of secondary and
post-secondary technical education.  Tnese priorities are consistent with
IDA's lending strategy and are reflected in this project as well as in
preceding projects.
1.35     The proposed fiftn project (an IDA Credit for US$10.0 million) would
assist the Government in its objective of building up the stock of Yemeni
teachers through a first "tranche" of PTTIs in rural areas. The proposed
project would also include further support for the DTC network of basic
training and literacy centers for men and women in rural areas and provide a
Basic Training Facility (BTF).

II. THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01     The proposed project is fully consistent with the Government s
development strategy for the education sector. It has the following main
objectives;
(a)  to increase the supply of Yemeni primary school teachers by expanding
teacher training and to improve the quality of the Yemeni teaching
force through revised curricula for PTTIs; and
(b)  to increase literacy and the acquisition of basic vocational skills
relating to agriculture, village and community life, traditional
crafts and home and family life for rural adolescent and adult men
and women.
2.02     The project would include the provision of:
(a)  construction, equipment and furniture for;

(b)  A Basic Training Facility (BTF) for assisting with funding local
development activities with a training element which includes
construction, equipment and furnishing and the operating costs of
District Training Center (DTC) activities;
(c)  Technical Assistance (TA) related to the improvement of teacher
training curricula and management, further support for the Project
Implementation Unit/School Building Unit (PIU/SBU) including
fellowship training, and a preinvestment study.
Primary Teacher Training Institutes (PTTIs)
2.03      This project item continues the support provided under the first and
second education projects (para. 1.32) and will enhance tne supply and quality
of Yemeni teachers by establishing teacher training facilities in rural



- 12 -
areas. The project would construct, equip and furnish four new Pills, three
for boys in rural areas of the most populous governorates, and one for girls
in the capital of a small governorate. These PTTIs would house the five-year
teacher training program for primary school graduates (para. 1.19).
2.04      Locations were selected from a number of sites proposed by the MOE on
the basis of the size of the population from which the new PTTIs would De able
to draw (Annex 1, Table 3), the local support for the proposed program, and
the proximity of alternative facilities. Tne PTTIs for boys will be located
in Al-Turba (Taiz governorate), Zaidiya (Hodeidah governorate) and Dhamar
(Dhamnar governorate). The PTTI for boys at Dhamar will replace an existing
one, wnich will be made into a girls' PTTI.  The project will also directly
support a PTTI for girls in Hajja, the capital of Hajja governorate. The
boys' schools would draw on a substantial rural population; in each
governorate recruiting only one graduate per complete primary school would
more than fill the entering class. By comparison, tne girls' school would
draw on a much smaller population. However, women are potentially a ricn
source for such programs since teaching is a socially acceptable career for
women throughout the Arab world and is gradually becoming one in tne YAK
also. It is anticipated that an adequate enrollment will be recruited for the
girls' PTTI in Hajja, since a teacner training program is already established
using temporary accommodation.
2.05      Each PTTI would house one stream of 40 students per grade.  In
addition to all the necessary teacher training facilities, the PTTIs for boys
would include boarding accommodations for 90% of the expected enrollment,
which would facilitate the enrollment of boys who live outside the immediate
location of the schools.  The location of the girls' PTTI in a governorate
capital largely obviates the need for boarding facilities, and girls requiring
accommodation would stay with local families. The instructional program at
each PTTI would require 13 teachers, and the Ministry intends to staff the new
institutes with Yemenis, preferably those who have been trained at Eastern
Michigan University (EMU) under the project funded by USAID. In this program,
experienced teachers who have previously earned a bachelor's degree
participate in a master's program that is completed partly in Yemen, and
partly at EMU. The program, which nas a target of 175, had by 1982 produced
about 60 graduates. It is anticipated that the 52 teachers required by these
4 PTTIs will be recruited from future graduates of the EMU program.
2.06      Tables 4 and 5 in Annex 1 show the annual demand for primary school
teachers from 1985/86 to 1993/94. In 1991/92, the graduates from tne boys'
and girls' PTTIs proposed in this project would meet 5% and 4% of the annual
demand for male and female teachers respectively. Witn the envisaged
expansion of school enrollment, the MOE's program to expand the number of
PTTIs is well justified.
2.07      An important element of the proposed project is tne revision of
curricula used in PTTIs across the country. The Ministry views development of
new curricula as a central feature of its reform of teacher training. The
existing curricula are for three-year programs and require rewritLing so as to
integrate instruction in subject matter and teaching methods into a five-year
program. Present curricula consist of a general education program with the



- 13 -
addition of a few specialized education courses. The new program, in
contrast, would be designed specifically for prospective teachers. The
curricula revision would be coordinated by the General Directorate or Teacher
Training, with TA (three experts for 10 man-years) provided under tne
project. One expert would be appointed for four years to oversee the
curricula revision and to provide institutional support to the General
Directorate of Teacher Training. Two experts, each of whom would be appointed
for three years, would work closely with the schools. One would assist tne
staff of the directorate in the development of mathematics and science
syllabi, the other in the development of humanities and social studies
syllabi. Detailed terms of reference for the experts will be agreed at
negotiations. The program of syllabi revision and its practical application
to the training program will be monitored by the Association during project
supervision. The Government would assign at least one counterpart for each
specialist included under the TA program on a full-time basis upon the
specialist's arrival in the country. An assurance to this effect has been
provided during negotiations (para. 5.01(a)).
District Training Centers (DTCs)
2.08     The proposed project would provide three additional DTCs and thereby
expand the basic training scheme which was initiated under the first and
second education projects (para. 1.32). It aims at providing training and
educational opportunities for the non-literate adolescent and adult population
in rural areas. The three additional centers would provide better
geographical representation of the main rural areas and increase the impact of
the scheme which has thus far met with enthusiasm and success.
2.09     The proposed project would finance construction, equipping and
furnishing three new centers. The three centers will be located in Al-Turba,
(population 30,000, Taiz governorate), Yerim (population 15,000, Ibb
governorate), and Mahweit (governorate capital, governorate population
175,000). The illiteracy rates in these three areas are 87%, 95% and 91%,
respectively.
2.10     The proposed additional DTCs, which would be very similar to the
existing, would include; (a) literacy courses, combined with basic
occupational skills (agriculture, vocational, home and family life);
(b) wherever possible, agricultural courses organized in conjunction with
agricultural extension personnel; and (c) home crafts, nutrition, health and
child care courses aimed specifically at women. Most occupational skills
courses are organized on an eight-month basis, with instruction occupying four
to five hours per day. Literacy classes would take place in the afternoon for
women and the evening for men. The DTCs would also feature intensive
vocational skills training in areas of carpentry, automobile mechanics and
electricity, enabling the "graduates" to move into semi-skilled occupations in
the local labor force, or to fulfill their present occupations more
effectively. Additional or special courses could be arranged upon specific
request from the LDA or the community. The training activities would be
monitored by a local board at the district or community level, which in turn
would report to the National Board for Non-Formal Education (NBNFE) which
dictates policy and budgeting requirements. The NBNFE was formed for this
purpose under the first and second education projects and is composed of the



- 14 -
Minister of Education, tne Director General of the Directorate of Non-Formal
Education, the Non-Formal Education Advisor, the Director of the PIU, and
representatives of other ministries.
2.11     The skills training program would be rudimentary but nonetheless
effective in that participants of programs in existing DTCs have improved
their skills significantly. The literacy program envisaged for the new DTCs
has been recently published by the Directorate of Non-Formal Education, in
conjunction with UNESCO specialists. It is a modified functional literacy
approacn, with emphasis on healtn, commerciaL, agricultural, social and
historical areas.
2.12     The DTCs would act as parent institutions to training units in remote
villages, and would be a medium of instruction responsive to village needs.
These units would provide literacy and oasic skills training, as well as
special programs adapted to the requirements of the village. More intensive
training would be provided by DTCs where boarding facilities and more
equipment would be available.
2.13     The target group ranges from 11-40 years of age.  The younger Dracket
consists mainly of those who have been forced to drop out of school after the
first year or two (owing to the need to work or the lack of school facilities
(para. 1.14)). Each DTC has the potential capacity to train about 2,400
people per year by providing 2 four-month skills courses annually, with two
shift classes, afternoons for women, evenings for men. In addition, where
village units exist, the 6 to 10 surrounding villages could offer training to
a similar number of people each year. Recruiting participants to the courses
has not been a problem in the existing DTCs, nor is it anticipated for tne
additional three proposed by this project.
2.14     Staffing in the existing 7 DTCs is dependent upon non-Yemeni
instructors of whom there are 56 at present. Each center utilizes about five
technical instructors, and the MOE, in an effort to increase the proportion of
Yemenis in technical posts, has undertaken to appoint nine graduates of the
technical secondary school this year to be counterparts of DTC instructors.
In addition, a number of potential local trainers have been identified in the
village units, for whom a short-term training program, using the vocational
schools' facilities, is being devised by tne Non-Formal Education Board of tne
MOE. Instructors live in rented accommodation in the township in waich the
DTC is located. Simple boarding accommodation would be provided for
trainee-instructors at the DTCs.
Basic Training Facility
2.15     Under the second education project, a basic training fund was set up
to enable DTCs to foster and establish village "front-line" units in areas
surrounding the main centers. This fund is now totally disbursed and a Basic
Training Facility (BTF) with the same objectives as the basic training fund
under the second education project is proposed in this project.
2.16     The original BTF has been remarkably successful in encouraging and
facilitating locally-identified development. Individually, the items
supported by the BTF have been small, but they have had a major impact on



- 15 -
tneir immediate environment as providers of education facilities and as
catalysts of change and development in remote areas. Items financed under the
BTF include civil works (43/), equipment and furniture (56%), and operating
costs of DTCs (1%). The BTF is a means of facilitating flexibility during tne
life of a project, and it has been used to support some 75 village units under
the second education project.
2.17     The conditions of disbursement from the new facility would be the
same as those applying to the BTF in recent years. The original conditions
attached to the BTF were found to be unduly stringent and in 1980 they were
amended. As a result of these changes and an improved appreciation of its
objectives, the entire BTF was disbursed between 1980 and 1982. Tne BTF would
be administered by the NBNFE and be subject to the following conditions;
(a) the National Board would not approve investment in any single
community of more than US$50,000;
(b) only training programs consistent with the objectives of the
Non-Formal Education Directorate or such special courses as may be
approved by the National Board would qualify for funding;
(c) proposals for funding for any community would be approved only where
the community had indicated its wish to participate in basic training
programs and where a commitment in kind was made by the community of
approximately 25% of the cost of the proposed investment;
(d) proposals to be made by the Director of a DTC to the National Board
for funding for a community training scheme would be supported by
details of the proposed training programs and of required furniture,
equipment and construction (with estimated costs) and estimates of
running costs; and
(e) the Director of the DTC submitting a proposal for funding would
provide confirmation that an instructor would be available for the
proposed training program and that adequate funds would oe available
within the budget of the DTC to meet the recurrent costs of the
program (para. 5.01(b)).
2.18     DTCs, as centers of out-of-school education and training programs in
YAR, are now well-established. They are making an important contribution to
adult education and the Government plans to continue the program, eventually
covering every region in the country.  Under the third education project
(Credit 915-YAR) technical assistance is provided to the Directorate of
Non-Formal Education which is responsible for tne existing seven DTCs. This
TA would also meet the needs of tne three additional DTCs proposed in this
project. In order to assist the Government with the long term development of
the basic training scheme, it is proposed that, by 1985, an evaluation of tne
program would be undertaken, tne purpose of wnich would be to review progress
and lay the foundations of the continued development of the basic training
scheme. The evaluation would, in particular, lead to recommendations for
enhancing the effectiveness of existing DTCs and appropriately locating and
designing new ones. In addition, tne evaluation would consider the need for
further support, for example, in the fields of educational materials



- 16 -
production, instructor training and curricula development. The evaluation
would be conducted under the auspices of the ERDC supported by the fourth
project, in close cooperation with the Department of Non-Formal Education in
the MOE, drawing upon two man-months of specialized consultancy services that
would be financed by this project, as well as upon technical assistance
provided for the ERDC under the fourth education project. It is proposed that
the Government and IDA will review the findings of the evaluation
(para. 5.01(c)), and that the Government would take appropriate measures to
carry out the recommendations in accordance with an implementation plan
satisfactory to the Government and IDA.
Technical Assistance (TA)
2.19     In addition to the TA provided to the PTTIs for curricula revision
(expert services for 10 man-years) and the evaluation study (two man-months),
the proposed project also includes TA for further support to the PLU and for
preinvestment studies, as follows.
2.20     Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and School Building Unit (SBU).
The SBU of the MOE, created in 1971, has the functions of designing, building
and maintaining government schools at all levels. It was establisned by
ministerial decree and attached to the PIU (1977). The expatriate PIU
director was designated to head this PIU/SBU combination. Since tne merger,
the number of local staff has steadily grown from about 9 to 117 professional,
technical, administrative and support staff in 1982, including supervisory
units in Taiz, Hodeidah and 7 other towns. The current number of PIU
expatriate staff is 9. The project will continue support for the expatriate
staff of the PIU (18 man-years). The MOE plans to gradually Yemenize the
PIU/SBU management when more qualified Yemenis will become available, with the
expatriate experts providing advisory services. In order to facilitate
handover of responsibility for the implementation of the MOE school building
program to Yemeni nationals, 10 fellowships for a combined total of 8
man-years for specialized training will be financed under this Credit.
2.21     Evaluation and Preinvestment Studies.  In addition to the evaluation
of the basic training program (para. 2.18), the project would fund feasibility
studies and engineering designs for a possible follow-up project.

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the
project are based on unit prices derived from current contracts and cost
analysis of similar institutions of the second and third projects and on
information on construction cost in general. Furniture and equipment costs
are based on current c.i.f. prices and are adjusted upward to include local
transportation and installation. The estimate of L.A. costs is based upon
average costs per man-month of about US$9,500 for expatriate experts and
US$3,800 equivalent for expatriate PIU staff under existing contracts
(consisting of salaries, fees, overhead, international travel cost and
subsistence) and about US$2,500 for fellowships inclusive of international
travel costs. These costs are based on recent experience in YAR. Baseline
cost estimates have been adjusted to reflect prices at the time of
negotiations (February 1983). Project institutions are exempt trom import
duties and taxes.
3.04     Unit Areas and Unit Costs.  Area allocations and costs per student
are shown in Annex 1, Table 6. Gross area per student place for PTTIs and
DTCs for academic, communal and boarding are in conformity with present
standards. Total capital costs (civil works, furniture and equipment) per
student place for academic and communal facilities for the DTCs are
comparable to the median average cost of similar Bank-financed
institutions. Total capital costs per student place for the Pills are
comparable to the high average cost of similar Bank-financed institutions.
3.05     Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions equal to 10% of the estimated
costs of civil works, furniture and equipment, and 5% of the estimated cost
of TA. The project cost also includes price escalation contingencies
calculated for the period beginning at negotiations (February 983) and in
accordance with an agreed schedule of implementation (Annex 1, Schedules 1
and 2). Annual rates of price increases for various categories of
expenditure are indicated in Annex 1, Table 7. Prices are expected to
increase during the project implementation period by a total of 17.0% for
civil works, 46.3% for furniture and equipment, 21.2% for TA specialists and
28.1% for fellowships. Accordingly, aggregated price increases are
estimated at about 22.9% of baseline cost plus physical contingencies.
Total contingencies are estimated to be about 31.5% of the baseline cost.
3.06     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange
component is US$10.8 million equivalent or about 53.8% of the total project
cost. The calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the
expectation that; (a) all of the civil works contracts will be awarded to
local firms (para 3.15); (b) all furniture and equipment will be directly
imported; and (c) 43% of the BTF will be expended for civil works cost and
the remaining for equipment and furniture. The resulting foreign exchange
content of each category of expenditure is as follows: (a) civil works,
37%; (b) furniture and equipment, 90%; (c) fellowships, TA for PIU, 80%; (d)
professional services for preinvestment designs, 100%.



- 20 -
3.07     Project Financing.  The proposed credit of US$10.0 million would
finance 89% of the total estimated foreign exchange cost of tne project and
3% of the local cost (1.5% of the total project cost), which represents the
local component of the civil works and operating costs financed tnrougn tne
Basic Training Facility. The balance of the foreign exchange cost (US$1.1
million) is the estimated cost of the necessary experts for the TA program
under the teacher training component of the project, which is expected to be
met by USAID. USAID is active in the field of teacher training and has
agreed to finance the above TA program. In the event USAID financing does
not materialize in time for the project's needs, the Government would meet
the additional cost. The Government would finance 97% of the net local
costs, amounting to US$9.0 million (44.7% of the total project cost). The
proposed financial plan is summarized below:

3.08     Recurrent Costs.  When fully operational, the annual recurrent costs
of the project institutions would be YRls 6.7 million and YRls 2.2 million for
the PTTIs and DTCs, respectively, which would be met without difficulty as the
costs are a negligible proportion (less than 0.5%) of the total 1986/87
education recurrent budget.

Project Implementation
3.09     Implementation Period.  The construction, furnishing and equipping of
all institutions and the TA component are scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1988 (Annex 1, Schedules 1 and 2). In order to allow sufficient
time for submission of the final withdrawal applications, the closing date
would be June 30, 1989.
3.10     The MOE has designated a senior official as Project Coordinator who
would have the overall responsibility of the project under the general
supervision of the Deputy Minister of Education. The coordinator, in close
collaboration with the Director of Teacher Training and the Director of
Non-Formal Education, would have specific responsibilities for; (a) ensuring
appropriate provisions of capital and recurrent budgets for the project;
(b) liaison with the PIU and the SBU in the development of architectural
designs and procurement of equipment and furniture with the assistance of his
staff; (c) financial records, and with advice and assistance of the PIU/SBU
accountant, the preparation of withdrawal applications for disbursements of
allocated IDA funds in respect of TA; and (d) timely recruitment of staff and
nomination of counterparts for the project schools and preinvestment studies.
03.11    The PIU, established in the MOE under the first IDA education
project, has responsibilities for the physical aspects of the proposed
project. These implementation activities will include, inter alia,
architectural design, preparation of cost estimates and supervision of
construction. The PIU will continue its association with the SBU of the MOE,
as envisaged under the third and fourth projects. The PIU will also assist in
carrying out the preinvestment studies in conjunction with the consultants for
this component.
3.12     Architectural Designs.  The PIU, in conjunction with the SBU as
stated above, would have the responsibility for the architectural services for
the project. Preliminary designs have been approved by IDA. Final
construction drawings and bid documents for ICB are scheduled for completion
by June 30, 1983. As these are "repeater" items, no problems are
anticipated.
3.13     Sites.  Suitable sites exist for each project institution and have
been acquired by the MOE. The cost of land acquisition would be borne by the
government and is not included in the project cost.
.3.14     Furniture and Equipment Lists.  Basic lists of equipment and
furniture for the PTTIs and for the DTCs were reviewed by IDA. The
preparation of the detailed equipment lists and specifications and bid
documents for ICB would be undertaken by the MOE department of teacher
training in collaboration with the PIU/SBU and are scheduled for completion by
June 1983. The contracts for major equipment bid packages will include
installation and commissioning of equipment. As these are "repeater" items,
no problems are anticipated.



- 22 -
Procurement
3.15     Civil works contracts (amounting to US$12.7 million includLng
contingencies) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. It is anticipated that due to the dispersion of the project
institutions within the country all civil works contracts (average size,
US$1.8 million) would be awarded to local firms. Construction of village
basic training facilities, which are small and dispersed, estimated at US$0.4
million total (on average, about US$20,000 eacn), would be carried out on tte
basis of local procurement procedures acceptable to IDA.   Detailed lists and
specifications of furniture and equipment would be presented to IDA for review
and approval prior to procurement. Equipment and furniture items (amounting
to US$3.7 million, including contingencies) would be grouped, to the extent
possible, in large packages to permit bulk procurement. Contracts for
furniture and equipment in excess of US$50,000 would be awarded on the oasis
of ICB. Small items or groups of items estimated to cost less than the above
figure or items of specialized nature for which ICB would not be practical
would be procured under normal government procedures acceptable to IDA and
would include, to the extent feasible, quotations from at least tnree
manufacturers or suppliers; these items would not exceed an aggregate total of
US$0.7 million, whicn would represent about 20% of tne estimated furniture and
equipment costs including contingency allowances. Draft tender and contract
documents for furniture, equipment and civil works would be forwarded to IDA
for review and approval; IDA's approval of tender evaluation documents would
be required prior to the award of all contracts for furniture, equipment and
civil works estimated to cost over US$50,000 each. Bank reimbursements for
all other contracts would be contingent upon IDA's approval of tender
evaluation documents subsequent to contract awards. For purpose of comparing
foreign and local bids under ICB, local manufacturers of furniture and
equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing rate
of customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15% c.i.f. price,
whichever is lower.
Disbursement
3.16     Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 3) would be on the basis of:
(a)  Civil works:  PTTIs and DTCs - 36% of total expenditure;
village training units financed under the BTF - 100%;
(b) Furniture and Equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures, and of local
expenditures ex-factory; 85% of local expenditures for imported items
procured locally;
(c) Technical Assistance: 100% of foreign expenditures; and
(d)  Operating costs:   for items financed under the BTF - 100%, subject
to a ceiling of $100,000 and based on statements of expenditure.
3.17     Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 1989,
amounting to a period of six years. The estimated disbursement profile nas a
higher profile and is of a shorter duration by one year from the IDA
country-wide disbursement profile for YAR. This is reasonable because of:



- 23 -
(a) the actual disbursement profile of the recently completed second IDA
education credit is both higher and of shorter duration (six years) than the
country profile; (b) the PIU's performance in implementation has progressively
improved with each succeeding IDA education project; (c) the advanced stage of
the proposed project with the completion of construction and bid documents of
civil works of all project items, such that bidding is scheduled for
July 1983; and (d) disbursements for the BTF are expected to be expeditious
due to experience gained on the first and second projects.
3.18     Accounts and Audits.  The PIU accountant will coordinate the
financial affairs of the project. Pre-auditing is carried out by an accounts
unit of the Ministry of Finance located in the MOE. Under existing Credit
Agreements (Credits 915-YAR and 1203-YAR), the Borrower has agreed to have
project accounts for each year audited by auditors acceptable to IDA.
Officials of the Government's Central Office for Auditing and Accounting in
June 1982 audited the project accounts of the third Credit (915-YAR) in
accordance with the Credit Covenant, but thus far no Audit reports have been
received by IDA. However, the Audit report is expected by March 1983.
3.19     The Government has agreed that;
(a)  the accounts will be audited by auditors acceptable to IDA and in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles; and
(b)  it will furnish to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal
year: (i) certified copies of the project accounts; and (ii) an
audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request,
including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against
certified statements of expenses (para. 5.01(d)).

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01      The main benefits expected to accrue from implementation of the
proposed project are as follows;
4.02     Teacher Training.  A principal benefit of this project would be
revised and new curricula for use in all PTTIs. This would lead to an
improvement in the quality of teacher training and hence to better trained
teachers. The project itself would contribute, by 1991/92, an annual addition
of about 130 teachers to the existing stock of Yemeni teachers, 5% of the
annual requirement for teachers. The project would facilitate an increased
participation of women in the teaching profession and of girls in school; one
of the four PTTIs is for girls. Through TA provided by the project, the
Directorate of Teacher Training would be strengthened and this would improve
the administration of teacher training at all levels nationally. The new
PTTIs are located in rural areas, and as a result the project is improving the
regional distribution of teacher training facilities.
4.03     Out-of-School Education.  This project would improve provision of
urgently required out-of-school literacy and basic skills training in areas of
the country presently lacking such facilities. Within the next three years,
approximately 150,000 persons will participate in the overall program and from
1984/85 onwards at least another 5,000 from each of the three centers
supported in this project will participate. The project would also assist
women to participate in the development of their country by extending the
training program which is a focal point for women's development in rural areas.
Risks
4.04     Teacher Training.  This project would face some risks arising from
major changes in the PTTI curricula, and possible low enrollments in the new
PTTIs.  With the provision of technical assistance for curricula revision, the
incentives for teacher trainees, the relatively small number of recruits to be
obtained from a potentially large number of eligible candidates, and the high
priority which Government accords to its new teacher training program, the
risks have been reduced to a minimum.
4.05     Out-of-School Education.  The three District Training Centers and the
Basic Training Facility are items included in two highly successful previous
projects, Credit 421-YAR and Credit 611-YAR. Ihere is every indication that
the high quality of management and performance of these centers would be
maintained.
4.06     Two of the three new DTCs planned under this project would be in
locations similar to the existing DTCs. The third would be in an area
considerably more remote, which the formal education system has only recently
reached. However, preparation of the component has included discussions with
the local community and has resulted in enthusiastic support by the LDA. With
LDA support, problems of implementation, which might arise in an area
relatively unexposed to education, would be minimized.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
(a)  At least one counterpart staff for each specialist included under the
TA program would be assigned on a full-time basis upon the
specialist's arrival in the country (para. 2.07).
(b)  The BTF would be administered by the National Board subject to the
following conditions (para. 2.17);
(i) the National Board would not approve investment in any single
community of more than US$50,000;
(ii) only training programs consistent with the objectives of the
Non-Formal Education Directorate or such special courses as may
be approved by the National Board would qualify for funding;
(iii) proposals for funding for any community would be approved only
where the community had indicated its wish to participate in
basic training programs and where a commitment in kind was made
by the community of approximately 25% of the cost of the
proposed investment;
(iv) proposals to be made by the Director of a DTC to the National
Board for funding for a community training scheme would be
supported by details of the proposed training programs and of
required furniture, equipment and construction (with estimated
costs); and
(v) the Director of the DTC submitting a proposal for funding woula
provide confirmation that an instructor would be available for
the proposed training program and that adequate funas woula be
available within the budget of the DTC to meet the recurrent
costs of the program.
(c)  An evaluation of the basic training scheme would be undertaken whicn
the Government would send to IDA within six months of its completion
for review and comment with a view to developing a program of
government measures for strengthening the basic training scheme
(para. 2.18).
(d)  Accounts will be audited by auditors acceptable to IDA and in
accordance with appropriate auditing principals (para. 3.19(a)); and
it will furnish IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year;
(i) certified copies of the project accounts; and (ii) an audit
report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request
(para. 3.19(b)).



- 26 -
5.02      Subject to the above conditions, the project would provide a suitable
basis for an IDA Credit of US$10.00 million equivalent to the Government of
the Yemen Arab Republic.

Conparative Education Data are useful io the evaluatIon of various edu..ation Syetew and analysEs of reStive stages of edctiE...al development between varou.s
countries. However, on the basis of tIe present data. cross-ntio-nal coparis.. should be approached wOth great c-utio. Data preseoted fn the above table have
been collected largely by bank aissions froc governiment sources; the remainder are staff estisates or data fro. Unesco. Efforts have been -ade to tandardice
defiGitions snd, vithio li its, to check the accuracy of the data. Nevertheless, such data are still imperfect in several respects snd the bank is vorking to
icprove thec progresively on the  8c8.si0  of its operational vork.  In the use of these data, the following qualifications should be kept in oiod:
(1)   Education  as defined in the table includes all educrtion and trsinEng, both formal and non-formal.
(2)   Priaary- education refero to education at the first level and -secondary  education refers to all education at the secondary level regardless of type
(e.g., general, technical, agricultural).
(3) -Literacy rates' (col. 6) are often obtained from country censuses. In many countries they are only eppro.insationo and it i. doubtful that any uniforc
definition of -literate" has been fonllved con-iste-tly.
(4)   Public expenditure in education- (cols. 4 and 5) refers to a11 capital and recurrent espenditures devoted to education by public and qu-ni-publjc
agencies .
(5)   Enrollsent ration" (rol. 7, 12 and 14) refer to school year and are the percentage of eligible children enrolled full-ti-n in the appropr-ate school,
public and private by level. They are often subject to a vide margin of error Sn the developing cnuntrieo owing to varitin-on Sn the accuracy of husic
data (i.e., ase-upecifSt  population end enroll e.ts).  Enrollment figures frequently are higher than the number of student, -ctually in sc-oh .  Ov-r-aged
students whose inclusion is indicated by footnotes -00 cran inflate the ratios.
