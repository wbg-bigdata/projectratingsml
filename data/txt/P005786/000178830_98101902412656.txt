Yemen Arab Republic
Fifth Education Project
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               Yemen Arab Republic (YAR)
Amount:                 Special Drawing Rights 9.2 million (approximately
$10.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                  Standard
Project Description:   The proposed project is designed to increase the
quality and quantity of basic educational services
by strengthening its primary and non-formal educa-
tion system. It would: (a) expand the facilities
for training of primary school teachers, especially
in rural areas, and improve girls' access to edu-
cation; (b) improve teacher training curricula;
(c) expand literacy and basic occupational skills
training in rural areas; and (d) assist the Ministry
of Education (MOE) in designing, constructing and
maintaining the educational facilities. The project
comprises: (a) the construction, equipping and fur-
nishing of four primary teacher training institutes
(PTTI), with an annual intake capacity of 160 stu-
dents; (b) boarding facilities for male trainees;
(c) the construction, equipping and furnishing of
three district training centers (DTC); (d) a basic
training facility for the construction, equipping
and furnishing of village training units; and (e)
technical assistance for revision of teachers'
training curricula, evaluation of the basic training
scheme, and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
and fellowships for Yemeni staff for training
abroad. The project's main benefits would be to
augment the supply of trained male and female
teachers and to improve the quality of teacher
training. It would provide literacy and basic
training skills for about 15,000 persons every year,
and promote the participation of women in
development. The project risks relate to major
changes in the teacher training curricula and
possible low enrollment. The risks have been
minimized by the provision of technical assistance
and incentives for teacher trainees.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF IDA
TO TE,E EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC FOR
A FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) for Special Drawing
Rights (SDRs) 9.2 million (approximately US$10.0 million equivalent), on
standard IDA terms, to help finance a Fifth Education project. The United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) would co-finance the
project with a grant of $1.1 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A basic economic report entitled "Yemen Arab Republic:  Development
of a Traditional Economy," (No. 2057a-YAR), dated December 14, 1978; a
Country Economic Memorandum (No. 2856-YAR), dated October 23, 1980; a report
on manpower development (No. 3181a-YAR), dated March 27, 1981; and a report
on domestic resource mobilization (No. 3554a-YAR), dated January 6, 1982,
have been distributed to the Executive Directors. Country data are attached
in Annex I.
Introduction
3.        Over the last decade YAR has experienced far-reaching changes in
its socioeconomic structure and the material welfare of its citizens. The
republican government which came to power following the 1962 Revolution
succeeded in establishing within a surprisingly short period of time the
foundations of a modern state.
4.        Political integration and the growing influence of central authori-
ties have provided the basis for rapid development of the public and private
sectors. Under the Three-Year Development Program (1974-76) and the First
Five-Year Plan (1977-81), the foundations of the country's physical and
social infrastructure were laid and expanded, and first attempts were made at
lifting agriculture, the mainstay of the economy, out of its medieval
setting; industrialization was also started, albeit on a small-scale.
5.        Rapid domestic economic growth has been accompanied and enhanced by
the large inflow of remittances and transfers by Yemenis abroad, particularly
workers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. These are estimated to have
increased, on a net basis, from around $40 million in 1969/70 to a level that
has fluctuated around $1 billion on an annual basis between 1978 and 1980.
1/ Substantially the same as Part I of the President's Report for the
Agricultural Credit project (Report No. P-3409-YAR dated November 18,
1982) approved by the Executive Directors on December 14, 1982.

They have since dropped to close to $790 million in 1981 (on the basis of
tentative estimates by the Central Bank). Largely as a result of these cash
inflows, YAR's real per capita GNP has increased significantly over this
period, reaching an estimated $430 in 1980.
Major Development Issues
6.        Recent achievements in development, remarkable as they are, should
not detract from the fact that YAR continues to be one of the world's least
developed countries. Productivity levels are still extremely low, especially
in agriculture. Over 90 percent of the population resides in rural areas, a
large part in remote villages without access to modern transportation,
schools, electricity or health services. Agricultural land and water are
scarce and few mineral deposits have been discovered so far.
7.        The shortage of skilled manpower is an overriding constraint to
YAR's development and limits the capacity of the public administration to
manage and implement a growing and increasingly complex development program.
The most critical shortages are in the skilled and semi-skilled occupations.
8.        A special effort is required to mobilize domestic resources for the
financing of fast-growing government expenditures. Although government
revenue rose rapidly during the 1970s, the tax base is still very small.
Most budget revenue is derived from import duties, while other sources of
taxation are still largely undeveloped. So far, budget deficits have been
covered through generous foreign aid. But this assistance could diminish in
relative terms over the longer run, a development which calls for measures to
broaden the tax base, strengthen the tax administration, and devise new
schemes to tap the savings of the private sector. A Bank mission, with IMF
participation, addressed these and related issues, and its report was
discussed with the Government in November 1981.  The Government has already
implemented some of the mission's recommendations, but the tougher measures
are likely to take more time to implement.
Government Objectives
9.        As of the early seventies, the country has been trying to develop
human resources and build new institutions, to strengthen the physical and
social infrastructure, to raise the productivity of the commodity-producing
sectors, and to improve the standard of living of the people, giving priority
to their basic needs. Most of the First Plan's targets which were in line
with these objectives have been met except in the agriculture sector.
Agricultural output has stagnated and actual growth fell considerably below
targeted levels primarily because of the abandonment of marginal rain-fed
areas where income opportunities could not compete with the opportunities of
migration. The production of qat (a mild stimulant) has been on the increase
and has competed for agricultural land. Its production is only partially
reflected in the national accounts.



-3-
10.       A draft Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86) was presented to an
International Development Conference in April 1982. The Bank was the
executing agency for a UNDP-financed project overseeing some inputs used by
the Central Planning Organization for the plan. The plan's aim is a
7 percent GDP growth target calling for a total investment of around $6.5
billion (1981 prices) over the p-lan period. The sectoral distribution of
investment underlies a continued broad-fronted strategy with a relative
emphasis on agriculture and manpower development. The plan's financing
depends heavily on external sources with around 70 percent of investment
expected to be covered by grants and loan disbursements and direct foreign
private investment. The Bank has cautioned the Government against setting
unrealistically ambitious targets and advised it to maintain flexibility in
plan implementation should the level of expected external resources prove
untenable.
Recent Economic Performance
11.       Overall economic performance during the First Plan period (1977-81)
has been satisfactory. Real GDP grew at around 6 percent p.a. Investment
effort was impressive averaging around one-third of GNP. Since 1978, how-
ever, a noticeable deceleration in the growth of most economic aggregates has
set in. This has been mainly due to the stabilization in the inflows of
workers' remittances and private transfers. Since imports and consumption
continued to grow, national savings, the balance of payments and the foreign
exchange position deteriorated. Thus, the overall balance of payments which
showed considerable surpluses before 1978, showed an estimated $330 million
deficit in 1981. Reserves which were equivalent to around 20 months of
imports in 1975 were down to around 7 months by end 1981.
12.       The budgetary position has also deteriorated rapidly as of 1978.
The overall deficit has more than quintupled from 1977/78 to 1978/79 and has
remained around the same level (some $500 million) through 1981. The main
reason is the very steep rise in capital expenditures at a time when revenue
increases were moderate.
13.       YAR's commodity exports are still extremely low, reflecting the
country's limited resource endowment and the underdeveloped state of its
economy.  Imports, on the other hand, have risen sharply from $194 million in
1973/74 to $1748 million in 1981. This upsurge in import demand reflects the
rapidly rising cash incomes, the convertibility of the Yemeni rial, and the
absence of import restrictions.
14.       Although there are no reliable data on income and consumption
distribution in YAR, there are reasons to believe that the benefits from
recent growth have been widely distributed; migration has led to little
apparent unemployment so far, and strong family ties ensure that many people
benefit from the increase in incomes. Public social expenditures, especially



- 4 -
in education and health, increased substantially, and the associated benefits
accrue directly to an increasing segment of the population.
Capital Flows and External Debt
15.       Since independence, YAR has received large amounts of foreign
assistance. Given the country's low per capita income and its UN classifi-
cation as a "least-developed country," most of the aid was provided in the
form of grants and concessionary loans. Cumulative aid disbursements,
including grants, came to around $2 billion by the end of 1981. The princi-
pal donors have been Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, USA
and West Germany as well as IDA and the Arab development funds.
16.       About one-half of the total assistance given so far was provided as
grants, mostly for food aid, technical assistance and more recently, for bud-
get support primarily from Saudi Arabia. Food aid has been provided through
the World Food Program and by a number of bilateral donors. A significant
part of official grants has been made available in the form of technical
assistance. Given the extreme shortage of skilled manpower in YAR, this type
of aid has high priority and will be needed by the country for many years to
come. Besides the grants, YAR received sizeable amounts of official loans
and credits. Drawings on these loans have increased in recent years, reach-
ing $417 million in 1980 and $294 million in 1981. Most of the official
loans and credits have been committed for the financing of specific projects,
with the main emphasis on roads, agriculture, including irrigation, and
utilities. The remaining funds were given for commodity assistance or as
cash loans.
17.       The terms on which YAR has obtained official loan assistance have
been very favorable. Loans from the USSR and the People's Republic of China
are, for the most part, free of interest. Western European countries have
generally charged between 3/4 percent and 2-1/2 percent. Interest rates
charged by Arab countries have varied from 0 to 4 percent. Loan maturities
range from 5-50 years, with a median of 20-30 years.
18.       YAR's external public debt outstanding on December 31, 1981 was
estimated at $1747 million, of which $1094 million was disbursed. IDA
credits accounted for $239 million or about 14 percent of the total debt
reported. Because of their very favorable terms of borrowing, the debt
service payments amounted to $59 million for 1981, equivalent to around
1.3 percent of gross foreign exchange earnings (including workers' remit-
tances and private transfers). Service payments are expected to rise
significantly over the next decade.

PART II - WORLD BAN. OPERATIONS 1/
19.       The proposed credit would be the thirty-fourth to YAR, bringing
total IDA commitments to $312.8 million.2/ The World Bank strategy in YAR
has been threefold: to concentrate on developing the basic institutions,
skills and physical infrastructure which are prerequisites for development,
to develop production and income in the dominant productive sector, agricul-
ture, and to support the Government in its programs to meet basic needs in
rural and urban areas. To achieve these objectives, IDA has extended eleven
credits, totaling $120.4 million, for agriculture, fisheries and rural infra-
structure; twelve credits, totaling $114.6 million, for infrastructure in-
cluding highways, ports, water supply and sewerage, power distribution, and
urban development; four credits, totaling $41 million, for education and
training; two credits, totaling $14.3 million, for industry; a $2.0 million
credit to promote the exploration of the petroleum and geothermal resources
to private companies; and a $10.5 million credit to strengthen and expand the
capability of the Ministry of Health to plan, staff and manage the country's
health care system. In FY78, an investment of $2.4 million by the Interna-
tional Finance Corporation was approved to help finance a dairy and juice
project. Further opportunities for IFC involvement are being explored.
20.       The main constraint to YAR's social and economic development has
been, and will remain for some time, the critical shortage of manpower,
especially skilled and professional, and the newness and weakness of its
institutions.  World Bank strategy in YAR has placed emphasis on helping to
strengthen Yemeni institutions and manpower capabilities, through increased
training of local staff and continued technical assistance, as well as
through direct financing for education. Thus all IDA projects in YAR contain
substantial components for technical assistance towards institution build-
ing. Three particularly important examples of the World Bank's support for
institution building have been in the Central Planning Organization (CPO) and
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF). In CPO, the World Bank
(through three grants totaling $520,000) and the Kuwait Fund have financed a
team of planning and economic advisers so as to create a planning machinery.
The Bank has been the executing agency for a UNDP-financed project to assist
the CPO in the preparation of the Second Five-Year Plan, 1982-86 (see para-
graph 10). In MAF, the Bank supplies the services of seven advisers ini-
tially financed by UNDP with the Bank as executing agency, and now financed
jointly by IDA, the EEC Special Action Fund (under the Second Tihama project)
1/ Substantially the same as Part II of the President's Report for the
Agricultural Credit project (Report No. P-3409-YAR dated November 18,
1982) approved by the Executive Directors on December 14, 1982.
2/ This includes the supplementary credit of $10.3 million for the First
Tihama project, No. 376-1 YAR, and excludes the $7.0 million credit for
the Textile Rehabilitation project, No. 832-YAR of 1978, which was
cancelled at the Government's request in October 1979 (see Annex II).

and UNDP. The Agricultural Research Station at Taiz, which has the responsi-
bility for carrying out applied agricultural research for the country as a
whole, is also financed as part of this institutional support.
21.       YAR's disbursement performance (disbursements as a percentage of
total commitments) lagged somewhat lately largely due to the delay in the
recruitment of staff for project implementation and the shortage of counter-
part funds arising from budgetary constraints. Following a number of imple-
mentation reviews of the whole portfolio, performance started to improve and
implementation of ongoing IDA-assisted projects is now progressing satisfac-
torily. YAR's performance now compares favorably with the regional average
and is considerably above that of countries at a similar level of develop-
ment. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits, Bank grants, and
IFC investments, as well as notes on the execution of the ongoing projects,
as of September 30, 1982.
22,       Future World Bank operations will concentrate on reinforcing the
institutional progress made in infrastructure, agriculture, rural development
and education and training, and will seek to spread the benefits of develop-
ment more widely throughout YAR. Particular attention will be given to YAR's
ability to implement projects, by ensuring the availability of key staff and
technical assistance needed for successful implementation. A third power
project has been appraised, a fifth highway project and several agricultural
development projects are in the preparation stage. Future projects are
expected to include water supply and sewerage, urban and housing, and
agricultural development, and may also include health and energy.
23.       YAR has contributed an increasing portion of local currency financ-
ing and is expected to continue to finance a rising portion of its develop-
ment expenditures in the future. Nevertheless, it remains among the least-
developed countries and requires special assistance through financing of a
large part of project costs, including local expenditures when necessary. As
in the past, the costs of future projects are expected to be substantially
higher than the amounts that IDA can provide, and we shall continue to co-
operate closely with other donors so as to maximize IDA's catalytic role in
stimulating cofinancing. IDA-supported projects, including this project,
have led to over $326 million equivalent of cofinancing from other aid donors.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
General Education
24.       The level of human resources development in YAR is one of the low-
est in the world. It is only a little more than a decade since the
Government has begun effective moves to establish a modern education system.
Only 21 percent of YAR's adult population is literate and enrollment ratios
for the formal education system in 1981-82 were about 49 percent at the
primary level, 7 percent at the preparatory level, 3 percent at the secondary
level, and 1 percent at the university level. 1/
1/ The data in Annex I relates to 1978-80.



- 7 -
25.       The need for an educated workforce with necessary skills to respond
to the demands of a changing economy is seen by the Government as fundamental
to its overall development strategy. Accordingly, educational development
policies have been directed towards expanding basic schooling, while training
programs have been oriented towards meeting skilled and semi-skilled manpower
needs. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for primary, prepara-
tory, secondary and technical education. The University of Sanaa has, at
present, five faculties Arts, Sciences, Education, Commerce and Sharia
(Islamic Law). However, plans are underway to establish three more facul-
ties: Engineering (as part of the IDA-assisted Education IV Project),
Medicine and Agriculture.
Educational Objectives
26.       In recent years the Government has made a major commitment of
resources to provide: basic education for all school-age children, and to
develop an education and training system adapted to the country's needs. The
MOE placed much emphasis on the construction of schools to realize these
objectives, assisted by IDA and other donors. As a result, enrollment has
increased very quickly, by about one-third per year since 1978/79 at the
primary and one-fifth at the preparatory and secondary levels, although from
a small base. While the increased enrollment at the primary level is
encouraging, two features of the present situation are matters of concern.
Firstly, the proportion of girl students is very low. Only 12 percent of
primary school students (about 8 percent of the girls in the age group 6-12)
were girls in 1982. This is attributable to the prevailing, though slowly
changing, strong social customs limiting girls participation in education.
Secondly, a high ratio of students drop out of primary schools, with the
result that only about 15 percent of students enrolled at the first grade
eventually graduate from the sixth grade. This high ratio of drop-outs is
due to the low quality and shortage of teachers, the inadequate educational
materials, the distant location of schools in rural areas, besides boys being
drawn from schools to assist their families on the farms. The proposed
project would help to improve the availability and the quality of teachers.
27.       Given the situation described above, the educational objectives of
the MOE in the Second Five-Year Plan are sound. They mainly consist of (a)
strengthening of primary education and improving its quality by expanding the
output of teachers, recruiting teachers at higher levels, and intensifying
in-service training; (b) expanding efforts to lessen adult illiteracy and to
provide girls with greater access to the education system; (c) providing more
basic skills for rural adults, by increasing the number of District Training
Centers and village training units; and (d) continuing to develop vocational
and technical training through vocational training centers and technical
secondary schools. Enrollment in primary schools is projected to grow at
12 percent per annum over the period 1982/83 through 1986/87, and then at
6 percent per annum from 1987/91 to 1995/96. Even then, the proportion of
population in the age group 6-12 attending primary schools would reach only
66 percent. The total demand (which includes attrition) for primary teachers
would increase from about 23,000 in 1982/83 to about 42,000 in 1995/96.

Primary Education and Teachers' Training
28.       The expansion and qualitative improvement of formal primary
education remains one of YAR's crucial needs. Only when primary education is
well established can other levels and types of education take off, and
provide a sound fourndation for effective vocational and professional training
to meet manpower needs.
29.       The development of a viable primary education system is constrained
by a severe shortage of trained Yemeni teachers. This shortage is the result
of a small number of Yemenis with requisite qualifications, and the perceived
unattractiveness of teaching as a profession. The Government has endeavored
to build up the pool of trained teachers by setting up a number of primary
teacher training institutes (PTTIs). These PTTIs have two programs; (a) a
three-year upper secondary level program, (grades 10-12) located in major
cities; and (b) a three-year post-primary program (grades 7-9). The
graduates from the latter program were judged to be too young and poorly
prepared to begin teaching immediately. The Government therefore started
phasing it out in 1981/82 to replace it by a new five-year post-primary
program (grade 7-11).
30.       The teacher training programs have experienced severe problems in
recruiting and retaining students. These problems are due to: (a) the
limited number of primary school graduates (para. 26); and (b) the
attractiveness of specialized secondary schools in agriculture, technical
subjects and communications; and the higher prestige and financial reward of
careers other than teaching. The pool of candidates for training can be
expanded only gradually. To attract available candidates for the teacher
training program, the government has provided increased stipends and boarding
facilities. Moreover, it plans to establish teacher training programs in
rural areas before installing any new general lower secondary programs. To
make teaching an attractive career, the government has increased teachers'
salaries by more than 20 percent and provided other incentives, including
exemption from military service. These incentives would help to achieve
fuller utilization of the existing primary teacher training institutes
(PTTIs). However, in view of the large existing and anticipated future
demands for qualified teachers (para. 27), these facilities need to be
expanded, which is the objective of the proposed project.
31.       In view of the shortage of trained Yemeni teachers, YAR has relied
on expatriate teachers from the earliest moments of expansion of the modern
education system. The number of expatriate teachers grew considerably fom
3,360 in 1978/79 to about 14,000 in 1981/82 and, despite increasing avail-
ability of Yemeni teachers from the existing training programs, is expected
to rise to 22,500 in 1986/87. This situation merely reflects the growing
demand for teachers in YAR and the inadequate number of Yemenis teachers to
cope with demand, despite concerted attempts to increase their supply. Apart
from its social implications, the large number of expatriate teachers also
has a significant impact on YAR's balance of payments.



9-
Non-Formal Education
32.       The rapidly expanding formal school system will not affect the
educational status of those too old to enter school. There is widespread
illiteracy (about 80 percent in 1982). The low level of literacy is a major
constraint to the development of the country, and not least in agriculture,
the sector from which most Yemenis derive a living. Basic skills training
for adults in rural areas has become more important since modern techniques
entered the rural economy. In response to this need, the MOE's Department of
Non-Formal Education (DNE) began in 1976 a program of establishing district
training centers (DTC) in small towns and village training units to provide
literacy classes and basic skills training for men and women.
33.       Under the first and second education projects (Credits 421-YAR and
611-YAR), seven DTCs were established. In the last two years that they have
been in effective operation, seven DTCs have offered villagers in rural areas
literacy courses, as well as courses in agricultural skills, women's crafts,
home economics, health and nutrition, and basic skills training in carpentry,
electricity and automotive mechanics. More than 17,000 have participated in
these programs thus far. Of the 1,800 completing the basic skills training
course, over 200 are known to have been employed by the Governent or industry
in the district. The majority have moved into self-employed categories or
are applying their newly acquired skills to their work environment. In
addition, 10 percent of the 10,000 literacy students completed sufficient
courses to qualify them to enter the first grade of the lower secondary
schools. Encouraged by the rural population's response to the non-formal
basic training program, the Government plans to expand gradually the program
to cover the entire country. The Association's report on manpower develop-
ment in the YAR (No. 3181a-YAR, dated March 27, 1981) recommended strength-
ening and expanding existing programs and upgrading unskilled workers through
such programs as the DTC.
Education Finance
34.       In 1981, the share of the education sector in total Government
expenditures exceeded 11 percent, as compared to 8 percent in 1975/76. In
addition, private contributions in kind, essentially for school accommoda-
tion, made through the Local Development Associations amounted to about
10 percent of Government expenditures on education. The proportion of GNP
allocated to the education sector exceeded 5 percent in 1981, which is com-
parable with the proportion devoted to education in countries at similar
stages of development. However, the cost of education per pupil in YAR,
which amounted to about two-thirds of the GNP per capita in 1981, is high for
three reasons:  (a) low enrollment and high drop out rates;  (b) high teacher
salaries reflecting the shortage of teachers; and (c) a large share of the
education budget (39 percent in 1981) finances capital expenditures.
35.       While the Government's emphasis on education and the increased
allocation of resources is appropriate, the Second Five-Year Plan, if fully
implemented would result in allocating more than 12 percent of GNP to the
education sector by 1986, about the highest proportion in the world. Conse-



- 10 -
quently, there is an urgent need to limit the growing expenditures on educa-
tion, through the efficient use of existing resources and the recovery of a
part of the current education costs through user fees. The MOE has already
begun taking some steps to lower unit costs by ensuring contractual obliga-
tions of minimum acceptable class contact hours for expatriate teachers, and
encouraging the recruitment and retention of Yemeni teachers. The Association
has initiated discussions with the Government on the findings of a recent IDA
study of education administration and finance, and expects to reach an under-
standing on some measures to recover a part of the increasing educational
costs.
Previous IDA Assistance in the Education Sector
36.       The proposed project would be the fifth IDA--financed project in the
education sector in YAR. IDA's irvolvement in this sector started in 1973.
The first two IDA-assisted projects (Cr. 421-YAR and Cr. 611-YAR), now com-
pleted, reflected the Government emphasis on establishing the formal
education system as an essential base for other education and training
programs, with priority for teacher, basic and vocational training and
secondary technical education. The Third Education project (Cr. 915-YAR)
approved in 1979 supported the Government's aim of expanding secondary
education in agriculture and livestock practices, and strengthening public
administration. Pre-investment feasibility studies related to basic health
care training included in the project led to the recently approved Health
project. The Fourth Education project (Cr. 1203-YAR) was approved in 1982.
It is designed to aid institutional development, to increase the utilization
of the existing PTTIs and vocational technical training centers (VTC) and to
meet a serious shortage of Yemeni engineers, establish an Engineering College
in the Sanaa University, and to strengthen the MOE's capacity to undertake
educational policy studies through the establishment of an Educational
Research and Development Center (ERDC). The on-going projects are
progressing satisfactorily.
37.       The Project Completion Report on the First Education project high-
lighted (i) the need for designs and construction drawings appropriate to
local conditions and expertise; (ii) the need for a coordinating mechanism
for the timely recruitment of foreign staff for schools; and (iii) the ne-
cessity to provide boarding facilities for PTTIs and VTCs to reach planned
enrollment capacities. The experience gained from the First Education
project and the subsequent projects has been incorporated in the design of
this project.
38.       YAR's chronic shortage of skilled and semi-skilled manpower is
projected to continue into the eighties and beyond. The solution to this
problem can be realized only over the longer-term, and consists in measures
to increase the efficiency of flow through the formal education system,
increase the number and capacity of training centers and their utilization,
and encourage a greater participation of qualified women in the labor force,
especially in the field of education, consistent with the social mores of the
country. This would require sustained Government efforts over time, and a
continued support by external aid agencies and friendly countries. The
proposed project would provide a part of the needed support.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
39.        The proposed project would build on the achievements of previous
IDA-assisted education projects (paragraph 36) in the Yemen Arab Republic.
It was prepared by the YAR Government with assistance from IDA and appraised
in June 1982. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington
from February 14-16, 1983.  The YAR delegation was headed by Mr. Gradah,
Deputy Minister of Education, and included the Deputy Chairman of the Central
Planning Organization and representatives of the Ministry of Education
(MOE). A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Yemen Arab Republic - Fifth
Education Project" (No. 4223-YAR, dated February 22, 1983) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the
Credit and the Project are summarized in the Credit and Project Summary and
in Annex III. A map of the project area is attached.
Project Objectives and Description
40.        The proposed project is designed to increase the quality and quan-
tity of basic educational services in YAR by strengthening two of the most
important components of the nation's education system: primary education and
non-formal education (NFE). Specifically, the project would (a) expand
training of primary school teachers and improve the teacher training cur-
riculum; (b) expand literacy and basic occupational skills training for rural
adolescents and adults; and (c) strengthen the institution responsible for
designing, constructing and maintaining all government educational facilities.
Primary Teacher Training Institutes (PTTIs)
41.        The lack of Yemeni primary school teachers is costly in both eco-
nomic and social terms (paragraph 31). To help alleviate the shortage, which
is especially severe in rural areas, the proposed project provides for the
construction, equipping and furnishing of three Primary Teacher Training
Institutes (PTTIs) for boys and one for girls, each with 200 student places.
The annual intake capacity of the four PTTIs will be 160 students. The boys'
schools, to be located in Al-Turbah, Zaidiya and Dhamar, would draw their
students from a large area. As experience with past projects has indicated
the need for provision of boarding facilities for PTTI trainees, the project
t             would include boarding facilities for 90 percent of the male students.  The
girls' school, located in Hajjah, a governorate capital, is already func-
tioning in temporary accommodation. As it would draw its students largely
from the immediate area, no boarding facilities are included for the girls.
With a new PTTI for boys at Dhamar, the existing PTTI at Dhamar will be made
into a girls' PTTI, and thus increase the total number of PTTI spaces for
girls, and correspondingly enhance economic opportunities for women. These
PTTIs would require 52 teachers. These positions are expected to be filled
by experienced Yemeni teachers currently being trained at Eastern Michigan
University (to complete a master's program) under an ongoing project financed
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).



- 12 -
42.       The proposed project would support the Government's new pi-ogfr ,t _%
improve the quality of primary teacher trainees, through the strengthening of
a five-year PTTI program introduced for recruits from among primary schoo3
graduates (paragraph 29).  Technical assistance (consisting of tihre--.
ists for a total of ten man-years) would be provided for adapting the
ing post-primary three-year curriculum to the needs of a five-year progra-
and for preparing the syllabi for individual subjects including mathemaC;
science, social studies and humanities.  USAID has agreed to firnance
foreign exchange costs of this technical assistance.  This should hela ,--
improve the curriculum in the primary schools, thereby contributing towards a
higher retention of the primary school students.
Non-Formal Education (NFE) and District Training Centers (DTCs)
43.       The rural NFE programs which have been implemented so far by MOE
under the IDA-assisted projects have provided community based literacy and
basic occupation and skills training to over 17,000 beneficiaries (para-
graph 33). The training has been provided via District Training Centers
(DTCs) and village training units. In order to expand this training. espe-
cially in remote rural areas, the proposed project provides for the construc-
tion and furnishing of three DTCs in areas currently lacking NFE facilities
and the village training units (paragraph 45). They would include simpLe
boarding facilities for instructor-trainees.
44.       The Government plans to eventually expand the DTC network to cover
every region of YAR. To assist the Government in the development of this
program, and to enhance its effectiveness, the Education Research and
Development Center (ERDC) would conduct a study in close cooperation with the
Department of Non-formal Education (DNE) (Development Credit Agreement,
Schedule 2, Part E). The study would be carried out not later than 1985. It
would assess the additional support needed for education materials
production, instructor training and curriculum development. The proposed
project includes two man-months of specialized technical assistance for the
proposed study. In addition, ERDC would utilize technical assistance
provided under the Fourth Education Project. The Government would exchange
views with the Association on the conclusions and recommendations of the
study, and thereafter implement the recommendations in accordance with a plan
satisfactory to the Association (Development Credit Agreement, Section
4.02(a) and (b)).
Basic Training Facility (BTF)
45.       Under the Second Education Project (Credit 611-YAR), a $I million
basic training fund was set-up to establish village training units in areas
surrounding the District Training Centers. This fund provided the needed
flexibility in responding to and encouraging local initiative. It helped to
support 75 village units. It was administered by the National Board for
Non-Formal Education (NBNFE) according to agreed guidelines. The entire fund
is now fully disbursed; 43 percent of the fund was utilized in providing
buildings and 57 percent for equipment, furniture and educational materials.



- 13 -
The project includes the provision of $1 million equivalent for the further
development of the basic training scheme and the village training units in
accordance with the agreed NBNFE guidelines (Annex to Schedule 2 of the
Development Credit Agreement).
Technical Assistance for the Project.Implementation Unit
46.       To train Yemenis to take over from expatriates the management of
the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established under the First IDA-assisted
*            Education project in line with the Government's objective of Yemenization,
the Third Education project included fellowships for overseas training.
Those currently receiving training abroad would assume their positions in the
coming years. To facilitate a smooth transition, the Government has proposed
that the existing nine expatriate staff managing the PIU be retained in an
advisory capacity. The project therefore includes 18 man-years of technical
assistance for the PIU. To further augment its managerial personnel, the
project also includes 10 fellowships for Yemenis for a total of 8 man-years
for specialized training abroad. The Government expects that it would be
possible for Yemenis to take over fully the management of the PIU by mid-1987.
Project Implementation
47.       The proposed project will be implemented over a period of five and
one-half years. Under the general supervision of the Deputy Minister of
Education, a project coordinator would have the overall responsibility for
the project. To assist it in the revision of the teacher training curriculum
(paragraph 42), and in the evaluation of the DTCs and the basic training
scheme (paragraph 44), the MOE would employ specialists with qualifications,
experience, terms of reference and employment satisfactory to IDA. The MOE
would provide at least one qualified Yemeni counterpart to work with each
specialist on a full-time basis (Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.03(a) and (b)). The PIU would be responsible for the physical aspects of
the project, including architectural designs, procurement, construction
supervision, and maintenance of project accounts. Sites have already been
acquired for all institutions. Preliminary designs for the building have
been approved by IDA, and basic lists of equipment and furniture have been
reviewed by IDA. Detailed construction drawings, equipment specifications
and bid documents for civil works and equipment would be ready by June 30,
1983. The PIU would also coordinate the project accounts, and furnish
audited accounts within six months at the end of each fiscal year
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.01).
Project Costs and Financing
48.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is esti-
mated at about $20.1 million equivalent, of which about 54 percent, or ¢10.8
million equivalent represents the foreign exchange component. Physical con-
tingencies of 10 percent for civil works, furniture and equipment, and 5 per-
cent for technical assistance, are assumed in the cost estimates. Price
contingencies for the period 1983-89 have been applied to all items at rates
ranging between 6.5 percent to 10 percent for locally procured items and



- 14 -
between 6 and 8 percent for foreign expenditures. Experts' services of about
128 man-months have been estimated at an average of about $9,500 per man-
month, and 216 man-months of PIU expatriate staff at about $3,800 per
man-month, including salaries, fees, overhead, international travel and
subsistence. These estimates are based on recent experience in YAR.
49.       The proposed IDA credit of SDRs 9.2 million (approximately $10 mil-
lion equivalent) would finance about 50 percent of the total project costs.
It would finance about 90 percent of the project's foreign exchange require-
ments; the remaining $1.1 million or about 10 percent of the foreign exchange
requirements would be met by USAID. The Government expects to conclude
arrangements for USAID financing before the end of 1983. USAID financing
would be linked to the implementation of the proposed technical assistance
for teacher training curriculum development. Since USAID financing is a part
of the project's financing plan, the Government would make other financing
arrangements satisfactory to the Association if the USAID financing agreement
is not effective by March 31, 1984 (Development Credit Agreement, Section
5.01(a)). Of the estimated local costs of $9.3 million equivalent, the
Government would finance $9.0 million, with the IDA Credit meeting $0.3
million.
Procurement
50.       Civil works contracts (amounting to $12.7 million) would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
World Bank procurement guidelines. Contracts for the construction of village
training facilities estimated at $0.4 million, (average size of about $20,000
each) would be carried out on the basis of local competitive bidding proce-
dures which are satisfactory to the Association. Contracts for furniture and
equipment (amounting to $3.7 million), in excess of $50,000, would be awarded
in accordance with IDA's guidelines for ICB. Small items or groups of items,
estimated to cost less than $50,000, or items of a specialized nature, for
which ICB would not be practical, would be procured under normal Government
procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA, and would include, to the extent
possible, quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers; the
total value of such procurement would not exceed $0.7 million, about 20 per-
cent of the estimated cost of equipment and furniture including contingencies.
Disbursement
51.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed as follows:
(a) civil works, 36 percent of total expenditures for PTTIs and DTCs, and
100 percent for village training units; (b) furniture and equipment, 100 per-
cent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory,
for locally manufactured items and 85 percent of local expenditures for items
procured locally; (c) technical assistance and training, 100 percent of
foreign expenditures; and (d) operating expenditures of DTC activities,
100 percent. The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1989.



- 15 -
Project Benefits and Risks
52.       The principal benefits of this project are:  (a) an anticipated
annual addition of about 130 teachers, amounting to 5 percent of the annual
requirements; (b) an improvement in the quality of teacher training through a
revision of the curriculum, which would eventually lead to improved teaching
methods and help reduce students' drop-out ratios; (c) increased participa-
tion of women in the teaching profession, and provide an increase in the
enrollment of girls in primary schools; and (d) a better regional distribu-
*            tion of teacher training facilities, which would lead to an improvement in
the educational facilities in rural areas.
53.       Through its support of non-formal education, the project would
expect to provide additional literacy and basic skills training in rural
areas, for about 15,000 persons every year and promote the participation of
women in development.
54.       The project faces some risks, arising from major changes in the
PTTI curriculum, and the possible low enrollment in the new PTTIs. With the
provision of technical assistance for curriculum revision, the incentives for
teacher trainees, and the relatively small number of recruits to be obtained
from a potentially large number of eligible candidates, the risks have been
reduced to the minimum.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Yemen Arab
Republic and the Association and the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Association's Articles of Agreement are
being distributed to the Executive Directors serparately.
56.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in Section III of Annex III.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
