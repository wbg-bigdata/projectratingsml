MEMORANDUM AND RECOeMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE. INTERNATtONAL DEVELOPMEN ASSCIATION
To THE EXECUTIVE DIRECT
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE YEMEN ARBRPBI  YAR)
FOR AN INTTTOAL DEVELOPMENT FRULCADNIT TONPROJECT
1.       The following mnemorandum and recoummendations on a proposed
development credit to the Yemen Arab Republic (yAR) in the amount of SDR-8.2-
million (U1S$10.8 million equivalent) is. submitted for apprqval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 49 years maturity and would help
finance the Institutional Development -for Public Administration Project. The
Government of YAR would contribute the remainiing US$4.6 million equivalent of-
the project cost.
2.       Background.  Over the last two decades, YAR has experienced
far-reaching changes in its socioeconomic structure. Although the Government
bas made commendable progress in-astablishing the foundations of a modern
state in an ~essentially tr'ibal society, serious problems remain. In
particular, YAR's public institutions continue to exhibit widespread technical
and managerial weaknesses, especially at~ upper-_ and middle-management levels, -
which limit the country's.capability to manage the increasingly complex issues
in economic and social development and seriously constrain the country's
development efforts. *The"Government,has passed through many phases in which
responsibility of public administration development was assigned anid then
reassig'ned among several agencies, departiments and committees. *This ad hoc
stage came to an end when the Government, recognizing the shortcomings of-its
administrative'structure and the shortages of skilled staff it faces
established a Ministry of Civil Service and Admbinistration Reform (NCSAR) in
.1981. MCSAR was given a comprehensive mandate for planning and implementing
the required structural and managerial developmei~t of the public servicei. The 
National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA)9 which is responsible for
all types of in-service training for the civil service and the public sector,
was formally attached to it. In addition, a Supreme Committee for Civil
Service and Administrative Reform, with the Prime Minister as its chairman,
was created as the highest authority for administrative development.
Unfortunately, skills shortages, lack of adequate facilities, and
institutional deficiencies within MCSAR and' NIPA themselves have retarded the
process of developing a more adequate civil service in YAR. Assessment of
this unsatisfactory progress has led to a strong commitment of top decision
makers, including the President, to improve the public administration, as
evidenced by the high priority given to administrative reform by the Third
7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Five-Year Plan (1987-91).
3.       Proiect Objectives.  The proposed Project is designed to make a
significant, though modest, contribution to the Government's efforts to
improve public administration through the institutional development of MCSAR
and NIPA. The objectives of the p'roposed Project are Ci) to improve MCSAR's



capacity to fulfill Its operational and advisory obligations to government
agencies for manpower and training planning, personnel administration, and
various aspects of operational and procedural effectiveness; and (ii) to
improve NIPA's capability to provide education, training, research and
consultancy services.
4.       Prolect Description.  To achieve these objectives, the proposed
Project would strengthen both MCSAR and NIPA through technical assistance
(TA), staff development and logistical support. This backing would help
MCSAR: (i) evaluate and improve the quality of government operations and
management, and personnel and administrative policies, and manpower and-
training planning of government agencies; (ii) establish a management
information system for the civil service and the public sector; and (iii)
assess the consistency of its own structure with respect to its functions and
responsibilities. The Project would help NIPA: (i) improve the quality,
efficiency and coverage of education, training and research, and strengthev
consultancy programs; [ii) meet its staff shortages through expatriate teacher
support while Yemeni staff are away on fellowships; (iii) develop a long-term
strategic plan for manpower development in the public sector; and (iv)
establish appropriate institutional decision-making structures and processes.
Project implementation would take seven years, with MCSAR and NIPA responsible
for implementing their respective components. The total cost of the proposed
Project is estimated at US$15.4 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$10.2 million. A breakdown of the costs and financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in YAR are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report-No. 7626-YAR of April 17, 1989 is also
attached.
5.       Actions Agreed.  A ;etailed list of issues and actions discussed at
negotiations are presented iu the Staff Appraisal Report. The main issues and
actions agreed upon are summarized as follows: the Government provided
satisfactory shortlists of agencies and institutions capable of executing the
project-financed TA components for MCSAR and NIPA. It also provided
satisfactory evidence that: (i) the training design study (supported by a
project preparation facility amounting to US$400,000) for MCSAR staff has
already started; and (ii) project implementation teams at MCSAR and NIPA have
been appointed. Moreover, the Government provided assurances that (i)
long-term plan for NIPA's activities and appropriate structure and decision
making process to help implement it will be submitted to IDA and jointly
reviewed with it by July 31, 1990; (ii) an appropriate number of counterparts
would be assigned to each expert/consultant and fellowship training awards
would be based on criteria acceptable to IDA; (iii) both MCSAR and NIPA would
establish a mechanism to monitor the performance of Yemeni trainees; and (iv)
it will submit and jointly review with IDA, by December 1989, the findings,
recommendations and follow-up action plans for the studies on personnel
administration and the assessment of MCSAR's organization structuze. (These
studies are supported by a project preparation facility.) As conditions for
disbursement of IDA credit, the Government agreed to submit two detailed



3
action plans sat.isfactory to IDA (one for the implementation of TA for the
MCSAR component and another for the NIPA component).
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA supports the Government's policy,
as expressed in tbe Third Ftve-Year Plan, to develop its human resources and
to  improve the performance of the public administration in general, and of
MCSAR and NIPA in particular.  Since the early-1910s, the thrust of IDA's
assistance strategy has continued to focus, inter alia, on helping the-
Government develop sustainable growth with an emphasis 'on longrterm
development of sikilled manpower, and on creating and maintaining the
institutional capacity appropriate to requirements in public administrat$pn.
The 1989 country strategy paper confirms the need for such continued
emphasis.  Moreover, IJA's assistance to NIPA under the Third (Cr. 915-YAR)
and Sixth (Cr. 1470-YAR)-Education Projects (consultancy services,
fellowships, and buildings and equipment for its excension centers at tais and
Hodeidah) needs to be continued to further develop NIPA as an effective
training institution. The proposed Project would break new ground by
financing the institutional development of MCSAR and NIPA and is expected to
lead to further IDA financing in subsequent phases of public administration
development in YAR through constructive policy dialogue in the sector.
7.       Benefits.  The proposed Project would be instrumental in making
possible the early modernization of the YAR public administration and its
in-service training capability. With improved facilities and equipment,
significant increases in the number of trained Yemeni staff,, and consultancy        '
support in priority areas, major benefits of the proposed Project are expected
to result from improvements in: (i) HCSAR's capacity to plan and manage
change in the areas of personnel administration and structure and operations
of government agencies; (ii) manpower and training planning by MCiiAR for the
public sector; (iii) training of some 8,000 civil servants during the life of
the Project and NIPA's improved capacity to train civil servants according to
client's needs far beyond the life of the Project.
8.       Risks.  The main risks associated with the proposed Project relate to
(i) the slow implementation of TA in the various IDA-financed projects and
(ii) MCSAR's involvement, for the first time. in an IDA-supported project.
The risk of slow implementation of TA would be mitigated by: (i) TA designed
with the input of both MCSAR and NIPA and using carefully prepared
implementation schedules based on absorptive capacity; -(ii) that a training
design study for MCSAR has started before negotiations; (iii) counterpart
staff has already been selected and criteria for the selection of candidates
for fellowship training has been established; (iv) detailed action plans for
the implementation of the TA packages will be finalized before disbursement;
and (v) agreement on frequent joint reviews of the project implementation.
The risks due to MCSAR's involvement in an IDA credit for the first time has
been reduced by the appointment of the project implementation staff before
negotiations and IDA's assistance in their training through a PPF advance.
