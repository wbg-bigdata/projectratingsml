EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
In connection with the privatisation process of ZCCM, the World Bank will support a Mine
Township Services (MTS) Project on the Copperbelt in Zambia. The main objective of the
MTSP is to support the provision of efficient and reliable water supply services, wastewater
services and solid waste arrangement in identified townships under five present and previous
divisions of ZCCM. The project is estimated at US $ 36.6 million.
The investment plan for rehabilitation works includes i) water systems, ii) water system
metering, iii) community metering and iv) sewage systems of the ZCCM Divisions and
mining company of Nkana Division, Kitwe, Mufulira Division, Mufulira, Nchanga Division,
Chingola, Konkola Division Chililabombwe and Roan Antelope Mine Corporation (RAMC
(Z) Plc), Luanshya.
Investment in solid waste management is not included in the investment plan, since this is
assumed to be incorporated in a follow-on Urban Development Project. However, the EA
Study Report includes a proposed description of a solid waste component with an investment
budget.
The Bank classified the MTS Project as Category B for the purpose of this EA. The EA
reflects the ToR - first drafted in an Environmental Reconnaissance Report, the relevant WB
operational directives, and the outline of the project in the Pre-Appraisal Aide Memoire.
During the course of the work, some technical and operational issues indirectly linked to the
focus of the EA came to light. These issues with recommendations are dealt with in a separate
appendix (H).
The main focus of the proposed Project is rehabilitation and new management of water
supply, sanitation and solid waste services. Environmental aspects of the Project are by
default directly linked to the investment plan and operation and maintenance of the
installations. With sufficient investment in rehabilitation and some new installations, and
proper management, operation and maintenance procedures being followed by well trained
staff, the Project would impose only minor environmental impacts. Consequently the focus of
the EA Study is on the investment and training required to bring the management, operations
and maintenance up on an appropriate level to meet the environmental and other requirements
set down by the Authorities of Zambia and the WB's OPs and ODs.
The EA Study Report is basically structured as follows: Following an introductory Chapter, a
review is offered of the policy, legal and administrative framework in Zambia, which governs
the management of water resources, water supply and sanitation, solid waste and
environmental assessment. Chapter 3 is a brief overview of the national and regional
environmental and social setting for the MTS Project. Chapter 4 presents the EA of the water
supply and sanitation proposals, including a section on the hydrology of upper Kafue River
basin. The Chapter first discusses issues common to all divisions and each area is then
considered in tum. Chapter 5 presents the present solid waste management services and a
proposed new solid waste management component of the Project. Chapter 6 outlines an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the MTS Project with institutional
responsibilities and a budget for resettlement, training and technical assistance.

Mine Township Services Project
National and Regional Environmental Setting
The Project area is situated in the Copperbelt Province in the upper Kafue River basin.
Copperbelt, as most of Zambia lies on the central African plateau with an altitude of around
1300 m asl. In upper Kafue basin the rain season normally starts in October and lasts till April
with 1200 - 1300 mm rainfall.
The flow regime of upper Kafue River basin is influenced by human interventions in addition
to geophysical characteristics of the basin and a number of water use and management
activities are taking place. Kafue River and its tributaries are the main source of water for a
majority of the population of Zambia, with demands from agriculture, domestic and industrial
activities including mining attached to it. Wastewater is in addition generated by the various
water use activities with retum flows into Kafuie River.
The high population densities on the Copperbelt, together with high levels of industrial,
mining and commercial activities have had an adverse impact on the environment, in
particular effects related to water and air pollution, solid waste generation, deforestation and
overcrowding in shanty townships and illegal settlements. Most of the land surrounding the
mine towns is owned by ZCCM and its successors. Forest plantations comprise a significant
land use besides commercial farming on state land around the towns.
There is a significant difference in the composition of the population (1,427 mill. - 1990) on
the Copperbelt compared to other regions of the country, with higher figures of males than of
females (there are more females than males on the national level). This is due to large
numbers of males seeking employment on the Copperbelt, however, with a current decline
due to a slow down in the mining activities.
Assessment of Water Supply and Sewage Systems
The Report offers an analysis of flow data of the upper Kafue River basin, e.g. upstream of
Mpatamatu 25 km south-west of Luanshya. Upper Kafue constitutes 11,520 km2 drainage
area of a total of 156,995 km2. However, the water resources of the Copperbelt are estimated
at some 150 m3/s of a total of 342 m3/s for the whole of Kafue River basin. It is estimated
that 21 % of the rainfall is converted to run-off.
There are 126 water rights on the Copperbelt with about 0,97 mill m3/d against the potential
of 12,9 mill m3/d. A general trend is that more water is added to the Kafue River in the upper
basin than is extracted from it, as there is a clear and distinctive influence of human activities
on the water regime. The general conclusion drawn from the flow data analysis is that there
are abundant surface water resources to meet current and projected water demands in the
mining townships.
On a national basis there is no regular sampling of water to record water quality since the
resources of the DWA are not sufficient. However, ZCCM has maintained water quality
monitoring related to mining activities (Cu, Co, TDS and TSS) at about 30 locations on the
Copperbelt. The test data are only of limited value as baseline data for environmental
monitoring of the Project.
It is assumed that the impacts on aquatic life in the Kafue River basin will be minimal from
the Project compared -to impacts from mining operations. The Report recommends
investments and mitigating measures, which considerably will reduce the level of impacts

Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework
In 1994 GRZ adopted a water policy document. The national water policy is based on seven
key principles: i) Separation of water resources management from water supply and
sanitation, ii) Sepamtion of regulatory and executive functions, iii) Devolution of authority to
local authorities and private enterprises, iv) Full.cost recovery in the long run, v) Human
resources development leading to more effective institutions, vi) Technology appropriate to
local conditions, and vii) Increased GRZ priority and budget spending to the sector.
A new regulatory body, the National Water and Sanitation Council (NWASCO) has recently
been put in place under the Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD) in
compliance with the new Water and Sanitation Act of 1997.
Water resources management is the responsibility of MEWD and a Water Development
Board (WDB). WDB is presently in the process of preparing a Water Resources Action
Program (WRAP) and an inception report is being prepared as basis for donor support for
WRAP. It is assumed that Kafue River basin will be used as a pilot project in developing a
new model for water resources management in Zambia. Most of the raw water drawn for the
schemes of the Project is from Kafue River or its tributaries in the upper Kafue.
A work group under the Water Sector Reforms Support Unit (RSU) in 1997 presented a
proposal for national environmental sanitation strategy for rural and peri-urban areas in
Zambia, including solid waste disposal. This initiative was in line with the GRZ Health
Reform's priority on preventive health measures.
Legislation relevant for the Project and its operation under AHC and a PO includes the
following laws and regulations briefly described in the Report: Water Pollution Control
(Effluent and Waste Water) Regulations, Statutory Instrument No 72/1993; Water Act 1949
(Chapter 198 of the Laws of Zamnbia); Water and Sanitation Act No 28/1997; Waste
Management (Licensing of Transporters of Wastes and Waste Disposal Sites (Regulations).
Statutory Instrument No 71/1993; Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act No
12/1990; Environmental Protection and Pollution Control (Environmental Impact
Assessment) Regulations. Statutory Instrument No 28/1997; Land Acquisition Act No 2/1970
and the Public Health Act.
The institutional framework is described with an outline of roles and responsibilities of the
main stakeholders of the Project. These include the ZCCM (owner of AHC-MMS) with its
Group Environmental Services, AHC Municipal Services Ltd. and the future Private Operator
(PO). Other institutions with roles and responsibilities related to the Project are: Ministry of
Local Government and Housing (MLGH) with municipal councils and three commercial
utility companies on the Copperbelt, NWASCO and RSU, WDB, Ministry of Health (MOH),
Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) and Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development
(MMMD).

Mine Township Services Project
Of issues related specificall) to water supply, WTP sludge and backwash water should be
disposed of in an environmentally sound way. It should in this regard be considered to install
alum recovery plant(s), which may be economically feasible.
It has previously been mentioned that Kafue River basin represent an abundant surface source
of water for the schemes under the Project. However, in certain cases abandoned mine shafts
may be used in the same way as bore holes for the provision of raw water.
The presence of water hyacinth on sewage ponds is dealt with under issues specifically
related to sewage and sewerage. It was found that the water weed, subject to certain
provisions, may actually assist in cleaning up the sewage. The provisos are that there is an
adequate area of aerobic ponds following from any pond covered by hyacinth and that the
weed is harvested in the full growth stage.
Observations made with regard to the fauna in most of the sewage pond systems indicated
that treatment is taking place and that oxygen is being absorbed into the water (the presents of
frogs and fish). The presents of crocodiles is a further indication of the presents of food.
However, crocodiles represent a real danger to the workers and will prevent necessary
operational and maintenance work to be carried out. It is therefor recommended that the
crocodiles be killed by the Crocodiles Farmers Association of Zambia who is authorised to
deal with the animals. The population of crocodiles is on the increase in Zambia, and the
number to be dealt with in this manner will be relatively small.
Sewage effluent standards are to a certain degree monitored by the ZCCM divisions and
RAMC (Z). At face value the available analysis would suggest that the present effluent
discharges in general meet the standards set down by ECZ (for the parameters being
measured), but it is believed that the values are false indicators. This is based on observations
of blocked and leaking sewer pipes, sewage diverted to irrigation and non functional pumps,
which would indicate that the amount of sewer reaching the ponds is lower that estimated.
The ECZ standard for coliform is too high for irrigation use of effluent water, as quoted by
WHO. The Report offers a set of parameters and values on a limited sample basis that may be
effectively applied in test regimes for environmental monitoring. It is also recommended that
sufficient funds is set aside in the rehabilitation budget for expansion of sewage treatment
systems where required to meet the recommended standards.
A summary of the recommendations, as indicated above is offered at the end of the Section on
common issues. The recommendations are incorporated as actions in the EMP in Chapter 6.
Each of the five divisions is dealt with separately. The existing water and sanitation systems
are described in the field reports in Appendix E. Each Section describes the current
environmental situation, analyses supply and demand projections and discusses significant
and minor environmental effects. The proposed investment (rehabilitation) program for each
division is attached in a table in each Section, with comments related to environmental
aspects. Environmental assessments are done on each component of the Project from the raw
water intake, through the WTP, the water transmission and reticulation systems, transmission
booster pump stations, to sewage systems, treatment and discharge of effluent. Analysis on
alternatives is done only for Nkana where the team was requested to look into water supply
for Kalulushi. A summary of recommendations is offered at the end of each Section.
The following recommendations made are included in the EMP:

from the present operations, in particular sewage effluent. Sewage from present operations
contributes less than 1.5 % of TSS in the Kafue River, and this does not exceed 4 % under
maximum conditions. However, with regard to Luanshya it is assumed that effluent from
sewage ponds has permanently changed the ecological system of in particular the
Nkulumashiba stream, which flows into Kafue River and to some degree the Luanshya
stream, which flows into Kafubu River and further downstream into Kafue River. Kafubu
River is also polluted from discharge of sewage from Ndola City.
No need for involuntary resettlement has been identified as a direct consequence of the
Project.
The draft management contract for the PO was not available for the EA Study Team.
However, in recognising the importance of quality assurance monitoring of such a contract, it
is recommended to build checks and balances into the contract, in particular related to
monitoring of quantity and quality of raw water, waste water management, e.g. quality of
treated effluents, and equipment investments.
The EA Study disclosed that there is a profound lack of operator skills and knowledge, in
particular related to knowledge of how processes function and why certain actions should be
carried out. This will in many instances have a bearing on the quality of treatment processes
and thus on the degree of environmental impacts. The EA Report suggests that a training
component should be included in the Project and refers to the Competence Based Modular
Training (CBMT) system for operators of water supply and sanitation schemes that will soon
start at Nortec in Ndola. It is understood that the management contract will include incentives
for the PO to finance training of staff.
The study also disclosed that there is a risk of cross contamination of water supplies by
workers assigned to duties both on sewage treatment and water treatment, and recommends
separation of workers, one group dealing with clean water and one group dealing with dirty
water. Medical checks every six months are recommended for water workers. With regard to
laboratory facilities for regular quality assurance and environmental monitoring, the Report
recommends that an assessment should be made of the need, and an appraisal done on how
this can be best met under the Project.
The issue of national statutes conceming environmental control and monitoring is not part of
the EA Study as such. However, statutes and license conditions will have a bearing on
compliance with the conditions and how environmental monitoring is carried out. The study
disclosed two important aspects related to this. The statutory instrument for, for example
sewage effluent has standards (number of determinants) that are not possible for a service
provider in Zambia to meet in practice. On the other hand, monitoring and control by the
statutory authority the ECZ, in this case and also regarding solid waste management, is at best
rudimentary, if at all carried out. The Report recommends that NWASCO should set up a
working party to carry out a joint review of standards, licenses and enforcement procedures
for water supply and sewage.
With regard to construction work under the Project close supervision is recommended to
minimise the risks attached to construction work for workers and nearby residents. Co-
ordinated plans for rehabilitation of sewage and water reticulation networks should be worked
out for each area.

Other recommendations offered, and included in the EMP are: Amendment of contracts'
specifications for collection and transport (if required); Establishment of bore holes or wells
in the vicinity of the dumpsites for Nkana, Nchanga, Konkola and Luanshya; Development of
a regular monitoring program with parameters, sample procedures, schedules and test regime
for ground water samples (and surface water downstream of Uchi); Proper management and
monitoring procedures to be worked out for Uchi as a matter of urgency, and a fee imposed
on waste being dumped by the council and others, not allowing hazardous waste on the site;
Disposal of waste for Mufulira should be concentrated on one of the three tailings dams now
in use; Access to be opened to the chosen quarry at Luanshya and the dumping in the bush
should be stopped immediately.
On analysis of altematives it is not recommended to change the structure of collection,
transport and disposal of solid waste from the mine townships for the duration of the five
years Project period. However, the Report recommends a feasibility study on solid waste
management altematives on the Copperbelt to be carried out as a component of the proposed
Urban Development Project.
The Report recommends a Solid Waste Management component under the MTSP and
outlines this in a number of sub-components/activities. A proposed investment budget amount
to US $ 950,000, including replacement/repair of 50 % of the bins and slabs used for
collection of refuse in the mine townships. This will be funded under the follow-on UDP and
through intemal cash guarantee in the project.
Environmental Management Plan
Physical aspects of the Project involve operation and maintenance, rehabilitation and
upgrading of existing facilities for water supply, sanitation and solid waste services, and
possibly increased discharge of effluents. The EA Study focuses both on existing
environmental problems that should be mitigated through implementation of the Project and
problems being caused by implementation of the Project itself. Recommendations on
environmental aspects made throughout the Report are contained in the EMP outlined in
Chapter 6. These are classified as issues common to all divisions regarding water supply and
sewage (environmental management and monitoring and mitigating measures), water supply
and sanitation operational procedures, division specific water and sewage issues (mitigating
measures) and EMP for solid waste management. In a matrix, the EMP outlines
actions/measures to be taken, monitoring parameters, frequency and timing, responsible entity
and who to report to.
Three distinctive aspects or roles of institutional responsibilities with regard to the EMP are
outlined in the Chapter: Implementation of the action plan component of the EMP,
monitoring of the implementation of the EMP and mitigating measures and independent
environmental review and control of the planned and approved actions and the monitoring
data and results. Primary responsibility for the two first aspects will rest with the AHC and
v               PO with assistance of the ZCCM Group Environmental Services, while a number of statutory
authorities will be responsible for the third aspect. These are NWASCO, ECZ, MOH,
WDB/DWA and Municipal Councils.
Institutional capacity building and training is discussed in a separate section to underline the
importance of this issue in relation to environmental monitoring, and a recommendation is

Mine Township Services Project
Nkana: A raw water reservoir should be constructed at Kafue River intake and flood levels
should be established in relation to any risk of flooding of the intake pumps.
Nchanga: A water storage tank is required at the intake in case the source is not shifted to
mine shaft water. Backwash water and sludge should be discharge to a tailings leach settling
tank across the road for the WTP.
Mufulira: The tailings dam adjacent to Mufulira Stream intake should be protected to prevent
ingress of pollutant matter, if required, the 17h Street pump station should be separated from
the sewage pump station, Kankoyo North and South sewage ponds should be replaced with
new combined sewage ponds, and the remaining three sewage pond systems all require
upgrading to accept 2005 flows, and all sewage pumping stations should be repaired.
Konkola: In case a clarifier is installed, a tank should be installed to receive all backwash
water and pump this back for re-processing, the proper ground investigations should be made
at the Kamwenza reservoir and the old one should be cleared away, maturation ponds should
be added to the Golf Course pond system and the Kamwenza ponds should be closed.
RAMC (Z) (Luanshya): Maturation ponds to be added to the Roan sewage ponds,
Mpatamatu sewage ponds need urgent reconstruction and rehabilitation of three sewage pump
stations is urgently needed.
Provided that the recommendations offered in the Report are followed up in the Project, the
Project should represent only minor environmental effects with regard to the water supply and
sanitation components.
Assessment of Solid Waste
The solid waste component was introduced into the Project during the Pre-Appraisal Mission
in May/June 1999, and consequently the final ER Report presented a brief of the mine
townships' solid waste management situation. In accordance with the ToR, Chapter 5 also
comes up with an investment program required to bring the solid waste management in line
with established environmental regulations and licenses issued by ECZ.
Most issues observed and assessed related to solid waste management are common to all
divisions. These include waste contents and production, collection and transport, waste
disposal and the socio-economic dimensions related to solid waste. Tables with a summary of
solid waste production and costs and separate ones for each division are offered.
A number of observations were made. The most significant ones concern discrepancies in
available data on production and costs and the general low standard of operation, control and
environmental protection of the dumpsites. Most of the standards laid down in ECZ licenses
are not complied with, apparently resulting in no actions from ECZ. Significant
environmental effects would be likely from operations of the Uchi dumpsite under Nkana
division in Kitwe. This dumpsite also receives waste collected by the City Council, as well as
industrial and commercial waste, without any monitoring or control.
A particular problem is represented by scavengers on all sites, and a study is recommended to
establish the economics of scavenging and the likely socio-economic consequences of
stopping it.

made for engagement of an Environmental Assessment Advisor. The EA Advisor should be
in an independent position as advisor to the AHC Managing Director, outside the line
functions of the company.
A cost estimate for implementation of the EMP is offered, including a sum for capacity
building and training, TA/consultants and studies. The budget totals US $ 400,000. It is
assumed that all other costs related to the recommendations of the EMP shall be covered
either under the ordinary operational budget of AHC/MTSP or under the investment program
budget, incorporating the solid waste management component. Additional investments
required to meet the environmental standards for water supply and sewage effluent are
tentatively estimated to a minimum of US $ 2,465,000.
A separate section of Chapter 6 also offers test regimes and parameters for water quality and
sewage effluent monitoring.
With regards to HI V/AIDS, about US$ 200,000 has been earmarked to increase awareness of
HIV/AIDS throughout the community and to provide specific support to employees of the
private operator and their families. The MSTP is not anticipated to significantly increase the
risk of HIV infection in the mining townships - it is not a typical infrastructure and mine
project that draws workers away from their families and increases commercial sex work in the
area. The funds will also support the Govemment's multi-sectoral, multi-partner program for
the prevention and mitigation of HIV/AIDS.
Finally, a stakeholders workshop and public consultation were held on October 28, 1999. The
facilitators of the workshop gave a brief presentation of the EA Study Report with its findings
and recommendations. A number of useful comments and corrections of a few technical
issues. Additional details of the public consultation are given in Appendix B of this report.

Mine Township Services Project
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1    Background
Zambia embarked on a structural adjustment program in 1991 and various sectors are still
being reconstructed. The country's environmental problems have been identified and
solutions proposed from the World Bank's perspective in a National Environmental Action
Plan (NEAP) and in the SAR (I 6239-ZA) on the Environmental Support Program (ZM-PA-
3253). Another key aspect of the policies of the current Government is its privatisation
program. It is in this respect that GRZ in the recent years has been in the process of selling off
the mining assets and operations of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) The
divisions situated in Kalulushi and Luanshya on the Copperbelt have thus been sold, and
negotiations have for some time been underway regarding the sale of the rest of the assets.
Within the context of the current negotiations on the sale of the remaining ZCCM assets,
private investors have been unwilling to take responsibility for assets that are not directly
linked with mining operations. The investors consider municipal services traditionally being
offered by ZCCM to its workers and their families as non-core businesses. These non-core
assets include those needed for the provision of mine township services: water and sanitation,
solid waste, storm-water drains, street lightening, maintenance of township roads, cemeteries,
and electricity distribution.
The investors are looking to GRZ to provide mechanisms that will assure the continuation of
an adequate and reliable range of vital urban services for company employees, their
dependants and other residents of the mine townships. If the investors are not confident that
these services will continue to be adequately provided, the sale of the mines may be
significantly delayed, with negative economic consequences for the country.
1.2    Overview of the Project
In connection with the privatisation process of ZCCM, the World Bank will support a Mine
Township Services (MTS) Project. An identification mission from the Bank visited Zambia in
February/March 1999 and the Pre-Appraisal Mission in May-June outlined the proposed
MTSP, including water supply, sewage and solid waste services in the mine townships of five
present and previous divisions of ZCCM. The other municipal services will probably be taken
over by the Municipal Councils and ZESCO.
The main objective of the MTSP is to support the provision of efficient and reliable water
supply services, wastewater services and solid waste management in the identified townships
during a transition period following the privatisation of ZCCM. The Project is estimated at
US$36.6 million.
The preliminary investment plan or capital works/rehabilitation budget includes the following
items: i) Water System, ii) Water System Metering, iii) Metering and iv) Sewage System of
the following ZCCM Divisions/Mining Company:
* Nkana Division, Kitwe
* Mufulira Division, Mufulira
* Nchanga Division, Chingola
* Konkola Division, Chililabombwe
* Roan Antelope Mine Corporation (RAMC (Z) Plc), Luanshya

Mine Township Services Project
The capital works/rehabilitation budget does not indicate any investments in solid waste
collection and disposal. Investments in solid waste management are programmed under a
follow-on Urban Development Project. Since the AHC during the transition period, and later
the PO will be responsible also for the solid waste from the mine townships, the EA Study
Report include a proposed description of these services during the Project period, with a
preliminary investment budget.
The water supply and sanitation systems under the above mentioned Divisions/Company are
described in an Environmental Impact Statement Report (ZCCM 1997) and a report on
Transformation of Municipal Services post ZCCM Privatisation (ZCCM 1998). The last
report also briefly describes solid waste collection, and this was further detailed in an
Environmental Reconnaissance (ER) Report (ICI 1999). The figures given by the ZCCM
report on solid waste generated are probably on the high side (WB I 999b). In addition to the
Consultant's own observations and the WB technical descriptions, the two mentioned reports
and detailed descriptions provided by ZCCM are used as references for the descriptions of the
water supply and sanitation systems in Appendix E of this Report.
The following water supply and sanitation systems, and solid waste collection are not
included in the Project: i) Nampundwe Mine (for a population of 6.000), ii) Kabwe (being
sold to the City council), iii) Kansanshi Mine (small plants, solid waste only from a guest
house) and iv) Chibuluma Mines Plc, Kalulushi (treated water sold to the Council and solid
waste collected by the Council).
1.3   Scope of the Environmental Assessment
The MTS Project is classified as Category B by the WB for the purposes of the EA, and this
EA Study report was prepared in accordance with WB practises for such projects.
Comprehensive Terms of Reference (ToR) were drafted in the ER report (ICI 1999) and
refined by the WB (Appendix A).. The ToR reflect the WB operational directives and the
outline of the Project in the Aid Memoire of the Pre-appraisal mission. The EA Study was
further scoped in the ER report. Observations made by the EA Team during the field visits
and initial discussions with ZCCM, AHC and officials of the Environmental Council of
Zambia (ECZ), basically confirmed the scope of the study as outlined in the ER report.
However, during the course of the work of the EA Team, some important issues regarding the
Project came to light, indirectly linked to the focus of the EA. These issues mainly have to do
with the proposed investment plan for water supply and sewage systems and technical
operational and maintenance issues. These issues are dealt with in a separate Appendix H for
the benefit of Project Appraisal.
It should, however, be noted here that the main focus of the proposed Project is rehabilitation
and new management of the water supply, sanitation and solid waste services. Environmental
aspects of the Project are therefore by default directly linked to the Project's investment
program and operation and maintenance of the installations. With sufficient investment in
rehabilitation of existing and some new installations, and proper management, operation and
maintenance procedures being followed by well trained staff, the Project would impose only
minor environmental impacts.
Consequently, the focus of the EA Study is on the investments and training required to bring
the management, operations and maintenance up on an appropriate level to meet the
environmental and other requirements set down by the Authorities of Zambia and the WB's
OPs and ODs. On achieving this aim, which will result in positive environmental impacts

compared with the present situation, it is neither possible nor desirable to isolate
environmental management, monitoring and mitigation measures from the operations of the
services itself.
For an analysis of the required investments in view of the environmental aspects of the
Project, it was found appropriate to also include an analysis of supply and demand projections
and a table with environment related comments to the proposed investments under each
division. The supply and demand projections have, however, not taken into account a possible
reduction in the level of supply following increased customer tariffs and improved metering
systems.
The scope of the EA of the solid waste management component focuses on investment,
operational procedures and training required to bring the operations of collection, transport
and disposal of solid waste up to the standards required in the licenses issued by ECZ.
1.4    Study Area
The core areas for the study include areas covered and influenced by water supply, sewage
and solid waste systems of the ZCCM Divisions/Mining Company listed in Section 1.2, e.g.
in Kitwe, Mufulira, Chingola, Chililabombwe and Luanshya.
Areas covered by the EA study are in particular those, which are the focus of the urban water,
supply and sanitation investments of the Project as well as the solid waste services. Included
are the water intake areas, wastewater discharge locations, and affected water surface waters,
and the main catchment which supply them, mine shafts (providing raw water for the
systems), as well as solid waste disposal sites and their surroundings. In part the study area
covers areas developed by the mines and affected by mines' operations. Interfaces with
environmental impacts of the mines' operations were also clarified. (The precise boundaries
of the study area for the assessment are still being defined by the presently ongoing exercise
of transferring assets from ZCCM to the AHC). Environmental assessment of the mines'
operations as such is outside the scope of work of this EA.
A map of Copperbelt is included in Figure 1.1 on page 6.
1.5    Structure of the Report
Following this introduction is a review of the policy, legal and administrative framework in
Zambia, which governs the management of water resources, water supply and sanitation, solid
waste and environmental assessment (Chapter 2), in addition to the AHC. In Chapter 3 is a
brief overview of the national and regional environmental and social setting for the MTS
Project.
Chapter 4 presents the EA of the water supply and sanitation proposals for the mine
townships in the five areas included in the Project - Kitwe, Chingola, Mufulira,
Chililabombwe and Luanshya. The Chapter begins with a discussion of issues common to all
the areas, including an assessment of water resources issues of the upper part of the Kafue
River catchment area. Each area program is then considered in turn; the assessment
recommendations summarised at the end of each area section, for inclusion in the EMP.
Possible alternatives were considered for each of the five Divisions, and an assessment is
included under the respective Section only when there would be realistic alternatives.

The Team chose to consider the solid waste operations separatelv from water and sanitation.
and Chapter 5 presents the assessment of this component of the Project. The same pattern as
in Chapter 4 is, however, followed.
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the MTS Project is then presented in Chapter
6 of the EA Report.
A set of photographs of the water supply, sanitation and solid waste installations and present
operations are contained in a separate Volume 11 issued together with the final report.
Seven appendices complete the report. The first (A) is the Terms of Reference for the EA
Study. The second (B) comprises a presentation of the team members and division of tasks
among team members, the work schedule, stakeholders workshop and public display and
consultation. People/organisations consulted are listed in the third appendix (C) and the texts
to be used on posters for the public display and consultation are presented in Appendix D.
The Plant Status Field Reports are presented in Appendix E, and an overview of sewage
ponds design is offered in Appendix F. Appendix G offers assessment and recommendations
on investment and operational aspects of the Project, indirectly linked to the environmental
aspects.

2.    POLICY, LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
2.1    National Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Polices
In 1994 GRZ adopted a Water Policy document in reference to the Water Sector Reforms. A
new Water Supply and Sanitation Act was enacted in 1997 (MEWD 1997), and the regulatory
body, the National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO) is presently being put in
place under the Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD). Local Authorities
(Councils) are in principle responsible for the provision of urban water and sanitation
services, but other operators may be licensed by NWASCO for the provision of such services.
The Councils on the Copperbelt have in reference to the new Act established three joint
venture commercial utility water supply and sewerage companies. It is expected that these
companies will take over the Councils' urban water supply and sanitation services over the
coming year or so. An inter-ministerial unit, the Water Sector Reform Support Unit (RSU) is
vested with the responsibility of supporting the implementation of the water sector reforms.
The national water policy as approved by the Government is based on the following seven
principles:
3 Separation of water resources management from water supply and sanitation;
* Separation of regulatory and executive functions;
* Devolution of authority to local authorities and private enterprises;
* Full cost recovery in the long run;
* Human resources development leading to more effective institutions;
* Technology appropriate to local conditions;
* Increased GRZ priority and budget spending to the sector.
With regard to the; principle of full cost recovery on the long run, the GRZ has adopted a
principle of lifeline tariffs for the poorer segments of the population and intemal cross
subsidies to be built into the tariff systems.
Investment support to water supply and sanitation is channelled through the Ministry of Local
Government and Housing (MLGH).
Water resources management is the responsibility of the MEWD and a Water Development
Board (WDB). With logistical support from the Department of Water Affairs (DWA), the
WDB is presently in the process of preparing a Water Resources Action Program (WRAP).
An Inception Report is being prepared as basis for donor support from i.a. WB, UNDP and
NORAD. WDB intends to use the Kafue River basin as a pilot project in developing a new
model for water resources management in Zambia. Kafue River and its tributaries is the
source of water for the majority of the population of Zambia, with a number of conflicting
interests attached to its management. Most of the raw water drawn for the schemes under
consideration in the MTS Project is also from Kafue River and its tributaries.
The WRAP process will address seven themes in water resources management; i) legal and
institutional framework, ii) information, iii) human resources development, iv) water
resources demand, supply and infrastructure, v) economics and financing, vi) water and the
environment, and vii) international waters. The approach will be a strategic management
process leading to a revised institutional and legal framework for water resources
management. Establishment of a form of river basin authorities under an autonomous WDB
may be one of the outcomes of the WRAP process.

Mine Township Services Project
With regard to sanitation and solid waste policies, a work- group under RSU (previous
WSDG) in 1997 produced a document - National Environmental Sanitation Strategy for
Rural and Peri-Urban Areas in Zambia (RSU 1997). The document was presented at a
National Environmental Sanitation Fair in 1998. It is understood that work is underway i!
developing a national policy on basis of the document. The initiative was in line with the
GRZ Health Reform's priority on preventive health measures.
The main objectives are to i) improve national access to appropriate, acceptable and
affordable excreta and domestic waste disposal facilities through sustainable approaches that
are demand driven and promote hygiene behavioural changes that bring about health and
well-being of the people, ii) to create an enabling environment with support mechanisms to
facilitate individuals, households and communities to effectively improve their environmental
sanitation conditions and hygiene practices by erecting barriers to prevent the transmission of
diseases, and iii) a number of specific goals to be reached in a five years horizon.
2.2    Legislation
2.2.1   General
The Pre-appraisal mission set out a series of preliminary jurisdictional issues to be reviewed
in order to ensure that the AHC has the necessary capacity and legal basis to enter into a
management contract. Of particular importance is that AHC will have the full authority, e.g.
ownership of the water supply, sanitation and solid waste assets and infrastructure, as well as
the legal right to bill and collect revenue for such services.
Legislation relevant in particular for environmental management and monitoring, and also for
operation of water supply, sanitation and solid waste services is briefly described in the
following sections.
2.2.2  Water and sanitation legislation
The Water Pollution Control (Effluent and Waste Water) Regulations. Statutory
Instrument No 72/1993. The Water Pollution Control Regulations were issued in pursuance
of the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act. The regulations establish that
operators of sewage systems (local authority) require a licence from ECZ. The regulations
outline the application format. All sewage systems to be taken over by the AHC are thus
licensed by ECZ.
The Inspectorate (ECZ) shall satisfy itself that the applicant has adequate and appropriate
facilities and equipment for pre-treatment and that the effluent will not cause significant
damage to the environment. The licence shall conform to the conditions and standards for
chemical and physical parameters as set out in a table of standards for effluent and waste
water, attached to the licence. These standards are set in accordance with internationally
accepted standards, according to ECZ. However the relevance of the list of parameters is not
considered in relation to the particular operations being licensed, other discharges polluting
the same aquatic environment and any natural pollution factors. ECZ is observant of this
ambiguity and is in the process of developing holistic environmental management strategies,
which may lead to individual standards for each licence.
The licence is normally issued for a period of three years, and may be renewed for a similar
period. ECZ may limit the validity of the licence when necessary. Similar regulations are

outlined for withdrawal of water from a water course for the purpose of diluting effluents.
(However, the discharge of sludge and backwash water is not licensed). The holder of a
licence shall keep records of licensed activities and submit the records everv six months to
ECZ. Abnormal discharge of effluents shall be reported to ECZ. ECZ has the authoritv to
order the licence holder to install metering devices and take samples for monitoring of -the
operations. Applications shall be gazetted four weeks prior to the issue of licences. Currently
ECZ lacks capacity to maintain regular monitoring and control of pollution. Occasional
pollution incidents are often not investigated timely or fully because of lack of capacity.
The Water Act (Chapter 198 of the Laws of Zambia) came into force in 1949 and provides
control, ownership and uses of water, excluding water that is part of international boundaries.
The Act established the Water Board (now Water Development Board) which is administered
by a Water Officer (Department of Water Affairs Qf MEWD). Ownership of water is vested in
the President on behalf of the public of Zambia, and therefore all use of water is made in
accordance with the Act. The WDB regulates the use of public water other than for domestic
use, and has a special section dealing with industrial water uses. The Act further establishes
polluting public water as an offence. There are detailed regulations in force regarding
application for water rights, which are issued by the WDB against a fee. The Water Act is
presently being reviewed under the auspices of WRAP, upon recommendations of the NEAP
(MENR 1997).
The Water and Sanitation Act No 28/1997 was enacted in November 1997. The Act
establishes the NWASCO and defines its functions, it provides for the establishment of water
supply and sanitation utilities by local authorities and provides for the efficient and
sustainable supply of water and sanitation services under the general regulation of NWASCO.
The Act also provides for matters connected with or incidental to the issues above. Water
supply and sanitation utilities may be established by local authorities as a company under the
Companies Act, provided that the majority of the shares are held by the local authority. The
local authority may alternatively contract another service provider for defined areas. A person
(private company) may also be licensed as a service provider in defined areas.
NWASCO will issue licenses to service providers and the Act outlines detailed requirements
to be met by the applicants. These include short and long term plans outlining plans for the
provision of efficient, affordable and sustainable water supply and sanitation services,
performance targets and financial and infrastructure improvements. NWASCO will in
principle act as a watchdog on behalf of the consumers, and will in this regard issue
guidelines, in particular with regard to tariff systems, water quality, performance levels etc.
2.2.3 Solid waste legislation
The Waste Management (Licensing of Transporters of Wastes and Waste Disposal Sites
(Regulations). Statutory Instrument No 71/1993. The Waste Management Regulations were
issued in pursuance of the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act. The
regulations set out that any person intending to transport wastes or operate a waste disposal
site or plant will require a licence from ECZ. The licence may be issued for any period less
than 3 years, but not less than six months. The licence will set out a number of standard
conditions cited in the regulations both for transport and for disposal of wastes.
The licence for transport shall be issued provided that ECZ is satisfied that the applicant has
adequate and appropriate facilities and equipment for transport, and with the collection
schedule. The licence for operation of waste disposal sites or plants will also require approval
from the town and country planning authority on the location of the site. The operator of the

shall be satisfied that the owner or operator has the abilitv and the appropriate facilities to
rnanage the site without causing significant damage to the environment. ECZ may order the
licence holder to install metering devices and take samples for monitoring of the issued
regulations.
The environmental authorities have not yet issued particular regulations regarding disposal of
hazardous and toxic waste. However, the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act
include provisions for licensing such operations. These provisions would probably apply to
the operations of the Uchi dump site under Nkana Division in Kitwe, since this site is also
used for industrial and commercial waste dumping. The AHC will take over the responsibility
for the operations of the dump site and possibly also as owner of the area.
2.2.4 Environmental and other legislation
The Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act No 12/1990. This Act establishes
the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) with an Inspectorate with administrative,
monitoring and enforcement authority regarding environmental protection and pollution
prevention in Zambia. The Act is organised in sections/parts for water, air, waste, pesticides
and toxic substances, noise, ionising radiation and natural resources conservation. A general
part sets out the responsibility of the public to report pollution incidents to thelnspectorate or
the police.
The Environmental Protection and Pollution Control (Environmental Impact Assessment)
Regulations. Statutory Instrument No 28/1997 outlines the EIA regulations in force in
Zambia. The regulations divide projects in two categories, one that require aproject brief to
be prepared by the developer, and one that require an environmental impact (El) statement to
be prepared. Water supply schemes (pipelines with diameter of 0.5 m and above and 10 km
length outside built up areas, and reservoirs with 50 m2 surface area or more), sewage
disposal works (capacity 15.000 litres or more a day) and solid waste disposal (1.000 tons/day
and above) would require an El statement to be prepared. Although not all components of the
MTS Project fall under the last category, for the purpose of this EA study, it is assumed that
the Project should be subjected to an El statement. It is further assumed that this EA Report
together with the ER Report fulfil the requirements of the EIA regulations in this regard.
The EIA Regulations institute a public consultation process during preparation of theToR for
the EA statement. For this particular project, the public consultation process will take place
on the basis of the draft EA Report, starting with a stakeholders workshop. The EA process of
the Project also differs from the regulations with regard to ECZ involvement, as the ECZ did
not comment on the ToR, although being presented with the ER Report containing the draft
ToR. ECZ should also in accordance with the regulations approve of the team of experts to
prepare the El statement.
Twelve copies of the El statement shall be submitted to ECZ. The regulations outlines
procedures for public notification in mass media and distribution to stakeholders for
comments. ECZ may also decide to hold a public hearing on the report. ECZ shall make a
decision within 30 days after receipt of a report from the public hearing, or within 20 days
from receiving the El statement from the developer in case a public hearing is not held.
The developer is obliged to undertake an environmental audit of the project within a period of
not less than one year and not more than 3 years after completion of the project or
commencement of its operations.

The Lands Acquisition Act No 2/1970 sets out regulations for compulsory acquisition of
land and property and compensation for such acquisition. The President (his designated and
authorised person) may acquire any property in the interest of the Republic. Notice shall be
given in person not less than two months in advance and shall be gazetted. Compensation for
acquired property, losses and damages shall be paid as may be agreed or, finally determined
by the National Assembly in case agreement on compensation is not reached within six weeks
after publication in the Gazette. Any disputes except for disputes related to the amount of
compensation may be instituted for court proceedings. The Act also opens for compensation
to be granted by allocation of new land to the property owner.
The Act instituted a Compensation Advisory Board to advise the Minister (Minister of Lands)
in assessment of compensation payable under the Act. The functions of the Board have been
discharged to various committees. Various forms to be used in the proceedings of property
acquisition are prescribed in SI 60/1970.
The Public Health Act regulates monitoring procedures for potable water quality standards.
In the absence of specific standards for Zambia, the Health Authorities have adopted the
WHO standards. The Central Board of Health has, however, issued draft guidelines for
drinking water quality and sampling procedures (CBH 1998) and the intention is to issue
these as a Statutory Instrument to the Public Health Act.
2.2.5  International conventions
Zambia is riparian to three intemational watercourse systems; the Zambezi River Basin,
which Zambia shares with Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe, the
Tanganyika Basin which Zambia has in common with Burundi, Democratic Republic of
Congo (former Zaire), Rwanda and Tanzania, and finally the Congo River Basin through with
the Luapula River drains via DRC.
Except for the Zamnbezi River Authority set up between Zambia and Zimbabwe for
management of Kariba dam and the Zambezi River along the common border between the
two countries, there are no administrative or legal arrangements on how the shared water
resources can be utilised on an equitable basis. Under the WRAP Zambia will, however,
consider initiatives related to arrangements such as the Helsinki Convention on the Protection
and Use of Transboundary Water Courses and Intemational Lakes.
Zambia is member of the Southem Africa Development Community (SADC) and has, as a
direct result of the Treaty of SADC, signed the SADC Protocol on shared Watercourse
Systems. SADC adopted in 1987 the inception of ZACPLAN for Zambezi River Basin based
on environmentally sound management and sustainable development. The plan has, however,
no regulatory functions.
Zambia is also a signatory to the SADC Protocol on Health, which opens for sectoral
approaches between countries on environmental health initiatives.
2.3   Institutional Framework
2.3.1 ZCCM and AHC Municipal Services Ltd
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) has an established institutional structure for
environmental management and protection - the ZCCM Group Environmental Services

(GES) with a Headquarter at 1ie Department for Operational Services in Kalulushi. Divisional
Environmental Officers are operating from each of the ZCCM Divisions (as well as RAMC
(Z) Plc). The future of the GES is not yet clear. However, it seems that key officers will be
retained with the GES under what will remain of the ZCCM after privatisation of the mine
assets and operations is completed, namely ZCCM Investment Holding Company. ZCCM
will, according to the conditions of the contracts with the buyers. remain with environmental
liabilities until the new owners have managed (according to obligations of the contract) to
bring the operations in line with ECZ environmental standards (MMMD 1999). Most likely
this will go on for as long as the MTS Project will be operational.
On this background the GES may play a role in relation to future monitoring of the
implementation of the EMP for the operations of water supply, sanitation and solid waste
services to be supported by the Project (see Chapter 6).
Operation of water supply services is presently done by the staff of the Engineering
Superintendent Sections of the ZCCM divisions. RAMC (Z), Luanshya has organised a
separate Municipal Services entity under the Assistant Engineering Superintendent
Water/Townships. Sanitation operations are monitored by the Chief Health Officer of each
division together with the monitoring of solid waste disposal.
With regard to solid waste collection and transport, the Engineering Superintendent Services
Sections (ZCCM 1998) have awarded contract to private contractors. The same ZCCM
Sections are responsible for preparation and operation of the disposal sites. The ZCCM
Divisions' Public Health Departments (Chief Health Officer) are responsible for monitoring
and control of the operations.
The AHC Municipal Services Ltd. (AHC) was incorporated under the Companies Act on
March 29, 1999. AHC is fully owned by ZCCM. At present there is an Acting Manager, a
Company Secretary/Accountant and Head of HRD, who are engaged on the registration and
transfer of the water supply, sanitation and solid waste assets from ZCCM to AHC. This
process was completed on October 1, 1999. The contracts with the private companies who
took over the ZCCM divisions in Luanshya and Kalulushi, stipulate that their obligation to
operate the municipal services comes to an end after two years on that date. The AHC
formally took over operations in the two towns on 18 October 1999.
It is assumed that the Chief Executive Officer of AHC will be assisted by a professional
group of supervisors covering the following competencies: technical, financial and
administration/consumer affairs (WB 1999b). The WB proposes that an environmental
advisor should be located in AHC. This issue will be discussed in Chapter 6 - the EMP. It is
also proposed that the AHC should be supported by a substantial TA package under the
Project.
AHC will take over the full responsibility as the service provider with regard to water supply
and sanitation services and solid waste management in the other defined areas. The services
will be contracted out to a PO, with AHC as the signatory to the contract(s). The management
contract is planned to come into effect within one year from the take over by AHC, e.g.
before the end of October 2000.
Proposed responsibilities of AHC in relation to the EMP are outlined in Chapter 6.

2.3.2  Private Operator
A Private Operator (PO) will be contracted to perform the technical and commercial
operations of the water supply and sanitation services and solid waste management on behalf
of AHC. AHC will pay the PO a management fee and incentive fees for specified
performance indicators. The PO will provide regular reports to AHC in accordance with the
management contract. The reports will include: i) monthly financial and technical reports; ii)
quarterly collection and cost summary tables; iii) quarterly unaudited accounts; iv) annual
technical and financial reports; v) annual strategic business plans; vi) annual budget; and vii)
annual audited accounts.
Proposed responsibilities of the PO in relation to the EMP are outlined in Chapter 6.
2.33 MLGH, Municipal Councils and commercial utilities
The Project operational areas are located within five districts on the Copperbelt, namely
Kitwe, Chingola, Mufulira, Chililabombwe and Luanshya, with a City Council for Kitwe and
Municipal Councils for the four other districts. The Councils will, or have already taken over
certain services in the mine townships. It is assumed that the Councils have the legal rights to
charge rates on the title deed holders of the townships. Presently rates are also supposed to
cover the cost of waste collection and disposal.
The Councils will receive support under the proposed Urban Development Project, which will
include certain municipal services, as solid waste. Eight Councils on the Copperbelt,
including the five in question, have formed three joint venture commercial utility companies,
namely Kafubu Water and Sewerage Company (Luanshya, Ndola and Masaiti), Nkana WSC
(Kitwe and Kalulushi) and Mulonga WSC (Chingola, Mufulira and Chililabombwe). The
companies are incorporated under the Companies Act, professional Boards of Directors have
been appointed, and they are presently in the process of recruiting key personnel and
rehabilitate headquarters offices.
2.3.4 NWASCO and RSU
The National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO) is the regulatory body for
water supply and sanitation in Zambia, created under the Water and Sanitation Act No 28 of
1997. It is presently being established with 12 members under the MEWD. The Council's
functions, authority and responsibilities are outlined in the Act and include: i) definition of
service areas (jurisdiction) of a utility, ii) setting and monitoring of performance standards,
iii) determining tariff systems to be applied and issue of guidelines (not the setting of tariffs),
iv) customer relations (watchdog of the utilities on behalf of the consumers), and v) imposing
sanctions for failure to meet agreed performance standards.
NWASCO will issue licences to service providers (utilities) in accordance with regulations of
the Act. The Act outlines detailed requirements for a licence application, which refer to what
would be the normal content of a corporate plan. The tariff structure and tariff levels for each
category of customers shall be included with a financial analysis of the operations.
The Water Sector Reform Support Unit (RSU) is an inter-ministerial secretariat for
supervision of the implementation of the water sector reform policies and strategies. RSU is
assisted by NORAD, GTZ and Irish Aid. In 1998 RSU was transformed from a larger
organisation - the Water Sector Development Group into a support unit. It is assumed that
RSU will be reorganised in 2000 and resume the functions as secretariat for NWASCO. RSU

has been, and is instrumental in the transformation of local 'authority operated utilities into
commerciallv viable water and sanitation utilities. As mentioned three utility companies have
been established on the Copperbelt, and the process is underway in Southern, Western. North
Western and Luapula Provinces as well, assisted by various donors. The commercialisation
process in Central Province will be assisted through an ADB financed project.
2.3.5 Water Development Board
The Water Development Board (WDB) under the Ministry of Energy and Water
Development is -the regulatory body with regard to water resources management and
distribution in the country. A Water Resources Action Plan (WRAP) is presently being
prepared and will be implemented under WDB (see Section 2.2.2). Extraction of surface
water requires a water right. to be issued by the WDB. The new water act will also require
water rights to be issued for extraction of ground water. It is assumed that ZCCM has
obtained the required water rights, which will have to be transferred to AHC.
2.3.6 Ministry of Health
The Ministry of Health through the Chief Health Officer is responsible for monitoring potable
water quality. The Ministry applies the WHO standards, as separate potable water quality
standards have not been issued for Zambia. Monitoring of water quality is carried out through
provincial laboratories by the Public Health Off icers of the District Health Management
Teams (for ZCCM areas this is done by the ZCCM Public Health Department).
2.3.7 Environmental Council of Zambia
The Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) was established under the Environmental
Protection and Pollution Control Act No 12/1990. ECZ is a body corporate with the power of
the Act to do all acts and things a body corporate may lawfully perform. The Chairmnan, Vice-
Chairman and two members are appointed by the Minister of Environment and Natural
Resources and a number of ministries, institutions and organisations nominate 24 other
miembers on the Council. The Council has constituted a Standing Technical Advisory
Committee of experts of the various fields of environmental protection and pollution control.
The Council has established an Environmental Inspectorate with technical staff and facilities
required to administer, monitor and enforce measures for the protection and the environment
and prevention of pollution. The Inspectorate is known as the ECZ.
The ECZ Inspectorate is the authority enforcing the Statutory Instrument No 28/97 on EIA.
This EA Study Report shall thus be scrutinised by ECZ in accordance with the EIA
regulations. The procedure is briefly outlined under Section 2.2.4 above.
2.3.8 Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development
On behalf of GRZ, the MMMD is the majority share holder of ZCCM, and ultimately
responsible for the sale of the ZCCM assets and operations. The Ministry will maintain a
majority ownership the ZCCM Investment Holdings Ltd., which again will be the owner of
AHC.

3.    NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
3.1    Biophysical Resource Base
Zambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa, and covers about 752.600 sq.km located
between latitudes 8 and 18 degrees south and longitudes 22 and 33 degrees east. Its
neighbours are Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Botswana, Zaire and
Namibia. A large part is on the central African plateau between 1000 and 1600 m above sea
level (asl). The plateau in Zambia on an altitude of around 1300 m as] is incised by large
rivers and the alluvial plains of the Kafue, Zambezi and Chambezi form expansive wetlands.
In tropical Zambia the temperatures are modified by altitude. There are three seasons: the cool
dry (April-August), hot dry (August-November) and hot wet (November-April). Average
temperatures range from a mean monthly minimum of about 10 C in June and July to a mean
monthly maximum of 30 C in October and November. Most of the rainfall is concentrated
over the period November - March. In the upper Kafue basin the rain season normally starts
in October. However, rainfall varies from 700 mm in the south to 1500 mm in the north with
approximately 1200 - 1300 mm on the Copperbelt.
The Copperbelt is situated in the upper Kafue River catchment or basin. The flow regime of
the upper Kafue River basin is influenced by human interventions in addition to geophysical
characteristics of the basin. A number of water use and management activities have been and
are taking place. Several water rights are issued to abstract water from Kafue River and its
tributaries for meeting demands from agriculture, domestic and industrial activities including
mining. At the same time, large volumes of water are also pumped from deep mines, a
considerable portion of which returns to the Kafue River system. In addition wastewater
generated by the various water use activities that are not related to mining also have return
flows that end in Kafue River.
The upper Kafue catchment area consists of Kundulungu limestones, shales, basement
complex granite and gneiss. The soils may be described as leached sandvelt. These are sandy
to medium textured soils with high level of leaching resulting from high rainfall in the upper
parts of the basin.
The natural vegetation in Zambia is savannah woodland dominated by Miombo
(brachystegia) woodland, which cover about 50 % of the country. The vegetation on the
Copperbelt consists of woodlands and/or bush with a varying density of grasses on dry lands.
The common type of woodlands are Miombo and Mutemwa (combratum) mainly consisting
of regrowth after previous clearing. There are also forest plantations on a substantial scale
developed by GRZ.
The country has abundant wildlife, however with some species like elephants and rhino being
reduced by pouching over the past 20 years (NEAP 1997).
3.2    Environmental Quality
The high population densities, on the Copperbelt, together with the high levels of industrial,
mining and commercial activities have had an adverse impact on the environment. Some of
the adverse effects relate to water and air pollution, large amounts of solid waste generation,
deforestation, and overcrowding especially in shanty townships or illegal settlements.
However, mine townships make up a relatively small percentage of the total population of the

Copperbelt. On the other side, in mining towns, the population of miners is high especially in
those towns like Chililabombwe where mining is the dominant economic activity.
Land tenure and land use. One interesting feature of land holding on the Copperbelt is that
most of the land surrounding the mine towns is owned by ZCCM. and for some, its
successors. Consequently, the total amount of land under municipal councils is relatively
small. After the mining companies, the Forest Department owns 16.64% (521,275 hectares)
which is designated as national and local forest areas. Of this, 55,000 hectares comprise forest
plantation originally intended to mitigate the mining industry's consumption of timber from
indigenous forests (ZFAP 1998).
Apart from the land owned by the mining companies and the Forest Department, there is state
land where most of the commercial farmers are settled. Most of this land is not far from the
town centres. However, some land in previous Ndola Rural (now 3 districts) has been
converted to state land in Mpongwe and Mukumpu areas. The rest of the land is under
traditional ownership.
Deforestation. One of the environmental problems on the Copperbelt, especially in the areas
near mine townships is deforestation due to charcoal burning. Many of the people living in
the shanty townships earn their income from charcoal burning and/or the selling of charcoal
and firewood (Mudenda and Mwanza 1999). Deforestation has contributed to soil erosion.
Pollution. Apart from the water, soil and air pollution due to mine related activities; there is
pollution associated with industrial, commercial and municipal waste. Most of this is in the
form of sewage and solid waste. The inability of the councils to collect refuse has contributed
to increased environmental degradation.
Shanty townships. The growing number of shanty townships is another factor contributing to
the poor state of the environment in most Copperbelt towns. This is bound to increase as more
people loose their jobs. Most of these illegal settlements are in mine areas and is likely to
pose a problem with new mining companies who by law can evict illegal settlers. In order to
mitigate adverse social impacts, the new mine owners need to work closely with the councils
and other local leadership structures to address this potentially explosive problem. Some of
the settlements are located on future mining areas while others are in cave-in areas, which are
not suited for human settlement (Njovu 1999).
3.3    Social Environment
Although the Copperbelt Province is the second smallest province after Lusaka Province, with
a land area 31,328 km2 it is the most populous province in the country contributing 19% of
the total population. As such, the province has the highest concentration of people. Kitwe
District has the highest number of people with Ndola as a close second and Chililabombwe is
the least populated district in the Province (CSO 1994).
According to the 1990 census, the population on the Copperbelt was 1,427,545 comprising
721,507 males and 706,038 females. The province is highly urbanised with a total of
1,221,199 (85.55%) people living in urban areas and the remaining 206,346 (14.45%) people
living in rural areas. In addition, the population of the Copperbelt had an above national
growth rate of 4% (1969-80) and 1.3% (1980-90).
The major demographic structures relate to the sex ratios, dependency ratios and ethnicity.
Traditionally, the Copperbelt Province has had more male adults than females, which is
contrary to the national sex ratio where there are fewer males per 100 females. The sex ratio
in 1980 was 105.5 and fell to 102.2 in the 1990 Censusi The large number of males is largely

due to the migration of males to the Copperbelt seeking emplovment. and the current decline
is mainly due to out-migration, which in turn has been caused by the slow down in the mining
activity in the province.
In terms of age composition, the child population (0-14 years) is about 45% of the total
population the adult population (15-65 years) is 54 % and the above 65 years is 1%. As such.
the overall dependence ratio is 85.6. However, the woman-child dependence, which is a more
realistic representation of the dependence ratio in most mining townships was 632.4 per 100
adult males.
According to the 1990 Census, about 98% of the population is of African origin. The major
indigenous ethnic group on the Copperbelt is Lamba. There has been an influx of several
ethnic groups due to mining activities and as a result, Bemba has become the dominant
language of communication. There are other 22 languages spoken on the Copperbelt and
Lamba is only dominant in the rural areas.
3.4    Critical Key Elements of Drinking Water
A number of health problems in Zambia are related to the availability and quality of drinking
water. The URWSP was for instance incepted as a quick fix program in direct response to
cholera outbreaks on the Copperbelt. Reliable data on health related to water are, however,
scarce, and results from individual projects in the health sector are not always disseminated
by the Health Authorities for the benefit of the country at large. For later monitoring and
evaluation of the Project, health data that may be available through the ZCCM Health
Department should be consulted.
The draft guidelines for drinking water quality and sampling procedures (CBH 1998) points at
a number of critical key elements related to the supply of drinking water in Zambia, e.g.
quantity, quality, continuity, coverage and cost implications. It is suggested a minimum
supply of 11 litres/c/d, and that a zero indicator for faecal coliforms should be strictly
followed. In 1995 GRZ established that by 2000, 50 % of the rural children should have
access to clean water and 100 % of the urban areas without any disruptions in the supply. It is
not likely that the objectives will be met. The latest data from 1991 indicated that 85 % of the
urban population had access to clean water and 27 % of the rural population. These figures
should have been supplemented with data on water quality and regularity of supply.

4.    ASSESSMENT OF WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE SYSTEMS
4.1   Introduction
The assessment of the water supply and sewage systems targeted by the MTS Project is
divided into several sections. First of all, issues common to all divisions are discussed
(Section 4.2) and recommendations made which pertain to all the divisions. The Section
opens with an analysis of runoffs of the Kafue River basin, in particular the upper Kafue. All
water supply and sanitation systems under the Project either draw raw water from Kafue river
or one of its tributaries and discharge effluents from sewage systems directly or indirectly into
the river. Other general issues discussed are impacts on aquatic life, the socio-economic
dimensions, resettlement and some institutional issues. Issues common to water supply and
sanitation are discussed in a separate section, as are issues related specifically to water supply
and issues related specifically to sewage and sewerage.
Next, operations of the five divisional systems and proposed investment programs are
analysed separately (Section 4.3 through 4.7). Recommendations are made as they are needed
and then summarised for ease of reference. As appropriate, each of the division assessments
refers back to the common issues presented earlier and forward to the recommended EMP
presented in Chapter 6.
The EMP is the most vital component of this assessment, and of efforts to achieve an
environmentally sensitive completion of the MTSP. The recommendations made in Chapter 4
are each given an identification code and incorporated in a matrix of mitigating measures and
implementation in the EMP, separately for water supply and sanitation systems (this Chapter)
and solid waste management (Chapter 5). Recommendations for implementation, mitigation
and monitoring are organised in i) common issues (environmental management and
monitoring and mitigating measures) and specific issues for each division (mitigating
measures). Resettlement procedures are discussed separately.
4.2   Issues Common to all Divisions
4.2.1 The Kafue River basin - resource utilisation
For purposes of this environmental assessment, the Kafue basin has been divided into two
regions viz., the upper Kafue and lower Kafue basin. The area upstream of Mpatamatu (25
km south-west of Luanshya) is regarded as the upper Kafue while the downstream is the
lower. Particular detail is paid to the area upstream of Mpatamatu (hydrological station 4-200)
where the MTSP is located. The inclusion of the lower parts of the basin downstream the
Copperbelt is mainly in line with the principle of taking the entire basin as a unitary system
where activities upstream have a bearing on the quantity and quality of water flowing
downstream.
In the case of the Kafue River it is important to note that the current water rights for power
generation and large-scale irrigation in the lower part of the basin may be adversely affected
by increased water demands upstream. Thus the assessment of the water resource base in the
upper Kafue basin should take cognisance of the other water users not directly related to
mining and domestic water supply.
The flow data used in the analysis has been based on records obtained from the Department of
Water Affairs - Hydrological Section who have been operating a network of monitoring
stations throughout.the country (MEWD 1995). Of particular relevance to this assessment are

stations Kafue River at Ngosha Fann (4-040), at Raglan Farm (4-050). at Kafironda (4-090).
at Smith Bridge (4-130), at Wusakile Bridge (4-150) and at Mpatamatu (4-200). Similarly. a
number of meteoroloLical stations operated by ZCCM have been used in the analysis of
rainfall data. Meteorological stations have been in operation since the late 1920s and flow
data are available from about 1960s.
The general layout of the Project area is shown in Figure 1.1 (page 6). From a hydrological
point of view, the Project area is located in the upper Kafue basin. The Kafue River basin lies
entirely within the Republic of Zambia to the east of the upper Zambezi catchment. Its
general location is between south latitudes 1135" and 1650" and longitude 2510" and
2910" (MEWD 1971).
Kafue basin. The total Kafue basin encompasses a drainage area of 156,995 kM2, while the
upper part upstream of Mpatamatu encompasses a drainage area of 11,520 km2. The river
originates from a plateau on the northern portion of the Copperbelt Province of Zambia near
the border of Democratic Republic of Congo. From its source the river flows in southeasterly
direction along where major mining towns of Chililabombwe, Chingola and Kitwe are
located. The Kafue then takes a southwesterly direction, till it reaches Iteshi Teshi. Finally the
river flows eastwards till it joins the Zambezi River.
The total length of the Kafue River from its source to its mouth on the Zambezi River is about
1,300 km. Its source is at an altitude of 1,483 m above sea level while its infall is at an
altitude of about 370 m above sea level. Most of the basin lies at an altitude of some 1000 to
1300 m above sea level. In general the terrain ranges from undulating to flat with very
isolated number of hills.
The Kafue is one of the major tributaries of the Zambezi. In turn the major tributaries to the
Kafue are the Munyonshi, Mwambashi, Kafulafuta (including Kafubu), Lufwanyama,
Luswishi, Lunga, Lufupa and Kaleya rivers.
The major characteristic features of the upper Kafue basin are the Lukanga swamps and the
peaty and marsh soils known as dambos which fill with water during the rainy season and
gradually and slowly begin to dry out. The physiography of the lower basin is dominated by
the Kafue flats located downstream of the Itechi-Teshi dam. Flow regime of lower Kafue is
regulated by the operations of the Itezhi-Teshi and Kafue Gorge dams constructed for power
generation.
Water availability. The surface water res. urces potential of the Kafue basin amounts to
some 342 m3/s based on average flows monitored for the period 1962 to 1992. This
represents about 13 % of the overall water resources potential of Zambia. On the other hand
the water resources potential of the Copperbelt is estimated at some 150 m3/s. This represents
44 % of the water resources potential of the Kafue basin. Thus the upper Kafue, which
includes Copperbelt, generates a large part of the water flowing in the river. The high rainfall
averaging about 1200 mm annually in the upper basin contributes to high level run-off.
Estimates indicate that about 21 % of the rainfall is converted to run-off.
On the other hand the groundwater potential of the Copperbelt is estimated and some 2,600
mill m3/y. On average terms, it is estimated about 7 % of the rainfall on the Copperbelt
contributes to groundwater recharge and is available as renewable resource on annual basis
(NCSR 1984).
A review of the water rights record at the WDB has indicated that the Kafue basin has about
700 water rights amounting to abstraction of 5.3 mill m3/d. The Copperbelt has an estimated

126 water rights with about 0.97 mill m3/d against a potential of 12.9 mill m3/d. This
indicates that only about 7.5 % of the surface water resources potential on the Copperbelt is
committed.
There are limited measurements made for the quantities of water added to or abstracted from
the Kafue River system within the Copperbelt, but the general trend is that more water is
added to the river system than is the abstractions. This is clearly demonstrated in Figure 4.1
that shows a marked increase in the available amount of water along the Kafue River between
Chililabombwe and Luanshya.
There is a clear and distinctive influence of human activities on the water regime. Thus the
eastem portion of the basin with higher population density, large scale mining activities,
urban infrastructure etc. tend to generate more run-off in relation to the westem portion where
the aforesaid activities are non-existent or marginally developed. The difference in run-off
production are therefore attributed to land use (human interference) as the rainfall, soils and
vegetation characteristics are fairly homogeneous between the westem and eastem portion of
the basin.

Figure 4.1 shows the relationship between drainage area and available water resources within the
upper Kafubu basin. Raglan farm is located upstream Chililabombwe town while Mpatamatu is located
downstream Luanshya town, thus representing the upstream and downstream of the Study area. In
addition to illustrating the mean yearly runoff, the figure also shows the variation of "decisive water
resources "within the drainage area. Decisive water resources refers to water available at a given
location for 90 % of the time in a span ofyears. The general conclusion drawn from the above figure is
that there are abundant surface water resources to meet current and projected water demands in the
mining towns hips.
Another interesting observation is the decrease in run-off values from the northern part of the
catchment to the southern part. This phenomenon may be attributed to the gradual decline in
rainfall from north to south as well as the presence of swamps and dambos that dominate the
physiographic feature of the Kafue basin. The major characteristics of the swamps and
dambos are that they are generally shallow with substantial surface area and hold water in

storage for long periods of time thereby allowing a considerable portion of the water to
evaporate. Consequently the amounts of water available for other uses downstream are
significantly reduced.
Water quality monitoring. On a national basis there is no regular sampling of water to
obtain records of quality. The overall responsibility to maintain a network of water quality
monitoring stations rests with the DWA of MEWD. In the Copperbelt area, however, ZCCM
has maintained regular water quality monitoring stations at about 30 locations. Five of these
stations are located on the main Kafue River. The frequency of sampling varies considerably
from daily to monthly depending on the station. Whilst the monitoring network maintained by
the Environmental Services of ZCCM is systematic, it is also selective as it concentrates on
heavy metals and products related to the mining industry, e.g. Cu, Co, TDS and TSS. The test
data are therefor only of limited value as baseline data for environmental monitoring of the
Project.
A test regime for water quality and sewage effluent monitoring is proposed in Section 6.7.
4.2.2  Impacts on aquatic life
It is assumed that any negative impacts on aquatic life in the Kafue River basin will be
minimal from the Project compared to impacts from mining operations and the present
operations of water supply, sanitation and solid waste management. The EA Study team did
not come across any documentation of the present situation for aquatic life in and around
streams and rivers affected by ZCCM water supply, sewage and solid waste services on the
Copperbelt. From the scarce data of questionable quality available it seems that the sewage
effluent contributes less than 1.5 % of TSS in Kafue River, and this does not exceed 4 %
under maximum conditions (see Fig. 4.2). It may therefor be assumed that any impact on
aquatic life from the MTSP will be negligible.
However, this statement may be modified with regard to Luanshya where effluent from
sewage ponds is discharged into Luanshya (Roan STW) and Nkulumashiba (Mpatamatu
STW) streams. The Luanshya stream joins the Kafubu River, a tributary to Kafulafuta River,
which joins Kafue River 20 km downstream of Luanshya. The Nkulumashiba stream flows
almost due west and joins the Kafue River about 15 km from Mpatamatu township. The
influence of effluent from the two STWs will be very small on the Kafue River, but
significant in the context of in particular the Nkulumashiba stream.
With regard to Nkulumashiba stream, which probably is not perennial, any flow it might carry
during the dry season in addition to sewage effluent is likely to originate from Mpatamatu
township activities, illegal blockages of sewers and from diversion of water from mine shaft
18/28. Especially during the dry season the flow of effluent from the ponds probably
contributes over 50 % of the flow in the stream, if not nearer to all. With these ponds being
heavily overloaded, pollution of the Nkulumashiba stream is therefore inevitable, and thus
changing the ecological systems of the stream. The only way in which this can be alleviated
will be to expand and re-construct the Mpatamatu ponds, with maturation ponds as well.
Because of the high contribution of the effluent to the stream flow, it is also recommended
that there for these ponds should be set a faecal coliform standard of 100 per 100 ml.
Kafubu River is also polluted from discharge of sewage from Ndola City, as most of the
waste and storm water runoff from the City area drains off to Kafubu dam. Kafubu dam,
which represents a major source of water for Ndola, overflows only during the rainy season.
This indicates that wastewater from Ndola City is being re-circulated during the dry season
and partly also during the rainy season. Kafubu WTP was rehabilitated under URWSP

(supported by WB and NORAD). However, that project was 'not subjected to an independent
EA in accordance with WB directives and ECZ regulations.
The quality of effluent discharges and monitoring of the same is proposed to be improved
under the Project (see the EMP in Chapter 6).
4.2.3  Resettlement
The environmental reconnaissance did not identify any apparent needs for involuntary
resettlements arising from the proposed investment program. There were no illegal
settlements reported on trunk mains scheduled for replacement and repair, and both the water
and sewage reticulation networks are laid out in townships originally regulated by ZCCM.
4.2.4  Institutional issues
In the context of the framework of transfer of assets, and eventual operation, firstly from
ZCCM to AHC, secondly to a Private Operator (PO), and finally to a commercial utility
company, it is an essential pre-requisite that certain fundamental matters are clearly defined in
the contracts.
AHC will have an important role both before (the first operational year) and after devolution
of operational responsibilities to the PO. At the end of the four-year period, the assets are
expected to be transferred to a municipal institution. It is important that the performance
standards laid down by statute (licence from NWASCO) and the standards of the assets being
improved under the Project are maintained during these periods.
In terms of environmental quality, the importance of this cannot be too strongly emphasised.
There has to be an authority of enforcement to bring them back into line. Statutory
authorities, such as ECZ (and NWASCO when operational), have powers to take action
against licensees who breach the terms of their licence.
4.2.5 Issues common to water supply and sanitation
Lack of operator skills and knowledge. In many instances, it was found that routine tasks
were being carried out just because of the inherent mine discipline, which demanded that they
be carried out that way, at that time, every day. Whilst this discipline is to be applauded, it
does infer inflexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. With water sources relying both
on natural water courses and mine sources, the quality on a daily basis will be subject to
changing circumstances. This may mean frequency of de-sludging of a clarifier needs to be
increased, or backwash of filters needs to be more frequent. Similarly, on sewage, a trained
operator can tell when treatment processes are not functioning, as they should be, or when
weed needs to be cleared.
The skills and knowledge of the operators certainly have a bearing on the impact on the
environment and possible health hazards of the operations. The MTSP does not include a
training component, as it is assumed that the PO in his own interest will see to that staff is
trained to meet the performance obligations of the contract. However, training should start as
soon as possible, and this EA Report argues that if a training component is not included in the
Project budget, the PO contract should specify training requirements in line with the
vocational training system recently adopted for the water and sanitation sector in Zambia, e.g.
the Competence Based Modular Training System (CBMT). It is assumed that this also will be
one of the conditions in the NWASCO licence. Skills training in the CBMT system for
operators of water supply and sanitation schemes will soon start at Nortect in Ndola.

Risk of cross contamination of water supplies. Operations appear to be carried out on an ad
hoc basis, and there is a consequent risk of cross contamination of water supplies. This point
is largely directed at the operations staff. It is understood that certain operators are job
specific to either water or sewage. But some others, notably fitters and electricians, can be
used for either. This carries with it the risk of cross contamination of water supplies, from an
operator coming from a sewage job straight on to a water job, without taking necessary
hygiene precautions.
It is therefore recommended that operations staff be separated into those working with (I)
clean and (2) dirty water, and that there should be no cross utilisation of one into the other,
without first ensuring proper hygiene procedures are carried out, and protective clothing
issued and used It is further recommended that water workers be given regular medical
checks at six-month intervals to ensure they are not carriers of any water borne diseases.
These aspects are covered in the Service appendix of the Management Contract.
Lack of independent laboratory facilities to enable regular quality assurance and
environmental monitoring testing. The mines' laboratories have provided facilities for testing
of water and sewage. However, these laboratories are set up to support the mines' services,
and not the municipal services. Furthermore, with the separation of the mines from the
municipal services for operational control, it should be assumed that the mines' laboratories
would not be available for municipal purposes. Various alternatives may be considered, e.g.
to procure the laboratory services on the private market or to make arrangements with the new
Water and Sewerage Companies to utilise their laboratories being upgraded under URWSP.
Review of National Statutes. This issue is not part of the EA Study. However, National
Statutes and how license conditions are formulated and issued will have a bearing on how
conditions are being complied with and how environmental monitoring is being carried out.
In the following arguments are offered for a review of certain statutes concerning control and
standards. Potable water quality is governed by the Public Health Act, and sewage now comes
under the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act. Certain standards are laid
down under each, which are supposed to be monitored and acted upon if not met. Effluent
discharges from sewage treatment plants are now controlled by ECZ under a licensing
system, while it seems that none have responsibility for monitoring of WTP sludge and
backwash water discharges.
The standards for potable water supplies are those laid down by the WHO. These are a very
comprehensive set of standards, but in applying them certain points need to be borne in mind.
When dealing with source waters from a heavily mineralised background, the background
levels of some of the constituents considered by WHO should be monitored. Without that
background knowledge, the quality of the actual water produced cannot be fairly assessed.
But this raises the question of who should be responsible for determining that analyses are
undertaken. It would possibly be a case for NWASCO in collaboration with Ministry of
Health.
The Statutory Instrument No 72 of 1993 lays down standards to be applied to effluents. There
are 58 determinants set down, which any license holder is supposed to meet, in full. Whilst
these are no doubt the ideal to aim for, they are wholly impractical to apply across every
situation. Furthermore, it is no use having standards if they are not, or cannot be enforced, or
understood. The sheer magnitude of the number of determinants also makes the cost of
laboratory services and data analysis impossible to support. Respect is then lost for the
standards, and for the persons who are supposed to enforce them. The internationally
recognised standards for effluents usually include BOD5 and suspended solids as core criteria,
and then may include COD, TDS, pH, nitrate, and bacteriological standards, particularly

where pond treatment systems are used. These few are easy for laboratory services, and
readily assimilated for data analysis. The remainder may have value, but should be regarded
as being only recommended levels of discharge.
It is recommended that NWASCO should set up a working party to carry out ajoint review of
all standards, licenses, and enforcement procedures for both water supply and sewage.
The above recommendation is not included in the EMP for the MTS Project, but is reiterated
in Appendix H comprising other issues.
Construction and Rehabilitation Works. There appears to be no problems, at present, from
illegal settlements along the alignments of any pipelines, or at the site of any other works.
There appears to be no land use conflict, conceming any of the proposed investments.
There will be risk to workers, and especially to nearby residents from construction activities.
These are no more so than would be expected from any construction activities. However, the
construction supervisor should be aware of public liability, and ensure that any contractor
minimises the risks as far as possible.
Construction risks will be minimised by proper supervision of construction activities, andfiul
consideration given to appropriate alternative technologies.
With regard to sewerage construction work, it is expected that a program should be worked
out so that sewerage construction runs in parallel with water pipe construction in the
same areas to minimise environmental factors and inconvenience to consumers (does
not apply to Nkana).
4.2.6 Issues related specifically to water supply
WTP sludge and backwash water creates a polluting load to receiving waters. The normal
operation of the WTP creates waste waters from sludge from clarifier tanks, and backwash
water from filters. The general practice at present is to dispose of these wastes to any
adjacent watercourse, without consideration whetber this has sufficient flow to dilute the
polluting effects. In some instances, the streams also carry.mine wastes, which would either
swamp the pollutant effect of the WTP wastes by their own pollutant effect, or would give
quite a high degree of dilution to reduce the pollutant effect. However, some streams are
ephemeral, and the effect of receiving WTP wastes would have a deleterious effect on the
aquatic life of such streams.
The sludge from clarifiers would be expected to be heavily contaminated with aluminium
salts, and lime residue, together with the particulate matter, which they cause to precipitate
out. It may be worth considering the possibility of creating alum recovery plants, especially
in view of the cost of alum supplies (US$ 12.50 per 50 kg bag, from South Africa). Annual
expenditure on alum purchases amount to around US$ 350,000 across all the five divisions.
Even assuming only 30% were recovered, the potential for savings would be of the order of
US$ 120,000 per annum. On top of that, there would be a saving of environmental
degradation.
Backwash water is more dilute, but still contains contaminates. Where this cannot be
disposed of to a mine tailings disposal process, this should be returned to the inlet for
re-cycling. However, there may be a potential problem of build up of iron and

manganese salts, and this should be guarded against. The installation of alum recovery
plant(s) should be considered.
Security of source water when mines close and slop pumping from their underground
sources is a cause for concern. This is a matter for concern both on a local level, and on a
national level. On a local level, the problem may be overcome by allowing the mine to fill
with water to its natural standing water level, and then regard the mine shaft as a borehole,
and pump from that at a higher level. This may require modification of the Mines Act with
respect to closure procedures of mines, and capping the shaft in particular. Water from such a
source may actually be cleaner than at present as the underground workings of the mine
would act as a quiescent settling tank.
On a national level, it has been shown in this EA study that mines actually increase the flow
of the Kafue River. At times of minimum flow the volume of water reaching the Lukanga
Swamps is increased by up to 10% above natural flow; this represents about 100 mill. m3/y.
The question should therefore be considered, whether such resource is now an established
necessity for downstream utilisation, or whether the water would be more valuable left in the
ground to re-charge the groundwater resources of the Copperbelt.
A Water Resource Study to address this issue is included in the project.
4.2.7 Issues related specifically to sewage and sewerage
The presence of water hyacinth (Eichornia Crassipes) on sewage ponds requires comment.
Water hyacinth has been observed at Konkola and Mufulira growing on sewage ponds. In
some quarters, the presence of such weed has been a cause for concern, particularly for water
sources. It certainly indicates the presence of the necessary nutrients, nitrate and phosphate.
Work in South Africa (R.D. Walmsely and M. Butty 1980) has shown that at or above a
nitrate:phosphate ratio of 5:1, plant production can be excessive. A significant paper by
Mtonga, et al (Mtonga 1999), has shown that at Konkola incoming sewage has phosphate
levels as high as 11.5 mg/I.
However, it is also a property of water hyacinth that .t uptakes metals. Sinkala, et al (Sinkala
1997) reported that copper was found in concentrations far in excess of that required for plant
growth, and for cobalt it was extremely in excess of the level for plant growth. Whilst the
presence of the weed creates an anaerobic condition in the water below that, of itself, is not a
bad thing for sewage treatment at a preliminary stage. Mtonga, et al, noted that at Konkola
the nitrate was completely removed through the pond covered by the weed.
Therefore, subject to certain provisions, the presence of water hyacinth need not be such a
cause for concern, and may actually assist in cleaning up the sewage. The provisos are:
*  That adequate area of aerobic ponds follows on from any ponds covered by water
hyacinth.
* That the water hyacinth has to be harvested in the full growth stage.
If left to die off, the weed releases all its nutrients back into the water creating a pollution
hazard. The harvested weed has been found to make a good fertiliser, which could be a home
industry by-product from such an approach. It is even possible that the mine industry might
find such an approach useful as a means of recovering copper and cobalt.
Environmental aspects of the fauna in the sewage pond systems. Observations were made
that frogs and fish existed in several of the sewage pond systems. These are welcome signs

that treatment is taking place and that oxygen is being absorbed into the water. On the macro
side, the presence of crocodiles is a further indication of the presence of food, in the form of
fish and frogs. However, the crocodiles also constitute a grave danger to personnel employed
on the maintenance of the ponds. Therein lies the environmental factor. Ponds require
maintenance to both protect the physical condition of the embankments, and prevent growth
of unwanted weed or trees, which could adversely affect the treatment process or endanger
the stability of the embankments. Measures to exclude the animals would be prohibitive
expensive as a grown up crocodile can easily get over a 2 m high barrier.
After discussing the problem with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife, the EA
Study Team was advised to contact the Crocodiles Farmers Association of Zambia (CFAZ),
who are authorised to deal with such animals. They should be contacted whenever crocodiles
are observed. Larger animals would be dangerous to try to trap and remove, and the only sure
way is to shoot them, which CFAZ is authorised to do. It should be mentioned in this regard
that the population of crocodiles seems to be on the increase in Zambia and people are being
attacked. This is based on own conversations with people in rural areas over the past 15 years.
The numbers which would need to be removed in this manner would probably not exceed 25
- 30 each year, across all divisions.
Similarly, hippopotamus (hippo) (reported in one pond) is also dangerous to humans,
especially when someone gets between the animal and its water. The usual daily cycle of
hippos is that they will stay close to their water (mainly in the water) during the heat of the
day, and only come out and graze at night. It is therefor unlikely that actual danger would
occur to any personnel as long as they are observant of the presence of hippos in the ponds
during the day. Sewage ponds are unmanned at night.
Sewage effluent standards. The EA Study Team was able to obtain Statutory compliance
reports for the period July to December 1998 for the following outlets of effluents from
sewage ponds: Konkola (Golf Course, Konkola and Kamenza STW) Mufulira (Kantanshi
Section 3, Kantanshi Big Pond, Butondo Big Pond, Kankoyo South and Kankoyo North) and
Nchanga (Nchanga Main to Nchanga Stream); and for the period January - June 1999 for
RAMC (Z) (Mpatamatu). The following tests are supposed to be carried out (some are left
open in some lab reports): flow rate (m3/d), pH, dissolved solids (mg/I), suspended solids
(mg/I) dissolved sulphate (mg/I), total copper, cobalt, iron, manganese (mg/I), BOD5 (mg/I),
faecal and total coliform count/I 00 ml.
The current ECZ standards call for effluent to meet a faecal coliform count of 5.000/100 ml.
At face value the analysis available would suggest that the present effluent discharges meet
that standard. However, these values may be false indicators. The reason is that the flows
through most sewage treatment facilities are being over optimistically stated, and that the
residence times within the ponds are higher than believed, due to blocked and leaking sewers
pipes, sewage diverted for irrigation of gardens and non functional pumps. Without proper
metering of the flow this can be no more than an educated guess.
Secondly, the effluent standard value of ECZ with regard to faecal coliform is too high for
irrigation use of the effluent water. WHO quotes various standards, which are applicable for
different types of effluent usage. The highest value quoted by WHO is 1.000/100 ml, and the
lowest is 100/100 ml. As the effluent from most of the ponds under the Project would
normally be used for irrigation, it is therefor recommended that a standard of 500/100 ml be
self imposed on a general level to reduce the likelihood of causing any infection from polluted
water being used for irrigation. As indicated in Section 4.2.2 it is also recommended that for
the Mpatamatu ponds the coliform standard should be set at 100/100 ml.

Mine Towtnship Services Project
A separate note is attached (Appendix G) showing the principles of design for sewage
treatment ponds. A check has been made on the capacities of the sewage ponds observed at
the divisions, using these principles, and sewage flows derived from conventional sewage
return contributions. This has shown virtually all the ponds to be returning a satisfactory
hydraulic performance, but not one achieves a satisfactory coliform reduction if the standards
advocated above are to be maintained. Thus, in every case, four maturation ponds are
required, each of 5 days retention capacity to achieve that standard of perfonnance.
It is therefore recommended to include sufficient funds in the rehabilitation budget for
expansion of the sewage treatment systems where required to meet the recommended
standards for coliform and other parameters as required by ECZ on a limited samples basis
in effluent discharges.
A limited sample basis should include parameters and values as follows (see Table 6.8D in
Section 6.7):
pH                                 6.0 - 9.0
BOD                                50 mg 02/1
COD                                90 mg 02/1
Total suspended solids (TSS)        100 mg/I
Total dissolved solids (TDS)       300 mg/l
Ammonical Nitrogen                  10 mg N/l
Organic Nitrogen                   5.0 mg/l
Nitrate Nitrogen                   50 mg/i (for lakes 20 mg/l)
Phosphorus                         6.0 mg/l (for lake cathcment areas 1.0 mg/I)
Faecal Coliform counts             500/100 ml (100/100 ml for Mpatamatu)
In considering these recommendations, ECZ should also consult the World Bank Group's
Handbook on Pollution Prevention and Abatement.
Contribution of sewage effluents to the Kafue Basin was considered. An evaluation was
made of the contribution of sewage effluents to the total load carried by the Kafue River.
ZCCM Environmental Services report on samples taken from the River (four parameters).
TSS was chosen as the parameter for comparison, taking ZCCM's own analyses from their
STPs. River flows were taken as average for the year June 1998 to May 1999, and sewage
flows were taken as average flows.

From these figures, an analysis was made of the mass balance of solids carried by the river,
and contributed bv the effluents.  Figure 4.2 shows that on average, the effluent TSS
contributed less than 1% of the TSS in the river. This rose to a maximum of 4% downstream
of Konkola during March 1999, but that does not correlate with the othermaxima, which both
occurred during September 1998.
4.2.8 Summary of recommendations
Recommendations to be incorporated in the EMP are identified with a letter and a number
(see Chapter 6). Other recommendations are listed in Appendix H. E stands for
Environmental Management recommendations and C for mitigating measures common to all
divisions. E I - E 2 concerns overall environmental management and are discussed in Chapter
6.
* 01 Water and sewage operators should be given skills training, to give them a greater
understanding and awareness of why they carry out certain functions, and why those
functions need to be carried out in the first place. This will be carried out by the PO.
Additionalfunds are also allocatedfor training under the project.
E 02   Further planning of the Project should include an assessment of the need for
operational and quality assurance laboratory services and an appraisal on how this
need can best be met as an integral part of the Project.
C 01   Operations staff should be separated into those dealing with clean and dirty water
workers, and there should be no cross utilisation of one into the other, without first
ensuring proper hygiene procedures are carried out, and protective clothing issued
and used It is further recommended that water workers be given regular medical
checks at six-month intervals to ensure they are not carriers of any water borne
diseases.
C 02   Installation of alzum recovery plant(s) should be considered.
C 03   With regard to the presence of water hyacinth there need not be such a cause for
concern. The weed may actually assist in cleaning up the sewage. The provisions
are:
* That adequate area of aerobic ponds follows on from any ponds covered by water
hyacinth.
* That the water hyacinth has to be harvested in the full growth stage.
C 04  Sufficient funds should be included in the rehabilitation budget for expansion of the
sewage treatment systems where required to in general meet the proposed standards
for coliform and ECZ standards for parameters on a limited samples basis in effluent
discharges. (Does not apply to Nkana).
C 05  A programme should be worked out so that sewerage construction runs in parallel
with water pipe construction in the same areas to minimise environmentalfactors and
inconvenience to consumers. (Does not apply to Nkana).
C 06   Construction risks should be minimised by proper supervision of construction
activities andfull consideration given to appropriate alternative technologies.

4.3    Nkana Division - Kitwe
4.3.1  Existing water and sanitation systems
The status of the existing water and sanitation systems is described in Appendix F, Plant
Status Field Reports.
Two points will be noted here that at the request of ZCCM/AHC an inspection was also made
of Kalalushi, which was not part of the original project. This has become of importance as
the mine at Kalalushi probably has only 3 or 4 years productive life left, and is the sole source
of water for the Kalalushi division. Secondly, Nkana division does not carry out any sewerage
or sewage treatment functions. These are taken entirely by Kitwe City Council. As this
therefore did not form part of the rehabilitation programme, it was not studied.
4.3.2 Current Environmental Situation.
The current environmental position concerns the water intake from the Kafue River. At the
location where it is situated, it is downstream of most of Kitwe City. The city has a large
industrial base, and the risk of pollution of the Kafue is ever present. Provided a raw water
reservoir is constructed at the intake, the danger to the water supply should be small. But,
vigilance should be exercised in monitoring the quality of the river water against any sudden
increase in indicators of pollution.
On a "do-nothing" approach, the greatest environmental danger will be a major pipeline burst.
Depending on where that occurs, it could cause loss of life at worst, or damage to property or
infrastructure at best. Based on the evidence of pipelines seen at 1 7th Avenue pump station, it
should be assumed that such an eventuality will occur, sooner rather than later.
The condition of Concentrator WTP gives rise for concern. It is not specifically included in
the proposed rehabilitation budget, but the ZCCM staff on site seems to be of another
understanding. The Plant Status Field Report (Appendix E) offers 3 possible alternatives in
case it is to be closed down (see also Section 4.3.5). The major concern is the Mindola
township, which today is supplied from the Concentrator WTP.
4.3.3  Project description
Supply and Demand Projections. Total demand has been calculated to 20,700 m3/d, actual
production is estimated at 65,000 m3/d and the projected demand of 2005 has been calculated
to 25,200 m3/d (see also Appendix H).
Investment Programme. Project investments proposed by the World Bank for Nkana
division are shown in Table 4.3 in Appendix E. Notes related to environmental issues have
been added in the light of findings from this study.
Significant Environmental Effects. Within the time horizon to 2005, it is not envisaged that
there will be any significant negative environmental effects as a result of implementing this
Project. Current water abstraction from the Kafue River is not envisaged to increase,
although it may be expected there will be some increase after 2005.
Minor Environmental Effects. Rehabilitation of the water pipework transmission and
reticulation systems will have overall positive environmental effects. Minor environmental
effects may be expected from pipeline construction, construction of pipelines across Kafue
River, other construction work and cleaning out the reservoir after testing.

4.3.4  Environmental assessment
Raw Water Intake. The existing Kafue Intake will continue to be the sole source of suppiv.
As outlined above, it is at risk to pollution slugs coming down the river from Kitwe City.
That can be mitigated against by constructing a raw water storage tank at the intake. The
intake structures should be checked against a maximum flood in the river, which might
inundate the pump stations.
Even if the abstraction rate is increased to 100,000 m3/day, that would still represent only 3%
of river flow under minimum flow conditions. This is not considered to be a major
environmental problem. ZCCM analysis reports indicate that at Ndola Road bridge,
approximately 6 km downstream, the river has generally recovered from earlier solids
loading. Provided there is no local pollution, which should in any case be of only short
duration, the water quality is reasonable for a raw water source.
Water Treatment Plant. The Nkana East WTP is in a secluded area, which does not intrude
upon any housing areas. It makes no more noise than one would expect from an operation
where electric motors have to run. Smell is not a problem. There is adequate room on the site
to double the whole size of the plant, should that need ever arise.
The rehabilitation budget does not indicate what work is to be carried out on Nkana East
WTP. It is, however, assumed that the intention is to bring the plant up to design capacity.
This being the case, expansion of treatment capacity will not be required to meet the demand
for 2005.
Backwash waters and sludge are currently discharged back into the Kafue River. At 5% of
treated water flow, they would contribute less than 0.2% of flow back to river at times of
minimum river flow. This would not be expected to have a deleterious environmental effect
at that level of dilution, but consideration should be given to installing an alum recovery
plant.
Water Transmission and Reticulation System . The existing pipework is in need of
replacement, otherwise there could be breakdowns to supply from bursts, with consequent
danger to persons and/or property. Provided the materials for the new pipes are chosen
correctly, they should give at least 30 years service before again becoming a problem.
Likewise, that selection would also obviate another potential risk, cross pollution from
sewage into cracked pipes orjoints. It is believed that in any case that risk is small.
Main Water Transmission Booster Pump Stations. 17th Avenue pump station will remain
as a major feature of the transmission system. It is presently well maintained, on the opposite
side of a main road across from a high cost housing area. It does not obtrude upon the
landscape, and noise is no more than would be expected from any operation where electric
motors are running more or less continuously.
The reservoirs at 17th Avenue need to be cleaned out, and repairs made to the concrete
internally. That work can be accommodated without too much intrusion upon the
environment. After return to service, there would be an occasional need to clean out the
reservoirs, possibly every five years or so. The environmental risk would be minimal from
such an operation.
Sewage Systems, Treatment and Discharge. The Division has no Sewage Treatment plant.
It relies on the Kitwe City Council. The Council manages three sewage treatment plants,
namely; Nkana East Mechanical Activated Sludge Plant (design capacity 45,700 cubic meters

per day), Ndeke Sewage Ponds and Mindola Sewage ponds. The plants have lacked
maintenance and this has resulted in failure to achieve acceptable effluent discharge
standards.
Because the Nkana East plant is only partially operational, this has led to partially treated
sewage being directly discharged into the Kafue River. The ponds systems receive little flow
consequently the outflow volume is low, but high in algae suspended solids, residual organic
nutrients and bacteria. The systems are over 40 years old. They require rehabilitation,
upgrading and replacement of old pipelines. Some broken pipelines are being replaced under
the ICI Consultancy (Nine Towns project).
Since Kitwe City deals with sewerage and sewage treatment from Nkana mine townships, the
environmental impact of this has not been considered in this report.
4.3.5 Analysis of alternatives
This brings Kalalushi into the picture, together with the potential closure of Concentrator
WTP. In the Plant Status Field Report, three alternatives were put forward. These are:
*  Nkana East WTP be upgraded to make good the deficit caused by the closure of both
Concentrator and Kalalushi WTP, or
*  That a new WTP be constructed nearer to Mindola Township and Kalalushi continues to
take water from the mine shaft, or
*  That a new WTP be constructed at a convenient site just to the west of the railway, to
accommodate both Mindola and Kalalushi Townships.
The approximate costs for a new WTP and/or transmission pipelines would be in the region of
US$ 1.0 million, bearing in mind the overall strategy behind the eventual choice of option.
The final option to be chosen will also depend upon how the Nkana Water and Sewerage
Company will solve the question of future raw water source for Kalulushi Town.
4.3.6 Summary of recommendations
The following recommendations are incorporated in the EMP (Chapter 6):
Nk 01 A raw water storage reservoir should be constructed at Kafue River intake.
Nk 02 Flood levels need to be established in relation to any risk of flooding of the pump
stations at the intake.

The main environmental concern is that Nchanga takes its water from the Kafue River. The
point of abstraction is to the north east of Chingola town, where the river has turned to flow to

collecting a pollutant load, and join the Kafue upstream of the Hippo Pool. and 7-8 km
upstream of the intake. There is therefore a risk of accidental pollution, either from traffic
accidents or industrial pollution, getting into the water intake.
Nchanga STW has now been found to be sitting on top of a copper seam. Mining activities
may soon displace that, and rather than spend money on rehabilitating the existing STW for
an unknown life, it would be better to develop a new set of sewage ponds on a site nearer the
Kafue River, downstream of the water intake. It is, however, beyond the scope of this EA
Study to indicate who should finance the construction of a new STW and the termination and
closure of the existing one.
The overall impression one gets of Nchanga/Chingola is the dominance of the mining
activities, against which backdrop the water and sanitation activities seem minimal.
4.4.3 Project description
Supply and Demand Projections. The water supply demand for 2005 has bee estimated to
33,000 m3/d, including 10,000 m3/d for mines operations. A sewage flow of 10,950 m3/d has
been estimated for 2005 (see Appendix H for details).
Investment Program. Project investments proposed by the World Bank for Nchanga division
are shown in Table 4.4 in Appendix E. Notes with relevance for the environment have been
added in the light of findings from this study.
Significant Environmental Effects. Within the 2005 time frame there should be no
significant environmental effects. Current water abstractions are sufficient to meet demand,
provided that unaccounted for water receives attention, which it should do with new pipelines
being laid.
Minor Environmental Effects. There may be a risk of a burst of the transmission pipelines
from the intake, which run above ground for much of the way from the intake to the WTP, but
the potential hazard to people is minimal. There is also a potential minor environmental effect
from sewerage as the lack of overflow facilities at pump stations creates a hazard at times of
pump stoppages.
4.4.4 Environmental assessment
Raw Water Intake. The raw water intake is situated approximately 5 km from the nearest
houses, and does not create any nuisance. Apart from the potential pollution problem
mentioned above, the main environmental hazard around the intake is crocodiles.
The maximum level of water take (60,000 m3/d) would represent about 7% of river flow at
minimum, and that would not be considered to be too great a depletion of the river.
To guard against possible accidental pollution, a raw water storage reservoir should be built at
the intake to hold emergency supplies whilst any pollutant slug passes. This will require
vigilance to be exercised at the intake in monitoring the quality of the river water against any
sudden increase in indicators of pollution. However, in a deal recently struck with a buyer of
Nchanga Mine it has been agreed that the new owner will provide mine water for domestic
supply over a period of 12 years. In case the raw water source is shifted to only mine water,
the present raw water intake would be closed down and the recommendation would not be
valid. Mine shaft water can be expected to ha a high degree of corrosivity, and a decision
should await the outcome of the corrosivity study recommended in Appendix G.

Water Treatment Plant. Previous estimates of the WTP capacity have given it a treatment
capability of 60,000 m'/day, based on filter capacity. No sedimentation is provided. Based
on the figures estimated for Nkana East, the production capacity is probably reasonable, and
therefore capable of meeting requirements to 2005. However, a clarifier would assist in
ensuring water quality, and extend periods between backwashing of the filters.
Backwash water is at present discharged to an adjacent stream, thence eventually into the
Chingola Stream. The stream receives water also from the mine operations, and whilst
figures are not available for the relative levels of flow, the WTP contribution is probably less
then 5%. Any environmental effect from the WTP wastes is minimal compared with the mine
wastes or, at the very least, receives dilution from the mine waters. Rather than continue that
option, it would be better for backwash water, and any sludge from a future clarifier, to be
discharge across the road to a mine tailings leach plant settling tank, and be disposed of with
the tailings residue. The quantity would be about 2,000 m3/day, at 5% backwash rate.
Water Transmission and Reticulation Systems. The existing pipework is in need of
replacement, otherwise there could be breakdowns to supply from bursts, with consequent
danger to persons and/or property. Provided the materials for the new pipes are chosen
correctly, they should give at least 30 years service before again becoming a problem.
Likewise, that selection would also obviate another potential risk, cross pollution from
sewage into cracked pipes orjoints. It is believed that in any case that risk is small.
Main Water Transmission Booster Pump Stations. The main booster pump station is at the
WTP, and the pumps are obviously in need of rehabilitation. Some rationalisation of the
pumping main layout might also be usefully done. There is another booster pump at El
reservoir (Chingola Town Centre). It was not possible to see that pump station as there was
no attendant available. No rehabilitation work is proposed on the booster pump stations.
Sewage Reticulation and Trunk Mains. Sewerage is generally by gravity, with three pump
stations. Effectively, all three are direct feeds to their respective STP. Little evidence was
seen, as elsewhere, of vandalism or blockage of manholes. Rehabilitation work is proposed,
but not detailed. Provided normal precautions are taken with proper supervision, the
construction work should not represent any serious environmental impact (see Section 4.2.6
regarding construction work).
Sewage Pumping Stations. Sewage pump stations are of concern from their lack of overflow
provisions in the event of pump stoppage. It would be advisable to provide collector ponds to
give at least six hours capacity, but this is not specifically included in the environmental
recommendations, only in Appendix G for consideration. Overflows from those ponds should
in case be directed by pipe as far downstream as possible into the nearest water course.
Sewage Treatment Works. Nchanga North STW may be vulnerable to mining incursion. It
would be better to accept the inevitable, and close the plant now, rather than spend money on
rehabilitation and have it wasted, probably within the 2005 time horizon. The alternative
would be to construct a new STW facility comprising facultative and maturation ponds on
land downstream of the water intake. 2 No facultative ponds of 120,000 and 80,000 m2,
followed by 4 No maturation ponds of 5 days retention each would give a flow capacity to
about 2010 and the water would also be of a standard suitable for aqua culture and irrigation.
At Lulamba STP, the existing "bio-reactor" works well enough, but is expensive to run in
terms of energy costs. It does yield a sludge that is of value to local farmers, but the
quantities are insufficient to be marketable to cover the energy costs. There is plenty of land
available at Lulamba, and conversion to a total sewage pond treatment system will save on

energy, noise, and any smell risk, as well as yielding an effluent of good quality for irrigation
purposes. It can be replaced with facultative and maturation ponds. The present 2 No ponds
are too small, unfortunately, for incorporation into the design, but 2 No facultative ponds of
40,000 and 30,000 m' followed by 4 No maturation ponds of 5 days retention each would
give flow capacity to about 2010, and the water would also be of a standard suitable for aqua
culture and irrigation.
The recommendations above are included in Appendix H.
4.4.5 Summary of recommendations
The following recommendations are incorporated in the EMP (Chapter 6):
N 01  A raw water storage tank is required at the intake (in case the source is not shifted to
mine shaft water).
N 02  Backwash water and sludge to be discharged to a tailings leach settling tank across
the roadfor the WTP.
4.5    Mufulira Division - Mufulira.
4.5.1  Existing water and sanitation systems
The status of the existing water and sanitation systems is described in Appendix F, Plant
Status Field Reports.
4.5.2  Current environmental situation
The water supply to Mufulira Stream comes from Valley Dam. This was completed around
30 years ago, and gives signs that it may be in need of some rehabilitation work. The current
abstraction license is for 40,000 m3/day, but only about 16,000 - 20,000 m3/day is actually
being taken. It is possible that live storage could be doubled by raising the spillway crest 4.0
m, but that would need to be examined in more detail technically and environmentally.
However, if feasible, it would ensure that domestic water supplies could be taken entirely
from that source at up to 60,000 m3/day for up to two years at a time with minimal inflow.
The Mufulira Stream Raw Water Intake appears to be at risk from pollution from wash out
from an adjacent tailings dam and some protection may be required.
The Mufulira WTP is located within the Main Plant security area. The plant has a smelter,
and the sulphur dioxide fumes from that exceed international standards by a factor of 70.
Similarly, dust emissions are 70 times standards. Whilst the WTP does not show any
apparent signs of acid attack, the proximity of such emissions may be absorbed into either the
raw water or treated water, with consequent diminishment of quality.
The Mining Plant at Mufulira sits astride a ridge, and this is reflected by having five STW at
different points of the compass. All five are pond treatment systems. Calculations show that
biologically, two of the ponds are capable of producing an applicable standard effluent.
However, Kankoyo North and South, and Butondo Big Pond are all under capacity for
biological treatment. None of the ponds are capable oVf producing an effluent capable of
meeting a coliformn standard. Both sets of Kankoyo ponds are within 1/2 km of housing, and
are used as a play ground by local children. Children also abound at Kantanshi Section 9
ponds, and are probably responsible for an act of vandalism there, which broke down the

Butando Big Pond. and Kantanshi Section 9 ponds Crocodile were reported at Kantanshi Big
Pond, but not observed, and at Kankoyo North pond, where one was observed.
A point, which needs to be noted, is that Butondo Big Pond had no outflow at the time of the
site visit. Obviously, there has been no outflow from No I pond for some considerable time.
It is possible that there may be seepage through the underlying strata, and this needs to be
checked, and if proved sealed off. The risk would be contamination to groundwater from
such sewage seepage.
Sewerage is also subject to vandalism, and at least one sewer was observed that had been
broken. The pipe was an asbestos cement pipe, and it is averred that local children had
broken it by throwing stones against it. Raw sewage was flowing all over an adjacent open
area, where people passed, and children played.
One point for concern was discovered at 1 7th Street pump station. This pump station has both
a water booster pump, and a sewage pump on the same site, within 20 m of each other.
Neither has a stand-by. There is obviously a positive risk of cross contamination, even if not
directly, then through the agency of workmen working first on one pump, then on the other.
4.5.3  Project description
Supply and Demand Projections. Present water supply demand is estimated to 34,700
m3/d, including 3,000 m3/d for mines operations. For 2005 the demand is estimated to 42,000
m3/d, and sewage flow is estimated at 18,250 m3/d (see Appendix H for details).
Investment Programme. Project investments proposed by the World Bank for Mufulira
division are shown in Table 4.5 in Appendix E. Notes concerning environmental issues have
been added in the light of findings from this study.
Significant Environmental Effects. Increasing supply demand up to 2005, and the Project
will not cause any significant impact on the present raw water supply arrangements. Sewage
discharges will increase in the period to 2005. Over load of sewage ponds will cause risks of
significant environmental effects if the capacity is not expanded as recommended by this
Report.
Minor Environmental Effects. Minor environmental effects may be expected from potential
transmission pipelines bursts and from construction works. On sewerage, there is a risk of
minor effects from vandalism with breaking of sewer pipes and lack of overflow capacity at
pump stations.
4.5.4  Environmental assessment
Raw Water Intake. The lake impounded by the Valley dam is already a fact of life of the
area, and has been for nearly 30 years. However, concern is expressed at the condition of the
dam, and it is recommended that it be inspected by a registered panel dam engineer. It may
also be necessary to engage a grouting specialist to advise on sealing the apparent leaks under
the dam. As a part of both exercises, consideration should be given to raising the crest of the
spillway by 4.0 m. This would more than double live storage from 16.6 to 35.0 x 106 m3.
The engineering feasibility needs to be established as a first stage, and then a separate
environmental assessment made of that specific proposal. The recommendation is included in
Appendix H.

The intake pump station needs structural attention to the adjacent reservoir. That would give
some protection against pollution in the Mufulira Stream from an adjacent tailings dump. As
a further stage, consideration should be given to stabilising the tailings dump on the faces
facing the Stream. This could be done with re-vegetation, geo-textiles. etc. The pump station
delivers to the WTP, and is supposed to have capacity up to 20,000 m3/day.  It is
recommended that these be upgraded to deliver 30,000 m3/day, to give a greater reliance upon
raw water for domestic supplies than mine water. This recommendation is included in
Appendix G.
Water Treatment Plant. The capacity for the clarifiers is estimated to be 23,000 m3/day.
This is believed to be reasonable, if not an over estimate. Therefore, to cater for 2005 flows,
the clarifiers need to be doubled in capacity, on the assumption that all incoming flow first
goes through the clarifiers. This would be beneficial to the overall treatment process, and
permit easier balancing of flows to the filters.
Sludge and backwash water are currently discharged to a stream, which eventually finds its
way back to the Mufulira Stream, downstream of the water intake. The originating stream
probably also carries mine waste water, and the volume of WTP waste is probably less than
5% of that discharged by the mine. The environmental effects of the WTP wastes would
therefore be masked or diluted by the mine wastes. The volume, at 5% would rise to about
2,000 m3/day by 2005. One option to river discharge would be to construct a tank to receive
all waste flows, and pump this back to the inlet for re-processing with the raw water over 24
hours. The only constraint to that is there is a risk of build up of iron and manganese.
Water Transmission and Reticulation Systems. The existing pipework is in need of
replacement, otherwise there could be breakdowns to supply from bursts, with consequent
danger to persons and/or property. Provided the materials for the new pipes are chosen
correctly, they should give at least 30 years service before again becoming a problem.
Likewise, that selection would also obviate another potential risk, cross pollution from
sewage into cracked pipes orjoints. It is believed that in any case that risk is small.
Main Water Transmission Booster Pump Stations. The water booster stations should be
rehabilitated, and in particular 1 7t Street pump station should be separated from the sewage
pump station. Likewise, the workers who attend to the water pumps should be kept separate
from those who attend to the sewage pumps. This is included in the recommendations under
common issues.
Sewage Reticulation and Trunk Mains. Sewage flows mainly by gravity, but there are 9 No
pump stations, all low lift, to raise the sewage locally to the head of the next adjacent sewer.
This is normal practise elsewhere, and creates no nuisance, except when there is a pump
stoppage.
Sewage Pumping Stations. To guard against nuisance created by pump stoppages, duplicate
pump sets should be available at every pump station, on a working/stand-by arrangement.
Likewise, where land permits, overflow ponds should be constructed to give about 6 hours
capacity against longer stoppages. Piped outlets from such ponds should be fed to the nearest
water course as far downstream as possible. (See also Nchanga, Section 4.4.4).
Sewage Treatment Works. Unless the overload situation receives attention, there will be a
serious danger of creating environmental nuisances. One of the first consequences will be
that the ponds will start to smell. Gross solids will float on the surface, and this will lead to
rat infestations, and fly and mosquito breeding. If the hydraulic overload exceeds the

capacity of the inter pond arrangements, over spills may also be expected. Based on
conventional pond design, the following have been calculated as required:

4 maturation ponds
Kantanshi Section 9        1 new primary facultative pond 10,000 m2,
4 maturation ponds.
These ponds will then give effluents conforming to the recommended standards in all
respects, and of a quality suitable for aqua culture and irrigation. Attention should also be
given to the ground conditions, and in the event that fissured rock is below any pond, the
bottom of the ponds must be sealed to prevent pollution of groundwater.
4.5.5 Summary of recommendations
The following recommendations are reflected in the EMP (Chapter 6):
MO]  The tailings dump adjacent to the Mufulira Stream intakes should be protected on the
slopes facing the stream,, in case it is found that pollutant matter can enter the water
intake.
M02  The 1 7th Street pump station should be separatedfrom the sewage pump station.
M 03  The Kankoyo North and South sewage ponds should be replaced with new combined
sewage ponds. The existing Kankoyo ponds are in any case under capacity for 2005
flows.
M 04 The remaining three sewage pond systems all require upgrading to accept 2005
flows.
M 05 All the 9 sewage pumping stations should be upgraded.
4.6    Konkola Division - Chililabombwe
4.6.1  Existing water and sanitation systems
The status of the existing water and sanitation systems is described in Appendix F, Plant
Status Field Reports.
4.6.2  Current environmental situation
Konkola Division derives its water from three sources; Kafue River and mine water,
delivering to Chililabombwe WTP, and Mingomba Intake, delivering to Konkola WTP.
Konkola Division is near the headwaters of the Kafue River, and the risk of accidental
pollution is very slight. The Mingomba Intake is on a stream of limited catchment, and
unknown hydrological perforrnance. It also sits at the top end of the tailings dam. There is
therefore a slight risk that at periods of low stream flow the intake is drawing water back from
the tailings dam.
It should be regarded as a matter for environmental concern that the Kamenza reservoirs stand
as they do.  The now disused reservoir is a danger.  It was of prestressed concrete
construction. Concrete is now spalling off the walls, .exposing the prestress wires, some of

which have already snapped and broken. If many more fail. the walls will have no structural
strength, and could easily collapse with potentially fatal results. The new reservoir has been
standing incomplete for so long its foundations must now be suspect from weathering. It
would be unwise to continue construction without a thorough ground investigation to prove
the soundness of the foundations.
The Konkola mines are the deepest on the Copperbelt, and water drawn from these is almost
certain to be high in carbon dioxide. Corrosivity is therefore a factor, which should be
investigated further, especially if reliance has to be placed on more water for future expansion
of domestic water supplies.
4.63   Project description
Supply and Demand Projections. Total demand for water supply, including Konkola
township and mines operations is 22,500 m3/d. This will increase to 26,000 m3/d in 2005.
Sewage flow is estimated to 9,250 m3/d in 2005 (see Appendix H).
Investment Program. Project investments proposed by the World Bank for Konkola division
are shown in Table 4.6 in Appendix E. Notes of significance for the environment have been
added in the light of findings from this study.
Significant Environmental Effects. ZCCM estimate that water is pumped from the Kafue
River at 30,000 ms/day. This represents about 10% of the river flow at minimum flow, and
this could be safely increased by 50%, if needed, without significant environmental impact.
To avoid significant environmental impact from the effluent discharge from the sewage
ponds, the recommendations of this Report should be followed.
Minor Environmental Effects. Minor environmental effects may be expected from
rehabilitation and replacement of transmission and distribution pipelines.
Sewage pump stations should have overflow capacities to avoid environmental impacts from
pump stoppages.
4.6.4  Environmental assessment
Raw Water Intake. The raw water intake is situated well away from any houses. It sits on a
stretch of the river, upstream from the Golf Course sewage pond effluent, and it is little risk of
pollution from that source. It is thought unlikely to suffer from accidental pollution of the
river, so a raw water reservoir is not necessary here.
Water Treatment Plant. Part of the Chililabombwe WTP is situated in the Township, and
not therefore subject to mine security. The other part, which gives sedimentation treatment to
mine water, is within the mining area. Sludge is drawn off twice a year, and pumped to the
tailings clarifier, for disposal to the tailings dam. It is recommended that all water should
receive settlement at the WTP. This would extend the operation of the filters, and permit a re-
organisation of the pipework layouts to give greater flexibility between flows to the two
banks.
There is a water storage reservoir at the bottom of the works. This is supported by externally
applied stressing rods. This looks as if it was an addition to support the structure, which must
have looked in distress at the time. It is an environmental risk left as it is, as any structural
failure could result in a sudden release of water with consequent flood damage to
neighbouring property. This reservoir should be replaced. with another of adequate design.

Backwash water at present is discharged to a stream, which eventually finds its way back to
the Kafue River. The stream would probably be ephemeral if it did not carry the WTP waste
water. As it is only backwash water, at present, this would have some mineral impurities in it,
but would largely be organic impurities. It is probable that it exerts an oxygen demand on
any aquatic life in the stream, and may have caused the death of most forms of life. If a
clarifier is constructed, the wastes would then be environmentally unfriendly to that stream.
In case a clarifier is installed, a tank should be constructed to receive all waste flows, and
pump this back to the inlet for re-processing with the raw water over 24 hours. The only
constraint to that is there is a risk of build up of iron and manganese.
Water Transmission and Reticulation Systems. The existing pipework is in need of
replacement, otherwise there could be breakdowns to supply from bursts, with consequent
danger to persons and/or property. Provided the materials for the new pipes are chosen
correctly, they should give at least 30 years service before again becoming a problem.
Likewise, that selection would also obviate another potential risk, cross pollution from
sewage into cracked pipes orjoints. It is believed that in any case that risk is small.
Sewage Reticulation and Trunk Mains. Sewage flow arriving at the Golf Course ponds is
smaller than would have been expected. It has been observed that the pipe appears to have
been fractured at the solid waste dump and raw sewage was spilling out at that site, this
should be repaired as soon as possible.
Sewage Pumping Stations. There may have to be a pumping station to serve Kamenza, if the
sewage from that area is diverted to Golf Course ponds. The siting should be chosen to be
screened from housing, and to permit an emergency overflow pond to be sited adjacent to
receive any spills in the event of pump stoppages.
Sewage Treatment Works. Both Golf Course ponds and Konkola ponds are sited well away
from any housing. There is no noticeable smell from either, and nothing to create a nuisance.
Crocodiles in the Golf Course ponds create a hazard to people working in and around the
ponds; some seen must have been 3.5 to 4.0 m long, and more than capable of attacking a
human. A hippopotamus is also believed to use the ponds (see also Section 4.2.8). Their
presence is encouraging though, as indicating that food, in the form of fishes and frogs, exist
in the ponds. This supports the calculations that Golf Course ponds do achieve biological
treatment, but fail to meet the proposed coliform standard.
It has been suggested by ZCCM that sewage treatment be concentrated at Golf Course and
Konkola ponds. This makes a lot of sense, and calculations have confirmed that Golf Course
has got the capacity, with added maturation ponds, to accept the extra flow. One point of
concern is the high phosphate level in the incoming sewage to Golf Course ponds. Mtonga, et
al (Mtonga 1999), reported levels as high as 11.5 mg/I. This is unusually high for what is just
a domestic sewage, and is the cause of the flourishing water hyacinth growth. It is possible
that one source of the phosphate is solid waste dumpsite adjacent to the access road to Golf
Course ponds, and more or less on top of the trunk sewer; whereby leachate is somehow
entering the sewer. Some samples, immediately upstream and downstream of the site would
confirm or deny that. There are however, no maps or drawings available to confirm the layout
of the sewer, but in the parallel solid waste study (Chapter 5), it was observed that the sewer
does appear to be broken at the site of the dump.
Konkola pond effluent gets diverted for irrigation purposes. One hole was observed in the
bank of the final pond to let water out to an adjacent field. These ponds are also capable of
giving biological treatment, but fail to meet the coliform standard.

Given that there is plentv of room at both sites to construct further ponds. 4 no maturation
ponds should be constructed at each site to give a coliform conforming effluent. The effluent
would then be suitable for aqua culture and irrigation.
4.6.6 Summary of recommendations
The following recommendations are incorporated in the EMP (Chapter 6):
K 01  In case a clarifier is installed a tank should be installed to receive all backwash water
and pump this back to the inlet for re-processing.
K 02   The Kamenza reservoir situation should receive special attention to clear away the
old reservoir, and make proper ground investigations on the site of the new one.
K 03   The Golf Course and Konkola sewage ponds have adequate capacity to treat all
sewage flows to 2005, provided maturation ponds are added. Kamenza ponds should
be closed.
4.7    Roan Antelope Mine Corporation - Luanshya
4.7.1  Existing water and sanitation systems
The status of the existing water and sanitation systems is described in Appendix F, Plant
Status Field Reports.
4.7.2  Current environmental situation
The current environmental situation at Luanshya is grave, mainly due to lack of funds, but for
other reasons as well. No sewage pump station was running, so sewage was passing either
into the Luanshya Dam, or into the Luanshya Stream. Sewers were also blocked, to enable
the sewage flow to irrigate adjacent fields.
Raw water is taken from Shaft 18/28, and flows in an open culvert through a low cost
township (Mpatumatu), where it can be easily polluted by township activities. Raw water is
also taken from the Luanshya dam, which probably is being polluted from seepage of sewage.
Raw water is pumped into Makoma Dam from Kafubu River, which drains from Ndola City,
and could be carrying pollution from that source. One of the transmission pipelines suffered
two major bursts during the site visit. Water is only pumped to distribution for certain
restricted hours every day.
Sewage flows basically two ways.  The Mpatamatu pond flows discharge into the
Nkulumashiba Stream, which joins the Kafue River about 15 km downstream. The
Mpatamatu ponds are currently over loaded, and producing a sub-standard effluent. This has
a major influence on the aquatic regime of the Nkulumashiba Stream, and it is expected that
this is dead to most forms of life down to the Kafue (See also Section 4.2.2).
The Roan ponds are within hydraulic loading parameters for producing a biologically
acceptable effluent, but out with the standards for coliforms. The effluent discharges to the
Luanshya Stream, via a farm, which takes some for irrigation. In terms of environmental
impact, the resulting effluent stream would not be making a significant impact upon the
receiving waters.

4.7.3  Project description
Supply and Demand Projections. Present water supply demand is estimated to 31.300 m3/d
including mines operations and supply to the municipality. This will increase to 37.800 m3/d.
The sewage flow in 2005 is estimated to 18,000 m3/d (see Appendix H).
Investment Program. Project investments proposed by the World Bank for Luanshya
division are shown in Table 4.7 in Appendix E. Notes related to environmental aspects have
been added in the light of findings of this study.
Significant Environmental Effects. Provided that the recommendations of the Report is
followed, there should be no significant environmental effects from the Project with regard to
the water supply and sewage works.
Minor Environmental Effects. The construction of new and rehabilitated pipelines will
impact have some minor environmental effects, and there is a potential risk of pipe bursts.
The present situation with some mains going dry at periods will be improved. This also
applies to sewage pipes, but there is a need to be aware of clogged sewage pipes on starting
up the system after rehabilitation.
4.7.4  Environmental assessment
Raw Water Intake. None of the three water intakes need uprating to cope with the demands
to 2005. The Kafubu River Intake is the most remote of the three, and least likely to cause
any environmental problems. The problem of the Shaft 18/28 water flow through Mpatamatu
township has already been mentioned. The only way to solve that problem would be to
enclose the culvert in which the stream runs. Even then, it would be impossible7to exclude
street run-off, as this stream also forms the storm water outlet from the township. One
solution might be to construct a holding pond before it reaches the main lake. That at least
could form a detritus trap and alleviate a silting problem in the main dam.
The Luanshya Dam source collects less urban pollution in normal times, but is presently
heavily polluted from the sewage inflows to the lake. Once that situation is normalised, and a
rainy season has flushed the lake through, this source could be on a par with the Kafubu in
terms of pollution.
The Kafubu River intake is situated adjacent to the Municipal Council water intake. To the
2005 horizon, it is unlikely that more water would be taken from the Kafubu than the present
abstractions. Likewise, reliance will have to continue of the Shaft 18/28 water, and the water
from the Luanshya Dam. These all feed into the Makoma Dam, from which the water is
drawn for treatment. From the visit made, it seems obvious that natural rainfall must also
play a part in the water balance of the water supply as, at the end of the dry season, the lake
level was quite low, and goes lower before the rainy season replenishes the level. If any one
of these three feed sources were to be unavailable for any reason, it could be quite serious for
the Makoma Dam regime, and for the water supply to Luanshya Townships. Backwash water
and sludge from the WTP goes straight back into the Makoma Dam. The dilution in the dam
would be more than sufficient to mitigate against the effect of any chemicals, provided that
mixing is taking place within the lake.
Water Treatment Plant. The present WTP would have no capacity to spare after 2005, and
the WTP would then require extensions for the next period. Sludge and backwash water
disposal has already been mentioned above.

Water Transmission and Reticulation Svstems. The existing pipework is in need of
replacement; otherwise there could be breakdowns to supply from bursts, with consequent
danger to persons and/or property. Provided the materials for the new pipes are chosen
correctly, they should give at least 30 years service before again becoming a problem.
Likewise, that selection would also obviate another potential risk, cross pollution from
sewage into cracked pipes or joints.
Sewage Reticulation and Trunk Mains. In Mpatamatu township, manholes were observed
with the manhole covers and frames removed, and blocked internally to deliberately
encourage the sewage to spill over. This was to enable an adjacent field to receive water.
Manhole construction and sewer access is a problem also in many other places. The people do
not realise is that they are creating an environmental hazard, not just to themselves, but to
other people as well. The ultimate solution is long term through education, but in the short
term, and especially on trunk sewers, which are less prone to blockages, manholes should be
completely sealed off with heavy concrete covers through such areas.
Sewage Pumping Stations. None of the three sewage pump stations was operating at the
time of the visit. However, it was obvious all were in need of urgent rehabilitation, both for
mechanical plant, and for the building and structural works. The environmental impact of
their non-operation has been described before. A short-tern measure is proposed in the Plant
Status Field Report, but the long-term solution is to get the pump stations working again.
Sewage Treatment Works. The present status of the two STP is described above.
Environmentally, Mpatamatu STP is the cause for greater concern. It takes the sewage
discharges from the greater number of people, and is overloaded. These ponds need to be
totally reconstructed. Calculation show that three ponds are necessary, 100,000 m2 followed
by two of 80,000 m2 each. 4 no maturation ponds, each of 5 days retention will also be
required to ensure the proposed standard for effluent in all respects. The effluent would then
be adequate for aqua culture and irrigation, e.g. a coliforn standard of 100 per 100 ml. Roan
STP require 4 no maturation ponds, of 5 days retention each, to give sufficient effluent
coliform standard.
4.7.6 Summary of recommendations
The following recommendations are included in the EMP (Chapter 6):
L 01   The Roan sewage ponds have adequate capacity to treat all sewage flows to 2005,
provided maturation ponds are added.
L 02   Mpatamatu sewage ponds need urgent reconstruction to accommodate the 2005
flows.
L 03   Rehabilitation of three sewage pump stations is urgently required and should be
included in the Project investment budget.

5.    ASSESSMENT OF SOLID WASTE
5.1   Introduction
The solid waste management component was introduced into the Project during the Pre-
Appraisal Mission in May/June 1999 and consequently the final ER report presented a brief
of the mine townships' solid waste management situation. The ToR for the EA Study indicate
that in addition to an environmental assessment, the Report should also come up with an
investment program required to bring the solid waste management in line with established
environmental regulations and licenses issued by ECZ. In addition a tentative operational
budget is presented.
The resources allocated to the EA Study did not allow for thorough investigations and
feasibility studies. The assessments and estimates presented are based on reports provided by
ZCCM (of which some are assumed not to be very reliable), interviews with key personnel,
own observations and generally accepted standards and estimates applicable to African
conditions.
Most issues observed and assessed in this Chapter are common to all the five divisions/areas.
These common issues are discussed in Section 5.2. Sections 5.3 through 5.7 deal with issues
particular for each individual division. Special recommendations for immediate actions
pertaining to individual divisions are offered under these Sections. A recommended short
term Solid Waste Management Project is outlined in Section 5.8 and all recommendations
regarding environmental monitoring are listed in Section 5.9, and included in the EMP
(Chapter 6).
5.2   Issues Common to All Divisions
5.2.1  Waste contents and production
Contents of domestic waste
ZCCM reports use the following categories of the contents of domestic refuse: garden and
wood products, food stuff, paper products, metal products, leather and textiles, plastics and
rubber, and glass and ceramics. ZCCM divisions have for example estimated the content of
garden and wood products from 66 to 93 % and foodstuff from 2 to 15 % in the six-monthly
reports to ECZ. The contents of these reports do not change from one period to the other.
The following observations were made with regard to type of waste related to type of
housing.
* Low/medium cost (high density) townships
-  Refuse bases - bays (concrete slabs with walls on three sides) for each 15 - 25
houses.
-  Mostly soil and green waste from cleaning of backyards.
-  Small amounts of kitchen waste, larger amounts of garden refuse during the rain
season (people cutting threes and bushes in their gardens).
*  High cost (low density) townships
-  Metal dustbins with lids (100 - 150 1), mainly for kitchen waste. Many lids were
destroyed and some bins had disappeared without being replaced, or the bins were
without lids to prevent access by dogs and cats.

-  Small heaps next to the gates for green and backyard waste.
*  Mines operational areas
-  "Industrial waste" - mostly refuse from offices, some garden refuse and small
pieces of scrap metal, debris, bricks, concrete, tins etc.
-  Rock waste dumps, tailings dams and slag dumps (not considered in this Report)
* Medical and hazardous waste
- Incinerators at the hospitals/clinics - ashes dumped at dumpsites.
Domestic waste production
Three different sources of information have been used in an estimation of the amount of solid
(domestic) waste being produced by the mine townships of the five divisions under
consideration. The sources are i) recent oral or written reports from the ZCCM Engineering
Superintendent Sections, ii) the ZCCM Task Force (TF) report on transfer of municipal
services (ZCCM 1998), and iii) average standard figures for waste production applicable for
Africa, e.g. 0.7 kg/c/d for high cost housing, 0.6 kg/c/d for medium cost housing and 0.4
kg/c/d for low cost housing. ZCCM uses the following occupancy rates: high cost - 7 persons,
medium cost - 8 and low cost 9 per house. ZCCM keeps fairly accurate records of the number
of houses of the three categories in mine townships receiving municipal services. Control
calculations were made using the number of bins/bays and estimated average volumes and
density of the waste.
The following Table 5.2 gives a summary of the total production figures arrived at using the
above three mentioned sources of data. The average cost figures are arrived at using source
iii) above with the cost figures of(ZCCM 1998).

5.2.2 Waste collection and transport
The following information was given, and observations made during field visits with regard
to common aspects of waste collection and transport in the five areas.
* Contractors with trucks (5 - 1 0 tons) or tractors and trailers on six months contracts.
* Contracts with Engineering Superintendent Sections, monitoring of contracts by Public
Health Department (Chief Health Officer).
* Collection 2 times a week in a zone rotating system in the townships.

Mine Township Services Project
*  The contractors are also responsible for road sweeping and cleaning of ditches and open
drains.
*  The crew on a truck/trailer would normally consist of one driver and four workers.
In general, most regulations of the ECZ licenses were not complied witi. These include
littering around bays and bins and along roadsides due to insufficient cover of the trucks and
trailers, and health risks for the workers who do not have appropriate protective clothing.
5.2.3 Waste disposal
A general impression from the visits to the dumpsites was the relative low standard of
operation, control and environmental protection. There were illegal dumpsites along access
roads and scavengers were allowed to operate freely on all sites. No caretakers were observed
monitoring arrival of trucks/trailers and giving instructions on dumping. A set of common
observations is offered in the following.
*  Quarries from roads construction used as dump sites (RAMC (Z), Konkola, Nchanga).
*  Tailings dams used as dump sites (Mufulira - 3 sites, Nkana - I site).
*  New site (quarry) recently licensed by ECZ (Konkola).
*  Disposal method: dumping at the sites, scavengers go through the refuse and collect
metal, plastic, food and other items; most of the rest is then burned by the scavengers.
X  Occasional bulldozing and compression - left over refuse moved to the sides of the
dumpsite with the bulldozer (except for RAMC (Z) and Nkana).
*  Only occasional monitoring of number of trucks.
3  No monitoring for environmental protection.
*  Permanent fire in combustible material (Nkana), causing air pollution and danger for
scavengers and operational staff.
*  Refuse dumped in the bush, not at designated quany (RAMC (Z)).
*  Little vegetative effects from dumping on tailings dams, as intended (probably due to the
burning of the refuse).
*  No settlements in nearby areas (except for Nkana).
*  Long distance (I km or more) to nearest stream/river from dumpsites (except for Nkana).
*  Dumping sites licensed by ECZ as improved dumps.
3  Six-monthly reports by ZCCM, but no monitoring by ECZ.
*  Most quantity figures given by Engineering Superintendent Sections are probably based
on wrong assumptions regarding number of loads and weight per load.
*  Collection and dumping may be erratic due to lack of monitoring of the contractors'
operations by the Divisions' Public Health Departments and late payment of the
contractors (some of the contractors have not been paid since October 1998).
Abandoned dumpsites were not properly covered and received no aftercare.
Regardless of the low standards of operation, the general environmental impacts of domestic
waste collection, transport and disposal are only minor (with a possible exemption for Nkana)
in comparison with the environmental impacts from the mining operations.
5.2.4 Socio-economic dimensions
The obligation by homeowners to remove solid waste is contained in the Public Health Act
and is included in the calculation of the rates paid to the Council by the homeowners. The
Regulations under the Public Health Act include the mine townships as integral parts of the
Council township areas (Kabimba 1999).

Mine Township Services Project
Unlike the other services, the Councils charge the removal of solid waste together with rates.
As such, there should be an arrangement whereby the Private Operator to be contracted by
AHC, would charge the homeowner for solid waste disposal while the Council would remove
the waste disposal component from the rates. In this way, rates would become a property tax
to homeowners in townships serviced by commercial solid waste management. Such rates
would be varied and graduated in accordance to the area of residence.
There is also the issue of scavengers who work the waste dumps. The scavengers earn their
livelihood from waste dumps. The protection of the dumps through fencing. might close this
source of income to those who work the solid waste dumps. It is not known what levels of
income are generated from solid waste dumps and the number of people involved in this
trade.
In conducting the study one needs to make allowances for the fact that scavenging is an
illegal activity by Zambian law, which may make it difficult to establish the real extent of the
practice.
5.3    Nkana Division - Kitwe
53.1  Present disposal arrangements
The mine townships comprises seven low/medium cost areas and four high cost areas with a
total of 8,412 houses (+ 2,276 so called sub-standard or old houses). Five contractors are
engaged on six months contracts to cover the collection and transportation services in all mine
townships. The figure given by ZCCM officials for the amount of waste being produced is
21.912 tons/y. The annual costs are calculated at US $ 492,000 by the TF on municipal
services (ZCCM 1998) and US $ 1,044,557 by ZCCM officials during the field visit.

The refuse is dumped at Uchi dumpsite located on the abandoned tailings dam no 26, 1 km
from the main road entering Kitwe from the south. The Kitwe City Council and several other
companies are also dumping refuse at the site, which stretches along the access road and over
a wide area near the eroded part of the tailings dam.

5.3.2  Current environmental situation
Collection and transportation observations
The following observations regarding collection and transportation were made during
meetings and field visits (additional to the common issues):
*  Trucks and trailers are not sufficiently covered to prevent littering along roads.
*  Contract costs (ZCCM  officials) are too high in relation to the real amount of waste
collected.
Observations on the Uchi refuse dumpsite
The Uchi refuse dumpsite gives a general impression of lack of proper management and
control, and as being run by the scavengers.
*  The shelter for the caretakers was demolished.
*  Refuse is virtually dumped along the I km access road - not only littering.
*  Potential leakage into the stream trough the tailings dam (tributary to Kafue River) and
potential contamination of ground water from leachate.
*  Potential health risks for workers and scavengers (and children playing in the area) from
refuse dumped along the access road and over a large area, as well as from smoke from
the permanent fire in combustible material on the site.
It is recommended that proper management and monitoring procedures for the Uchi dumpsite
are worked out and implemented.
5.4    Nchanga Division, Chingola
5.4.1  Present disposal arrangements
Solid waste collection and transport from 1499 high cost, 1693 medium cost and 4569 low
cost houses (total 7761) is contracted out to two major contractors, using 12 trucks. 3 tractors
and 75 employees. Information given by ZCCM officials during field visits point at an
estimated figure of 28.241 tons/y, whilst the figure given by the TF (ZCCM 1998) is 48
tons/d or 17,520 tons/y. The refuse is duimped in a previous quarry near the Chingola -
Chililabombwe road.
5.4.2  Current environmental situation
Collection and transportation observations
The following observations were made during field visits regarding collection and transport
of refuse (additional to common issues).
*  Illegal dumping along the access road to the dumpsite
*  Contract costs seem to be on the high side. The figure for annual production given by
ZCCM officials is probably based on wrong data.

Observations on the Chililabombwe road refuse dumpsite
The dumpsite for Nchanga division is located along the Chililabombwe road, approximately 3
km from the townships. The dumpsite was established in 1992. In addition to domestic waste,
the dumpsite also receives scrap wires; wooden planks and debris as well as ash from
incinerated medical waste from the hospitals. The following observations were made during
site visits.
* Potential contamination of ground water from leachate. There is no monitoring of
leachate at the site. The site is located approximately I km from Mushishima River.
* Lack of material (soil) for cover of compacted refuse.
* No operational staff/caretakers observed on the site.
* Potential health risks for workers and scavengers.
5.5    Mufulira Division - Mufulira
5.5.1 Present disposal arrangements
Three contractors engaged on six months contracts, collect a reported 18,937 tons/y of solid
waste from 9,596 houses, using 10 trucks and 60 employees. The refuse is dumped in three
tailings dams outside Mufulira, Nos 8, 10 and 11.

5.5.2   Current environmental situation
Collection and trianspoitation observations
The following observations were made during field visits in addition to common issues.
*  Trucks and trailers were not sufficiently covered to prevent linering along the roads.
*  Contract costs given by ZCCM  officials are considerably lower than for Nkana and
Nchanga.
Observations on the refuse dumpsites
Only the dumpsite at tailings dam no. 10 was visited, and the following observations were
made. It is assumed that the situation is similar at tailings dams no. 8 and 11.
*  No shelter for caretaker/operational staff. No operational staff observed.
* The risk of contamination of ground water seemed to be small compared to runoff from
the tailings dam.
*  Lack of material (soil) for cover, except for tailings.
The amount of refuse being dumped appeared to be relatively small, and it is possible that
more is dumped at the two other dumpsites. ZCCM officials did however, not confirm this.
It is recommended to concentrate disposal of waste to only one of the three tailings dams for
the duration of the 5 years Project period.
With regard to monitoring of possible leachate from solid waste dumped on a tailings dam,
ECZ should be requested to clarify the relevance of establishing bore holes or wells for this
purpose on the chosen site.
5.6    Konkola Division - Chililabombwe
5.6.1   Present disposal arrangements
An estimated 29 tons of solid waste (ZCCM  1998) is generated daily from 4,866 houses (+
439 in Konkola township). This is collected by five contractors on six months contracts, using
7 ton tippers, and dumped in a quarry near the Golf Course road and in Konkola road
dumpsite. Workers equipped with trolleys and barrels clean up litter along the roads, from
ditches and drains. According to ZCCM officials, a bulldozer levels and compacts the refuse
at the dumpsite once a week.

The Golf Course road dumpsite is full and will be abandoned in the near future for a new site
further down the road. The new site has been licensed by ECZ. The following observations
were made.
-  The dumpsite was flooded with sewage from a broken sewage mains.
* No preparations were made for proper termination of the site.
* Potential contamination of ground water from leachate.
* Potential health risks for workers and scavengers.
5.7    Roan Antelope Mine Corporation - Luanshya
5.7.1 Present disposal arrangements
9,519 houses generate 56 tons of solid waste on a daily basis (ZCCM 1998). Three
contractors collect this on six months contracts. In 1994 six operational dumpsites were
abandoned and a new located in a group of quarries along a 1.5 km stretch of road in the
unpopulated area outside Lunashya. However, no access has been opened to the quarries and
the refuse is dumped in the bush next to the quarries along the road.

Collection and transportation observations
The following observations were made during the field visits (additional to common issues).
*  Trucks and trailers are not sufficiently covered to prevent littering.
* Contractors had not been paid lately due to the financial problems of RAMC(Z).
Observations on the Luanshya refuse dumpsite
There is no arrangements for aftercare of the six dumpsites closed in 1994, except for natural
growth of vegetation. On the new dumpsite the following observations were made.
*  No caretaker/operational staff is engaged on the site, thus no monitoring of the amount of
waste or number of truckloads.
*  Littering along the road and in the bush.
*  Risk of bush fires from scavengers buming the refuse.
*  No attempt made to compact and cover ieftover refuse.
*  No environmental monitoring.
It is recommended that access is opened to the chosen quarry (licensed) and that dumping in
the bush be stopped immediately.

Solid Waste Management under MTSP
The proposed Project's short term activities basically include improved management,
operation and monitoring procedures, employment of sufficient number of staff, training, and
repair/replacement of bays and bins. The following activities are proposed under the MTSP:
1.    Carry out a survey to establish a more correct picture of the contents and amount of
waste being produced by the mine townships and disposed of at the various
dumpsites, both during the dry and rainy seasons, including realistic estimates of
required resources and costs. The study should include an assessment of the need for
monitoring bore holes/wells for all dumpsites, the feasibility of investment in a
bulldozer and/or front loader for Uchi dumpsite (Nkana), and development of
procedures for management, operation and monitoring, included under EMP.

2.     Upgrading of bins and refuse collection bays:
3.     Upgrading of trucks and trailers to meet license requirements (responsibility of the
contractors);
4.     Procurement of improved quality collection and transport services. e.g. review and
upgrade contract specifications (I + 4 years contracts - review specifications once a
year):
S.     Minor investments at the dumpsites will include a proper gate to prevent unauthorised
access by vehicles (not necessarily fencing, except for Nkana)2, a shed with washing
and toilet facilities for the caretakers/operators, protective clothing, a small first aid
kit and necessary tools. Investment in own machinery for Uchi should be considered;
6.     Hire compressing and overfill machinery (for Uchi dumpsite see item 6 above);
7.     Development of procedures for management, operation and monitoring at dump sites
(development of procedures may be incorporated in the study under I. above);
8.     Engagement of operational and caretaker staff on the dumpsites;
A Feasibility study on future solid waste management on the Copperbelt, including also
industrial and hazardous waste should be carried out under the Urban Development Project.
This comprehensive study will include scavenger issues.
2 In case the dumpsites need to be physically protected against scavenging, fencing of all dumpsites
may be required. Engagement of night guards may also be required.

5.8    Environmental Management and Monitoring
The following environmental management, monitoring and mitigating measures are
incorporated in the contract with the PO. The recommendations will, if properly implemented,
meet the requirements of the ECZ licenses for solid waste collection and transport (issued to
contractors) and for disposal arrangements (currently issued to ZCCM).
Summary of environmental recommendations
SW 01 Carry out a study on the scavenger problem  (under Solid Waste Copperbelt
Feasibility Study).
SW 02 Amend specifications in the contracts for collection and transport to accommodate
requirements of the ECZ licenses (ifrequired).
SW 03 Establish bore holes or wells in the vicinity of the dumpsites for Nkana, Nchanga,
Konkola and Luanshya RAMC (Z) (Luanshya) in accordance with a plan to be
developed in collaboration with ECZ.
SW 04 In collaboration with ECZ, develop a regular monitoring program with parameters,
sample procedures, schedules and test regime for ground water samples (and surface
water downstream of the Uchi dumpsite).
SW 05 Proper management and monitoring procedures for the Uchi dumpsite should be
worked out and implemented as a matter of urgency.
SW 06 For Mufulira division, disposal of waste should be concentrated to only one of the
three tailings dams for the duration of the S years Project period.
SW 07 Access to be opened to the chosen quarry (licensed) at Luanshya and the dumping in
the bush should be slopped immediately.
5.9    Analysis of Alternatives
A study has been budgeted for under the project to review a regional approach to Copperbelt
solid waste management needs. The study would look at options to reorganise solid waste
management on the Copperbelt within a provincial framework, incorporating domestic waste
from councils' and mine townships' areas. The future waste management arrangement on the
Copperbelt should also take industrial and hazardous wastes into consideration. (It is assumed
that the waste problems related to mining operations will be solved separately.) This Report
therefor suggests a feasibility study on solid waste management alternatives on the
Copperbelt to be carried out as a component of the proposed Urban Development Project. The
study should also review the privatisation arrangements presently being tested on the
Copperbelt. A likely outcome of the study will be a proposal for a separate solid waste
management project. Long term solutions for the mine townships have for the same reason
not been considered in this Report.

6.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
6.1    Focus and Status of the EMP
The ToR indicate that the Consultant should prepare a monitoring plan. Although the EA
Study concludes that the sum of all environmental impacts of the MTS Project will be
positive, the recommended amendments of the project and mitigating measures would justify
an environmental management plan to be prepared and implemented. The Consultant therefor
recommends an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the MTS Project, as outlined in
this Chapter.
The Project is described in Chapter I of the Report. Recommendations are presented in
relevant Sections of Chapter 4 (water supply and sanitation) and 5 (solid waste management)
and summarised at the end of each Section. Recommendations related to the EMP are
identified with a letter and number as follows:
* Water and Sanitation
- Common issues
Environmental management and monitoring        E 01 - 02
Mitigating measures                            C 01 -06

Konkola (Chililabombwe)                        K  01 - 03
RAMC (Z) (Luanshya)                            L 01 -03
*  Solid Waste Management                             SW 01 - 07
Annex C of the WB Operational Policies (OD) 4.01 sets out the guiding principles for an
EMP (WB I 998a). To prepare the EMP the AHC and the Consultant should a) identify a set
of responses to potentially adverse impacts, b) determine requirements for ensuring that those
responses are made effectively and in a timely manner, and c) describe the means for meeting
those requirements. The EMP shall according to the GD 4.01 include the following main
components: i) Mitigation, ii) Monitoring, iii) Capacity Development and Training, iv)
Implementation Schedule and Cost Estimates, and v) Integration of EMP with the Project.
It was agreed with AHC that all components of the EMP as relevant for each of the five
divisions/areas should be contained in one document. This will serve the purpose of better co-
ordination and ease the workload of AHC, ECZ and other stakeholders.
Physical aspects of the Project involve operation and maintenance, rehabilitation and
upgrading of existing facilities for water supply, sanitation and solid waste services, and
possibly increased discharge of effluents. Due to the present lack of meters and possible
future reductions in unaccounted for water (UfW), it is unlikely, but not clear whether the
Project will lead to an increase in raw water extraction during the five years Project period.
The EA Study focuses both on existing environmental problems that should be mitigated
through implementation of the Project and on problems being caused by the implementation
of the Project itself. Recommendations of Chapters 4 and 5 of the Study are thus reiterated in
the EMP.

Zambia Consolidated Copper AMines/lWorld Bank                       Finai Report
Mine Township Services Project
The EA Study did not identify any significant, but a number of minor environmental impacts
of the proposed project implementation (provided that the Report s recommendations are
followed up and incorporated in the Project). Priority on mitigation measures should be given
to significant impacts identified from the present operations, which mainlv concerns sewage
treatment and disposal in some of the divisions, and solid waste disposal at the Uchi site in
Kitwe. Resettlement issues should also be given priority in case of actuality.
Preparation and internal clearance of the EMP is one of the conditions set by the Bank for
final Board presentation. However, the document has also been prepared in reference to the
GRZ EIA regulations (ECZ 1997) and expropriation and resettlement procedures (the Land
Acquisition Act). Application of the EMP should consequently go beyond the scope of the
IDA financed components of MTSP. In accordance with the above mentioned EIA
regulations, the EA Report should be presented by AHC to ECZ for review and issue of an
environmental licence with monitoring procedural guidelines attached.
AHC and the Bank should, in collaboration with ECZ, establish the formal status of the EMP
when the Bank and AHC approve the Plan. A reference may be made to the EMP in a
possible Performance Contract (between AHC and MMMD/MFP) with the authority and
responsibilities of AHC regarding implementation and monitoring of the EMP established in
that Contract. MMMD has, on behalf of GRZ as majority owner of ZCCM, taken over the
overall responsibility for environmental liabilities connected to the ZCCM operations,
including municipal services, in reference to EMPs for ZCCM operations. It is proposed that
such a performance contract should delegate these responsibilities to AHC with regard to
water supply, sewage and solid waste management. In Phase 11, the implementation of the
EMP will be vested with the PO under the management contract with AHC.
6.2    Legal, Policy and Institutional Framework
Applicable laws, regulations, policies and institutions with potential roles in environmental
monitoring and management related to the water supply, sanitation and solid waste sectors in
general and the MTSP in particular are described in Chapter 2 of the Report, and will not be
repeated here. Institutional responsibilities in relation to the EMP are proposed in the next
Section.
6.3    EMP Institutional Responsibilities
There are three distinctive aspects or roles of institutional responsibilities with regard to the
EMP:
* Implementation of the action plan components of the EMP in accordance with the
planned time schedules, e.g. mitigation of environmental impacts, as well as
organisational changes and capacity building;
* Monitoring of the implementation of the EMP and mitigating measures;
* Independent environmental review and control of the planned and approved actions
instituted by the EMP and the monitoring data and results.
The roles and responsibilities with regard to the above aspects are outlined below.

Mine Township Services Project
6.3.1 AHC Municipal Services Ltd
Given the key role of AHC and its management in implementation and management of the
MTS Project, it would be most functional that AHC takes on the overall responsibility for
supervising and monitoring the implementation of the EMP by the PO. By nature of the
monitoring and mitigating actions, most of them should be implemented by the PO under
instructions from AHC in reference to the contract, leaving AHC with a monitoring role. The
AHC duties with regard to the EMP include
* AHC to be overall responsible for implementation of the EMP.
* After ECZ has ratified the MTSP EMP, AHC should be authorised to instruct the PO to
implement specified actions of the EMP, which naturally would fall under the
responsibility of a water, sanitation and solid waste service provider.
* AHC should be responsible for monitoring the POs compliance with the instructions.
6.3.2 Private Operator
The contracts between the AHC and the PO should adequately cover monitoring, control and
mitigating measures related to raw and potable water quality, sewage treatment operations
and quality of effluent, as well as solid waste management and pollution risks.
Chapters 4 and 5 elaborate on a number of recommendations concerning environmental
management and monitoring and other common issues. These are referred to as
recommendations E 01 and E 02 and C 01 - C 06. Part of E I 1 (training) and C 01 - 06 are
all relevant for the PO (except C 02 in case the recommended alum recovery plants are not
installed) and should be incorporated in the instructions from AHC to the PO. The same
applies to recommendations E 03 - E 09 and 0 01 - 0 13.
Relevant parts of the EMP should be incorporated in the annual Strategic Business Plan
(Corporate Plan) to be prepared by the PO, as instructed by AHC. AHC shall review and
approve the plans in accordance with its mandate.
The PO shall include an environmental statement accounting for the measures taken in direct
reference to the EMP and this will be included in the annual report. This can be made
available to DWA, NWASCO/MOH and ECZ respectively, as Tequired. The PO shall also
prepare 6 monthly reports to ECZ (through AHC) in reference to licences issued by ECZ and
to NWASCO, as required.
The PO will have certain responsibilities in case of involuntary resettlement needs. These are
outlined in Appendix I and relevant paragraphs should be referred to in the PO contract.
With regard to particular division related issues, these concern basically contract management
and construction supervision and a general provision on procedures and reporting
requirements should be included in the PO contract.
6.3.3 ZCCM Group Environmental Services
It is assumed that the ZCCM Investment Holdings Company will retain a core staff of the
present GES to handle the ZCCM EMPs and environmental liabilities retained by ZCCM and
GRZ in the sales contracts. Personnel of the GES will as present be stationed at the divisional
offices. An arrangement may be made with the Company for this personnel to assist the AHC
EA Advisor in monitoring implementation of the EMP and other environmental control
functions. Special training may be offered for key personnel.

6.3.4 National Water and Sanitation Council
It is clear that AHC will require a water supply and sanitation license to be issued by
NWASCO. As indicated in Section 2.3.4 the Water and Sanitation Act outlines detailed
requirements for licence application. It is, however, not yet.known how NWASCO will
establish monitoring procedures for compliance with licence standards and to what degree
NWASCO will detail performance standards and tariff systems/mechanisms in its guidelines.
6.3.5 Environmental Council of Zambia
ECZ is supposed to issue an environmental licence after scrutiny of this EA Study Report.
ECZ issues licences for the following operations of the AHC/PO: i) effluent discharge from
sewage treatment works, ii) collection and transport of solid waste (contractors) and iii)
disposal of solid waste. ECZ shall according to its own regulations monitor the compliance
with the licences through 6 monthly reports and control visits.
6.3.6 Ministry of Health
MOH is according to the Public Health Act monitoring potable water quality in the country.
This is done through the District Health Management Teams with laboratory services
provided by regional laboratories.
6.3.7 Water Development Board/Department of Water Affairs
WDB issue water rights, e.g. rights to extract water from waterways, and collect fees for these
rights. It is assumed that ZCCM has obtained the necessary water rights for domestic supply
and that these rights will be transferred to AHC.
DWA has the institutional and legal responsibility for monitoring of the quality of water in
the country's waterways. DWA should therefor receive reports on raw water quality prepared
by AHC/PO during the course of the Project.
6.3.8 Municipal Councils
Relevant municipal councils will have some responsibilities in case involuntary resettlement
becomes necessary, see Section 6.4 below. The Councils also issue planning permissions for
construction works and shall approve of the locations of any new solid waste dumpsites.
6.4   Institutional Capacity Building and Training
Both the GRZ and its donors give high priority to the sectors of water supply and sanitation,
and the country intends to invest heavily in these sectors in the coming years. Environmental
issues are equally high on the political agenda. Solid waste has so far not attracted similar
attention, but this is likely to change in the coming years. The environmental legislation
institutes new responsibilities to implementing agencies and companies related to
environmental assessment, mitigating measures and monitoring. Specially trained and well-
qualified personnel will be required, to ensure that environmental aspects are taken care of
from the early planning stage to implementation and operation of a given project.
The operations of AHC (including technical assistance), will be supported under the MTS
Project. Component iv) mentions the need for environmental expertise to be attached to the

Company. In relation to this EMP it is recommended that resources for capacitv development
and training be identified within the project budget, as indicated below.
AHC should have an Environmental Assessment Advisor in an independent position outside
the line functions of the Company. The EA Advisor will collaborate with other relevant
stakeholders. His/her responsibilities and scope of work will consist of three main
components:
* Scrutinise all major project terms of references, studies, plans and reports within the
scope of AHC operations and advise on environment related issues, EA studies, plans and
monitoring arrangements;
* Advise on, and monitor implementation of this EMP;
* Assess requirements for capacity development and training related to environmental
issues and arrange briefings, seminars and workshops.
(a full TOR is attached)
Staff of the future ZCCM Investment Holding Company's Environmental Services may be
offered special training in environmental assessment and monitoring if required. The costs are
covered under the Project.
An appropriate way of introducing this EMP for all stakeholders, including representatives of
the PO, would be to arrange a workshop in connection with the scrutiny for approval of the
plan. A lump sum is indicated in the cost estimate for this purpose.
With regard to other involved institutions, both ECZ and MOH are supported financially and
technically by donor funded projects, and would therefore not require additional resources
related to the implementation of this EMP.
Eventual requirements for TA/consultants in relation to implementation of the EMP will have
to be assessed by AHC when the executive management is in place. A lump sum is proposed
in the budget for this purpose.
Environmental aspects concern all people working in an enterprise. The need for qualified
and skilled workers with full understanding of their roles and tasks has been underlined in the
EA Study Report. It has therefor been recommended in this Report that the Project budget
should include a sum to be utilised for skills training of water, sewerage and solid waste
operators. Alternatively the PO contract shonld include the necessary provisions to ensure that
the operation and maintenance staff meet the competence requirements of the Competence
Based Modular Training (CBMT) systems adopted for the water and sanitation sector of
Zambia. It is assumed that NWASCO will institute such requirements in the water and
sanitation licenses.
6.5    Mitigating Measures and Implementation
The following Figures 6.1 to 6.7 contain the EMP in a matrix format, describing
Environmental Management and Monitoring Actions and Mitigating Measures, with
monitoring parameters, frequency, responsible institution/person and whom to report to.

6.6    Water Quality Parameters
6.6.1  Introduction
The test regime and parameters presented below may vary from practices presently supposed
to be applied in the Copperbelt. The reason for proposing variations to those practices is to
ensure that monitoring is carried out, and these proposals are believed to be practical for the
purpose of water quality and sewage effluent monitoring. Water tests shall be carried out
separately from sewage as the two are not compatible. The tests require the existence of a
laboratory equipped to carry out the tests to a consistent standard. A single result from a
laboratory is of itself only indicative. The only true manner of judging the value of any
particular result is to have a set of results over a period of time because each laboratory
develops its own characteristics of doing tasks - one will read to the top of a meniscus,
another to the bottom, and so on. The important point with respect to any laboratory is
consistency of results, that way analysis and trend detection become more meaningful.

Managanese            Can be troublesome in water, and toxic in large quantities
For raw water samples, there are typically no limiting values, but the values obtained are
valuable in assessing the condition of the source water, and for adjustment to the treatment
processes.
2.     Parameters to be analysed for from a full sample
A full sample would be taken once every year, and would be analysed in accordance with
WHO recommendation. This would analyse for all parameters listed in the current WHO
Guidelines. Amongst other matters, this would be a good guide as to whether toxic
substances from, say agricultural practices (pesticides/fungicides, etc) were finding their way
into raw water sources and supply. For treated water samples, the limiting value would be the
current MOH Guideline for that parameter.

Sewage - Full sample
A full sample for sewage effluents would be to determine every determinant set down by ECZ
for compliance.
All of the above results should be analysed for trends, and any trend, which develops over say
three sets of samples should be investigated more closely to determine the cause.

parameters, including date and the operator's name

6.7    EMP Implementation Cost Estimate
It is assumed that all costs associated with the EMP (Figures 6.1A through 6.7, except as
included in Table 6.9 below) shall be covered, either under the ordinary operational budget of
AHC/MTSP or under the Investment Program budget, incorporating also the Solid Waste
Management Project investments. Table 6.9 below summarises the additional costs proposed
for implementation of the EMP, including engagement of an EA Advisor, training, TA and
studies to a total of US $ 400,000.
Preliminary cost estimates for investments/mitigating measures recommended to be included
in the ordinary investment budget of the Project are indicated in Table 6. 10. These investment

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE EA STUDY
The following presents a proposal for Terms of Reference for an Environmental Assessment
Study of the Mine Township Services (MTS) Project in Zambia. (The TOR will be reviewed in
connection with finalisation of the aide Memoire from the Pre-Appraisal Mission May 24 - June
5, 1999).
1.    Introduction
Zambia is under reconstruction and its environmental problems have been identified and solutions
proposed from the Bank's perspective in the National Environmental Action Plan and the SAR
(16239-ZA) on the Environmental Support Program (ZM-PA-3253). Within the context of the
current negotiations for the sale of the remaining ZCCM assets, private investors have been
unwilling to take responsibility for assets that are not directly linked with mining operations. The
investors consider the municipal services traditionally being offered by ZCCM to its workers and
their families as non-core businesses. These non-core assets include those needed for the
provision of mine township services: water and sanitation, solid waste, storm-water drains, street
lighting, maintenance of township roads, cemeteries, and electricity distribution.
The investors are looking to GRZ to provide mechanisms that will assure the continuation of an
adequate and reliable range of vital urban services for company employees, their dependants and
other residents of the mine townships. If the investors are not confident that these services will
continue to be adequately provided, the sale of the mines may be significantly delayed, with
negative economic consequences for the country.
2.    Background Information
In connection with the privatisation process of Zamnbia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the
World Bank is considering to support a Mine Township Services (MTS) Project. An'
idL.tification mission from the Bank visited Zambia in February/March 1999 and the mentioned
Pre-Appraisal Mission outlined the proposed MTS Project, including water supply, sewage and
solid waste services in the mine townships of five present and previous divisions of ZCCM. The
other municipal services will probably be taken over by the Councils and ZESCO.
The Project will according to the Aide Memoire of the Pre-Appraisal Mission contain the
following components:
US $ mill.
i)    Management Contract with provisions for performnance bonuses   5.5
ii)    Operations Maintenance and Repair Fund                       10.0
iii)    Rehabilitation Works                                        18.5
iv)    Support to Asset Holding Company                              1.0
v)    Support to Municipal Institutions                              2.0
Total                                                        38.0
The Project will be implemented in three Phases:
i)    Phase I - up to 12 months. Management by an ZCCM-owned subsidiary Asset Holding
Company (AHC), with possible EU support (AHC Mining Municipal Services Ltd.).
ii)    Phase II - four years contract with a Private Operator (PO).

iii)   Phase III - transfer of assets and operations to permanent providers of services, probably
the commercial utility companies (water and sewerage) and the municipal councils (solid
waste).
The preliminary investment plan or capital works/rehabilitation budget includes the following
items: i) Water System, ii) Water System Metering, iii) Community Metering and iv) Sewage
Systems. The budget does not indicate any investments in solid waste collection and disposal.
Necessary investments will probably be included in a follow-on Urban Development Project. It is
assumed that the ZCCM-owned Asset Holding Company during the transition period, and later
the Private Operator will be responsible also for the solid waste from the mine townships, the EA
study shall encompass these services.
The EA study shall also identify potential socio-economic impacts of the Project.
For the purpose of this EA, the Bank in accordance with the WB OP/BP/GP 4.01 has assigned the
Project as Category B.
3.     Objectives
The Objectives of the EA will be to identify the possible negative environmental impacts of the
project as presently designed and propose the required mitigating measures to be implemented to
avoid these negative impacts. The EA will also highlight the positive impacts of the project on the
water and sanitation sector.
At this stage of the screening process, the negative impacts have been identified as mainly
coming from the existing installations and operations, while more positive environmental impacts
may be the result from the physical investments being financed under the Project, notably the
infrastructure, rehabilitation and equipment components for the sewage collection and disposal
schemes.
Although involuntary resettlement is not anticipated at this point in the preparation, should it
become an issue subsequently, a separate resettlement plan will be required.
The Project proposes the enhancement of the performance in urban water supply, sanitation and
solid waste collection and disposal through components incorporating institutional reforms and
capacity building under a concept of commercialisation and privatisation. The EA will assess
likely effects of other proposals under the Project on the enhancement of urban and rural
environmental conditions.
These terms of reference have been drafted with the objective that the EA would be over,
endorsed by the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and cleared in the Bank (AFTES)
before the appraisal mission, scheduled for September 1999:
4.     Environmental Assessment Requirements
The EA will seek to ensure that the Project complies with the relevant guidelines and
requirements of the following:

*  World Bank Operational Policies 4.01 "Environmental Assessment" (November 1998) and
related guidelines such as Bank Procedures 4.01 (November 1998) and OD 4.30
"Involuntary Resettlement" (June 1990) (OP/BP 4.12?);
* The Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook:
* National laws and/or regulations on pollution control, environmental reviews and impact
assessments, in particular the Statutory Instruments No 72 of 1993 and No 28 of 1997;
* Environmental assessment regulations of any other financing organisations involved in the
project; and
* The Zambia National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).
5.     Study Area
The core areas for the study include areas covered and influenced by water supply, sewage and
solid waste systems of the following ZCCM Divisions/Mining Companies:
* Roan Antelope Mine Corporation (RAMC (Z) Plc), Luanshya
* Nkana Division, Kitwe
*  Mufulira Division, Mufulira
* Nchanga Division, Chingola
* Konkola Division, Chililabombwe
Areas to be covered by the study are in particular those which are the focus of the urban water
supply and sanitation investments of the Project as well as the solid waste services, their water
intake areas, wastewater discharge locations, and affected water surface waters, and the main
catchment and/or groundwater systems (including their recharge areas) which supply them, as
well as solid waste disposal sites and their surroundings. The study area will in part cover areas
developed by the mines and affected by mines' operations. Interfaces with environmental impacts
of the mines' operations will be clarified and the precise boundaries of the study area for the
assessment will be decided upon during the initial exercise of the EA. Environmental assessment
of the mines' operations as such is outside the scope of work of this EA.
6.     Scope of Work
Some of the technical and economic/financial as well as institutional information on the project is
still being refined. The consultants will take stock of all relevant existing information at the time
of starting EA preparation.
7.     Task 1: Description of the Proposed Project
The Project is described in the attached Aide Memoire of May 24 - June 5 1999 with details of
the proposed repairs and rehabilitation program from its Annex 2. This task will take stock of the
project components as they stand now and will break them down according to the type of works
in order to ease the identification of their likely environmental impacts. A convenient way to do
so is to break down each activity into the following phases: present operations, construction,
maintenance, development of activities permitted by the works (e.g. design of the water supply
systems, land clearing and acquisition work, laying out the pipes etc.).

8.     Task 2: Description of the environment
The consultants will assemble, evaluate and present baseline data on the relevant environmental
characteristics of the study area. These will include information on any changes anticipated
before the project commences, in reference to the reconnaissance of the likely environmental
impacts of the project. Within the areas likely to be impacted the following environmental
impacts will be collated when relevant:
a)    Physical environment: geology; topography; soils; climate and meteorology; ambient air
quality; surface and ground-water hydrology; existing sources of air emissions; existing
water and soil pollution discharges; and receiving water quality.
b)    Biological environment (especially in rural areas): flora; fauna; rare or endangered
species; sensitive habitats, including parks or preserves, significant natural sites, etc.;
species of commercial importance, and species with potential to become nuisances,
vectors or dangerous.
c)     Socio-economic environment: land use (including current crops and cropping patterns);
land tenure and land titling; human settlements, human health indicators, family economy
and ability to pay for the proposed services, present water supply and water uses
(including current distribution of water resources if irrigation systems already exist in
area); control over allocation of resource use rights.
The consultants will make use of relevant environmental data available, in particular data
collected in the Environmental Impact Statement Report (applicable Appendixes H) (ZCCM
1997), the ZCCM Group Environmental Services, the RAMC (Z) PLC Environmental Services,
the Ministries of Environment and Natural Resources and Energy and Water Development.
9.     Task 3: Legislative and regulatory considerations
The consultants shall ascertain and summarise the pertinent regulations and standards governing
environmental quality, health and safety, protection of sensitive areas, protection of endangered
species, siting, land use control, etc., at international, national, regional and local levels. An
assessment of the present handling of the EA requirements and procedures, as well as of the
GRZ's capacity to handle these in the future should be included in this EA. The NEAP and the
Environmental Support Program should be made use of as part of this exercise.
10.    Task 4: Determination of the potential impacts of and impacts on the proposed
project
Potential impacts to be assessed include, but are not limited to the environmental reconnaissance
which identified likely impacts that should be investigated.
a)     Project Location: possible resettlement of people; loss of forest land; loss of agricultural
land (cropping and grazing); impact on flora and fauna; impact on history and cultural
sites; effects on water resources outside and inside command area.
b)     Project Design: disruption of hydrology; drainage problems; design of constructions and
other structures; crossings for people and animals.

Mine Township Services Project                                            Appendix A
c)    Construction Works: soil erosion; noise. traffic safetv issues, construction spoils
(disposal of); sanitary conditions and health risks associated with construction camp and
workers coming into area; social and cultural conflicts between imported workers and
local people.
d)    Project Operation: pollution by chemicals; impacts on soils (water logging, salinisation,
etc.); changes in ground water levels and quality inside and outside command area;
changes in surface water quality and risks of eutrophication; incidence of excreta and
water-related diseases, sanitary risks from sewage treatment operations.
In general potential environmental risks may be connected with the following stages in the water
supply and sewage disposal processes:
a)    Raw Water Intake
* Extraction quantities in relation to minimum flow requirement or aquifer potential
* Quality of raw water
b)     Water Treatment Works
* Backwash water and sludge discharges - recipient purification capacity and chemical
contamination
c)     Water Transmission and Reticulation Systems
* Leakage - contamination through cracks by sewage and other polluted water during
zero pressure periods
d)     Sewage Reticulation and Transmission Systems
*  Cracked or clogged pipes - sewage may contaminate ground water or seep out on the
surface and into trenches and streams
* Pipes cracked by nearby residents to provide irrigation water - pollution and health
risks
e)    Sewage Pumping Stations
* -Overflow during pump breakdowns - health risk for workers and contamination of
surrounding area
j)    Sewage Treatment Plants and Ponds
* Access by the public - health risks
* Disposal of coarse screenings, grit and sludge - soil/water pollution and health risks
for workers, nearby community and domestic animals
* Discharge water not thoroughly processed - pollution of recipient (length of
river/stream affected by the discharge and magnitude of changes in water quality
parameters), and/or health risks related to overflow water used for irrigation
*  Water weed on the pond - consequences for the purification processes in the ponds
* Crocodiles in the ponds - consequences for operation and maintenance
* Seepage from ponds into groundwater and nearby waterways
* Health risks for workers
* Need for system capacity upgrading due to increased volumes from rehabilitated
reticulation systems

g)     Construction and Rehabilitation Works
*  Involuntary resettlement requirements
*  Land use conflicts
a  Risk of accidents for workers and nearby residents - example: open water filled
trenches left unguarded without proper physical protection
With regard to solid waste collection, transport and disposal, the following operations may
constitute environmental risks:
a)   Household disposal
*  Health risks, particularly for children if proper containers are not used
b)   Collection and tran.bport
* Health risks for local population and pollution from open waste slabs
*  Health risks for collection workers
c)   Disposal landfills (to be elaborated)
*  Location - general nuisance for nearby residents
*  Dump/landfill disposal and treatment methods
*  Soil and water and air pollution from leachate and gas emission (and smoke in case
of burning refuse)
*  Health risks for workers, scavengers and nearby residents.
The EA Study should, in addition to requirements of the WB OP 4.01, include the following
issues related to solid waste:
- a survey of the operations carried out by the contractors, including the type and amount
of waste produced by the various categories of customers,
- preliminary designs and operational guidelines for improved dumps (eventual sanitary
I landfills if required by ECZ),
- estimate of investments, operational and environmental monitoring costs (for example
bore holes to monitor eventual leachate contamination of ground water) needed to meet
the requirements of the respective ECZ licenses,
- recommendation on organisation of the solid waste component under the AHC Mining
Municipality Services Ltd.
Implementation of the Project is linked to the privatisation process of the mining industry in
Zambia. This process has, and will have in the future, significant socio-economic consequences
for the involved employees and their families, in particular the miners living in the mine
townships. The EA study should identify potential socio-economic impacts directly or indirectly
connected to the Project and in case these may be assumed to be significant and negative,
recommend appropriate further studies and/or mitigating measures.
The EA shall cover, but not be limited to the above mentioned issues, and will also consider the
water cycle as a whole and make recommendations in this connection. Projected quantitative and
qualitative changes in beneficial uses, and anticipated sanitation and public health benefits should
also be assessed.

11.   Task 5: Analysis of alternatives to the proposed project
Describe alternatives that were examined in the course of developing the proposed project and
identify other alternatives, which would achieve the same objectives. The concept of alternatives
extends to siting, design, technology selection, construction techniques and phasing. and
operating and maintenance procedures. Compare alternatives in terms of potential environmental
impacts; capital and operating costs; suitability under local conditions; and institutional, training,
and monitoring requirements. When describing the impacts, indicate which are irreversible or
unavoidable and which can be mitigated. To the extent possible, quantify the costs and benefits of
each alternative, incorporating the estimated costs of any associated mitigating measures. Include
the altemative of not implementing the project, in order to demonstrate environmental conditions
without it.
12.   Task 6: Identification of institutional needs to implement environmental assessment
recommendations
This duty component is subject to a justified need of more monitoring plans and institutional
building than those which will be implemented as part of the proposed Project.
Review the authority and capability of institutions at local, provincialregional, and national
levels and recommend steps to strengthen or expand them so that the (management and)
monitoring plans in the EA can be implemented. The recommendations may extend to new laws
and regulations, new agencies or agency functions, inter-sectoral arrangements, management
procedures and training, staffing, operation and maintenance training, budgeting and financial
support.
13.   Task 7: Development of an Environmental Monitoring Plan
A comprehensive environmental management plan will only be executed if the EA has identified
significant harmful impacts of the proposed Project. If not, the plan shall be limited to description
of mitigating measures, and an outline of monitoring procedures and responsibilities.
The consultants shall prepare a plan for monitoring of the implementation of mitigating measures
and monitoring of the impacts of the project during construction and operation. The monitoring
efforts should not only cover biophysical elements, but also inhabitants and their sanitary
conditions.
The EA Study Report shall recommend feasible and cost-effective measures to prevent or reduce
significant negative impacts to acceptable levels. Estimate the impacts and costs of these
measures, and of the institutional and training requirements to implement them.
Consider compensation to affected parties for impacts, which cannot be mitigated. Prepare a plan
including budget estimates, schedules, staffing and training requirements, and other necessary
support services to implement the mitigating measures. The plan shall include an outline of
institutional responsibilities for implementation of the plan.

Conclusions of the EA Study:
*  The main focus of the Project is rehabilitation and new management of water supply,
sanitation and solid waste services.
*  Environmental aspects of the Project are by default directly linked to the investment plan
and operation and maintenance of the installations.
*  With sufficient investment in rehabilitation and some new installations, and proper
management, operation and maintenance procedures being followed by well trained staff,
the Project would impose only minor environmental impacts.
*  Consequently the focus of the EA Study is on the investment and training required to
bring the management, operations and maintenance up on an appropriate level to meet the
environmental and other requirements set down by the Authorities of Zambia and the
WB's Operational Policies and Directives.
Assessment of Water Supply and Sanitation Services
A thorough investigation and analysis was done on the present installations and operations of
water supply and sewage, as well as of the proposed rehabilitation program.

Recommendations Common to All Divisions
Recommendations are incorporated in the Environmental Management Plan and are identified
with a letter and a number. E stands for Environmental Management recommendations and C
for mitigating measures common to all divisions.
E 01   Water and sewage operators should be given skills training, to give them a greater
understanding and awareness of why they carry out certain functions, and why those
functions need to be carried out in the first place.
E 02   Further planning of the Project should include an assessment of the need for
operational and quality assurance laboratory services and an appraisal on how this
need can best be met as an integral part of the Project.
C 01   Operations staff should be separated into those workers dealing with clean and dirty
water, and there should be no cross utilisation of one into the other, without first
ensuring proper hygiene procedures are carried out, and protective clothing issued
and used. Water workers should be given regular medical checks at six-month
intervals to ensure they are not carriers of any water borne diseases.
C 02   Installation of alum recovery plant(s) should be considered.
C 03   With regard to the presence of water hyacinth there need not be such a cause for
concern. The weed may actually assist in cleaning up the sewage. The provisions are:
* That adequate area of aerobic ponds follows on from any ponds covered by water
hyacinth.
* That the water hyacinth has to be harvested in the full growth stage.
C 04   Sufficient funds should be included in the rehabilitation budget for expansion of the
sewage treatment systems where required to in general meet the proposed standards
for coliform and ECZ standards for parameters on a limited samples basis in effluent
discharges. (Does not apply to Nkana).
C 05   A programme should be worked out so that sewerage construction runs in parallel
with water pipe construction in the same areas to minimise environmental factors and
inconvenience to consumers. (Does not apply to Nkana).
C 06   Construction risks should be minimised by proper supervision of construction
activities and full consideration given to appropriate alternative technologies.
Recommendations Specific to Individual Divisions
Nkana - Kitwe
Nk 01 A raw water storage reservoir should be constructed at Kafue River intake.
Nk 02 Flood levels need to be established in relation to any risk of flooding of the pump
stations at the intake.

mine shaft water).
N 02  Backwash water and sludge to be discharged to a tailings leach settling tank across
the road for the WTP.
Mufulira
M 01  The tailings dump adjacent to the Mufulira Stream intakes should be protected on the
slopes facing the stream,, in case it is found that pollutant matter can enter the water
intake.
M 02  The 17th Street pump station should be separated from the sewage pump station.
M 03  The Kankoyo North and South sewage ponds should be replaced with new combined
sewage ponds. The existing Kankoyo ponds are in any case under capacity for 2005
flows.
M 04  The remaining three sewage pond systems all require upgrading to accept 2005
flows.
M 05  All the 9 sewage pumping stations should be rehabilitated.
Konkola - Chililabombwe
K 01  In case a clarifier is installed a tank should be installed to receive all backwash water
and pump this back to the inlet for re-processing.
K 02  The Kamenza reservoir situation should receive special attention to clear away the
old reservoir, and make proper ground investigations on the site of the new one.
K 03  The Golf Course and Konkola sewage ponds have adequate capacity to treat all
sewage flows to 2005, provided maturation ponds are added. Kamenza ponds should
be closed.
Lunashya
L 01   The Roan sewage ponds have adequate capacity to treat all sewage flows to 2005,
provided maturation ponds are added.
L 02   Mpatamatu sewage ponds need urgent reconstruction to accommodate the 2005
flows.
L 03   Rehabilitation of three sewage pump stations is urgently required and should be
included in the Project investment budget.
The additional investments recommended under individual divisions amount to
approximately 2.5 mill US $

Assessment of Solid Waste Services
The study considered waste production and contents, waste collection and transport and
finally waste disposal practices were considered:
The following practices were observed:
* Quarries from roads construction were used as dumpsites - RAMC (Z), Konkola,
Nchanga) or tailings dams - Mufulira - 3 sites, Nkana - I site
* Disposal method: dumping at the sites, scavengers go through the refuse and collect metal
and other items, most of the rest is then burned by the scavengers
* Occasional bulldozing and compression - left over refuse moved to the sides of the
dumpsite with the bulldozer (except for RAMC (Z) and Nkana)
* No visible guard or caretaker at sites, no monitoring of number and loads of trucks
* Refuse dumped in bush, not designated quarry - RAMC (Z)
* Little vegetative effects from dumping on tailings dams, as intended (probably due to the
burning of the refuse)
* No settlements in nearby areas (except for Nkana)
* Long distance (I km or more) to nearest stream/river from dumpsites (except for Nkana)
* Dumping sites licensed by ECZ as improved dumps - non compliance with license
regulations
* 6 monthly reports by ZCCM, but not scrutinised and monitoring by ECZ
* Erratic collection and dumping - lack of monitoring of the contractors' operations by the
Divisions' Public Health Departments and late payment of the contractors
Waste Management is licensed by the ECZ
*  Transport of wastes and operation of disposal sites is licensed under the Statutory
Instrument No 71/93
- It was observed that the following conditions of the licenses were not complied with:
-  Protective clothing etc.
-  Scattering of waste along transport routes
-  Annual medical checks up of personnel?
-  No monitoring of amount of waste at disposal site
-  No disposal sites enclosed and secure from scavenging
-  No signboards at disposal sites (except for one)
-  Compacting and soil coverage not adequate
-  No arrangement for ventilation
-  No monitoring of leachate into groundwater
-  No prevention of scattering of papers etc. at the sites
-  No program to detect illegal disposal of hazardous wastes
- Open air burning at all sites
The EA Study also considered the socio-economic dimensions related to Solid Waste
Management, among other issues:
* Solid waste tariffs - relation to Council rates
* The scavenger problem

The Solid Waste Management of Nkana Division - Kitwe represents a particular problem,
observing tle following:
Refuse is dumped at Uchi dumpsite in an abandoned tailings dam (no 26). 1 km from the
main road entering Kitwe from the south. The City Council and several other companies are
also dumping refuse at the site, which stretches along the access road and over a wide area
near the eroded part of the tailings dam.
* Hazardous waste disposed at the site without monitoring
* Potential leakage into the stream trough the tailings dam (tributary to Kafue River)
* Potential contamination of ground water
* Potential biogas generation at site
* No compacting and covering with soil observed
* Potential health risks for workers and scavengers (and children playing in the area) from
refuse dumped along the I km from the main road to the dump site, and refuse dumped
over a large area
* Smoke from burning refuse (lit by the scavengers) may drift over to housing areas.
SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO SOLID WASTE
SW 01        Carry out a study on the scavenger problem (covered under Solid Waste
Master Plan for Copperbelt)
SW 02        Amend specifications in the contracts for collection and transport to
accommodate requirements of the ECZ licenses (if required).
SW 03        Establish bore holes or wells in the vicinity of the dumpsites for Nkana,
Nchanga, Konkola and Luanshya RAMC (Z) (Luanshya) in accordance with
a plan to be developed in collaboration with ECZ.
SW 04        In collaboration with ECZ, develop a regular monitoring program with
parameters, sample procedures, schedules and test regime for ground water
samples (and surface water downstream of the Uchi dumpsite).
SW 05        Proper management and monitoring procedures for the Uchi dumpsite should
be worked out and implemented as a matter of urgency.
SW 06        For Mufulira division, disposal of waste should be concentrated to only one
of the three tailings dams for the duration of the 5 years Project period.
SW 07        Access to be opened to the chosen quarry (licensed) at Luanshya and the
dumping in the bush should be stopped immediately.
The E4 Report Recommends that a Component for Solid Waste Management is included
under the MTSP as part of the Solid Waste Master Planning study:
Firstly to carry out a survey:
* to establish a more correct picture of the contents and amount of waste being produced by
the mine townships
* to assess the need for monitoring bore holes/wells for dumpsites

*  to work out procedures for management, operation and monitoring
The proposed component includes a number of activities, which are considered necessary to
enable the AHC (and the PO) to meet the license conditions of ECZ.
An Investment Budget is offered in the EA Report.
The EA Study also recommends that a feasibility study should be carried out on the future
solid waste management arrangements on the Copperbelt, as part of the new Urban
Development Project, incorporating both Council and Mine Township operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)
EMP Institutional Responsibilities
There are three distinctive aspects or roles of institutional responsibilities with regard to the
EMP:

the low lift pumps, their inclusion seems questionable, particularly as the
high lift pumps also need some attention.  However, if the future of
Concentrator WTP, and Kalalushi WTP are also called into question, then

This works was seen at the request of AHC as the mine only has 3 or 4 years productive life left. Options available for water supply after then would be:
1. To continue using the shaft, as a borehole. from water after it reaches its rest level, probably less than 100 m down.
2. To commission an adjacent extant borehole.
3. To use water from the new surface open pit mine, about 10 to 12 km away.
4. To investigate using the Wambashi stream, augmented by any of the above.
5. To combine with a replacement WTP for Concentrator WTP.
6. To reinstate the formner Kitwe - Kalalushi pipeline.
The costs to include for Kalalushi are included in the figure of US$ 1.0 million quoted elsewhere for the Concentrator WTP options. A study obviously needs
to be commissioned as a matter of urgency to examine these various options.

The rehabilitation budget provides ZK 77 million (=US$ 32,000) for work on
4 of these pump stations. In view of the condition of the stations seen, and
their lack of a stand-by pump in most cases, this is a serious under estimate.
A more likely figure would be US$ 300,000 for all nine pump stations.

APPENDIx F
OVERVIEW OF SEWAGE POND DESIGN - AS AFFECTING EFFLUENT QUALITY
1.    Introduction
This overview sets down some of the principles of sewage pond design as they affect the quality
of the effluents flowing from ponds in the Copperbelt Mine Townships. In general, it seems that
design has been carried out more with a view to accommodating a pond of a certain size, than
with a view to the treatment capability of that pond.
Sewage treatment ponds may be simple to construct and operate, but the reactions that occur have
only properly been understood within the last 30 years or so, more or less the time period within
which the Mine Township ponds have been constructed. On a historical footnote, some of the
early research on the dynamic performance of ponds was carried out in Zambia. The principles
that have been established are:
* Sewage ponds have an inherent capability to produce effluents of a satisfactory standard.
* Sewage ponds are capable of absorbing "shock" loadings.
-  The performance of sewage ponds in terms of biological pollutant reduction is temperature
dependent.
e  The perfornance of sewage ponds in terms of coliform and bacteria reduction is solar
radiation dependent.
Sewage treatment ponds have been and continue to be 'used for a variety of community sizes
throughout Africa, and the rest of the world. In Kenya, the city of Nairobi treats its sewage by
ponds with a surface area of several hundred hectares. The ponds under consideration in this
study are not of such size, but could be capable of producing high quality effluents with some
modifications and improvements.
2.    Breakdown of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BODs)
Little data has been made available on the strength of raw sewage. Obviously, as a pre-requisite
for designing a treatment facility, the quality of the raw product needs to be known. In terms of
BOD various approaches could be made, including:
* Adopting an aerial loading factor. Normally, the figure used is 60 gm BOD per head per day.
It is a convenient approximation, particularly, as in this case, there are no industrial effluents
to be considered.
* Adopting a strength loading figure. Research carried out in Nairobi some years ago
demonstrated that strengths varied from income group to income group. The results gave
strengths as

-     High income         320 mg/I
-     Medium income       400 mg/I
-     Low income          720 mg/I.
These figures may seem somewhat surprising at first glance, but they also relate to the water
returned as sewage. Taking both sets of figures together, they would give sewage contributions
per day as:
High income         187.5  litres per head
Medium income       150.0  litres per head
Low income           83.3  litres per head.
These sewage return figures conform to those quoted in standard texts, and demonstrate, inter
alia, the point made in Appendix E, that sewage flows presently quoted are too high.
Taking as the datum point a strength of 60 gm/hd/day, that can be equated to the area of
facultative pond required. Using a loading rate of 130 kg/hectare/day, the area of pond required
per 1000 head of population would be 4,615 m2.
Facultative ponds work on the principle that the sludge which drops out is digestedanaerobically,
and the products of the anaerobic process together with surface oxygen absorption break down
the BOD. Thus, to ensure an anaerobic condition at the bottom of the pond a water depth of 1.8
metres is commonly used. This would give a pond capacity of 8,300 m3 per 1000 population.
Even for a high income group, with the highest rate of sewage return, this would give a retention
period of about 44 days, and that would be regarded as being satisfactory.
Because the processes which operate in sewage ponds are kinetic, this primary or facultative
stage may be broken down into multi-sequential stages. The usual is two, but in the instance of
the ponds seen in the Copperbelt, three ponds have usually been constructed. These should all be
regarded as being facultative because of the depths of water retained; that point will be explained
later.
3.    Bacteriological Reduction of Pathogenic Organisms
Sewage, by its nature contains pathogenic organisms, which have the potential to cause health
hazards to man and animals who may come into contact with such contaminated water. Contact
may be made through drinking the water, and also by eating certain plants that take up not only
the water, but also the contaminants contained in it.
It is well known that sunlight and oxygen are good disinfectants for the removal of such
pathogenic organisms, and exposure to both will ensure a high degree of removal. In sewage
treatment ponds this is usually carried out in maturation ponds. Facultative, or indeed anaerobic
ponds will assist, but by their nature where the dissolved oxygen levels are low, the degree of
treatment will be small in comparison to maturation ponds. To achieve the purification required,
the ponds should not exceed 1.2 m in depth to permit maximum sunlight penetration.Algea will
also grow, and are one of the indicators of proper operation, that oxygen generation within the
body of the water is taking place.

Pathogen removal again follows kinetic first order principles, and several ponds will give better
reduction in pathogen counts than one big pond. Thus, typically, maturation ponds tend to have a
hydraulic capacity of approximately 4.5 to 6.0 days retention, and there are usually at least three
in series, four being normal.
With the correct design, pathogen removal rates in excess of 99.975 % can and should be
achieved.
4.    Practical Points Related to Pond Design
4.1    Short circuiting
Short circuiting is the process whereby flow entering a pond establishes a flow path directly to the
outlet. Thus, the sewage is retained for insufficient time for the biological processes to have
effect.
The best way to prevent this happening is to force the water into a circuitous flow path, either by
constructing intermediate embankments, which prevent a direct path between inlet and outlet, or
by constructing a baffle wall immediately opposite the inlet, which will cause the water flow to
deflect either side into the main body of the pond water.
4.2    Scum prevention
Scum is one of the things to avoid with ponds, as it prevents oxygen from the atmosphere
reaching the surface of the water. Fortunately, it only usually affects the primary pond, and can be
controlled fairly easily.
It is recommended that one way of controlling sum is to construct a control area around the inlet
to the primary pond. This should be about 10 - 15 % of the pond area, and should comprise a
walkway, wide enough for an operator and a wheel barrow, and scum baffles which penetrate at
least 30 cm below the surface. The scum will be wind blown against the baffle boards, and the
operator can lift the debris with a rake or fork or other suitable implement into his barrow and
remove it for burial as the safest means of disposal.
4.3    Weed and bush growth
Weeds and bushes should not be allowed to grow, either within the body of the water or along the
embankment of the ponds Within the body of the water they will cause surface area to be lost,
and prevent efficient mixing of the flow through the ponds. Along the embankments, the roots
will cause a hazard to the stability of the embankment, with the eventual danger that the banks
could collapse. (Clearing of water hyacinths is explained in the Report proper).

APPENDIX G
TECHNICAL ISSUES OF THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE SYSTEMS
1.    Issues common to water supply and sanitation
Lack of any operating meters. This has caused concern regarding the quality of data. In many
instances, it has been found that quantity data for both water and sanitation has not been supplied from
metered readings. For water, this has often been based on the rated capacity outputs of pumps. and for
sewage, on a timed flQat passing down a channel. These do not, and cannot give scientifically reliable
data upon which to base a major capital programme. The reasons for this are discussed briefly in the
field reports (Appendix E).
It is therefore recommended that meters should be regarded as being essential, and should be installe'd
and monitored as soon as possible. This bears not only upon the capacity of treatment plants, but also
upon unaccountedfor water (UfW).
Lack of accurate up-dated drawings. This makes system analysis impossible, or even the simple
tasks of locating sources of leaks, or sewage blockages. Drawings were examined at all divisions for
adequacy of hand over to an independent operator. In general, it was found that plan layouts of water
and sewerage reticulation was kept in the Surveyors Department, but after making enquiry in the
Engineering Sections, it was also found that engineering drawings of, for instance, water intake plant,
water treatment plant, longitudinal section drawings of sewers or water mains were not there. This
places any future independent operator at a grave disadvantage.
It is therefore recommended as follows:
1:    That all existing drawings are found, whether in Survey or Engineering Departments, that
they be catalogued, filed and then kept separate from all mine operations drawings.
2.    Immediately after Task I is completed, that consultants be appointed to make surveys of
facilities for which no drawings exist, and to verify, as far as possible, the accuracy of the
extant drawings.
3.     That all drawings be then scanned and digital images created, or created new in digital
format, which can then be usedfor analysis, or CADD drafting.
Replacement of plants. The mechanical and electrical plant has generally outlived its reasonable
economic age. In the water industry, mechanical and electrical plant generally is reckoned to have an
economic life of 10 to 15 years, depending upon its duty. On this basis, virtually all of the plants seen
for both water and sanitation have long passed their economic life. This includes pumps, motors,
screens, control panels, valves and penstocks. In many instances, this is evidenced by the leaks
observed associated with such plant. Not only is this wasteful, but is also dangerous for safety to the
operators, and potentially dangerous to the consumer through contamination or loss of service.
It is therefore recommended that within the future financial limits:
1.    A rolling program is prepared division by division, for replacement work to be prioritised, and
to be done in phases.
2.     That in the instances where plants are subject to design reviews, such as required pump
outputs, they be deferred until the completion of such review.
3.     That new plants should be purchased on the basis of simplicity of operation and robustness of
construction.
4.     That electric motors should be industry standard machines, and at least one of each power
rating should be kept as a spare by each division.

Repair and maintenance. Maintenance tasks which would otherwise have been previously carried
out in ZCCM workshops will now have to be carried out on a commercial basis. It is very evident in
every division visited that ZCCM workshops have kept the water and sewage plant going, sometimes
with "make-do-and-mend" repairs, but at least it was good enough to ensure speedy return to service.
That facility was given, effectively, free of charge as part of the general plant overheads, and the
quality of the work was usually very good.
Two categories of repairs need to be considered. Firstly, and this is the preferred management option,
is to take plant out of service at regular time periods for routine servicing. This system of management
reduces the incidence of breakdowns, and the interference to service can be planned for to minimise
inconvenience to the customer. Secondly, inevitably there will still be breakdowns, and these will
require urgent attention to reduce the inconvenience element and risk to the environment. A properly
equipped workshop facility is therefore absolutely necessary to both hold spare parts and make'the
necessary repairs.
It is therefore recommended that one of three options be adopted, or a combination thereof:
1.     That a commercial arrangement be made with each mine to continue repairs as before.
2.     That a central workshop be established to service all divisions
3.     That repairs be sent out to the private sector.
Properly conducted site investigations should be done at the site of any major works before
commencing work. It is a matter of some concern that evidence exists of possible insufficient ground
investigations before certain works were carried out. The two specific instances are the Kamenza
reservoir at Cililabombwe, Konkola, and the Butondo Big Bond sewage treatment ponds at Mufulira.
In the first case, it appears a catastrophic tilting and over stressing of the structure occurred after the
reservoir over spilled and the ground collapsed. In the second, it seems that seepage through the
bottom of the ponds is occurring.
Both, and other like, instances could have been preventable with a proper appreciation of the ground
conditions, and the proper preventative measures taken. The geology of the Copperbelt in the region
of the five divisions under study generally comprises granites, schists and gneiss. The granites of
Southern Africa are particularly notorious as being structurally unreliable. They can have a carapace
structure, with soft weathered material under, which seems to have been the case at Kamenza reservoir
where it is sited on the top of a kopje. They can be subject to massive block fracturing, which permits
the passage of water easily. Schists and gneiss also are subject to considerable fracturing and
weathering, and this possibly accounts for the seepage at Butondo Big Ponds.
It is therefore recommended that before any new capital works are started on any structure, there
should be a full and properly conducted site investigation. This should include the new incomplete
reservoir at Kamenza before construction resumes.
Security is a matter for major concern, with virtually every division reporting thefts of cables, pump
motors, or other similar vital operating equipment. The incidence of thefts and vandalism were
numerous amongst the divisions visited. Because of the risk to life associated with some of the thefts,
suspicion must inevitably fall upon those who work daily in such conditions. However, the only way
to deal with the problem of theft is prevention and detection. Even then, it must be accepted that this
will not be foolproof, but if the incidence of theft can be reduced by say 75%, that much cost saving is
achieved towards other projects, that much less inconvenience is suffered by the customer, and there is
less environmental risk.

It is therefore recommended that a securitv consultant be en,gaged to advise each division on the nmost
appropriate measures, which could be applied Then, those measures should be applied.
2.    Issues related specifically to water supply
Corrosivity of the source waters is a matter for concern in terms of the life expectancy of the fixed
assets such as pipework, structures, etc. It is very evident from the condition of much of the plants that
corrosivity is prevalent in the water sources. This would be expected to be so in water pumped out of
the mines, when carbon dioxide content can be very high. However, the chemistry of corrosivity is
quite complex and, as shown in the Plant Status Field Reports for Mufulira, there is insufficient data at
present to support any firm conclusions as the causes of relative severity of the corrosivity.
It is therefore recommended that a specialist corrosion expert be engaged to carry out a sampling
program, and make recommendations appropriate to the situation as discovered
Transmission and distribution replacement pipelines have been included in the rehabilitation
budget, representing 42.5% of the total. The divisions were unable to provide breakdowns of how this
money was to be spent, and why. In some instances, as in the case of Luanshya, the obvious presence
of a burst indicated a pipeline in distress. At Nkana, some of the pipelines at 1 7th Avenue pump
station showed weeping through of water. A priority list of replacements will have to be made.
Likewise, in terms of construction techniques and materials, there are certain points to be made from
the environmental aspect.
Steel was used for much of the pipeline construction, obviously because it was a convenient material
for the mines to obtain and use. However, without protective linings, and with corrosive waters, many
of the pipelines will need attention. Likewise, some water may be lost through an unknown cross
connection being left open. The only way the true position can be absolutely ascertained will be
through metering supplies, and leak detection measures. Bulk metering will indicate zones taking
more than their share of water, and night flow meters will home in on the actual areas where leakage is
worst. The only way to tackle such a task is by a methodical zone by zone approach. Nothing should
therefore be undertaken until metering has been installed and monitored to establish the true position
in each zone in each division.
On the matter of environmental concern, the construction of any pipeline always causes disturbance in
the area where it is carried out. There are dangers from open trenches, especially if they collect
rainwater, which can then become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Likewise, the spoil from trench
excavations can cause a nuisance, especially across agricultural or horticultural land. These problems
can be mitigated by adopting other techniques, which can also reduce the overall period of
inconvenienice, especially when considering the transmission pipelines. Also, on the question of open
trenches, this will depend upon the construction supervisor specifying the permitted open lengths of
trench, at any one time, and then strictly applying the specifications, and ensuring that open trenches
are adequately protected and guarded to prevent children especially from gaining access, particularly
during the rainy season, when trenches may be flooded.
Consideration should be given to using alternative construction techniques, which would not
necessarily require long lengths of open trench. This would include bored pipelines, polythene linings,
in situ spun concrete linings, or any similar form of construction, which does not replace the existing
pipeline, but uses it for a former to support the new construction. Likewise, where pipelines have to
be replaced or strengthened by additional pipeline, consideration should be given to using materials
other than steel, both for durability and speed of construction.

It is therefore recommended that pipeline construction be deferred until data is available fronm the
metering program. Likewise, construction ofpipelines should be carefullv reviewed to ensure the most
appropriate solution is used
The question of unaccounted for water needs to be addressed. Several of the previous reports noted
the wastage of water, which takes place through broken plumbing fittings, illegal connections, etc.
Time did not permit more than a cursory examination of the problem during this EA study, but it
undoubtedly exists. Several solutions are presented for consideration, and are recommended for
action.
* The water operator could offer a washer or other minor plumbing fitting replacement service at
cost. Procedures for reduction of waste on private property have been produced by the Nine
Towns Project (URWSP), and these should be consulted.
* The water operator should institute an inspection service to houses. This should be made
mandatory in the case of new house construction, or house alterations, and advisory in the case of
existing houses. Such a duty could be delegated to licensed plumbers. The purpose of such an
inspection would be to determine that plumbing has been carried out properly, that there is no risk
of back feeding into the mains, and that the system is free of leaks.
* Private plumbers should be licensed by the water operator. Firstly, this will create an elite, who
can carry the title of licensed plumber. Secondly, it will create a register of licensed plumbers,
which can be made available to the public. Thirdly, only licensed plumbers should be allowed to
work on plumbing installations on new or modified house construction. Fourthly, any licensed
plumber found making an unauthorised or illegal connection should be immediately removedfrom
the register, and be open to prosecution for any future illegal like acts.
* The legal provisions for punishment for anyone to tamper with water mains, fittings, or other
appurtenances, which are the property of the water operator, or to take water from the same
without the authority of the water operator, should be enforced
Reservoir capacity is genemily insufficient. Reservoirs have three functions to fulfil. Firstly, they
provide a secure source of potable treated water in the event of breakdown of any supply facility.
Secondly, they provide a balancing function in the distribution system. Thirdly, they also provide a
resource readily available for fire fighting purposes.
Water can obviously be pumped from the WTP to meet the peak demands of supply, but to do so is
uneconomic in terms of pump capacity and pipeline sizes, which would be required. The diurnal
variations between peak and average demands vary depending upon the size and nature of the
community being served. Based upon data available from the UK, and bearing in mind that the
communities being served have very little or no industry, the expected peak factors to be applied for
the five divisions would be 2.05 (Mufulira and Luanshya), 2.1 (Nkana), 2.2 (Nchanga) and 2.25
(Konkola).
This shows that pumps and pipelines to meet that demand would need to be rated for twice the daily
average flow. However, that peak only extends over quite a short period of the day, probably for less
than six out of the twenty four hours. Thus, a balancing calculation should be carried out to determine
the size of reservoirs required to offset the peaks, against the average daily volume of water, which
needs to be pumped.
However, the greater volume requirement for storage is the security against disruption of supplies, e.g.
contingency storage. Taking all the factors together, to meet the contingencies of variations of

demand, trunk main bursts, or source works plant breakdowns, or electricity disruptions, the normal
storage necessary is 24 hours capacity. An assessment of required storage capacities for the five
divisions is available.
It should also be noted that there is no provision for dealing with pollution slugs at any of the river
intakes. With traffic volumes increasing, and mine activities in the same watershed, there is always a
risk of pollution occurring. One oil tanker overtuming and discharging its load constitutes a major
pollution problem. One slimes dam partially collapsing will create a pollution problem.
It is therefore recommended
1.    That additional distribution reservoir capacity should be included in the rehabilitation budget.
At the present, it is believed that insufficient funds have been made available.
2.     That a raw water storage reservoir be constructed at Nchanga (Chingola), Nkana, and
Luanshya, with 12 hours capacity against the eventuality of pollution coming down the river.
3.    Issues related specifically to sewage and sewerage
Fish farming. Sewage ponds are capable of supporting an aqua culture valuable to the community. In
many parts of the world, aqua culture is practised using sewage treatment ponds as the medium for
growth. This particularly relates to fish fanning, and Tilapia (Sarotherodon mossambica) especially
are a good species for this practise; they are algae grazers, and make good eating, after cleaning and
cooking. This practise also creates an industry, which has an interest in maintaining the environment
in which it works.
It is therefore recommended that consideration be given to privatising sewage pond maintenance to
fish farmers upon a quid pro quo basis.
The use of effluent for irrigation purposes should be encouraged. Provided that the effluents meet
the ECZ standards, and especially for faecal colifor:s, the effluent water can be used for irrigation
purposes. Vegetables, and other produce should be cooked before being eaten as a precaution. Thus,
if fish farming is carried out in the ponds and the effluents used for irrigation, the community as whole
benefits twice over from sewage discharges.
4.    Summary of common recommendations
1.    Meters should be regarded as being essential, and should be installed and monitored as soon
as possible. This bears not only upon the capacity of treatment plants, but also upon UfW.
2.    Alternative construction techniques should be considered, especially for transmission
pipelines, to minimise environmental disturbance and inconvenience to consumers.
3.    Regarding drawings it is recommended as follows:
* That all existing drawings are found, whether in Survey or Engineering Departments, that
they be catalogued, filed and then kept separate from all mine operations drawings.
*  Immediately after the task above is completed, that consultants be appointed to make
surveys of facilities for which no drawings exist, and to verify, as far as possible, the
accuracy of the extant drawings.
*  That all drawings be then scanned and digital images created, or created new in digital
format, which can them be usedfor analysis, or CADD drafting.

Likewise, construction of pipelines should be carefully reviewed to ensure the most
appropriate solution is used.
5.    NWASCO should set up a working party to carry out a joint review of all standards, licenses,
and enforcement procedures for both water supply and sewage.
6.    Regarding replacements it is recommended that within the future financial limits:
*  A rolling program is prepared division by division, for replacement work to be prior:itised,
and to be done in phases.
*  That in the instances where plants are subject to design reviews, such as required pump

*  That new plants should be purchased on the basis of simplicity of operation and
robustness of construction.
*  That electric motors should be industry standard machines, and at least one of each power
rating should be kept as a spare by each division.
7.    With regard to workshops services it is therefore recommended that one of three options below
is adopted, or a combination thereof:
* That a commercial arrangement be made with each mine to continue repairs as before, or
that a central workshop be established to service all divisions, or that repairs be sent out

should await installation and monitoring of meters, especially for leak detection, to establish
prioritisation.

5.    Nkana Division, Kitwe
Supply and demand projections. The situation at Nkana is somewhat obscured by ZCCM supplying
water to Kitwe City Council. However, based on the fact that actual measurements were made in
1997, and that this data was given to Mattson (Mattson 1998), the position may be summarised as
follows, with a 4% pa growth allowance to 2005: Total calculated demand 20,700 m3/d, actual water
production 65,000 m3 and projected demand 2005 25,200 m3/d.
Mattson estimated the present water demand at 16,000 m3/day, and the present estimate shown above
was derived on a similar basis of unit demands used elsewhere. It is suspected that the major
divergence may arise from use of more recent figures for house counts, which gave a separation, by
income groups including medium cost.  These have been assumed to use water at a demand
somewhere between high and low income housing. Based on Mattson's figures for water production,
32,000 m3/day is transferred to Kitwe city and the Mines. This leaves a balance of 33,000 m3/day
available to mine townships, which leaves a balance of 12,300 m3/day unaccounted for. This is 37%
of the daily water transferred to mine townships, and would be typical of the losses that would be due
to leakage from a system of this age.
On the basis that water leaks will be reduced by 40% by replacement of pipework systems within the
five year horizon to 2005, it means that during this period there is no need for expansion to meet the
2005 demand for mine townships alone.
Recommendations based on technical assessments:
* Concentrator WTP should be closed
-  Design alternatives will have to be considered and analysedfor replacement of Concentrator and
Kalalushi WTP. Nkana East Intake has capacity to accommodate increased water abstraction, to
include for the above.
* Nkana East WTP can be expanded without problems, but the immediate need is for additional
clarifier capacity.
*  17h Avenue pump station and reservoirs should be rehabilitated.
* Additional reservoir capacity is required in the distribution zones.
6.    Nchanga Division, Chingola
Supply and demand projections: Nchanga is one of the divisions, which do not have any operating
meters. Water production is estimated from rated pump outputs. On that basis, water production was
estimated to be 57,000 m3/day. Likewise, sewage was estimated by the float technique, and estimated
at 48,000 m3/day. Both have been criticised before for their lack of precision.
Using the same estimating procedures as before the mine townships water demand will be 17,470
m3/day. Mattson states that 10,000 m3/day is supplied to the mine. Added to this estimate, and adding
on 5% for backwash water, gives a total water production requirement of 29,000 m3/day. There is thus
a gap of 28,000 m3/day unaccounted for between ZCCM estimate and this estimate, or 96% of
required water production. That suggests either an over estimate of water production by ZCCM, or
losses, which are unacceptably high. Based on 4% per annum growth rate, the 2005 water demand
will be 21,250 m3/day. Adding on the ZCCM 10,000 m3/day, and allowing 5% for backwash, gives a
total requirement for production of 33,000 m3/day.
The sewage collection was estimated by the same procedure, using data used elsewhere, and that gave
an estimated sewage flow of 9,000 m3/day. Allowing the same 4% growth rate, gives a 2005 sewage
flow of 10,950 m3/day.

Recommendations based on technical assessments:
*  Nchanga North STP should be replaced with a new sewage pond installation. to avoid the mining
operation.
* Lulamba STP "Bio-Reactor" should be replaced with sewage ponds to reduce energy costs.
* Collector ponds should be provided at the sewage pump stations
* Nchanga Water Intake requires rehabilitating.
* The WTP has adequate capacity to meet demand to 2005, but the addition of a clarifier would
ensure satisfactory performance from the quality aspect.
* The booster pumps need rehabilitating.
* Additional distribution reservoir capacity is needed.
7.    Mufulira Division, Mufulira
Supply and demand projections: Mufulira has no operating flow meters, and flows are estimated
from rated pump outputs. Estimated water output is 42,000 m /day. For sewage flows, a measurement
was made by timing a float down a channel of known cross section, and water depth. Both methods
are obviously prone to error, as outlined elsewhere. Recourse has therefore been made to calculations
based on typical water consumption from elsewhere.
Mufulira mine townships have an estimated water demand of 30,200 m3/day. Mattson states that
3,000 m3/day is taken by the mine. Allowing 5% water taken for backwash, this would give about
34,700 m3/day, or 82% of Mufulira's estimated output, based on pump ratings. It is probably safe to
say that the actual output is around 36,000 m3/day, which allows for 1,200 m3/day, plus an allowance
built into the calculations of another 17,000 m3/day unaccounted for. Mufulira estimates about 10,000
m3/day going into backwash, which represents about 35% of water production, as compared to the
norm of 2 - 5%. Either backwash is being conducted wastefully, or the flow estimates are grossly in
error.
Adopting a 4% per annum growth rate, this would give a 2005 water demand of 36,750 m3/day for the
mine townships. Assuming the mine still takes 3,000 m3/day, and making an allowance for backwash,
this would give a total water treatment capacity requirement of around 42,000 m3/day.
Sewage flows are estimated at present at I 5,000 m3/day. Assuming the same 4% growth rate, sewage
flows at 2005 will be about 18,250 m3/day.
Recommendations based on technical assessments:
* Valley dam requires inspection from a registered panel dam engineer, and specialist grouting
expert.
*  Should raising the spillway prove to be a feasible technical option, the next step would be to
proceed to an environmental assessment.
* The raw water pump station should be refurbished and upgraded to 30, 000 m3/day capacity.
*  The WTP should pass all incoming waters through the clarifiers.
*  The clarifiers should be doubled in capacity, and a proportionalflow splitter put in to divide the
flow between the filters.
* Booster pumps should be rehabilitated
*  Additional distribution storage reservoir capacity is required

Mine Township Services Project                                               Appendix G
Supply and demand projections: Konkola is another of the divisions, which do not have any
operating meters, and estimates the water production from rated pump outputs. On that basis, water
production was estimated to be 34,000 m3/day.  Likewise, sewage was estimated by the float
technique, and estimated at 22,470 m3/day. Both have been criticised before for their lack of
precision.
Using the same estimating procedures as before it is estimated that mine townships water demand is
15,000 m3/day, including Konkola Township. Mattson states that 6,000 m3/day is supplied to the
mine. Added to this estimate, and adding on 5% for backwash water, gives a total water production
requirement of 22,500 m3/day. There is thus a gap of 11,500 m3/day unaccounted for between ZCCM
estimate and this estimate, or 51 % of required water production. That suggests either an over estimate
of water production by ZCCM, or losses, which are unacceptably high.
Taking a growth rate of 4% per annum, the 2005 water demand will be 18,250 m3/day. Adding on the
mine 6,000 m3/day, and adding on the 5% for backwash gives a total requirement for production of
26,000 m3/day, including Konkola.
Sewage flows have been estimated, by the same techniques as before, at 7,600 m3/day. Sewage flows
likewise have been estimated to grow at 4% per annum, giving a 2005 flow of 9,250 m3/day.
R-ecommendations based on technical assessments:
o Mingomba intake should be closed and Konkola township should be supplied by a new
transmission main from Chingola WTP.
*  The raw water pump station should be rehabilitated to 30,000 m3/day capacity.
- The WTP should pass all incoming waters through a clarifier.
- Booster pumps should be rehabilitated.
 Additional distribution storage reservoir capacity is required.
9.    RAMC (Z), Luanshya
Supply and demand projections: Luanshya had no operating meters, and flows were estimated by
either pump ratings or float measurements. Their estimate of water produced was 38,000 m3/day, and
sewage generated was 15,400 m3/day. It is estimated the mine townships have a water demand of
27,800 m3/day. 1,000 m3/day is supplied to the municipality, and 1,000 m3/day to the mine (Mattson
1998). Allowing 5% for backwash water. this gives a daily production requirement of 31,300 m3/day.
There is therefore a discrepancy of 6,700 m3/day unaccounted for water between ZCCM's estimate of
what they produce, and this estimate based on typical consumption figures. However, the figure for
unaccounted for water needs to be modified as the actual consumption is probably much lower than
estimated demand due to the erratic supply.
Taking the 4% growth rate as before, this gives a 2005 demand of 33,800 m3/day. Assuming the
municipality has grown at the same rate, that would then be 1,200 m3/day, and adding on the 1,000
m3/day for the mine, and 5% for backwash, gives a daily water requirement of about 37,800 m3/day.
Given that pipeline replacement will proceed during the same period, thereby reducing the
unaccounted for water losses, the present production seems adequate to 2005.
Sewage flows have similarly been calculated, and estimated at 14,750 m3/day. This gives a fairly good
correlation with ZCCM's estimate. Taking the same 4% growth rate, the 2005 sewage flows would be
18,000 m3/day.

Annex 1
Social Impact Assessment
ZAMBIA: MINING Township Services-Urban
I. Background
As part of project preparation, the World Bank and the AHC-MMS undertook both research and
consultations to gather more complete information on the socioeconomic background and service
priorities of water consumers in mine townships. Three principle activities took place with
report to a social assessment.
First, a process of obtaining feedback from consumers on project design was initiated, and
continued throughout project preparation. The discussion groups included a cross section of the
different types of consumers (miners, retrenched miners and non-miners) with separate groups for
low, medium and high cost housing residents and for women and men (150-200 participants
total). Union official (MUZ) participated in several of the discussion groups meetings. Second, a
rapid social survey covering roughly 430 households in Luanshya, Nkana and Chililabombwe
mining townships was carried out in conjunction with students and professors from the
Copperbelt University. The proportional sample was stratified according to income groupings
and covered areas with relatively good water service (Chililabombwe), as well as those with poor
water service (Luanshya, Nkana). Third, socio-economic information was gathered and meetings
were held with each of the mines' personnel and community services departments. Field work for
these activities took place over 2.5 weeks in the Copperbelt in May and November, 1999 and was
organized and supervised by both the AHC and the World Bank.
While the quantitative survey sought to attain basic information on water and sanitation use,
satisfaction with current services, income sources, vulnerability and to a very limited degree,
expenditures and income, the focus group discussions concentrated on perception of current
service, priorities for service improvements, assessing what tradeoffs different groups of
consumers were willing to make between maintaining/ improving service levels and keeping
costs within affordable limits (fewer hours with lower costs versus more hours with higher costs),
and exploring the most acceptable forms of cost recovery including the likely reaction to different
options for metering.
The issue of how to best introduce a successful system of billing and cost recovery is one which
is important for both mining and Council townships. Moreover, cost recovery policies in adjacent
Council and mining township areas influence each other, and many focus group participants made
comments on the cost recovery systems and service standards in place in adjacent Council areas.
Thus, although the research area was within mine townships, the lessons and suggestions from
consumers in mining areas can also be of use to policymakers for Council areas.
Because of time constraints, the focus of the socio-economic research has been on the mine areas
where the majority of project beneficiaries reside. However, in addition to providing water to
mining townships, ZCCM provides water directly - formally or informally - to close to 6,000
residents of informal settlements which are adjacent to or on top of mine water pipes. These
settlements are largest in Nkana/Kitwe (1,150 residents) and Konkola/Chilabombwe (about 4,600
residents). Since these settlements are likely to grow, the operator would presumably hold
responsibility for establishing proper maintenance and cost-recovery schemes which would
require active community participation as has been pursued in Ndola Council areas with the
assistance of CARE.



II. Profile of the Mine Townships
1.   Occupation
Mine townships historically provided free housing. municipal services, and other benefits
(education, health care) to mine employees as part of their employee package. Although many of
these benefits have been or are being discontinued, the majority of residents are still miners.
Table 1: Composition of Mine Townships
% Miner Occupied   % Ex-Miner      % Non-Miner      Total Housing

In recent years, the mining companies have regularized the housing market, and sold houses to
mine workers at discounted prices. Over time, as these employees leave, either selling or renting
their house, and others have moved in, the mine areas have had an increasing number of non-
miner residents. In the divisions of Luanshya and Mufulira this is especially noticeable. In
addition, mines have traditionally leased housing to non-mine employees working for the
community (teachers, health care workers, police, etc.). This is the case for about 600 teachers
for whom the Ministry of Education leased housing and paid all municipal charges. The Ministry
of Education, like the mines, is in the process of changing the system so that residents pay rent
directly to owners.
An additional factor in the changing nature of mine township are plans for retrenching additional
miners. If all new retrenchees came from mine townships, and stayed in the townships, then only
54% of the residents would be active miners compared to the current 66%. In Luanshya and
Mufulira, the percentage of miners would drop to between 41% and 43% of the total residents if
all planned retrenchments are carried out. In Nchanga and Luanshya planned additional
retrenchments are the equivalent of 12% and 21% of the households.
2.   Residence
According to the quantitative survey, 77% of retrenched miners interviewed said they planned on
staying at their residence while 23% planned to rent their house out and move elsewhere. ZCCM
offered to sell some of its leased housing to miners in areas where there was a shortage of housing
for sale. This has resulted in a dispute over whether the non-miner residents (mostly teachers)
had the right to purchase the houses themselves, or were instead obliged to start paying rent
directly to the new owners. This was the case, for example, in Luanshya which had excess
housing stock; 547 miners from Nchanga, which did not have sufficient housing, were offered an
opportunity to purchase houses from ZCCM which were occupied by teachers and other non-
miners. In spite of this uncertainty, seventy four percent of non-miners said they planned on
staying in their house. On average, township residents have lived in the township for 6.5 years,
with non-miners living there on average for over 4 years, and disabled and retired miners
averaging over 10 years.



3.   Social Context
Because of the large role mines traditionally played in townships in providing for all services, and
responding to community problems, most communities do not have altemative community
organizations to turn to resolve local problems. Church organizations perhaps play the most
prominent role in mine townships, but have not traditionally been involved in organization around
municipal services issues. Some neighborhoods have started forming neighborhood committees,
although these are still in the relatively early stages. In discussion groups, most participants
noted that they were not used to resolving public issues with their neighbors, and the general
tendency was more individualistic.
Literacy rates among miners are relatively high (over 90%), and over 90% of miners are married.
Almost all miners are Zambian, with the overwhelming majority coming from urban areas (often
from mining families). Thus, mining families often have not developed skills in informal trading
or agriculture to the samne degree as non-mining families simply because they have not needed to
since historically the mine provided steady income. In discussion groups, and in the quantitative
survey, most households (77%) had only one income eamer. In the low cost areas wives reported
taking on other petty trading activities to supplement their income.
Overall, between 50% and 60% of miners reported having a bank account (close to 100% in high
cost areas, and between 30 - 67% among non-managerial staff). Among residents in general, the
quantitative survey reveals a similar pattem with 73% of residents with access to a bank account,
but with lower rates (40 - 65%) among low cost housing residents. In discussion groups, low cost
housing residents noted that although they had bank accounts, they did not have any deposits but
maintained the account in order to receive their salaries. About 41% of high cost housing
residents and about 10% of medium cost housing residents have or have had a telephone.
According to the survey, a majority of residents in mine areas own their homes (79%).
Ownership rates decline with income as only 25% of very low cost housing residents owned their
homes compared with 91 % of medium and high cost housing residents. According to ZCCM,
some of the residents in low-cost housing areas are eligible to purchase their houses, but have
been unable to come up with the modest payment ($100 in some cases).
4.   Income
As presented in Table 3, at present, the majority of miners have relatively modest incomes and
earn from $120 to $156 per month in take-home pay (net of taxes and mandatory payments,
including overtime, bonuses for municipal services, but prior to any deductions for purchases at
mine stores or for municipal services). Data on miners incomes focused on ZCCM townships
because updated information was readily available. Similar data was collected from Luanshya in
May, 1999, and the pattern is similar to that in the ZCCM townships. Analysis of income levels
confirms that without supplemental income, the workers on the very bottom of the salary scale
are not far from the poverty line. The average take home salary of those at the lowest-end of the
salary scale, who most likely live in very low cost housing, is 299,297 Kw and thus a 13% drop in
income would place this family at the poverty threshold. This was calculated using data from
preliminary analysis of the 1998 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey; the approximate poverty
line (in terms of expenditures) would equal 260,471 Kw for someone with the household size
typical of someone in very low cost housing, 310,301 Kw for someone with a household size
typical of someone in in low cost housing and so forth. Anecdotal evidence from the focus
group discussions suggested that in the lowest income areas, spouses will often try to supplement
income by selling charcoal, gardening, or raising poultry.

On average non-miners (teachers, public employees, retrenchees, retirees) eam less than miners.
In focus group discussions, and a small sub-sample from the quantitative work, the typical
monthly household income of non-mine workers generally ranged between 100,000 Kw to
270,000 Kw (US$40 - US$108) per month.
Residents of all income levels expressed anxiety about retrenchments and about their future
income. It is difficult to forecast what the longer-term income of retrenched miners will be, but
those involved in focus group discussions were most often involved in marketing (informal
trading), seasonal fish mongering, or carpentry and were eaming less than they had eamed as
miners. Only 5% had found another job with regular income. Others will move to rural areas
and rent out their homes for income. Retrenchees in higher income areas complained that they
could not find people who could afford to rent their large houses.

At present, miners and retrenched miners feel they are facing a financial squeeze because they are
being required to pay for the cost of services which were previously free or subsidized (health
care, education, etc.) and have not had a concurrent increase in salaries. Twenty four percent of
respondents living in low cost housing noted that they had sent relatives to live elsewhere in the
past 12 months because they could no longer afford to care for them. Although some residents
are cutting down on their support to others, miners continue to play a key role in providing
financial support to an extended family; in each household in the mine township an average of
1.22 income earners over 18 supports an average of 10 persons (of which 2.3 live outside the
household).

II.   Consumer Perspective
I .   Current Water Supply, Solid Waste & SewerageServices
Based on feedback from both the quantitative survey and the focus group discussions, residents of
low income mine areas receive a lower level of service than their counterparts in high income
areas. Thus, if the project succeeds in improving water pressure (as should occur if leaks are
repaired in low cost areas), it should bring a substantial benefit to these underserved groups.

A majority of residents ranked water as the most important municipal service to maintain or to
improve, followed by sewage services. High rates of dissatisfaction were expressed with water
quality and pressure. This reflects, however, large differences among divisions; in Luanshya 80%
of respondents were not satisfied with water quality and 48% - 60% were dissatisfied with
pressure. This compares to only 18% having problems with water quality in Chililabombwe. In
focus group discussions with low income residents in Luanshya, women complained that they
were unable to maintain vegetable gardens, an important source of supplementing income, when
there was insufficient water pressure to water their gardens. The lack of pressure also resulted in
a situation where several residents in Luanshya reported that people were breaking into the pipe
where it comes into the neighborhood to try to leapfrog ahead of neighbors to get water before
pressure deteriorates at end of line.

One of the contributing factors to low pressure can be leaks inside households which would not
normally fall into the purview of a water operator. According to respondents, this appears to
pose more of a problem in low cost areas.

In focus group discussions, participants' most frequent complaint about sewage service was of
stopped toilets. For solid waste, some residents reported that service had deteriorated in terms of
the frequency of collection. Forty seven percent of respondents claimed that refuse was not
collected at all and many stated that they either bumed the refuse or buried it in pits in their yard.

2.   Consumer Feedback on Priorities for Service Improvement, Preferred Payment
Methods and Cost Recovery
In focus group discussions, residents expressed a strong desire to improve or maintain service
levels for 24 hours with good pressure. It was more common in Luanshya, where service is
already restricted, that when pressed to pay significantly more, residents noted that they would
settle for at least 12 - 18 hours of water service. Miners were generally more willing to pay an
increment over current costs if the mode of payment continued to be the payroll deduction system
Since the ZCCM mines have been providing a 30% housing bonus which more than covers the
current deduction for municipal charges, miners may associate the payroll system with non-
.payment. and if they were only paying for what they were consuming through some form of
metering. Women were particularly concemed that if their husbands actually had take the cash
they receive from their paycheck and go to a separate office to pay the bill, that the bill would not
be paid but spent on entertainment or alcohol. Indeed, seventy three percent of those interviewed
stated that they had never paid a bill of any type, and the time required to go to a central billing
office and wait in line, would both discourage miners from paying. The issue of leaming to
budget and pay bills will immediately affect all non-miners who do not have the salary deduction
scheme.
The willingness to pay more money for individual meters was mixed, although a majority were
willing to. pay at least 1000 Kw more per month for a metered service. This reflects the presence
of non-miners and retrenched miners - who tended to have much lower incomes than miners. At
higher prices for metered service (5000 Kw + extra just for the meter), some low cost housing
and a portion of medium cost housing residents said they would settle for communal metering
system. Only one low income group of women in Chililabombwe did not want a metered system
because of the fear that someone would use the taps in their yard when they were away.
Although residents expressed a strong demand for individual meters, such a system is expensive
to install and maintain. Altemative options were explored with residents such as community
metering whereby groups of households are metered and within a group the bill is evenly divided
by the number of households. However, in the majority of areas, residents resisted the concept of
being dependent on the actions of their neighbors, or having to pay the financial burden of their
neighbors inability to pay their bills given the growing number of unemployed retrenched
workers. According to participants, altemative social safety nets do not exist, and in only one
discussion group did participants agree that they could contribute a small amount to help a
neighbor in the first month or two of not being able to pay for services. Many participants were
willing to pay a premium just to have a meter. In order to address this issue, the project
incorporated funds for purchasing meters, and requested the private operator to work with
communities to develop innovative metering schemes with communities' participation. However,
it would still be costly to install individual meters in all households and thus if the operator must
continue a scheme of flat payments or grouped metering, individual households which cannot pay
their bill should be offered an option to reduce consumption to the most minimal level (such as a



drip valve). This would serve to protect those households which are unemployed or retrenched
from facing a flat monthly fee reflecting the water usage of their wealthier neighbors or face
being cut off, while also protecting the neighbors from bearing the indirect expense of full water
service for households which could not afford to pay their water bills. Finally, because current
consumption levels are very high, providing consumers with an option to reduce their bill by
reducing consumption will allow people to tailor consumption to their ability to pay for services.
Many participants noted that the change in mindset from receiving a free service to paying for a
metered service would be facilitated by giving advance waming of changes, and involving
communities in the process of change. Thus, the private operator will be requested to develop a
communications campaign for how such changes will be implemented. This campaign should
include regular, organized consultations of consumers and other stakeholders. One of the most
influential stakeholders, the unions, will thus also need to be incorporated early on.
3.   Ability and Willingness to Pay for Services
In order to assess the affordability of changes in tariffs, it is necessary to understand the current
contribution that households are making towards water supply, sewerage and refuse collection
costs. Non-miners, or those no longer receiving a salary or payment from the mines, are currently
paying nothing as they have not received any bills. Initially when the cost recovery was phased
.in for miners, the miners were to pay according to their grade level through a deduction directly
from their salary. Table 12 shows the weighted average amounts which were to be deducted by
grade level. However, because of the mismatch between grades and the types of housing,
different mines implemented the policy in different ways. In Chililabombwe (Konkola mine)
miners pay a set fee according to the type of house they inhabit, regardless of their grade or
salary. In Nchanga, some people pay according to their grade (for example junior staff in high
cost housing) and others pay according to their house (for example, a senior staff who is
underhoused in low-cost housing would pay less for the house). In Mufulira, miners pay
according to their grade, unless they are underhoused. One issue is that those in Luanshya are
currently charged for a level of service according to the township they live in rather than
according to the housing type; thus Roan and Mpatamatu have a mix of housing types yet all
residents pay the sarne flat rate within each township. This penalizes the lower income residents
in this area.
Thus, for those townships where many junior staff are living in high cost houses but not paying
the corresponding higher cost for municipal services, they will experience a sharper jump when
costs rise to reflect the amount of water consumed and the level of service received.
Based on the calculations estimating the cost for providing services, there will need to be
significant increases in the arnount currently withheld for water supply and sanitation for high
cost groups.
