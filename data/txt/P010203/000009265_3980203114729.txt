MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IV
BACKGROUND
1.1     The Mahaweli Ganga Development Program has been the centerpiece of the
Government of Sri Lanka's (GOSL) public investment effort since the current
administration came to power. In late 1977, GOSL decided to accelerate implemen-
tation of the Progra'a to reduce food imports, unemployment, and energy deficien-
cies and to provide settlement opportunities. An exceptional amount of financial
support was generated from international donors for accelerated program develop-
ment. The proposed project would be the fourth in a series of irrigated agricul-
tural projects to be assisted by the Bank Group under the Mahaweli Program: the
first project has been completed; the second is expected to be completed by
mid-1984; and the third, appraised in 1980 and started in 1982, is sti:ll in early
implementation stages. In addition, the Bank has played an active role in advis-
ing on the composition of the Mahaweli Program and in coordinating external assis-
tance for its financing.
1.2     GOSL has attached high priority for System B development for two main
reasons: (a) to utilize water resources from the recently completed Maduru Oya
Reservoir and (b) to serve as irrigated resettlement areas for persons from
upstream reservoir basins where dams are currently being constructed as well as
from overpopulated, economically depressed areas elsewhere in the country. In
early 1983, GOSL formally requested Bank participation in financing development of
either the System B Left or Right Dank downstream projects. CIDA and the Saudi
Fund for Development have indicated their intent to co-finance development of the
Right Bank (RB). Because of USAID's expected expanded role in financing Left Bank
(LB) development with co-financing from Australia, the Saudi Fund for Development,
and the EEC, and the ongoing implementation of that work, the Bank has opted to
participate in RB development and thereby to remove its outstanding financing gap.
1.3     In 1980, a feasibility report for System B was prepared by Acres Interna-
tional, Ltd., with financing and supervision f¢rom GOSL. A revised report for the
RB project, including updated technical and cost data, was prepared by Acres in
1982 with CIDA financing. Detailed designs of the RB main and branch canals were
carried out in late 1981 and 1982 by the Berger/IECO consulting consortium, with
USAID financing, as part of the consortium's LB irrigation system design studies.
These reports formed the basis for appraisal by a joint Bank/CIDA mission which
visited Sri Lanka in June-July 1983. The appraisal mission comprised S. Baker, P.
Tamboli, W. Nickel, S. Lysy (IDA) and J.W. Robins (consultant) and V. Carvell
(CIDA). A detailed land classification survey was carried out by the Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) in support of the appraisal with the assistance of a
soil specialist and a drainage engineer (consultants).
I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
General
1.01    Sri Lanka is endowed with favorable resources and diverse agro-climatic
conditions that permit wide-ranging agricultural pursuits. Sri Lanka comprises an
area of 65,600 sq km with a total population estimated at 15.2 M (1982) growing at
about 1.7% p.a. GDP per capita is about US$320. The population is highly
literate and has achieved considerable success in curbing population growth.



-2-
About 75% of the population lives in rural areas and is directly or indlirectly
dependent on agriculttLre.  The climate is characterized by nearly constant tem-
peratures and large variations in rainfall. The island can be divided into the
distinct wet anld intermediate zones (average annual ra-inifall over 1,900i mm) and
dry zone (average annual rainifall below 1,900 mnm).  The combined wet an' inter-
mediaLe zone occurs in the southwest quadrant and covers about 30% of Srl. Lanka's
land aren.  This zone supports more than 75% of the population and accoun,s for
about 45% of cultivated area. 1/
1.02    Until the late 1970s, economic growth in Sri Lanka was slow.  Real per
capita GDP grew at 2.1% p.a. in the 1960s and declined to 1.3% p.a. during tile
1970-76 period.  The slow pace of economic growth in the 1970s was mainly due to a
combinf2tion of inadequate investment, ineffective and inappropriate goveriimeat
policies tosward growth and investment, adverse weather, and a sharp rise in "lhe
cost of imported food and fuel.  This disappointing economic performance resulted
in severe unemployment.  In late 1977, the newly elected administration initiated
a "liberalization" strategy to achieve higher growth rates of: (a) production and
employment, (b) savings and investment, and (c) exports.  Major changes included
exchange rate unification and de2preciation, import trade liberalization, interest
rate increases to encourage savings, full-cost pricing for most imported com-
modities, and a free trade zone to attract export-oriented foreign private invest-
ment, The economy reacted vigorously to these changes. Sri Lanka'B development
efforts since 1977 have yielded an annual growth rate in GDP in excess of 6%. The
primary sectors of significant growth have been paddy production, services, and
construction, These benefited from changes in relative prices, removal of import
quotas, and rapidly expanded investment.  Furthermore, employment growth has been
substantial in both the public and private sectors. Unemployment has been reduced
further by out-migration in response to job opportunities abroad. As a result,
the unemployment rate fell from 24% of the labor force in 1975, to 14.8% in 1978
and 13.1% in 1982. 2/ Fixed investment likewise has risen from 14-15% of GDP in
the early 1970s to 30% in recent years.
riculture Sector
1.03    Agriculture plays a major role in Sri Lanka's economy, accounting
for abour 25% of GDP, over 50% of the labor force, and about 60% of export
earvings. About 95% of the rural population is involved directly in
agriculture-related activities.  In addition, much of the activity in the manufac-
turing, transport and services sectors relates to either agricultural input supply
or the processing agricultural produce.  Sri Lanka's climate is suitable for
year-round cultivation, and variations in precipitation, topography, temperature,
and soils enable production of a wide range of crops. Out of about 2.24 M ha
under permanent cultivation (34% of land area), paddy accoonts for 0.65 M ha; tree
crops (coconut, tea, and rubber) 0.93 M ha; and other perennial crops 0.04 4 ha.
The remaining 0.62 M ha comprises mixed rainfed farming, mostly as small gardens
around homesteads. An additional 1.0 M ha are under shifting slash and burn
cultivation (chena).

1.04    GOSL's current policy emphasizes development and settlenietit of the dry
zone thirough the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga Development Program (AbIDP) while
complemnenting these long-gestation investments wit:h lower-cost, quick-yielding
projects in areas receiving no significant berefits from tlhe Malhaweli Program.
Investment and incentive policy chianges introduced for the agricultur&l sector by
GOSL in the late 1970s were a response to disappointing growth in the early and
mid-1970s.  Average agricultural growth, 3.4% p.a. during the 1960s, had declined
to only 1.9% p.a. over the 1970-77 period. Agricultural performance over tile
1978-82 period improved substantially with growth averaging 4.0% p.a. This over-
all result was buoyed by an impressive inicrease in paddy production averaging 5.2
% p.a., and was depressed by poorer growth in the tree crops sector averaging only
1.6% p.a.  As a consequence, imports of rice have declined dramatically.  Climat.c
vagaries, however, have been particularly pronounced in the last three yeqr: and
have had marked impact on Sri Lankan agriculture.  A marginal decline in paddy
production in 1982 of 3.3% was attributable to an 11% drop in the 1981-82 maha
crop due to a severe drought, mitigated by a 1982 yala crop 12% better than the
previous year. 1/ The 1982-83 maha crop (1.79 M tons), in contrast, was a
record--31% above the previous year's depressed production. Drought conditions
during the 1983 yala and maha 1983-84 seasons were very serious, leaving normally
sown areas either uncultivated or damaged.
Irrigation Subsector
1.05    Annual mean rainfall in Sri Lanka's wet and intermediate agro-climatic
zones ranges from about 2,200 to 3,900 mm and is fairly well distributed
throughout the year. Paddy can be grown in these zones under rainfed conditions,
not only in the maha season but, in some areas, in the yala as well. Irrigation
development in the wet zone has been limited primarily to run-of-the-river diver-
sion. In contrast, annual rainfall in the dry zone, averaging only about 1,300
mm, is concentrated in the maha season and displays considerable year-to-year
variability; irrigation, therefore, is essential for cultivation in the yala
season, and some supplemental irrigation is often necessary for the maha crop.
The dry zone, containing about 285,000 ha of irrigated land, accounts for about
78% of the total irrigated area. Traditional irrigation schemes are based on
storage tanks designed to provide supplemental irrigation to the maha crop, with
any residual water used for 'Limited dry season cropping. There are a total of
about 180 such major schemes in Sri Lanka with a combined storage capacity in
excess of 2.5 M n:3 (irrigating a total of nearly 162,000 ha) and a vast number of
smaller schemes. Traditionally, maintenance of these schemes has been the respon-
sibility of farmers, with only major headworks and main canals under government
purview. For most schemes, water is allowed to flow continuously, running from
field to field with only limited development of tertiary channels. Not only have
most of these irrigation systems deteriorated seriously but initial designs were
outmoded and provided only minimal control. With modernization, proper operation,
improved water management practices, and introduction of appropriate cropping
patterns (in particular to optimize rainfall use and to diversify into non-paddy
crops on more permeable soils), substantial increases in cropping intensities and
irrigable areas could be attained with existing water supplies. Under the ongoing

monsoon season (April-September).

Cr. 1079-CE, and Cr. 1363-CE) and Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project

prototypes for future development of other dry zone tanks. For the longer-term;,
GOSL is emphasizing expansion of irrigated agriculture in the dry zone through
development of Sri Lanka's major river basins, principally the Mahaweli Ganga
Basin.
Mahaweli Ganga Development Program 1/
1.06    The basic objectives underlying the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program
stem from a need to overcome three major problems facing Sri Lanka: (a) unemploy-
ment; (b) excessive imports of foodgrain and other agricultural products; and (c)
a shortage of power for industrial development and rural electrification. Under
the Program, about 225,000 farm families would be settled on newly developed land,
and over a million people would be employed in agricultural and allied pursuits.
Agricultural output would redi'ce the need to import rtce and other food items for
which the foreign exchange 1rill averaged about US$270 M in 1980-82, or about 25%
of export earnings.
1.07    The Program is based on a Master Plan prepared jointly by a UNDP/FAO team
and Sri Lankan engineers in 1965-68. The Plan, which envisaged development of
about 365,000 ha of irrigable land in the dry zone as well as about 500 MW of
hydropower, was divided into three phases, each including several projects for
stepwise implementation over a 30-year period. Implementation of the Plan began
in 1970. Late in 1977, however, GOSL realized thit at the current rates of con-
struction and population growth, the Program would not have much near-term impact
on the unemployment problem and serious food and power shortages, and that it
should be accelerated. An Implementation Strategy Study was carried out with
financing from the Netherlands to: (a) review and re-evaluate the UNDP/FAO Master
Plan and each of its separate projects, (b) examine the implications of various
alternative phasings of the feasible projects, and (c) recommend a specific action
plan taking into account technical, financial, economic, institutional, and man-
power constraints. While the Study was underway, GOSL selected five major
projects comprising five dams and hydropower plants with a total potential power
capacity of 500-600 MW and downstream development of about 112,000 ha to be
included under its Accelerated Mahaweli Development Program (AMDP). Donors were
approached for support for different components of the Program and responded
positively. Meanwhile, the Study, completed in 1979, concluded that (a) the base
costs of the overall Program had been greatly underestimated; (b) two of the five
projects (Randenigala and Moragahakanda) were not required for irrigation in the
AMDP as the remaining Kotmale, Victoria and the Maduru Oya Dams would provide
sufficient regulation to irrigate the entire AMDP area; and (c) based on power
demand studies, substantial additions to existing capacity were needed.
1/ The Mahaweli Ganga Development Program or Scheme, as shown in the UNDP/FAO
Mahaweli Ganga Master Plan of 1968, includes about 365,000 ha of net irrigable
land situated in the Mahaweli Ganga and Maduru Oya Basins (192,000 ha) and the
North-Central part of Sri Lanka (17S,000 ha). The Accelerated Mahaweli
Development Program encompasses about one-third of the Scheme's net irrigable
area, representing Systems A, B, C, D-1, D-2, E, F, and G.



-5-
1.08    GCSL accepted most of these concluvlons and revised the AMDP accordingly,
with the exception of including the Randenigala Project since it was justified on
power alone and it was considered badly needed by about 1989. Initial work in
AMDP (1980-85) was confined to the four headworks projects having a total
installed capacity of about 500 MW (Kotmale, financed partly by Swedish import
support funds; Victoria, by an initial 100 M UK grant; Maduru Oya, by Canadian
loans and grants amounting to C$85.9 M; and Randenigala, by a D)M 400 M loan from
the Federal Republic or Germany).  Downstream development was to be limited to
about 60,000 ha in Systems B and C, completion of ongoing development works in
System H, and coastruction of the M4inipe Anicut, the Right Bank Transbasin Canal,
and the Ulhitya and Ratkinda Reservoirs. The US is currently providing assistance
for downstream development of the Maduru Oya Project System B LB (US$90 M); it
also financed an in-depth study of the environmental impact of AMDP and is financ-
ing a Mahaweli Environmental Project (US$5.0 M) to implement the Study's recommen-
dations. Canada and the UK financed feasibility studies of Systems B and C,
respectively. The EEC is supporting development of Zone 2 in System C; and IDA,
Japan, and the Kuwait Fund are assisting in Zones 3-6 of System C. The Asian
Development Bank is providing assistance to plan and construct roads in the AMDP
area. Under a technical assistance credit, IDA ard the EEC financed consultancy
services to review designs and tender documents for the Transbasin Canal and for
detailed designs and engineering of irrigation infrastructure in System C. The
proposed project in System B RB would mark the Bank's second area development
effort in the AMDP area. The Bank also financed an earlier Mahaweli project to
divert Mahaweli Ganga water to System H and adjoining areas (ptra 1.10).
1.09    The Mahaweli Program and Sri Lanka's Public Investment Program.  The
overall costs of the Program have risen substantially during the past yeats due to
rapid domestic and international inflation and to increased costs associated with
more difficult site conditions for the Kotmale project (a major storage dam under
the AMDP) than originally anticipated. Its share of total public capital expendi-
tures rose from about 7% in 1977 to about 35% over 1980-82, reaching a high of 46%
in 1982. As a consequence of its relative and absolute magnitudes, AMDP has (a)
contributed substantially to large unfinanced budget deficits, (b) led to heavy
dependence on external financing, including sizable commercial borrowings, and (c)
helped create a serious imbalance between current and capital spending. The
macro-economic situation, including the need to reduce public investment and
reorient public spending generaliy, is the topic of ongoing dialogue between GOSL,
the Bank and the IMF. GOSL has responded to macro-management difficulties by
making various adjustments and cuts in the capital budget, including adjustments
to AMDP (e.g., reducing the height of Kotmale Dam and deferring some downstream
development). In addition, GOSL imposed a moratorium during 1983-84 on new
projects not already in its investment program. Nevertheless, the extent to which
Mahaweli can contribute to GOSL's overall adjustment in its public investment
program are limited by earlier commitments, expenditures on which are expected
to peak over 1982-84. Thereafter, declines are projected, and Mahaweli's share is
currently expected to fall to 23% of total public investment by 1985-87. The
proposed project for System B RB development would basically be implemented after
the current peak. It is also intended to complement major headwork investments
(sunk costs) already made in the Maduru Oya Reservoir and RB Transbasin Canal and
to utilize other external assistance.

Bank Group's Rolt in Mahaweli Ganga Development
1.10    Withi Bank Group assistance, initial construction under the Pr,gram bega
in 1970 under the Mahaweli Ganga Development Project I (Cr. 653-CE) with divers±  i
headworks at Polgolla on the Mahaweli Ganga and at Bow;tenna on the Amban Ganga,
including a 40 MW hydropower plant at Polgolla. This first project was completed
in 1978 and provided an improved water supply to about 52,650 ha of existi.ig
irrigated land and a full supply for about 29,000 ha of unirrigated land in System
H to be developed under future projects. The project was well designed, fulfilled
its objectives, and received full support from government agencies. In a
Bank-sponsored audit of the completed project, it was also noted that farmers'
ability to quickly adopt double-cropping was one of the principal reasons for its
success.  Under Mahaweli II (Cr. 701-CE), with co-financing from IDA, Canada, the
Netherlands, UK, US, and EEC, construction work is nearing completion on irriga-
tion and social infrastructure for about 60% of this 29,000 ha of newly irrigated
area. 1/ The Project, including settlement assistance and agricultural extension
and support services, is e-cpected to be completed by mid-1984, or about one year
behind schedule. Under Mahaweli III (Cr. 1166-CE), with co-financing from IDA,
Japan and the Kuwait Fund, work on downstream development in System C was started
in 1980 with award of contracts for construction of the Minipe RB Transbasin
Canal. The construction of irrigation infrastructure works began in 1982. The
Project will provide a full irrigation supply for about 24,100 ha of newly
irrigated land and a supplemental supply for about 3,600 ha in System C. The
Project includes irrigation and social infrastructure, settlement assistance, and
agricultural development assistance. Concentrated principally in Zones 3-6 of
System C, the Project is complemented by similar concomitant investments in Zone 2
financed by EEC. Under a technical assistance credit (Cr. 979-CE), IDA, with EEC
co-financing, is providing technical assistance for a study to determine optimal
use of surplus water from the Mahaweli Ganga. In addition to financing these
earlier projects, the Bank has also assisted GOSL with AMDP principally throlgh
external assistance coordination for project preparation and implementation.
Implementation Progress of Mahaweli Ganga DevE lpment Projects II and III
1.11    Implementation of Mahaweli II is resulting in a well-developed agricul-
tural area with promise for sustained, increased agricultural production. Quality
social infrastructure has been provided. However, some additional work is
required to improve water management and rectify water measurement and control
structures. Further, as the Project has become operational, additional canal
lining requirements have been identified to reduce excessive canal seepage losses
and concomitant drainage problems. Although necessary canal lining was foreseen
at appraisal and included under the Project, only limited sections of the canal
have been lined thus far. Remaining construction of structures and canal lining
are matched to local funds available, which are currently deemed insufficient to
finance all the work needed. It may therefore be possible, in view of time and
resource constraints, to finish no more than 60% of the lining works foreseen.
The Credit was extended one year. System H has become an important contributor to
national rice production, and output of other field crops is steadily increasing.
Maha 1982-83 paddy yields were reported to average 5.4 tons/ha against a national

average of 3.5 tons/ha, suggesting that the emphasis of the extension program on
timely cultivation, fertilizer application and weed control is appropriate. Land
acquisition payments and disbursements from the Credit are behind schedule. Cost
recovery through land sales and signiificant water charge collection has not yet
begun.
1.12    Implemeintation of Mahaweli III is still in early stages, although con-
struction of the RB Transbasin Canal is nearing completion. Jungle clearing work
is nearly completed in Zone 3 and contracts have been awarded for clearing about
30% of the land in Zone 4. By end-1982, about 50% of the infrastructure buildings
were completed in Zone 3 and about 1,800 families settled. It is estimated that
by early 1984 essentially all infrastructure in Zone 3 will be completed and about
4,200 families (23% of total) will be settled. However, contracting of main and
branch canals was delayed by late preparation of designs and bidding documents,
and work has just begun on construction of the downstream irrigation distribution
,stem in Zone 3.  Equipment and vehicle procurement is progressing satisfac-
turily, and an environmental program has been 'ev!2wed, approved and started.
Disbursenents from the Credit have been slow due to loadenuate documentation on
disburseinent applications.  The project is about six mol.   behind schedule.
II. PROJECT AREA
General
2.01    System B, the downstream command area of the recently compleced Madura Oya
Dam, consists of a net irrigable area of about 39,400 ha out of a gross area of
136,000 ha. It includes about one third of the lands to be irrigated under AMDP.
This irrigable area is located on both the right and left banks of the Maduru Oya
River downstream from Maduru Oya Reservoir, lying east of the Mahaweli Ganga in an
adjacent basin within Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa Districts. The
water supply for Systems B and C has been developed tarough construction of the
Victoria Dam and Reservoir, Minipe Anicut Right Bank rransbasin Canal, and the
Ulhitiya-Ratkinda Reservoirs. Irrigation facilities for the System B LB area
(about 25,400 net irrigable ha) are currently being developed with assistance from
USAID, the Saudi Fund and Australia.
2.02    The project area is located on the RB of the Maduru Oya and comprises a
gross area of 58,000 ha with an estimated net irrigable area of 14,000 ha (Map No.
IBRD 17493). The RB area is located entirely in Batticaloa District and covers
specifically Zones 6-8 of System B. About 80% of the RB is currently covered by
scrub evergreen forest, 12% under wetland paddy cultivation, 5% under chena, and
3% by traditional settlements and tanks. By 1979 much of the forested area was
subjected to unsanctioned encroachment, although to a lesser extent than in other
Mahaweli areas such as System C. Traces and roads have since been cut to enable
topographic and soil surveys and timber extraction. Virtually all marketable
timber has been removed in preparation for settlement and agricultural develop-
ment.
2.03    The population of the total System B area was estimated in 1979 at 26,000.
However, the RB area has a population of less than 7,000. Most of the RB popula-
tion, which is en,aged in agriculture, is concentrated in about six villages.
Cultivated land, now used principally for paddy, totals about 5,600 gross
ha--2,000 ha under the Punanai river diversion scheme, 600 ha uncler minor tanks,



-8-
and 3,000 ha of rainfed floodplains. The larger vilLages and rmost of the popula-
tion are located near the relatively extensive paddy areas in Zones 7-8. A few
families mnaintain cattle for meat and/or milk, production.  About 2,000 ha of chena
are cultivated each year, and the pressure on suitable lands has resulced in
shortening the shifting cultivation cycle and encroachment on lands desigrated as
forest reserves. Most families outside the areas served by diversion or tank
irrigation are eligible for the National Food Stamp Scheme (threshold income
eligibility level of Rs 3,600 p.a. per family).
2.04    Infrastructure development is rather rudimentary in the RB area.  An
unsurfaced road, traversing the western end of Zone 7 and the Length of Zone 8
(the Wacaanunne-Kirane Road), is generally passable year-round.  The remaining road
network is limited to cart tracks.  A few small villages in Zones 7-8 provide sore
rudimentary services, but residents generally have to travel outside the area for
satisfactory communications, health, education, and technical services. Agricul-
tural supporting services within the RB area are negligible and are generally
confined to extension activities around area tanks. Services are more adequate at
Welikanda, Punanai town, and Vakaneri, all located on the LB north of and adjacent
to Zone 7, and around Valachchenai, east of Zone 8.  The main Colombo-Batticoloa
rail :,ine passes just north of the RB area, making stops at Welikanda and Punanai.
Welikanda currently serves as the principal construction headquarters for System B
development.
Clirmate
2.05    The warm tropical climate in the RB area is favorable for year-round crop
production. Temperatures average about 28oC, varying from occasIonal lows of 170C
in January-February to highs near 380C during Jv..e-September.  Mean annual rain-
fall is about 1,800 mm with about 65% occurring during the NE monsoon period from    J
nid-October to mid-February (maha), and the balance during the reMainder of the
year (yala). Rainfall unpredictability in the naha makes irrigation necessary to
ensture high and stable yields. Crop cultivation during the yala is almost
entirely dependent on irrigation.
Topography and Drainage
2.06    Elevation and surface configuration of RB lands is generally controlled by
underlying bedrock. The depth-to-bedrock generaLly exceeds six meters in lowland
areas. However, this barrier is relatively shallow beneath the higher lands where
soils and unconsolidated substrata are typically 2-4 in deep.  Rock outcrops are
common, especially on upper slopes and ridge crests.  Floodplains, comprising the
greater part of the valley floor, have general sLopes of less than 0.5% with
smooth to gently undulating microrelief.  Higher lands, consisting of a dissected
erosional surface that comprises about 75% of the gross area, have the most
pronounced relief.  Gradients on side slopes of the broader ridges are generally
in the range of 1-3%. Some side slopes of narrow ridges have general gradient
exceeding 6%. Floodplains are poorly to very poorly drained.  In most areas the
watertable rises :o surface level in the maha season, and the lowest sections were
subject to flood ag in the normal maha season prior to Maduru Oya Reservoir con-
struction.  Howeever, flooding will be much less extensive and severe with
anticipated reservoir operations. Scattered tracts of moderateLy well drained
lands are found in upland areas having permeable soils with relatively deep bar-
rier zones. However, the greater portion of uplands is poorly drained because of
relatively shallow depth to effective barrier. The watertable rises close to the



- 9-
surface in thiese areas during normal maha seasons under currently nonirrigated
conditions.
Soils and Land Suitability for Irrigation Development
2.07    Soil salinity, exchangeable sodium, or iron toxicity would not be problems
for RB irrigation development considering (a) area rainfall and irrigation water
quality, (b) adequacy of drainage to meet leaching requirements, and (c) favorable
soil chemical characteristics. Lands vary considerably in other important soil
characteristics that, together with topography and drainage, determine their
suitability for irrigation and appropriate cropping patterns.
2.08    Floodpla:n lands have a flat regular topography, relatively high-fertility
soils, and fairly impermeable soils ideal for paddy production. About two thirds
of the higher lands above the floodplains are considered nonirrigable because of
steep topography, coarse textured soils with low cation-exchange capacity, and/or
shallow soil depth. Of those higher lands classified as irrigable, the majority
have been designated for paddy production because their shallow depth-to-barrier
would otherwise require extensive drainage to make non-paddy cropping technically
feasible.  The rtumaining scattered tracts of irrigable lands having deep, perme-
able, fertile soils would t'n suitable for upland crop production.  Irrigable land
areas designated for paddy and upland crops are summarized in Annex 1, Table 1.
Rural Credit
2.09    Institutional rural credit in Sri Lanka is principally disbursed by two
nationalized commercial banks, the People's Bank (PB) and Bank of Ceylon (BC). PB
operates through its banking divisions, the Cooperative Rural Banks.  BC provides
credit services through its main branches, with representation maintained at
Agrarian Service Centers (ASC). National rural credit policy is established by a
Rural Credit Advisory Board (RCAB) chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank
(CB).  CB's Department of Rural Credit functions as the Board's secretariat and
executive. Within Mahaweli Program areas, BC and PB always operate in separate
jurisdictions, at the discretion of the Mahaweli Economic Agency (MEA), so that
any farner will have access to only one banking institution. At the present time,
there are no banking facilities in the System B RB area.
2.10    The total amount of institutional rural credit disbursed nationwide
declined in nominal terns from Rs 156.8 M (1981) to Rs 153.9 M (1982), or by 1.8%.
This decline was primarily the result of a drop in lending under the Comprehensiva
Rural Credit Scheme (CRCS) by 13. During the same period, crop cultivation loans
declined from Rs 85.3 M to Rs 75.2 M. High default rates continue to be an
unsatisfactory feature of rural lending. From 1967 to end-1982, initially under
the New Agricultural Credit Scheme and subsequently under the CRCS, only about 48%
of amounts disbursed have been recovered. 1/ In 1982, only Rs 86.2 M of the Rs
150.4 M disbursed during the 1981-82 cultivation year was recovered, resulting in
a deterioration in the recovery rates for both paddy and minor food crops compared
to the previous year. The maha 1981-82 drought accounted for part of this
deterioration. As a result of this drought and subsequent defaults, the National

Agricultural Credit Fund (NACF) was established by the RCAB to provide insurance
for crop failures due to natural calamities. Such insurance thereafter was
required for crop loans; however, the Crop Insurance Scheme has now bean suspended
as a result of the impact on its operatiors of subsequent droughts.
2.11    With a view to improving recoveries, the RCAB in 1981 started a reschedul-
ing effort for CRCS cultivation. loans in default.  Under the schene, defaulters
can be eligible for new loans, initially paying 10% of the overdue loan aLong withi
interest at 9.0% p.a. up to June 30, 1981. Thereafter, at; each harvest, a fonrer
defaulter is expected to repay the balance over a five year period. Nqo literest
was charged after June 30, 1981.  If farmers pay the first seven installrnents
regulariy, the scheme provides a waiver for the last three installments.  The
scheme was adopted by BC in 1982 and then by PB in 1983.  By ernd-1982 the totaL
amount of loans coDsolidated indicated that farmers' response to the scheme was
greater than expected. This national rescheduling effort shouLd estabLish. a
healthier farmer-bank relationship as a basis for the future credit expansion.
2.12    Cultivation loans from banks for paddy and subsidiary food crops are
generally provided for 240 days at 9.0% interest p.a., witb a penalty of 5%
charged on overdues.  Such loans are provided partly in kind (with direct payment
to input suppliers) and partly in cash. Long-term credit is aLso avaiLabLe to the
farmers for purchasing equipment.  In addition to this institutional credit, there
is evidence that a substantial share of rural credit comes fromn non-institurional
sources.  Data from System H indicate tnat only 22.5% of settlers received loans
from institutional sources between yala 1980 and mnaha 1982-83. A large proportion
of the remainder is likely to have taken credit from non-institutional lenders.
This aspect of rural credit is currently under study by the Mahaweli Authority of
Sri Lanka (MASL) and banking agencies.
III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01    The proposed project would be che fourth irrigated agricultural develop-
ment project assisted by the Bank Group under the hahaweli Ganga Development
Program. The project would provide facilities for new irrigation and set:tlement
on about 14,000 ha (net) lying on the Right Bank of the Maduru Oya and for
enhanced irrigation to about 1,800 ha (net) of existing cultivated area,
non-irrigated conservation forests, fuelwood and cashew plantations, and axtisanal

assistance; monitoring, training, and environmental enhanceaent programs; and
equipment and vehicles for construc2tion, operation, training and crop cuLtivation
programs.

Description of Project Works, Facilities, and Programs
3.03    NDK Dam and Reservoir (Annex 2, Table 5).  A small regulatory reservoir
would be provided on the RB Main Canal downstream of the outlet from Maduru Oya
Reservoir. The reservoir formed by NDK Dam would have an active capacity of 15.6
M m3 and would partially regulate natural stream inflows plus releases for the RB
from Maduru Oya Dam. This reservoir would also act as afterbay storage for
releases from power facilities at the Maduru oya Dam should they eventually be
developed.  The NDK Dam would be 2,700 m long (including two low dikes) and 18 mi
high above streambed with a crest at 78 X elevation.  The spillway, with a crest
width of 275 m at 74.5 m elevation, would have maximum discharge capacity of 1,900
m3/sec.
3.04    Main and Branch Canals (Annex 2, Table 6).  The Main Canal from Maduru Oya
Reservoir to NDK Dam would have a capacity of 100 m3/sec; from NDK Dam the
capacity would be 28 m3/sec. The canal would be about 35 km long and would be
concrete-lined throughout. Nine branch canals, totalling 55 km in length with
capacities varying from 1-10 m3/sec, would also be eoncrete-lined. Eight small
reservoirs, formed by level canal crossings and with capacities of from 0.25 - 1.5
Km3, would be located along the canal alignment.



-12-
3.05    Irrigation Distribution and Drainage Facilities (Annex 2, Table 7).  About
280 km of distributary canals and 765 km of field canals would be constructed to
distribute irrigation water from main and branch canals to the estimated 14,000 ha
of net irrigable area in Zones 6-8, All distributary canals serving upland areas
(28 km) and about 10% (25 km) of the canals serving lowlands would be con-
crete-lined. A farm turnout would be provided to serve each one-ha farm plot in
lowland areas and one turnout would be provided for every two ha in upland areas.
About 680 km of field drains, 200 km of secondary drains, and 35 km of main drains
would be constructed for protection against excessive water level buildup from
rains and to control the subsurface watertable in upland areas.
3.06    Roads (Annex 2, Table 8).  The road network constructed under the project
would include about 75 km of 11 m-wide primary trunk roads, 230 km of 7-m wide
market and access roads (including 30 km of O&M roads upgraded to market road
standards), and 140 km of 4 mn-wide village and hamlet roads. Trunk and market
roads would be asphalt-surfaced and village and hamlet roads would be laterite- or
gravel-surfaced.
3.07    Land Clearing and On-farm Development (Annex 2, Table 9).  A total of
about 15,000 ha would require clearing to provide a net irrigable area of 14,000
ha of farm land, and 5,000 ha would be cleared for the cashew, fuelwood and con-
servation forest plantations. Clearing of homesteads would not be included under
the project so that settlerE could utilize vegetation for fuel and shade. Rough
leveling, land shaping and bund layouts would be carried out under the project for
the 14,000 ha area. Construction of bunds, on-farm ditches and drains, and final
farm leveling or grading would be done by settlers on a labor contract basis.
3.08    Social Infrastructure and Community Development Facilities (Annex 2, Table
9). There are currently no major communities in the project area. The project
would provide new settlers with adequate health, educational, and other facilities
to attain living standards comparable to developed areas elsewhere in Sri Lanka.
The basic project development unit would be a hamlet or unit center of about
250-275 farmer-settler families and 75 non-farmer settlers. There would be about
18 such units in each zone. Two area or block centers would be developed in each
zone, with each block center serving about 8-10 unit centers. One township or
project center would be developed at Meyankolla in Zone 8 to serve the entire
project area.
3.09    About 18,200 new families (approximately 100,000 persons) would settle in
the project area with development, including 14,000 farmer- settlers 1/ and about
4,200 tradesmen, service personnel, and GOSL staff. The project would provide
basic social infrastructure including development and training centers. A summary
of the infrastructure to be provided is given in Annex 1, Table 3. Educational
facil.'ties would include a primary school at each hamlet and junior secondary
schools at block and project centers based on population (including three each in
Zones 6-7 and four in Zone 8). Senior secondary schools would be located at block
centers in Zone 6-7 and at the project center in Zone 8. Limited boarding
facilities would be provided at schools for students coming from more distant
parts of the project area. The project would cover the initial furniture and
1/ Includes about 600 farm-families (4%) from minor tank areas in the RB which
would be incorporated into the project's overall irrigatiorL systen.



-13-
training aids for the schools, and the Ministry of Education would defray recut
rent costs of the buildings, teacher's salaries, and other expenses.
3.10    The project would provide strategically located medical and health
facilities including ambulance dnd mobile unit service. A, central health unit
would be located at Meyankolla, with dispensaries in each zone. Midwife clinics
and sub-dispensary units would be sited throughout the area with three clinics and
dispensary units in Zone 6, four in Zone 7, and six in Zone 8. Each dispensary
unit would serve about four hamlets. Living quarters would be provided for medi-
cal and nursing staff.
3.11    Other facilities would include a townhall and offices, police station and
police posts, telephone and postal facilities, rural electrification, and a piped
water supply for the project center at Meyankolla. Storage for fertilizers, seed,
and food provided by the World Food Programme (WFP) also would be provided at
block centers.
3.12    Management and Operational Infrastructure (Annex 2, Table 9).  Project
settlement and O&M activities would be managed by the Mahaweli Economic Agency
(MEA). Offices and quarters for MEA staff would be provided under the project.
Housing would be included for all MEA management staff at the unit, block and
project centers and dormitories for extension workers and farmers would be
provided at block and project centers. The project would provide office buildings
at block and project centers, a central workshop, and minor repair facilities.
Duriag project implementation, MEA's recurrent costs (e.g., salaries, allowances,
vehicle operation) would be covered as part of project O&M costs.
3.13    Agricultural Training and Research Facilities.  Farmer-settlers, some with
no practical irrigation experience, would require training in water management
techniques, particularly for diversified cropping. They would need to learn the
fundamentals of, and accept responsibility for, proper operation and maintenance
of tertiary irrigation. The key to the success of the Mahaweli Program and its
individual projects is knowledgeable, efficient farmers capable of managing water
resources effectively in cooperation with others. With water use in similar
irrigation projects currently running as much as 2-3 times higher than actually
needed, a major effort must be made to (a) construct proper irrigation systems to
control water issues ;-fficiently and to distribute them equitably, and (b) train
farmers to be good water managers. The Aralaganwila Training Center farm on the
System B LB, which also has soil types typical of the RB, would be used to demon-
strate diversified cropping and irrigation systems. The Center, currently being
developed with CIDA financing, would have necessary classrooms, research build-
ings, laboratories, and farm facilities to demonstrate correct agricultural prac-
tices and irrigation techniques. Hostel accommodations would be provided for [iO
participants attending basic courses. riarters for resident staff, offices,
workshops, and ancillary buildings also would be provided. The center would
organize (a) pre-service and in-service training for management operation staff;
and (b) training for contact farmers and community leaders. It also wo11.cd serve
as a venue for field day demonstrations for the settler community. Small demon-
stration plantations for farm forestry would also be developed.  To complement the
Aralagangwila complex, a small demonstration-cum-training center would be
developed at Meyankolla.
3.14    Fuelwood and Cashews Plantations (Annex 2, Tables 10 & 11).  To provide an
adequate, long-term supply of fuel for settlers, the project would establish



-14-
fuelwood plantations within the project area. These plantations would be located
in upland rion-irrigable areas. Specific locations would be demarcated by the MASL
Planning Division and then released tc the Forest Department (FD) for development.
FD would establish small nurseries and coordinate plantation establishment and
maintenance. Based on an estimated annual famiiy fuelwood requirement of 2.25 m3,
average annual yield of 20 m3/ha, and a six-year rotation, about 1,650 ha would be
required to meet the fuelwood requirements of farnmer and non-farmer settlers. 1/
An additional area of 350 ha would be planted to support industrial development.
About 20% of the 2,000 ha total would be planted each year during project
implementation to ensure a continuous supply. In contrast with past development
practice in Mahaweli projects, homestead plots would not be cleared; rather,
standing timber would be used for fuel until plantation output and homegrown
supplies become available. Another 2,000 ha of non-irrigable land would be demar-
cated by MASI, and developed for cashew cultivation. About 400 ha would be planted
annually and managed by the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation (SLCC) on behalf of MASL.
Assurances were received from GOSL that by December 31, 1984 SLOC would submit to
the Bank for review and approval a detailed technical work program, including
appropriate costing, for implementing the cashew development component in the
project area. Bank approval of such a program would be a condition of disburse-
ment for this component.
3.15    Conservation Forests (Annex 2, Table 10).   General forest planting would
be carried out in accordance with ongoing conservation programs sponsored by '{ASL
and would be managed by FD. About 1,000 ha in the project area would be
reforested, including riverine areas, roadsides, and canal banks.
3.16    Settlement (Annex 2, Table 9).   Each new farmer-settler would be allotted
on average 1.0 ha of farm land, as well as a 0.2 ha houseplot. The 7.0 ha of
irrigated land would vary from all paddyland to 0.2 ha paddyland wit!- 0.8 ha
upland. Each new settler family would receive orientation and transport to its
assigned area, temporary shelter, basic materials for house construction, farm
tools, and an initial seed/seedling supply. A total of 14,000 farm families are
expected to settle on irrigated land developed by the project, with approximately
4,500 of these in Zone 6; 4,700 in Zone 7; and 4,800 in Zone 8. They would
receive houseplots and farmplots about four to six months before irrigation water
becomes available. Their first harvest would be obtained about one year after
settlement. They would be given opportunity to work for competitive wages in
developing their land, including land preparation, farm ditch and drain construc-
tion, and bunding. Non-farm settlers would construct houses and business estab-
lishments from their own resources, institutional credit, or other programs inde-
pendently of the project. Settlers would be eligible to receive food aid for a
period of 12 months after arrival under agreements between GOSL and WFP. Based on
experience in ongoing Mahaweli settlement operations, no difficulty is foreseen in
attracting sufficient settlers for the project. Provision would also be made for
both individual, livestock holdings and communal grazing areas within the settle-
ment design.
3.17    Settler Selection Criteria.  A scoring system is used to choose settlers
for Mahaweli projects. All applicants must currently work in the agricultural
sector, and cannot be government employees. Applicants receive a score based on
1/ 25% of farmer-settler family fuel requirements would be met from houseplots.



-15-
their family characteristics, and are ranked by this score. There are eight
criteria:  (a) Age:  Maximum score of 10 for the 30-39 group, and lower scores if
older or younger; (b) Education: Maximum score of 10 if completed grade 10 or
above, lower score if less; (c) Tenurial Status: Maximnum score of 10 if landless,
less if a landowner; (d) Personality: Maximum scores of 5 each for physical
fitness and sociability; (e) Farming knowledge of modern methods and formal
agricultural schooling; (f) Size of Household: Maximum score of 10 if 3 units of
labor, lower score if more or less; (g) Participation in Village Activities:
Maximum score of 10 based on degree of participation of applicant and wife in
village level organization; and (h) Other Skills: Maximum score of 10 based on
knowledge o- medicine, masonry, carpentry, and other such skills.
3.18    Agricultural Extension.   A strong agricultural extension program would be
provided to ensure expected yields and intensities are achieved as quickly as
possible. Extension staff would receive thorough training before and after
arrival in the project area. Periodic courses at the Aralaganwila Training Center
would complement proposed pre-service training of field staff. The extension
program would be consistent with the Training and Visit (T&V) System currently
being introduced throughout Sri Lanka. Assurances were received from GOSL that
implementation of agricultural extension services establisaed in the project area
under MASL will be in accordance with the systematic approach agreed to under the
nationwide Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project assisted by IDA.
3.19    Farm Machinery Hire Service (Annex 2, Table 15).   Proposed development of
the project area would be principally for double-cropped paddy. The maha crop
should be planted by end-November to make most effective use of maha rains.
Therefore, farmers must have sufficient farm power to complete land preparation
within a period of about b-8 weeks before the maha crop and 4-6 weeks before the
yala season, as well as assistance to thresh the maha crop. Since necessary farm
power generally would not be totally available irom farmers' own resources durir.g
the early stages of the project, as under Mahaweli III in System C, MEA would
operate a tractor hire service consisting of sixty-four 40-50 HP tractors with
suitable tillage implements provided under the project. It would not be necessary
to replace these MEA tractors because the farming community eventually would
acquire sufficient two-wheel tractors and draft animals to make a publicly
operated tractor hire service no longer neceseary.
3.20    Agricultural Supporting Services.   The marketing and distribution of
seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides would be supported by the construction of a
central store at Meyankolla and smaller stores (two per block and one per unit) to
serve as retail outlets. Since fertilizers would be blended and stored in large
quantities at the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation regional depot nearby at Badulla,
the project would provide only minimum on-site storage facilities, but would
provide sufficient transport vehicles to replenish stocks on short notice. Sup-
plies over the long-term are expected to come from bulk depots at Polonnaruwa.
3.21    Rural Credit.  Most farmer-settlers withbn the project area would be
selected from the landless, unemployed, and underemployed segments of the popula-
tion and would be dependent upon credit to obtain basic cultivation and domestic
requirements. Furthermore, about 10-20% of the new occupants of System B RB would
belong to the trading and service sectors and would require development capital to
finance investments in support activities. Institutional credit, therefore, would
be an integral part of settlement requirements. Recent efforts to improve credit



-16-
recoveries, including resclieduling (para 2.11), are not expected to affect adver-
sely credit eligibility for those settlers selected under the project. Rather,
settlers are expected to benefit directly from programs complementary to project
investments currently being carried out by major banking institutions to
(a) expand rural lending based on repayment and supervisory discipline,
(b) provide field organizations and facillties, and (c) broaden lending schemes as
new rural financing needs arise. Their lending schemes and scales of finance,
both existing and envisaged, should however be reviewed periodically to ensure
that financial assistance is not eroded by inflation. To permit realization of
agricultural production potential from project investments and to ensure growth of
a viable service sector, assurances were received from GOSL that it will make
arrangements to provide adequate credit to project area residents, that such
institutional credit will be supported by adequate supervisory staff and
facilities, and that credit arrangements will be reviewed periodically and
adjusted as required.
3.22    Monitoring and Evaluation (Annex 2, Table 13).  A monitoring and evalua-
tion program would be carried out under the project to review progress in project
implementation and success in meeting its objectives (para 4.12). In particular
it would focus on two basic areas: (a) input delivery and ase covering civil
works construction, on-farm development, settlement, scheduling, project costs,
O&M, agricultural input supplies, and credit; and (b) output achievement in terms
of increased production, improved services and living standards, employment gener-
ation, water management and use efficiency (including irrigation deliveries and
system losses), and environmental impact. In view of ongoing and comprehensive
assistance from CIDA in MASL's overall monitoring efforts, the project would
include only a series of incremental baseline socioeconomic and agricultural
investigations by which to assess the project's impact.
3.23    Water Quality Monitoring Program (Annex 2, Table 10).   The project wotuld
include development and implementation of a water quality sampling program within
System B. A five-year program would be carried out to collect physical, chemical
and biological data on a regular basis from specific sampling sites in the project
area, i.e., Maduru Oya, irrigation tanks, canal and drainage systems, groundwater
and downstream estuarine areas. Sample analyses would be made in the field and in
a centralized laboratory to be established in the project area. Analyses would
evaluate (a) extent of agro-chemical entry into the aquatic ecosystem as a result
of runoff, (b) cumulative effects of nutrient buildup and other pollutants on
Maduru Oya estuarine resources, and (c) effects of Maduru Oya discharges on the
salinity profile and fisheries resources of the estuary. Based on these monitor-
ing activities, water management problem areas would be identified and corrected,
and proper discharge levels determined to enhance estuarine resources. The
program would be coordinated by a Water Resource Research and Monitoring Unit
established within MASL. Technical assistance would be provided under the project
to assist program design and prepare a mathematical model of salinity characteris-
tics in the estuary.
3.24    Fisheries (Annex 2, Table 12).  At project completion, an estimated 2,000
ha of small natural and manmade waterbodies would exist in thb RB downstream area.
The project would provide the seeding of these waterbodies with fingerlings of
freshwater species (@ 1,000/ha: to stimulate traditional artisanal fishing
activities in the area. The Ir.land Fisheries Development Department, Fisheries
Ministry, would carry out these ::nual seeding operations on behalf of MAST. In



-17-
accordance with its ongoing program. Fingerlings would be obtained from the
CIDA-financed hatchery currently under construction near the Maduru Oya Reservoir.
Water Supply and Demand (Annex 1, Tables 2 to 9)
3.25    Average annual irrigation water requirements were based on cropping pat-
terns anticipated with project development (Annex 2, Chart b). Considering effec-
tive rainfall and an average overall efficiency factor of 65%, the gross annual
irrigation wa.er requirement for the 14,000 ha (net) RB area was estimated to
average about 379 m3, The recently completed Maduru Oya Dam would regulate allo-
cated diversions from the Mahaweli Ganga and inflows to Maduru Oya Reservoir to
serve the following requirements in System B:
Irrigable   Mean Annual
Area (ha)   Demand (M 03)
Left Bank (under development)               21,800           611
Kight Bank (project area)                   14,000           379
Lower Left Bank ("Drop-off" area) /a         3,600             97
Total                                39,400         1,087
La  The 3,600 ha Lower LB "drop-off" area is planned for future deve-
lopment based on water availabilities.
3.26    The System B water supply would consist of 380 M m3 of natural inflow to
Maduru Oya Reservoir, 30 M m3 to NDK Reservoir, and an average of 677 M m3 of
Mahaweli Ganga diversions through the link tunnel to Maduru Oya Reservoir from the
Minipe Anicut-Transbasin Canal system to meet the full irrigation requirements of
the LB and Rb areas. The link tunnel has a capacity of 34 m3/sec, which is ade-
quate to convey the supplemental water needed for System B. The capacity of the
Minipe Transbasin Canal is limited to 64 m3/sec and is designed to serve System C
as well as System B. With the regulatory storage provided in the Ulhitiya Oya and
Ratkinda Reservoirs located at the terminus of the Transbasin Canal, adequate
water would be available from the canal to supply the full capacity of the link
tunnel (90 M m3/mo) for all months except during peak demand periods in May-July
when System C demand would reduce the water available for di         0TIon. Maduru Oya
and NDK reservoir storage releases would normally supply che addi:tonal require-
ment of System B during that period. Simulated operation studies for Systems B
and C using estimated reservoir inflows and Transbasin Canal diversions, as
modified by upstream storage and diversions from the Mahaweli Ganga, indicate
estimated irrigation demands for System B can be met without shortage. Neverthe-
less, development of the "drop-off" area in the lower reaches of Left Bank area
would be delayed until the remaining lands in System B and System C are completed
and water availability has been verified. Water-use monitoring and water manage-
ment training programs would be carried out to facilitate effective water manage-
ment and efficient use of irrigation water by farmers. An assurance was received
from GOSL that MASL will allocate to System B tae full amount of water required
for project use.
3.27    With irrigation of the 14,000 ha project area at an average cropping
intensity of 180%, about 20% of the water applied would return to the Maduru Oya
during the month of application and 10% in the second month, amounting to about 35
M m3 of usable return flow in the Yala and 20 M m3 in the Maha. This would more



-18-
than meet the requirement for the presently cultivated land (1600 ha net) in the
downstream Punanai area, to be irrigated from the lower Maduru Oya. The quality
of water in the Mahaweli Ganga and Maduru Oya is satisfactory for irrigation use.
The project water quality monitoring program (para 3.23) would complement the
program already underway with USAID assistance in System B that gathers physical,
chemical and biological data on water supplies and return flows on a regular
basis.
Status of Project Preparation
3.28    Feasibility investigations for System B were completed by Acres Interna-
tional, Ltd. and summarized in its August 1980 Maduru Oya Project feasibility
report. Technical and cost data for the RB area were updated by Acres in 1982, and
the Mahaweli Authority subsequently updated the development plan for social
infrastructure and settlement. A consulting firm was engaged with USAID financing
to prepare final designs and preliminary tender documents for NDK Dam and Feeder
Canal and the Main and Branch Canals. The detailed surveys, geotechnical inves-
tigations and final designs have been completed for both the Dam and Canals. A
contract was awarded for construction of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal (with CIDA
assistance), and construction of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal will be c.-ipleted early
in 1984. Bids for constructing the Main and Branch Canals are expected to be
called in mid-1984 (financed by the Saudi Fund for Development (para 3.29)).
3.29    Land classification for the feasibility report was based on semi-detailed
soil surveys and topographic mapping at a scale of 1:5,000. Detailed irrigation
suitability land classification and drainage investigations were carried out in
late 1983 (following US Bureau of Reclamation criteria) to delineate lands
suitable for paddy and diversified cropping, and the irrigable area was adjusted
accordingly. Designs and estimates for irrigation distribution and drainage
systems were developed from sample areas representative of the project area.
Sample area studies utilized available topographic maos (scale of 1:5,000 and one
meter contours) with land classification ctinerimposed to develop realistic cost
estimates for the distributary canals, field canals, and drains. Final layout and
preparation of detailed designs, cost estimates, and tender documents for dis-
tribution facilities, drains, roads, and social infrastructure would be carried
out with technical assistance provided under the project (para 3.30) utilizing
detailed strip photography.
Technical Assistance (Annex 4; Annex 2, Tables 6, 7, 10 and 11)
3.30    The professional and technical staff of the Mahaweli Engineering and
Construction Agency (MECA) are currently almost fully committed to ongoing
projects in the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program (including System B LB), and
MECA does not have the capacity to provide the engineering and supervision exper-
tise required during project implementation. Consequently, consultants would be
provided to supervise construction of the Main and Branch Canals and to plan,
design, and supervise construction of RB tertiary irrigation facilities, drainage
facilities, and social and management infrastructure. A consulting firm for
supervision of construction of the Main and Branch Canals would be financed by the
Saudi Fund and is expected to be selected and posted in early 1984. The consult-
ants required for final design, layout and construction supervision of tertiary
irrigation and drainage facilities, on-farm development, roads, and social
infrastructure would be finianced by CIDA. Draft terms of reference for the Saudi
Fund and CIDA funded consultants (who would also supervise implementation of



-19-
IDA-financed components) are presented in Annex 4. Additional technical assis-
tance requirements provided under the project include two man-months for estab-
lishment of the water quality monitoring program and 12 man-months to assist in
cashew seed material selection and breeding. Total requirements and estimated
costs are summarized below, based on end-CY83 general cost levels for the exper-
tise required:

Cost Estimates
3.31    Total project cost is estimated at about Rs 4,351.0 M (US$160.1 M),
including US$32.1 M for price escalation and excluding the Bank front-end fee.
Cost estimates include Rs 35.3 M (US$1.3 M) for taxes and duties on imported
vehicles, equipment a:id materials. Foreign exchange costs would be about
US$85.0 M, or 53%. Cost estimates are based on end-CY83 price levels. Unit
prices for the main and branch canals are based on recent bids for similar work
escalated to end-1983. The cost for NDK Dam Is based on its actual bid price.
Cost estimates for the tertiary irrigation distribution and drainage system are
based on costs of similar facilities being constructed in Systems H and C and
detai'ed layouts for sample areas. Costs of land clearing, on-farm development
and social infrastructure are based on MECA and MEA cost data from other systems,
adjusted to accommodate project conditions. Administration and engineering costs
are based on the construction organization rroposed, which, plus the assistance to
be provided by consultants, amount to about 12% of construction costs. Physical
contingencies were estimated at 10% for the Main and Branch Canals and 15% for
other civil works. Price contingency estimates are based on inflation rates shown
in Table 3.1. Because estimated domestic inflation rates are generally expected
to remain higher than foreign inflation rates, particularly in the early years of
implementation, year-specific exchange rates have been assumed to maintain pur-
chasing power parity. Irrigation O&M costs at full development (1989) are
estimated to average Rs 450/ha (base aosts) or Rs 675/ha including price contin-
gencies. O&M costs for irrigation ard social infrastructure were based on the
operatiotnal organization to be provided and the maintenance schedule to be carried
out annually, including personnel, equipment and materials. Total O&M costs are
estimated at about Rs 30 M annually. The project cost estimates are detailed in
Annex 2 and Tables 3 to 15, and are summarized below:

Implementation Schedule and Settlement Rate
3.32    The project would basically be implemented over five years (1985-89).
However, construction of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal was started in 1983 (with
CIDA financing), and work is scheduled to start on the Main and Branch Canals
in 1985 (with Saudi Fund financing). The detailed survey anid designs for
the tertiary irrigation and drainage system, roads, and social infrastructure
are scheduled to start in early 1984 (Annex 2, Charts 4-5). Settlement would
be by zone and phased with completion of irrigation facilities, but would
precede on-farm development work. Estimated settlement by zone is shown
below:

Financing
3.33    Project cofinancing arrangements are being finalized by GOSL.  The
Saudi Fund for Development has indicated its willingness to provide
US$50.10 M equivalent (about 32% of project cost net of taxes and duties).
CIDA has indicated its intent to contribute about US$40.0 14 equivalent (about
25% of project cost). The above bilateral assistance, combined with the
proposed IDA/Bank contribution of US$42.1 M (IDA credit US$30 M; Bank Loan
US$12.1 M), would finance about 83% of total project costs net of taxes and
duties including 100% of foreign and 64% of local costs, The combined
IBRD//IDA contribution would finance about 26% of the total project cost net
of taxes and duties. The Bank loan would finance in addition the Bank
front-end fee of US$29,925 on a proposed Bank loan of US$12.0 M which would
be capitali2ed into the loan. Remaining requirements (US$28.0 M equivalent)
would be met by GOSL. Satisfactory arrangements for commitments from the
other external project cofinanciers would be a condition of effectiveness for
the Bank Loan/Credit. Assurances were received from GOSL that adequate and
timely funds will be provided for project implementation. Financing of
project components has been agreed tentatively with the prospective
cofinanciers as follows:

and field canals and the drainage facilities (US$11.3 M equivalent) would be
combined into about five packages (US$2 - 3 M equivalent) to attract foreign
competition but would be contracted tlc-ough LCB. These works, because of
their small size and scattered location, are unsuited for ICB; but some
foreign contractors in Sri Lanka may have an interest in such work. There-
fore, on all items procured through local competitive bidding (LCB), foreign
contractors would be eligible to participate. Primary and market roads,

exclusive of final asphalt surfacing, would be incltuded in one contract
(US$8.6 M equivalent) to be awarded following ICB in accordance with Banki
guidelines. Local firms arc expected to be competitive for the Lrrigation
facilities and road contracts. Upgrading of OEM roads to market road stand-
ards, asphalt surfacing of the primary and market roads following constrxc-
tion of other works (US$3.7 M equivalent), and construction of smaller vL1-
lage roads (US$2.8 M equivalent) would be contracted following ICB procedures
acceptable to the Bank.  Land clearing and on-farm development would be done
by both mechanized and manual methods. Clearing to be done mechanicaLly
would be groupedc into contracts of at least US$1.0 M each to be awarded
following LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Work to be done manually
would be divided into snall contracts and awarded in fixed rate contracts to
small local contractors and settlers. Settlement assistance, including
transportation, temporary shelter, housing materials, seeds, seedlings, and
tools would be provided by MEA.  SmalL off-the-shelf items costing less than
US$20,000 per contract that cannot be bulked into packages suiLable for
international tendering or which are required urgently for project implemen-
tation may be procured after solicittation of quotations from at least three
independent suppliers in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Such purchases would be limited to an aggregate of US$0.5 14 equivalent. ALl
work contracts over US$100,000 and equipment contracts over US$50,000 would
be subject to Bank review prior to award. Other contracts would be subject
to selective post-award review. A preference margin of 7.5% D.: civil worlks
contracts and 15% on equipment and vehicles would be extended L. qualified
local manufacturers in bid evaluation.  Taxes and duties on all equipment and
vehicles would be the responsibility of GOSL.
Accounts and Audit
3.36    In view of the difficulties experienced with audit reporting undex
previous Mahaweli Projects and the general lack of adequate record keeping by
MASL, the Bank and GOSL have agreed that all expenditures disbursed on the
basis of statements of expenditure would be audited semi annually instead Af
annually to facilitate disbursement action. MASL has agreed to engage
qualified consultants for establishment and installation of a suitable
accounting system for maintaining records of all Mahaw0li Ganga Develolpnent
Projects. Such assistance would include, inter alia, com?tuter expertise.
GOSL has appointed a local accounting firm to establish a sound accounting
system for all MASL projects and will fund its services oIt of GOSL resour-
ces. Assurances were received from GOSL that MA,SL will: (a) maintain
separate project accounts adequate to reflect the operations, resources, and
expenditures related to the project; (b) have these accounts and financial
statements audited annually by independent auditors acceprable to the Bank
and would submit certilied copies of these audited accounts and auditors'
reports within nine months after the end of each fiscal year; (c) provide
semi-annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors acceptable tx, the
Bank on all expenditures for which reimbursement applications are subnl:ted
without ftull documentation, i.e., on the basis of statements of experiditure ;
(d) ensure that each audit report includes, inter alia, a statement that
funds disbursed against statements of expenditure have been used for the
purposes for whiclh they were provided; and (e) retain up to one year after
credit closing for review by Bank representatives all records (contracts,
orders, invoices, bills, receipts, and other documents) evidencing expendi-
tures claimed for reimbursement by scatements of expenditure.  Semi annual



-25-
audit reports would be submitted within sixty days from the end of each
preceding six-nonth period. Withdrawal applications submitted on this basis
would be certified by the Project Engineer and the Project Accountant. MASL
would submit copies of unaudited annual project accounts to the Bank not
later thaii three months after the end of each fiscal year.;
Disbursements
3.37    Disbursemencs from the proposed loan/credit blend would be as
follows:
(a) Bank front-end fee capitalized into the loan, 100%;
(b) civil works and materials:
(i) irrigation distributary canals and drainage system, 90%;
(ii) land clearing and on-farm development, 90%;
(iii) roads, 90%;
(c) vehicles, equipment, and spare parts:
(i) directly imported, 100% of foreign expenditures;
(ii) locally manufactured, 100% of local expenditures ex-factory;
(iii) other procured locally, 75%;
(d) cashew plantation development, including administrative facilities,
staff costs, land preparation, planting and planting materials, 100%;
(e)  settlement assistance, including settlement camp facilities and
settler assistance inputs, 100%; and
(f)  administration and engineering, 50%.
The following items will be disbursed against statements of expenditures:
(i) civil works under contracts for less than Rs 500,000, (ii) reimbursements
under other contracts for less than the equivalent of US$10,000, (iii) plan-
tation activities (Item (d) above), (iv) settlement assistance, and (v)
administration and engineering.  Disbursements against other contracts for
the equivalent of US$10,000 and above will be documented in accordance with
the Bank's standard requirements. The documentation, including contract
documents for items disbursed against statements of expenditures, will be
retained by MASL at one central location and made available for IDA repre-
sentatives for review on request. All expenditures disbursed on statements
of expenditures will be audited semi annually by independent auditors,
acceptable to the Bank and the documentation will be retained for one year
after Project completion. The Borrower will submit reimbursement applica-
tions only when the amount expended has reached the equivalent of US$20,000
or more. The Bank would finance incremental recurrent expenditures for
project administration and engineering to cover about 50% of MECA and MEA
staff salaries and wages, vehicle O&M, and supplies on a declining basis,
i.e., 75% in the first year, 65X in the second, 50% in the third, 40% in the
fourth, and 30% in the fifth year. To assist in record keeping for contracts
awarded under the project, MASL would submit to the Bank on a rmonthly basis a
register of contracts; this register would be submitted for the duration of
project implementation.  The estimated disbursement schedule of Bank loan/IDA.
credit proceeds Is presented in Annex 2, Table 16. Disbursements would be



-26-
completed by December 1990, about eighteen months after project completion.
These disbursement projections are based on _he standard sectoral disburse-
ment profiles for IDA Credits, deemed aippropriate for a project of this type.
3.38    Project Special Account (Revclving Fund).  To ensure that project
activities are s_arted promptly, the Government would open a Project Special
Account. The initial deposit to be made by IDA in the account would be
equivalent to US$1,000,000. The opening of a Project; Special Account by GOSL
would be made in accordance with Section 2 of the DCA and would be a condi-
tion of credit effectiveness.
Environmental Impact
3.39    Natural vegetation in the project area has gradually been diminished
by encroachment over the last decade, with about 10,000 ha currently under
chena rotation. The remaining tropical dry, mixed evergreen forest covers
about 20,000 ha, principally in the western portion of the projact area.
Although site-specific data are limited, a wide variety of wildlife, includ-
ing endemic and endangered/threatened species, likely occurs within tne area.
The Nelugala jungle corridor, a wildlife reserve, extends through both the RB
and LB areas. Based on a 1982 cabinet decision, this corridor will be
declassified when the areas are required for development. An assurance was
received that all portions of the Nelugala Corridor it the project area will
be declassified before the area is developed. There are currently no sub-
stantial fish populations in the Maduru Oya; however, its coastal estuary
provides breeding grounds for shrimp and commercial fish species. MASL plans
to stock Maduru Oya Reservoir with suitable fish species starting in 1984,
outside the project.
3.40    GOSL has taken an active role in environmental protection and conser-
vation. Throughout the planning and irnpletentation stages of AMDP, GOSL has
continued to seek solutions to potentially significant environmental problems
and to integrate them into overall project development. These efforts cul-
minated in a comprehensive environmental assessment of AMDP financed by
USAID. 1/ This study, finalize' in December 1980, presented a detailed
analysis of the effects of AMDP on the terrestrial, aquatic and human
environments, including an evaluation of cumulative impacts of proposed
irrigation.  The final report concluded that AMDP benefits were justifiable
and needed, although achieving them would necessitate certain unavoidable
adverse effects and resource commitments. The report set forth recommenda-
tions to minimize detrimental impacts, enhance beneficial aspects, and
achieve effective wildlife resource management. GOSL used the study's recom-
mendations as a basis for an AMDP Environmental Plan of Action. The Plan was
comapleted in November 1981 and has been adopted by GOSL as the official guide
for implementing environmentally-related activities in AMDP. The Plan com-
prises a series of components, each of which identifies both recently imple-
mented and proposed plans or activities to address specific environmental
issues. The Plan's components of particular relevance to the proposed
project include:
1/ Carried out by the US firm of Tippets, Abbett, McCarthy and Stratton
(TAMS).



-27-
(a)  Forestry Planning and Management.  Forest clearing is closely con-
trolled in AMDP and is limited only to those areas to be cultivated.
The State Timber Corporation is responsible for clearing but is
regulated by a Technical Subcommittee on Forestry within MASL. Fuel-
wood plantations for all new settlements are planned throughout the
ANDP area. FD provides technical inputs and extension services for
seedling plantations. In addition, conservation forests are planned
for specialized areas to control erosion, protect river banks and
improve wildlife habitats. In this regard, MASL has adopted a
general guideline to establish where possible 200 m-wide protection
forests along banks of rivers and streams.
(b)  Wildlife Conservation.  The Plan calls for a series of wildlife
reserves within and ;-.jacent to AMDP areas.  A two-phased plan is
proposed, first focu6ing on establishment of reserve and park bound-
aries and preparation of management plans. During the second phase,
management plans would be implemented to include creation of buffer
zones, habitat enrichment, construction of park infrastructure,
wildlife monitoring, establishment of a wildlife training and conser-
vation center, and overall upgrading of the Department of Wildlife
Conservation (DWLC).  DWLC is responsible for implementing this
program and managing new parks. This program is being funded by
USAID (US$5.0 M) and GOSL (US$1.9 M).
(c)  Water Resources Research and Monitoring.  MASL plans to establish
a Water Resources Research and Monitoring Unit to carry out a water
quality monitoring program and coordinate relevant studies involving
control of aquatic weeds, mangrove conservation, river discharge
monitoring, and monitoring wetland resources.  MASL is supporting
initial research involving wetland ecology, weed infestation, and
preliminary water quality sampling, with equipment provided under the
USAID-financed LB Project.
(d)  Health Care and Sanitation Planning.  A comprehensive health care
program is currently being inplemented with external financing in
System H, System C and System B LB. The national anti-malaria cam-
paign is also being extended to new settlements in the AMDP area.
3.41    Mitigation and Protection Measures for the Project Area.  Principal
negative environmental impacts anticipated with the project would be (a)
reduction of natural vegetation; (b) concomitant loss of wildlife; (c) chan-
ges in water quality and quantity with regard to agro-chemical runoff,
nutrient cycling patterns, and salinity intrusion in the downstream estuary;
and (d) potential spread of communicable water-borne and vector diseases. To
mitigate these, a number of interventions would be included under the project
or are being carried out through complementary programs. First, sufficient
fuelwood plantations (2,000 ha) would be developed to meet settler needs and
conservation forests would be established under the project. Secondly, a
water quality monitoring program currently underway would be strengthened.
rTirdly, adequate health facilities would be provided for settlers as part
of the project and would be enhanced through ongoing UNDP-assisted programs
providing safe wells and latrines in settlements. Fourthly, the Mahaweli
Environment ProjecL is sufficiently comprehensive to minimize and mitigate



-2 8-
adverse impacts on wildlife. In addition, part of the existing Omunugala
Forest Reserve has been recommended for inclusion in the Maduru Oya National
Park as a possible trade-off for the declassification of the Nelugala
Corridor. Finally, project development would be in consonance with the needs
of the people of Sri Lanka by providing settlement oppor'tunities on well
developed agricultural lands with adequate social infrastructure to enhance
the quality of life of settlers.
IV.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (M4ASL)
4.01    MASL, established under the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act of
1979, is responsible for implementing the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program
in specially designated areas, including System B. It is empowered to estab-
lish corporations or other operational entities and to take any steps con-
sidered necessary to implement development in such areas. MASL is controlled
by five directors, three appointed by the Minister of Mahaweli Development,
with the Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance and Mahaweli Development
Member Directors ex-officio. One of the appointees is selected to be
Director-General and Chief Executive of MASL. MASL has overall respon-
sibility for coordinating project implementation and its subsequent manage-
ment (Annex 3, Chart 1). Actual execution of such work is carried out
through the two MASL operational agencies described below (paras 4.02 and
4.03).
Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency (MECA)
4.02    MECA is responsible for the planning, design, and construction of ;all
project civil works, including irrigation and drainage, roads, buildings, and
public service facilities. MECA organizational divisions include Design and
Construction, Finance and Administration, and Personnel and Training, with
Project Directors for each project (Annex 3, Chart 3). MECA is staffed with
well-qualified personnel but currently its professional and technical staff
are nearly fully committed to ongoing development projects in the Mahaweli
Canga Basin. Consequently, it would be necessary to provide Technical Assis-
tance to MECA for preparing the final plan and designs and for construction
supervision of RB project facilities. MASL would select the cot.sultants
provided for, and MECA would direct and supervise the consultants'
activities.
Mahaweli Economic Agency (MEA)
4.03    MEA is responsible for post-construction implementation of projects,
including settlement, land development and allocation, on-farm development,
water management, agricultural credit, production, marketing and extension,
operation and maintenance of the irrigation system, and development and
management of community and business infrastructure. A member of the board
of directors of MASL is the Chief Executive Officer (Managing Director) of
MEA. MEA's head office is located in Colombo where the Managing Director is
assisted by four Managers (Finance & Administration; Community Services;
Production, Credit, & Marketing; and Investment & Business Development).
They are supported by Directors of Irrigation & Power, Settlement, Planning 6    >
Monitoring, and the Resident Project Managers. A Project Coordinator serves



-29-
as a link between the Resident Project Managers in the field and Directors
and other Managers at tne MEA Head Office, and other Colombo-based (service)
organizations.
4.04    The Resident Project Manager for System B RB would be stationed at
Meyankolla in Zone 8. He would have a Deputy Resident Project Manager (DPM)
to assist him with specialist officers in the functional areas of O&M and
water management, agriculture and lands, community and business development,
and marketing and credit. The project area would be divided into six blocks,
each area serving 2,000-2,500 farm families. Each block area would have 8-10
unit areas, each supporting 250-275 farm families. There would be 54 units
in the project. The Block Manager would also provide technical support to
Unit Managers. The organizational structure proposed for the project is
shown in Annex 3, Charts 3-4.
4.05    Settlement Services.  Supply of agricultural inputs and marketing of
produce from the Project area would be coordinated by the Manager of Produc-
tion, Credit & Marketing. lie would coordinate with existing organizations
such as Paddy Marketing Board, Cooperative Wholesale Establishment,
Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies and the private sector marketing
entities. He would also assist commercial banking institutions in all
aspects of rural credit, including agricultural production and investment
credit.
4.06    Farm Machinery Hire Service.  MEA would operate a farm machinery hire
service primarily to meet an anticipated farm power gap until farmers acquire
sufficient animal and machine power to cultivate their lands. These services
would be controlled by a Mechanical Engineer in the project O&N section.
4.07  .Plantation and Grazing Lands Establishment and Management   About
3,000 ha of out-of-command unirrigated lands not required for settler
residential facilities would be developed as fuelwood and conservation plan-
tations by MEA and FD. Cashew plantations would also be developed on 2,000
unirrigated ha acquired and cleared by MEA and developed by the Sri Lanka
Cashew Corporation (SLCC). During implementation, MEA and SLCC would explore
the feasibility and modalities of establishing mini-cashew estates of about
15-20 ha each for private entrepreneurs, with technical assistance provided
from SLCC. Communal pasture grounds would be developed around hamlet areas
by MEA for grazing of settler livestock. The DPM (Agricultura) would have
overall responsibility for plantation and grazing land development with
assistance of a Forest Department (FD) officer.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.08    Fertilizer supplies required would be obtained from the Ceylon Fer-
tilizer Corporation. Six regional fertilizer depots are being established in
Sri Lanka along railway lines, including one in Badulla that would serve the
project area. Fertilizers from its plant in Colombo or from imported sto A
would be blended in depots, bagged, and dispatched to district warehouseb as
required. MEA would build and operate a fertilizer store in the project area
and would operate retail outlets in townships and villages. Pesticides are
imported as finished products and are usually bought by farmers from outlets
supplying fertilizers. Seeds (paddy, naize, soybeans, and 1ulses) are
produced under supervision of the Department of Agriculture and sold througTh



MEA.  Since the project does not require special seed varieties, norimal seed
supply channels would readily satisfy demand.  MEA, however, wotuld ensure
adequate availability of seeds and woulid use proposed fertilizer outlets for
their distribution.  Seedlings and cuttings for tree crops would be produced
in the project area from rxiaterial provided by the Minor IExport Crops Research
Institute at Matale.  The proposed training center near Aralaganwila would
produce planting materials. Agricultural research would consist principally
of adaptive research for tlhe project area. Findings from regional research
stations would be tested in the area's research farm at the Aralaganwila
Training Center and Farm. This farm would also provide seasonal traininig for
all grades of extension workers and would demonstrate recommended cropping
sequences, cultural practices, and other techniques pertainirng to improved
farm activities. Babic research relevant to the project area is currently
being carried out at Malha Illupallama (dry zone irrigated crop lhusbandry) and
Batalagoda (paddy breeding).
Project Design and Construction
4.09    Assistance in the preparation of final designs and bidding documents
and in the supervision of project civil works construction would be provided
by consultants to MECA. Final designs and tender documents for NDK Dam and
Feeder Canal, and Main and Branch Canals have been completed. Construction
of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal is underway with CIDA financing, and consultants
assigned by CIDA are assisting MECA in construction supervision. A consult-
ing firm, financed and approved by the Saudi Fund, would be selected to
assist MECA in calling and evaluating bids and in supervising construction of
Main and Branch Canals. A separate consulting firm, financed and approved by
CIDA, would be selected to assist NECA in the preparation of final designs
and bidding documents; in calling, evaluating and awarding bids; and in
construct:'on supervision of the remaining civil works. This firm would be
responsible to CIDA for procurement of CIDA-financed equipment and would also
assist MECA in procurement of vehicles financed by the Bank.
Operation and Maintenance
4.10    A Water Management Panel has been set up under tthe Director General,
MASL to allocate Mahaweli Ganga water for irrigation, power, and other uses
and to apportion irrigation water among the various Mahaweli irrigation
projects. Bulk water issues to each project Would be made by a water manage-
ment secretariat set up under MASL and attached to MECA, which would operate
and maintain major canals and irrigation structures. This would include
water releases to and from Maduru Oya Reserve,,r, to NDK Reservoir, and to the
project RB Main Canal to serve the project area. MEA would be responsible
for O&M of the irrigation and drainage system, social and administrative
infrastructure, and village roads. DPM (Irrigation) would operate and con-
trol water deliveries in the main and branch canals to each block. The Water
Management Supervisor in each block office would be charged with making water
issues as needed to distribution canals. The Water Management Assistant
(WMA) t the unit level would assist farmers within each turnout area (averag-
ing about 12 farmers each) to distribute water equitably on rotation.  He
would be responsible for communicating water requirements and management
information to farmers and for recommending farmers for participation in
periodic training programs. He would also organize turnout groups and guide
them in maintaining field ditches and drains. The maintenance section under



-31-
the DPM wculd be responsible for maintaining the irrigation system down to
iarm turniouts and would carry out a regular maintenance program so that
complete system coverage would be achieved at least once every two years.
MECA would be called upon to make any major repairs or modifications required
to major stru'tures. Water Management Supervisors and Agricultural Officers
(AO) at block level would review block water requirements at least weekly,
and this information would be conveyed to the D1PM by Block Managers. The
operations section would then adjust water issues within the system according
to reported needs and rainfall.  MEA would serve as an enforcement as well as
advisory agenicy to ensure irrigation water is used efficiently by farmers and
that unauthorizeC' water diversions do not occur.
4.1l    Project.-constructed primary and market roads when completed would be
turned over to the Highway Depar;ment for management and maintenance.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12    A monitoring and evaluation unit in MEA would be responsible for (a)
assessing project implementation performance and (b) carrying out and coor-
dinating proposed evaluations. The monitoring unit would also have respon-
sibility for similar reviews under other Mahaweli projects and for e.tab-
lishing general evaluation standards and criteria.  In addition, at the field
level the Project Manager would have a small monitoring staff linked to the
headquarters unit. Finally, moniitoring of water management, irrigation
deliveries, and system losses would be the responsibility of the water
management staff in the office of the DPM, under the direct supervision of a
senior irrigation engineer; a special unit would be established for this
purpose. Assurances were received that XASL will iraplement a monitoring and
evaluation program for the projecs in consonance with ongoing monitoring and
evaluation activities in othier Mahaweli projects.
Aralaganwila Irrigation Training Center and Farm
4.13    This Center would be the focal point of project staff and settler
training and would provide facilities and staff necessary for the various
training programs proposed under the project. It would also mainitain an
Adaptive Research Farm for System B. The Center would be headed by a resi-
dent Principal having experience in agriculture, adult education, and
administration.  The senior Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) .n the office of
DPM (Agriculture) and an operations officer in the office of the DPM (Irriga-
tion and Water Management) would coordinate with the Principal in developing
cropping and water management trials to be carried out on the 250 ha farm
associated with the Center. The Farm would be developed for both paddy and
diversified irrigated cropping, and various types of irrigation systems
provided under the project would be installed for training and research
purposes. Short courses would be arranged regularly in agriculture, water
management, and community development. Annual orientation seminars would
also be held for MEA non-technical staff and for farmer-settlers.



-32-
4.14    Agricultural Training Courses
(a) Two seven-day training courses would be organized before each main
crop?ing season for area agricultural staff. Apart from Center
staff, instructors would be SMSs attached to the DPM (Agriculture)
office and participating AOs.
(b) About 300 contact farmers would also receive pre-season train- ing
for about two days. arranged to overlap with training provided for
agricultural staff.
(c)  Field days would be held for farmer groups throughout the growing
seasons to demonstrate particular cultural practices.
4.15    Water Management Training Courses
(a)  In view of the importance of efficient water use to the success of
the Mahaweli Program, water management training would be compulsory
for all MEA staff involved in agriculture or irrigation system opera-
tion. Irrigation engineers and Water Management Supervisors would
attend (i) a basic training course lasting about four weeks, includ-
ing about 10 days of field work, and (ii) periodic refresher ses-
sions. WMAs would undergo two weeks of basic training in water
management practices before posting and would receive additional
training at six-month intervals. Instructors would be senior irriga-
tion staff, outside lecturers, and consultants.
(b) Farmer training in efficient water management practices, ope- rating
rules, and other related fields would be a priority of of MEA and the
Center. The objective would be to have as many area farmers as
possible eventually undergo a two-week training program at the
Irrigation Training Center, during which they would review thoroughly
technical and regulatory aspects of water management and would learn
by using the various irrigation facilities provided at the Training
Center Farm.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES,
FARM INCOME, AND COST RECOVERY
Agricultural Development with the Project
5.01    About 14,000 ha in System B RB would receive irrigation water with
the project (Zones 6-8). In addition to this new irrigation capability, the
project would provide a more assured water supply to the older Punanai
settlement-irrigation scheme for about 1,800 ha (net) thereby allowing higher
cropping intensity than possible without project investments. Out-of-command
areas would be developed for fuelwood and cashew plantations and grazing
areas.
5.02    Irrigated Area.  About 88% of the newly irrigated area in Zone 6-8
would be placed under a double-cropped paddy rotation with 100% cropping
intensity expected in the maha and 80% on the yala by full development.
Approximately half of the cropped area under paddy would be transplanted.



-33-
Maha plantings, beginning in mid-October, would be with 3.5-4.0 month
varieties. Yala plantings, completed by mid-April would require 3.0-3.5
month varieties to allow a July harvest. Such a cropping schedule would
ensure optimal utilization of rainfall and, therefore, of supplemental
irrigation water. About 1,700 ha net (12%) upland area would be under
soybeans, vegetables, pulses, citrus tree crops, and coconut. About 1,800 ha
under the Punanai tank scheme would receive more assured water and would
continue growing paddy with the project; average cropping intensity in this
tank area would increase from 100% (currently and without the project) to
180% (Annex 1, Chart 1).
5.03    Homeplots and Plantations.  About 3,200 unirrigated ha in Zones 6-8
would be utilized for settler homestead plots. Homestead plots are expected
to produce a variety of agricultural commodities both for on-farm consumption
and off-farm sales. About 2,000 ha of out-of-command area would be placed
under fuelwood plantations so that by full development all home fuel needs
would be locally produced, either on these plantations or on homeplots.
Another 2,000 ha would be allocated for cashew development.
Future Development without the Project
5.04    At present the project area supports about 2,000 ha of chena cultiva-
tion annually. 1/ In addition, Zones 6-8 contain a number of minor tanks
supplying about 600 ha with supplemental maha irrigation and about 2,000 of
rainfed floodplain maha paddy cultivation. This land-use regime is expected
to remain constant in the future without the project, reflecting current
population sparsity and irrigation constraints likely to continue for the
near-term.
Yields and Production
5.05    Annex 5, Table 1 summarizes present and projected cropped area,
yields, and production. Paddy yields at full development are anticipated to
average 4.6 tons/ha (see para 1.11). With-project yield estimates are based
on the nature of area soils, experience in similar regions of Sri Lanka, and
anticipated success in implementing rigorous water management and improved
agricultural extension under the project. Reflecting assumed continuation of
present chena levels without the project, annual dryland production of about
2,000 tons (in maize terms) 2/ would be foregone. In addition, without the
project, about 12,700 tons of paddy would be produced yearly within the
Punanai system, within minor tank command areas, and on floodplains. In
contrast, with the project, an estimated 116,700 tons of paddy would be
generated annually, implying an increment of 104,000 tons. On upland
irrigated soils, each year about 2,740 tons of cowpeas, soybeans, and
vegetables, as well as 1.9 M coconuts and 2.6 M tons citrus would be
produced. Full development production would be reached in 1993 (paddy and
1/ About 10,000 ha are under chena rotation in Zones 6-8, with about 20%
under cultivation each year.
2/ Maize has been used as the representative chena crop in the
without-project case.



-34-
other annuals) and in 1995/96 (perennials). Total incremental rice, 70,700
tons, the project's principal commodity, would equal about 5% of 1980-82
average production nationwide and 41% of average annual rice imports over the
same perlod. By 1991, project fuelwood plantations would be produci:rg about
48,000 m3 p.a. (@ 120 m3 in a six-year rotation), and by 1996, cashew planta-
tions would reach full production, 1,000 tons raw nuts (200 tons of kernels),
at an assumed yield of 0.5 tons/ha p.a. Lastly, by 1990, RB area waterbodies
would produce 400 tons of fisli each year through the project's waterbody
seeding activities.
Marketing and Pricing of Project Output
5.06    Paddy Marketing and Pricing.  Developmerits since 1978 in the paddy
and rice marketing sector have reflected GOSL's attempt to extricate itself
from the costly obligations of directly guaranteeing food supplies and of
subsidizing retail prices. In January 1978, ration privileges were withdrawn
from about 50% of the population, which led to an abrupt expansion of private
rice marketing. Concomitant with ration program reform was the introduction
of the Food Stamp Scheme (FSS). Under FSS, eligible families (family income
of Rs 300/month or less) receive food stamps that can be used to purchase
rice and other food commodities. Administered prices for these commodities
have since been raised closer co the goal of cost-plus levels. While these
1978-79 reforms at first enabled a move toward a system that truly benefited
needy familie- and compensated them for higher costs of basic food items,
failure to .ate FSS eligibility lists has resulted in the exclusion of some
nec'       -es.  GOSL is currently considering FSS amendments, including
ined~.    nefits and reducing the nuamber of recipients.
5.07    The shift to the private sector has had major implications not only
for the share of harvest passing through public sector agencies, the Paddy
Marketing Board (PMB) and the Food Departmerit, but also for the roles that
each plays. In general, GOSL's policy objective has beerr to expand tthe role
of the private sector while concentrating public sector activities on stabi-
lizing the market within acceptable limits of seasonal price variation.
Critical to the success of such policies is the setting of a range between
floor and ceiling prices to provide adequate scope to the private sector
without adversely affecting producer or consumer interests. GOSL last
increased the Guaranteed Price S_-heme (GPS) paddy price by 9% to
Rs 62.5/bushel (Rs 2,995/ton) during the 1982/83 maha season, about 87% of
the end-CY83 import parity price.
5.08    Rice Imports.  Over the last decade, rice imports averaged 360,000
tons p.a., representing about 29% of consumption. Since 1978, imports have
been decreasing steadily as domestic rice production increased, in part due
to start of Mahaweli scheme production. In 1982, however, poor weather
conditions reduced domestic paddy production to 2.16 M tons--a 3% reduction
from the preceding year; rice imports in 1982 totalled 156,000 tons. A
bumper 1982-83 maha harvest of 1.79 M tons has led the Food Department to
reduce rice import projections for 1983 to 100,000 tons, or approximately 7%
of consumption; failure of the 1983 southwest monsoon (yala) is likely to
make this estimate of needed imports optimistic. Despite considerable suc-
cess in boosting paddy production, population growth, higher per capita
consumption, need to establish buffer stocks, and climatic vagaries are



-35-
expected to keep Sri Lanka a marginal net rice importer for the balance of
the decade (para 1.04).
5.09    Paddy Storage and Milling.  PMB currently has about 335,500 tons of
rited storage capacity and owns 28 rice mills with a capacity of 181,000 tons
p.a.  To supplement its own capacity, PMB maintains a register of about 400
"quota mills," having aggregate capacity of about 600,000 tons, that mill PMB
paddy for administered fees and reimbursement for handling and transport
expenses. In addition, there are approximately 1,500 mills operated by
private traders that buy and sell in the open market and also custom mill for
consumers. In 1982 these mills had approximately 1.2 M tons p.a. capacity--
implying a capability of handling about two-thirds of that year's paddy crop.
Private mills vary in capacity and quality from units comparable with rela-
tively large-scale quota mills to small hullers at village-level able to
process about 200 kg/hr. Past curtailment of capital goods imports led to
significant obsolescence, breakdown, and consequent poor milling quality ini
both the public and private sectors. Private units often lacked cleaners,
separators, and graders. With import liberalization in 1977, increased
availability of machinery and spares has enabled the private sector to assume
the slack created with curtailment of PMB-Food Department activities in
1978-79.  The recently increased role of the private sector has led to a
significant underutilization of PMB milling capacity; in 1982 PMB utilized
only about 10% of its rated capacity. It was expected several years ago that
with further privatization, PMB would lease unused capacity to private
entrepreneurs; to date this has not occurred as many PMB mills were too
large, poorly maintained, or located away fron prime growing areas. PM4B has
recently initiated a program to close down its most obsolescent plants.
5.10    USAID and other donors are financing projects designed to increase
and upgLade rice milling and storage capacity in Sri Lanka. 1/ Because of
ongoing modernization projects, current capacity underutilizations, and
considerable local capital available for such investments, only one small
milling unit (2 tons/hr) and 12,000 tons of transient storage, both financed

5.11    Cashew Marketing and Processi.ng.  Over the last decade, GOSL has
placed emphasis on cashew development because of its export potential and the
significant unsatisfied local market. While small-scale cashew cultivation
has existed in Sri Larka for some time, large-scale commercial production
started only in 1968. In 1973, the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation (SLCC) was
formed to take over large-scale cashew estates begun in 1968, encourage
smallholder cultivation, engage in processing and marketing, and establish
quality controls for exports. SLCC currently operates nine major plantati.ons
with a total of 3,500 ha, ranging in size from 50 to 2,400 ha.  In addition,
SLCC administers a smallholder assistance scheme under which free seedlings
and planting subsidies are provide& to growers. SLCC likewise maintains

purchasing centers in principal production areas, relies on private agents
to purchase from private growers, and runs a center near Colombo to process
its own and purchased raw nuts. In addition, a number of private dealers/
exporters engage in cashew trade, including one firm with a 2,000 ton p.a.
facility within the Free Trade Zone. Currently, this facility is coln-
siderably underutilized for lack of raw materials. Relatively labor-
intensive technology is employed for cashew processing in Sri Lanka.
5.12    Estimation of cashew production in Sri Lanka is difficult due to the
dispersed, garden-type nature of a major portion of private cultivation.
Also, production data are somewhat misleading since only about 28Y of SLCC's
plantation area is planted and mature. SLCC, however, has made estimates of
total cashew area at 4,600 ha, about 24% under private control. Cashew
production is roughly estimated at about 1,000 tons of raw nuts (200 tons of
kernels), representing a very minor shato of world production. World market
conditions have be,un to improve after k brief disruption caused by tem-
porary, but relatively significant, sales by India onto the worLd markets in
lieu of established barter arrangements. This was reflected in the 1981 drop
in Sri Lanka's export earnings from cashews by 12% to Rs 64.6 M. The
project's annual production of 1,000 tons of raw nuts (200 tons of kernels)
would allow about a doubling of current production. This incremental quan-
tity, however, should present no marketing difficulty for the longer term
in view of growing local demand, projected growth in international demand
(particularly from higher income countries) and apparent international con-
sumer preference for the Asian cashew on grounds of flavor and quality.
5.13    Other Agricultural Activities.  A variety of traditional cash and
staple crops would be grown on the remaining cropped area under the project.
Incremental output of these commodities can easily be absorbed through farm
family consumption, in local and domestic urban markets, and in export trade
(soybeans, citrus, coconut). With anticipated population growth anrd increase
in real income, there should be an assured market for residual commoditi4s
not exported. Should temporary, localized gluts arise, thereby depressing
farmgate prices, upland farmers would have sufficient crop alternatives to
maintain estimated farm incomes (paras 5.14-5.15). About 0.5 M m3 of fuel-
wood would be produced each year from fuelwood plantations in out-of-command
areas to provide local settlers with basic fuel requirements. Along with
cashew development, the project's fuelwood plantations would be in consonance
with Sri Lanka's agro-forestry program.
Farm Income
5.14    Project impact on family incomes was analyzed both for new settler
families acquiring one ha of irrigated land and a 0.2 ha houseplot with the
project and for existing farm families within the older Punanai settlement
scheme 1/ achieving higher cropping intensities through greater and more
assured water supplies. The representative farmer-settler is assumed to
receive both lowland (0.88 ha) and upland (0.12 ha) agricultural land alloca-
tions in addition to an unirrigated houseplot. While without-project incones
of prospective settlers would vary significantly depending on individual

circumstances, most would be landless families and those operating sub
economic holdings and would qualify for the FSS 1/; for illustrative pur-
poses, a representative without-project seasonal income of Rs 3,600 p.a. has
been assumed in addition to public assistance of Rs 1,460 p.a. Net family
income estimates include remuneration for family labor and'management.
Income projections also reflect: (a) projected paddy, soybean, and fer-
tilizer financial price increases; and (b) water charge and land payment
regimes discussed in paras 5.21-5.24. Inputs -ind outputs have been valued
according to projected financial prices expres6ed in constant end-CY83 prices
as specified in Annex 6, Table 1. Table 5.1 presents two estimates of net
farm incomes: (a) full development levels; and (b) annualized levels basi-
cally to adjust for initial build-up periods. Annex 6, Tables 2-3 provide
further assumptions and give illustrative 20-year profiles of net farm income
and project rent. 2/

tive potential of irrigation land. New settlers would realize about a 280%

examined. In effect, most of the increment can be viewed as a catching up by
the currently disadvantaged to tliose farmers operating fully irrigated land.
Farm families wichin the Punanai tank system wouLd continue deriving rela-
tively higher incomes without thle project stemMilng from their larger holding
and irrigation capability during the maha season.  Ihowever, with project
investments in additional irrigation infrastructure, agricultural extension,
and other supporting services, cropping intensities are expected to Trise by
80% and yields are projected to increase by 100% in both growing seasons.
With graduation to major irrigation schene status (intensities orer 150%),
beneficiaries within the Punanai scheme would be expected to pay water
charges towards scheme O&M.  Even with sucih charges, existing farmers are
expected to enjoy increased income averaging 240% with the project.
Cost Recovery/Impact on Government Budget
5.16    A fundamental objective of the Mahaweli Program is establishment of a
viable and sustainable socio economic environment for a large portion of the
poor within Sri Lankan society.  SettLers are selected for project areas fron
applicants whose current earning potential and agricultural holdings, if any,
are judged inadequate.  They tend to come from areas experiencing overpopuLa-
tion and high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Without the
Mahaweli Scheme, therefore, the bulk of applicants would likely be burdens
to the government budget since they would qualify for food and/or other
assistance payments. With the project, this public subsidy would be reduced,
and saved resources could be reallocated to satisfy other national priorities
(para 5.18).
5.17    Investment and Recurrent Costs.  Investment costs of project
works--NDK Dam and Feeder Canal (prorated), irrigation and drainage
infrastructure, land development, roads, social and administrative
infrastructure, equipment, settlement assistance, monitoring, training,
plantation development, and technical assistance--would amount to about
Rs 2,204 M in present value (PV) terns. 1/ 2/  Irrigation infrastructure and
land development would represent about 69% of this total.  Recurrent expenses
for project works O&M would amount to about Rs 227 M (PV).  Thus, the RV of
investment and recurrent costs over the 25-year time profile studied woLild
total about Rs 2,431 M.
5.18    Reduced Public Assistance.  At a rate of about Rs 120/family/moath,
about Rs 129 n (PV) would be saved in public assistance with the project,
assuming continuation of the food stamp scheme or another comparable pTogram
that would be available to finance other budgetary requirements.
5.19    Sales of Agro-Forestry Products.  Fuelwood and cashew plantations
would be established by the FD (fuelwood) and SLCC (cashews) on behaLf of

MASL. At harvest, wood would be sold at public depots to meet local settler
fuel requirements, and cashews would be processed and sold onto domestic and
export markets. Revenues would in turn flow into the State exchequer to
cover budgetary obligations. Wood and cashew sales are projected to generate
Rs 32 K anid Rs 45 M (PV), respectively, in gross revenues.
5.20    Direct Recoveries--General.  Cost recovery in irrigation projects in
Sri Lanka, particularly involving direct water charges, has generally not
been successful to date, despite protracted dialogue between GOSL and the
Bank on the subject. The administration that came to power in 1977 made an
attempt to reactivate earlier laws and promulgate suitable legislation to tax
irrigation beneficiaries anid generate revenues. Recovery of land improvement
costs and costs of O&M of irrigation works was to be carried out under the
Sale of State Lands Law of 1973 and the Land Betterment Law of 1977; under
the latter, land betterment c!larges or water charges could be levied taking
into account amount and dependability of water supplies, agricultural produc-
tion increases, and capital and O&M costs. Unfortunately, neither of these
laws could be implemented effectively as a series of technical and procedural
problems arose which defied resolution; they were therefore dropped in 1978
as a basis for cost recovery. The Government then attempted to reintroduce
provisions for cost recovery through water charges under the Irrigation
Ordinance of 1946, as amended in 1968. It also provided for land ownership
transfer to settlers upon payment of costs of land improvements under the
Land Development Ordinance of 1936, as amended in 1981. These laws have
nationiwide coverage.
5.21    Water Charges.  Under the Irrigation Ordinance, GOSL was empowered
to impose water charges towards recovery of capital and O&M costs of irriga-
tion systems.  In 1978, charges were set at Rs 75/ha in major schemes (com-
prising 80 ha or more) with cropping intensities of over 150% and at Rs 50/ha
for schemes with croppinig intensities of 150% or less. 1/ Water charges were
assessed and some collections made in certain schemes during 1978-80, but
lack of an effective enforcement mechanism and failure of many farmers to pay
led to collapse of the program and cessation of any collections from 1981 to
the present. In early 1981 extensive dialogue was held between the Bank and
GOSL on cost recovery during negotiations for the IDA-financed Mahaweli
Project III in an attempt to introduce Mahaweli Basin-specific water charges
and collections on the grounds that nationwide covenants, including provi-
sions for rate anhancemnents agreed to under previous projects (Mahaweli II
and Tank Irrigation Modernization Projects), were not being follow%d. Under
Mahaweli III, water charges were to be collected in Mahaweli Scheme areas
starting in September 1982 at a level equivalent to 22% of expected O&M costs
and rising to 100% of such costs by 1991. No action was taken in 1982
because of the politically sensitive nature of water charges in the 1982
elections and because of the drought conditions which prevailed during the
earlier 1981-82 inaha season. The Irrigation Ordinance also proved
problematical for implementing a water charge program, partly because of an
unsatisfactory legal basis for enforcement and for lack of funds and a viable
1/  Such rates were estimated in 1981 to cover but a fraction of O&K
costs--about 25% under major tanks and only 15% under the more complex
Mahaweli schemes.



-40-
collection mechanism.  To remedy these deficiencies, Government (a) estab-
lished a Cabinet-levul panel to recommend a reasonable basis for such co! *c-
tions, and (b) throu!,h amendments to the Irrigation Ordinance (i) approved
reintroduction of magistrare court jurisdiction to streamline legal action
against water char!,e payment defaulters, and (ii) empowered 'Zovernment Agents
to repair damaged irrigation works and recover costs from offenders.
5.22    In July 1983, the Cabinet approved the recommendations of the
Cabinet-level panel, including implementation of nationwide annual water
charge collection at the foJ lowing rates: Rs 2,000/ha for major lift irriga-
tion projects, Rs 688/ha for drainage, and Rs 500/ha for gravity irrigation
to cover current average O&M costs. The Cabinet also approved special
advance accounts for 0&M works into which revenues collected would be
credited. To begin the program and phase collections concomitantly with
improved O&M servicing, GOSL has proposed that 50% of such rates be collected
initially (1984) with progressive increase of 20% of the balance per year
until full rates are collected in five years. Thereafter, as permitted under
the Irrigation Ordinance, rates would be reviewed periodically and enhanced
to accommodate any cost escalation. Approval of this program represents a
major step forward, emanating certainly from recognition of past inadequacies
of resource mobilization and increasing O&M requirements for irrigation
works. For the major irrigation schemes under the Mahaweli Program, MASL
proposes to start water charge collection with the harvest of the 1983-84
maha crop (April-June 1984). Advertising of these proposed rates has already
beeii been carried out in all local newspapers and on the radio, and MASL
proposes further publicity and farmer education. MASL has almost eompleted
necessary revisions to specification registers and other documentation, begun
in June 1983, and has finalized designation and instruction of rate collec-
tors to enable water charge collection to begin on schedule. MASL has
promised to communicate with IDA regarding progress in these interim steps
during the months ahead. It has also agreed to provide a collection report
to the Bank once colleci:ions start. Assurances were received from GOSL that
such water charge collection reports will be submitted annually by July of
each year to the Bank and that GOSL will take appropriate actions to inten-
sify collection efforts in case collection performance proves unsatisfactory.
5.23    While GOSL intends in its collection program firstly to set a defined
nominal recovery goal, based on estimated 1983 OEM costs, to be reached by a
specified date (1988) and secondly to phase increases in water charges in
tandem with needed improvements to O&M servicing of irrigation systems,
significant erosion of real value of water charges is likely in future. At
projected inflation rates, the target of Rs 500/ha in 1988/89 would lose
about 38% of its real value, and assuming 0&n costs rise with general infla-
tion, adjustments will be required to close the gap between charges and
average costs and to comply with previously agreed IDA covenants. Toward
this end, it was agreed with GOSL that a mid-term review will be held by July
1986 to assess the success of the water charge collection program, to examine
the degree to which current rates cover annual O&M costs, and to propose a
program for rate enhancements to enable recovery of full annual O&M costs by
or before 1991. About Rs 44 M (PV) in water charges would be recovered from
project beneficiaries with implementation of the current rate regime proposal



-41-
and with enhancement to Rs 500 in real terms by 1991. Until such time as the
recovery of full O&M costs is attained, it was agreed that GOSL annually will
provide the funds necessary for adequate O&M of the irrigation systems.
5.24    Land Transfers.  Land transfers have yet to begin within areas,
although a formalized program of farm boundary demarcation began in System H
in January 1983 as a prerequisite to such transfers. KASL has reemphasized
its desire to implement this transfer program and to recover land improvement
costs from settlers. Under Mahaweli III, for example, GOSL agreed to recover
costs of settlement assistance, and clearing, on-farm development, field
canals, arid field drains. Under the Land Development Ordinance, such trans-
fer payments were to be made over a ten-year payment period at 4% p.a. inter-
est, 1/ preceded by three years of probationary grace. To reduce the impact
of these payments on new settlers, particularly in initial years, and to
accommodate more moderate growth in projected rice prices since Mahaweli III
appraisal estimates, MASL is now considering a payment plan involving
graduated payments. Although such collections within System C area are not
yet due since settlement activities have just begun, MASL proposes in System
H to (a) complete necessary farm surveys by end-1985, (b) finish preparation
of land alienation registers (begun in February 1983), (c) issue permits by
end-June 1984, and (d) begin land payment collection in April 1985. A
similar exercise would be carried out concurrently for System C. Assurances
were received at negotiations that such a program would be implemented by
GOSL. For System B RB, assurances were received from GOSL that it will
implement in the project area of a program satisfactory to the Bank for the
transfer of rights to protect beneficiaries of land improved under the
project in accordance with an installment plan and at rates sufficient to
recover the costs of settlement assistance (housing materials, tools, and
seed/seedling materials), land clearing, on-farm development, field canals,
field drains, and any other improvements agreed to between COSL and the Bank.
It was agree, that GOSL will inform prospective settlers of the proposed land
tmAnsfer price and payment terms before they physically settle on the land.
Based on (a) Rs 27,500 per ha for on-farm works and settlement assistance;
(b) a payment program involving 10 years, 4% p.a. interest, initial payment
of Rs 2,500 and gradually increasing payments; and (c) an interest-free
probationary grace period of three years, land transfer payments would total
Rs 62 M (PV) in real terms.
5.25    COSL budgetary 'nflows and outflows discussed above are presented in
a 25-year time profile in AnneA 6, Table 4, and are summarized in Table 5.2
below. Table 5.2 demonstrates that about 13% of total costs wpuld be
recovered through the project. This level of recovery is considered
reasonable in view of (a) the low-income base of most beneficiaries without
the project, (b) the erosive impact of relatively high projected domestic
inflation on the real value of land installment payments and (c) the histori-
cal difficulties in implementing cost recovery schemes in Sri Lanka. 2/ In
1/ The highest rate of interest Dermitted by law for such transfers.
2/ About 10% and 11% of incremental income and project rent, respectively,
would be collected annually during the land transfer payment period (new
settlers).



-42-
addition, inflows from land transfer payments and revenues from plantation
output are generated well into the period, significantly reducing their
contributions to the total inflow in PV terms. The landl charge mechanism
proposed under the project offers a simple, project-specific procedure for
recovering investment costs, and is expected to serve as a prototype for
replication elsewhere in the Mahaweli Area. While the cost recovery record
in Sri Lanka has been disappointing to date, it is hoped that the stronger
legislative and judicial framework now in place as well as the firmer
institutional support expected from MASL will now permit significant improve-
ment.

VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS
Overview
6.01      The project would enable development of currently unexploited and
underutilized land resources in the Mahawell. Ganga Basin for intensive
agricultural development. Also, through irrigated agriculture-based settle-
ment, a viable and sustainable socio economic environment would be estab-
lished for many low-incom.- families; the project would create a sound finan-
cial base in irrigated farming for about 14,000 settler families in the
project area, most of whom would be selected from the lower-income strata of
the Sri Lankan population. About 900 existing farm families in the Punanai
Tank scheme would benefit from more assured water supplies. As agricultural



-43-
production expands, secondary and tertiary industries would also develop,
thereby increasing furthler opportunities for economic growth and employment
for another 4,200 non-farming families. Project settlers would be supported
by compreliensive teclhnical and social infrastructure packages to ensure
agricultural success and social well-being. Residue.l out-of-command areas
remaining after homestead developmnent would become grazinig zones and conser-
vation forests as well as fuelwood and cashew plantations, the latter assist-
irg GOSL's agro-forestry and erosion control efforts.  By expanding produc-
tion of import substituting and exportable commodities (rice, soybeans,
cashews, chillies), the project would have a beneficial impact on GOSL's
balance of payments. In total, the project at full development would gener-
ate anniually ani estimated 70,700 tons of incremental rice, about 770 tons of
vegetables, 2,000 tons of pulses, 2,500 tons of citrus, 1.9 M coconuts,
48,000 m3 of fuelwood, and 200 toins of cashew kernels. In addition, about
400 tons of fish would be produced annually in project area waterbodies as a
result of seeding aztivities. Lastly, the project's water monitoring and
forest conservation interventions would be in consonance with GOSL's Environ-
mental Action Program and its goals of development compatible with environ-
mental protection.
Employment and Income Effects
6.02    With Pew agriculture-based settlement and higher land-use inten-
sities, agricultural labor requirements in the project area would expand from
about 0.6 M man-days without the project to about 3.8 M man-days at full
project development. About 0.2 M man-days would represent labor demand in
out-of-command tree crop activities offering off-season employment to settler
families. Farmer-settlers, while expected to satisfy a large portion of
their on-farm labor reqtuirement for crop production, would still hire-in
about half of their labor needs for peak period activities. In addition,
development within System B RB would generate considerable employment in
construction of physical infrastructure, marketing and processing of agricul-
tural produce, and in provision of social services.
6.03    About 94% of direct project beneficiaries would be new settler
families most of whom are currently landless or operating subeconomic hold-
ings. Even with the water and land charges proposed (paras 5.21-5.24), their
average effective income would increase about 2.8 times above without-project
levels. Another 6% of bentificiaries would be farm families currently engaged
in moderately intensive irrigated farming under the Punanai Tank scheme.
These families would earn incomes about 2.4 times without-project levels
through greater cropping intensities and yields permitted by the project.
Direct Foreign Exchange Effects
6.U4    Based on projected initernational prices expressed in end-CY83 con-
stant currency units, the annual gross foreign exchange value of incremental
production of tradeables generated through the project is estimated at about
US$20.0 M, 92% of which would coine from rice production. Adjusting for
foreign exchange costs of traded recurrent inputs (US$5.1 M) and foreign
exchange O&M costs of the irrigation system and settlement and agricultural
support (US$0.1 M), the project's identifiable direct foreign exchange effect
would total about US$14.8 M p.a.

Benefits to the Economy and Economic Analytt
6.05    Considering incremental capital and recurrent costs (productive
components) and benefits valued in border rupees and constant currency
values, the Sri Lankan economy is expected to realize net benefits from
project inventments of about Rs 422 M (US$16.9 M) in present worth (PW)
terms, which when annualized over the 40-year expected project life would
yield about Rs 43 M p.a. (US$1.7 M).  The economy of Sri Lanka would realize
an economic rate of return (ERR) from total project investments, inclusive of
physical contingencies, of about 12%. The following summarizes ERRs and Net
Present Worths (NPWs) of benefits from each project component and from the
total project:

The economic cash flow for the total project is provided in Annex 6, Table 5,
with full referencing of underlying assumptions. The following, however,
outline principal assumptions underlying the economic analysis:
(a)  Project Life and Phasing.  The project would have an anticipated life
of 40 years. Project implementation would require seven years,
incorporating investments in auxiliary structures begun in 1983 with
CIDA assistance. Phasing of project settlement is given in para
3.32. Production on newly settled land is assumed to begin one year
after settlement. Annual crop production would reach with-project
yields/intensities within four years, and perennial tree crops,
within seven years. Fuelwood is assumed raised in a six-year rota-
tion. Full production levels are expect.ed as follows: annual crops,
1993; perennials, 1995/96; fuelwood, 1991; and cashews, 1996.
(b)  Prices.  For internationally traded ;oods, prices were derived from
projected world market prices expreseed in end-CL83 currency values.
Appropriate adjustments were made for freight, handling, processing,
and quality differentials. Local costs and locally valued benefits
were expressed in border rupees through application of appropriate
conversion factors, the principal one being a Standard Conversion
Factor (SOF) of 0.85. To adjust for rural unskilled labor, an
adjustment factor of 0.80 was applied to the non-peak wage, 20% below
the seasonal peak wage. Year-specific prices have been used for
inputs and outputs over the 1985-95 period, after wlhich 1995 prices
were assutmed to remain unchanged in real terms for the remainder of



-45-
the project life. Input and output prices used in the economic
analysis are summarized in Annex 6, Table 1.
(c) Benefits. Incremental crop benefits are based on most probable
yieTds attainable with project investments. Fuelwood produced on
project plantations has been valued on a i.erosene basis.
(d) Investment Costs. The economic analysis of the project included all
costs associated with directly productive investments, i.e., irriga-
tion and agriculture. 1/ The following highlights special treatment
given to major project-related investment costs:
(i,  Maduru pya Dam and Right Bank Transbasin Canal.  These capital
facilities, representing headworks and allied structures, are
completed. As such, they have been treated as sunk costs (base
case). The proposed project would enable raalization of
benefits from the investments already in place. However,
allocations of the costs of these works were made to the project
in a sensitivity test to assess its broader viability wtth sunk
costs (para 6.09).
(ii)  NDK Dam and Feeder Canal.  In addition to supplying irrigation
to the project areas, these structures would also act as a
downstream re-regulating facility (afterbay storage) for
releases from power installations to be constructed at Maduru
Oya Dam. Therefore, 54% of investment costs for these works
have been allocated to the project based on a single purpose
alternative canal alignment without the NDK Dam to meet project
,Area irrigation water requirements.
(e) Crop Production Costs. Per hectare input requirements by crop are
specified in Annex 5, Table 2. The total farm labor contingent,
including family inputs, was assessed according to economic wages
summarized in Annex 6, Table 1.
(f)  Other ProJect Effects.  The following non-quantifiable effects have
been omitted from the economic analysis: (i) environmental impact
(para 3.37); (ii) demonstration effect to farmers outside System B
RB; (iii) remaining extractable timber 2/ and residual wood useable
for fuel; (iv) incremental employment generated from commodity
processing, handling, transport, and marketing; (v) non-agricultural
benefits, e.g., health, well-being, employment mobility derived from
social infrastructure; and (vi) scrap value of project equipment.
1/ Investments in social infrastructure, such as schools, potable water
supply, health facilities, police stations, post offices, temporary
settlement shelter and administrative infrastructure servicing such
socially-oriented investments were excluded from the analysis.
2/ Mosc of the valuable timber within System B RB has already been removed
throughi legal and illicit felling operations.

Project Risks and Sensitivity Tests
6.06    The Mahaweli Program dominates Sri Lanka's public investment program
and has severely strained financial and real resources. Public capital
spending, of which the Mahaweli Program constituted 35% during 1980-82, has
grown excessively, contributing to unsustainable budgetary and balance of
payments deficits. As a major step to remedy these imbalances, GOSL has
imposed a moratorium during 1983-84 on new projects not already in the
investment program, while projects included in this program but not yet
started will be scrutinized for possible postponement. The proposed project,
scheduled to start in 1985, would be implemented during the time most of the
investment bulge is expected to have eased. Projects designed to strengthen
balance of payments, to complement investments already made, and to receive
substantial donor support are given priority by GOSL in its public investment
program. The proposed project meets these criteria. Nevertheless, an active
dialogue, involving GOSL, the Ban;, and the IMF, continues on the overall
macroeconomic situation.
6.07    Barring any increase in real costs, the project can withstanid up to
about a 1.5-year delay in project benefits and remain economically viable. 1/
Therefore, efficient and expeditious implementation would be required. The
capabilities of MECA and MEA to carry out project works would be strained
because of these and other ongoing commitments, particularly in Systems C and
B. To alleviate this problem, the project includes significant technical
assistance input to ensure completion of work as scheduled.
6.08    Sensitivity Tests.  Sensitivity tests were performed to assess the
impact of variations in incremental cost and benefit streams on the project's
viability. Switching values (SV) for individual and total cost and benefit
streams are provided in Annex 6, Table 6. This table also presents PWs for
total cost and benefit streams with their breakdown into respective
categories. While an OCC of 10% has been assumed throughout the analysis,
SVs were also calculated at 12%. A plot of PWs for total project cost and
benefit streams against various discount rates is presented in Annex 6, Chart
1(A); a locus of all possible SVs for aggregate costs and benefits 2/ is
provided in Chart 1(B). The SVs demonstrate, and the figures illustrate,
that the project can bear only a moderate amount of shock and still retain
economic viability. If total incremental costs rise above 13% or if
incremental benefits fall more than 12%, the project's economic viability
would be in jeopardy. Therefore, economical and expeditious implementation
would be required to avoid real cost increases. The SVs also suggest that
the project would remain economically attractive with up to a 13.5% shortfall
in incremental paddy production, the project's chief crop.
1/ It should be noted that this is a fairly severe test in this project
since it refers to delay in benefits only, holding investment streams
constant.
2/ Discounted at OCC = 10%.



-47-
6.09    When the full cost of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal was allocated to the
project, the NPW fell by 32% to Rs 289 M (ERR = i1%). When one third of
social infrastructure investments were charged against this project ERR
dropped to 11.8% whereas 50% charge resulted in ERR of 11.6%. In another
sensitivity test, the project's incremental costs were augmented by the
allocated sunk costs of the Maduru Oya Dam and Link Tunnel as well as the RB
Transbasin Canal, System B's principal headworks installations. Begun in
1980, these structures were completed in 1983 and 1982, respectively. Alloca-
tions of these sunk costs were made on the basis of percent of total area to
benefit: accordingly, 41% of Maduru Oya Dam and Link Tunnel (Rs 859 M (PW))
and 25% of the Right Bank Transbasin Canal costs (Rs 187 X (PW)) were
included in the sensitivity analysis. As a result, the project's ERR dropped
from 12% (base case) to 7%. 1/ This outcome confirms the conclusions that
can be drawn from the 1979 Nedeco Implementation Stragegy Study that System B
RB should have had low priority, on economic grounds, among the downstream
development areas. However, given the current sunk nature of these costs,
the project is economically justifiable.

1/  Cropping intensity would increase from 100% to 180% with-project.
2/  With the project, minor tanks would cease to exist for irrigation purposes and land formerly
served from these would be incorporated into the general irrigation system area.
JI/  Net paddy area is 12,300 ha, which would increase to 22,140 ha due to 180% cropping intensity.
4/  Net area under upland is 1,700 ha. of which 510 ha would be under Derrenial.  On remaining
1190 ha, the cropping intensity assumed is 180% yielding 2,142 cropped ha.

(Illustrative New Settler Parm Budget (in Rs)
(1 Ha Agricultural Land with 0.2 Ha Romestead)
Footriotes
1/  F,xpressed in consta^,t end-CYA3 prices.
2/ 20-vear time profile.
3/ Agricultural Land (1 ha) for illustrative purposes assumed to consist
of 0.88 ha lowland and 0.12 ha upland.
4/ Notional representation of without-project income. Family assumed to
earn Rs 300/mo. Earning Rs 3600/yr, the family in total would have
about 150 mandays of employment.  Assuming 2.2 adult male equivalents,
out of 5.8 persons in the family, at Rs 24/manday, this is equivalent
to 68 days of employment p.a. per adult.
5/ Food Stamp Assumptions:
Children below 8 years-old        2.0 @ Rs 25/mo-Rs 50
Children over 8 but below 12:   1.0 @ 20/mo   -   20
Persons over 12               :   2.8 @ 15/mo   -   42
Totals                    5.8               112/mo
or Rs 1,344/yr
Kerosene Stamps                                 Rs 114 p.a.
6/  Annual crops assumed to reach full production levels in 4 years. First
year production (1987) would start at 60% of full development yields.
Cropping intensity of 180%.
7/ Based on Acres projiect preparation report. Settler houseplot of 0.2 ha
assumed to have n.12 ha garden plot. Total benefits p.a. would total
Rs 900 and would be reached in 2 years.
R/  5.5% of labor requirements hired-in.
9/ Rased on COST.-estirnated average O&M costs for major gravity irrigation
schemes in end-1l83 prices. Nominal rates assumed increased from Rs 250
to Rs 500 over 1984I-R8 period, thereafter rates assumed adjusted to
recover full O&?M average costs by lc%1*.
IO/ Based on nominal Dayment of Rs 27,5nn payable in installments over 10
years at 47 p.a. io'terest preceeded with three years of interest-free
probationary grace. Land payment would cover costs of on-farm development
works and settlement assistance. An annual graduating payment scale would
be adopted; first nominal payment Rs 2,5C0 with equal increments thireafter.
11/ Payments first added to incremental income to derive percentage recovered.
i12/ 45% of labor rectuirements.
T13 15% of net farm income.
14/ Without-project seasonal employment considered a compensation to labor,
not a rent. Therefore, with-project implicit rent equals project rent.
15/ Discounted and annualized at 10% p.a.
