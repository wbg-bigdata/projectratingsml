INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IV
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed loan
of US$12.1 million and a proposed credit of SDR 28.3 million (US$30.0 million
equivalent) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka to help finance
a Mahaweli Ganga Development Project IV. The loan would have a term of
twenty years including five years of grace at the standard variable interest
rate. The credit would be on standard IDA terms. Cofinancing arrangements
have been made with the Canadian International Development Association (CIDA)
and the Saudi Fund for Development (Saudi Fund) for US$40.0 million and
US$50.0 million equivalent, respectively.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.      A country economic memorandum "Sri Lanka:  Recent Economic
Developments, Prospects and Policies" (Report No. 5038-CE) dated May 4, 1984,
was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 18, 1984. Country data are
provided in Annex I.
3.      After several years of relative stagnation, Sri Lanka's economy has
experienced sustained growth. This growth has been the direct result of the
economic liberalization of 1977 and a significant growth in foreign
assistance. Until 1977, Sri Lanka's growth performance had been below both
need and potential. Although the 4.4 percent annual GDP growth in the 1960s
was above the average for low-income countries, it slackened sharply in the
1970-77 period to 2.9 percent per annum, just below the average for low-
income countries. Through much of this period, the terms of trade
deteriorated steadily, eroding even these modest gains. The slowdown in
economic growth in the 1970-77 period was attributable to a combination of
factors, including inadequate investment, poor management of the economy, and
a policy environment not conducive to growth and investment; these difficul-
ties were compounded by poor weather in some years and a sharp rise in the
cost of imported food and petroleum.
4.      In sharp contrast to this poor economic performance, Sri Lanka's
social achievements in relation to per capita income have been outstanding.
By virtually all social indicators--life expectancy, literacy, infant
mortality, birth rate, nutrition levels--Sri Lanka ranks significantly better



-2-
than other countries at its per capita income level. These improvements in
the quality of life, in particular the rise in health standards, the spread
of education and the availability of subsidized food, have been important
factors in the decline in mortality. T'he increasing age of marriage, the
spread of female education and employment, and a family planning program also
have contributed to a sharp decline in fertility. As a consequence, popula-
tion growth, net of migration, has dropped steadily, from 2.7 percent per
annum in the 1953-63 period to 2.2 percent per annum in the 1963-71 period,
and to 1.7 percent per annum during 1971-81.
5.      However, the Government f-inanced both its investment and social
expenditures largely through the extraction of the surpluses of the three
maior tree crops (tea, rubber and coconut), which traditionally have fur-
nished easy sources of revenue and foreign exchange. These surpluses began
to decline in the late 1960s as government export tax policies discriminated
against tree crops and export unit prices weakened. With the growth in other
productive sectors declining in the 1970-77 period, the budgetary resources
available for social programs were squeezed between inelastic revenues and
rapid inflation. As a consequencei, expe-nditures for social services other
than the food subsidy declined as a proportion of total current expenditures
and of GDP, threatening the hard-won gains in health and education. In
short, the economy could no longer generate t'he resources needed to sustain
the large program of welfare expenditures. Moreover, the very size of those
programs reduced the scope for policy makers to shift resources to
development.
6.      In 1977, a package of policy measures was introduced in order to
break this vicious circle. In an attempt to Liberalize the economy and allow
a greater role for the private sector, the new Government introduced, in
close consultation with the IMF, policies designed to (a) reduce government
intervention in commodity markets, (b) reduce government consumption sub-
sidies to assist in restoring producer incent-'ves and public savings, and
(c) create a favorable environment for private (foreign and domestic) invest-
ment by tax concessions, the creation of an Investment Promotion Zone, and
the unification and depreciation of the exchange rate. Two of the more
important positive consequences of this policy reform package were that the
burden of selected subsidies and transfers fell from around 10 percent of GDP
in 1977 to around 3 percent by 1981, and that the periodic increase in the
domestic support price for paddy in line with world price trends resulted in
a highly positive producer response in rice.
7.      In addition to these policy reforms, the Government also embarked
on an ambitious public investment program. As the Government responded to
the increased availability of resources (from domestic and foreign sources)
to tackle long, overdue investments, the Government's capital expenditure
jumped from 6 percent of GDP in 1977, to an average of 13 percent in 1978 and
1979, peaking at 19 percent in 1980, and subsequently declining to an average
14 percent over the period 1981 to 1983. At the center of the Government's
investment plan were three major new undertakings: (a) the accelerated
implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program, the largest multi-
purpose river basin development program ever undertaken in Sri Lanka; (b) the
establishment of a 200 square mile free trade zone north of Colombo near the
international airport, aimed primarily at attracting foreign investors; and
(c) a massive housing and urban renewal program with its main focus on the



-3--
Colombo metropolitan region, including the construction of a new capital
complex at Kotte, a suburb of Colombo.
8.      The initial result of both the policy reforms and increased level
of investment was an impressive jump in the GDP growth rate to an average
6.8 percent per annum for the period 1977-80 declining to 5.3 percent between
1980-83. The major activities which accounted for most of this increased
growth were paddy production, garment exports, tourism and the service
sector. Paddy production has averaged an annual 5.7 percent real growth rate
since 1977, resulting in a decline in rice imports from an average 33 percent
of total rice consumption during 1970-77 to only 12 percent during 1978-83.
Manufactured garment exports have increased from $12 million in 1977 to $197
million in 1983, raising their share of non-petroleum manufactured exports
from 41 percent in 1977 to 76 percent in 1983, whereas tourist arrivals have
increased from 153,665 in 1977 to 407,230 in 1982, with a setback to 337,342
in 1983 due to ethnic disturbances during July.
9.      However, some of the basic structural weaknesses within the economy
have not been addressed. With respect to directly productive activities,
three subsectors have continued to perform poorly, i.e., the tree crop
sector, public manufacturing enterprises and non-traditional exports. The
volume of output from the centrally important export-oriented tree crop
sector has continued to decline. The public manufacturing enterprises
inherited by the present Government, which account for approximately 40
percent of the value added in the non-petroleum manufacturing sector, con-
tinue to utilize resources inefficiently thereby reducing the overall growth
rate in manufacturing. And, lastly, the real growth of non-traditional
exports has been fairly low and erratic. Underlying the poor performance of
these sectors are two principal factors: poor management of publicly owned
activities and an overall incentive framework which offers high and uneven
levels of effective protection with a general bias against export activities.
Moreover, as the exchange rate has not been fully adiusted in a systematic
way since 1977 so as to compensate for the high levels of domestic inflation,
the incentive to invest in the production of traded commodities has been
reduced in favor of non-traded activities.
10.     In addition to these distortions in the incentive framework and the
inefficient management of publicly-owned assets, the Government's budgetary
policy has been a major source of macro-financial instability, particularly
over the past few years.  As a share of GDP, budgetary spending increased
sharply from 23 percent in 1977 to a record 43 percent in 1980, subsequently
declining but still remaining at 32 percent in 1983, in spite of an unex-
pected shortfall from original spending plans in 1983 due to the July
disturbances. Although initially much of this increased expenditure resulted
from a corresponding inflow of foreign concessionary capital which was linked
to the public investment program, the need to resort to domestic or commer-
cial foreign financing increased. In addition, the Government's efforts to
mobilize additional domestic resources fell short of what was required. Due
to falling volumes and prices in the tree crop sector and an insufficient
effort to widen the tax base away from traditional sources, the Government
became increasingly reliant on ad hoc taxation measures to maintain existing
revenue levels. The large growth in spending coupled with large inflows of
foreign savings and a weak domestic revenue effort has resulted in large
budget deficits which peaked at the equivalent of 23 percent of GDP in 1980



-4-
and still amounted to 15 percent of GDP in 1983. In response to the increas-
ing domestic deficits, current spending has been squeezed. Although the
reductions in subsidies is welcome, the limits placed on both public sector
salaries and operation and maintenance expenditure are beginning to impose
significant costs on the economy in terms of recruitment/performance in the
public sector and the efficient use of the existing publicly-owned capital
stock. Even so, savings on the budgetary current account have remained
negative from 1979 to 1983. In summary, despite impressive donor support for
the country's development programs, equivalent to 7.3 percent of GDP during
1981-83, the high level of public expenditure has meant that only 45 percent
of the overall deficit was financed by zoncessionary flows during these three
years with about 10 percent being covered by foreign commercial borrowing and
the remaining 45 percent through domestic borrowing.
11.     The rapid expansion in investmenit and general economic activity has
been reflected vividly in the balance of payments. Import volumes grew at
an average annual rate of 18.8 percent between 1977 and 1980, with investment
goods increasing from $83 million to $493 million and intermediate goods and
petroleum imports tripling in current prices over the same period. This
fairly broad-based expansion in irmports resulted in the share of merchandise
imports as a percent of GDP increasing from 23 percent in 1977 to 51 percent
in 1980. Export volumes, however, expanded at a much lower rate (an average
annual growth rate of 4.7 percent between 1977 and 1980) with the decline
in tree crop export volumes offsetting the strong growth in garment exports
from new firms established in the Investment Promotion Zone. As a
consequence, merchandise exports increased as a share of GDP from 21 percent
in 1977 to only 26 percent in 1980. These adverse trade volume trends were
accompanied by a 26 percent terms of trade deterioration over the same
period. The rapid growth in tourism receipts and private remittances from
abroad in this period failed to offset the deterioration in the trade
account, and the current account deficit deteriorated from a positive 2.4
percent of GDP in 1977 to a record 19.8 percent deficit in 1980.  Although
the deficits in 1978 and 1979 were more than offset by increased net aid
disbursements, even to the extent that Sri Lanika could continue to add to net
international reserves, by 1980 the situation had changed. In the latter
year net international reserves fell by $220 million and the public sector
began to make increased use of commercial financing.
12.     Since 1980, the external deficit has mirrored the erratic movements
of the budget deficit. Realizing in 1981 that: a continuation of the 1980
trends would result in serious financial instability, the government began to
take corrective measures, mainly in the form c,f tighter overall monetary
expansion, a substantial reduction in government spending and a gradual
realignment of the exchange rate as part of a new IMF program. Although
these measures were beginning to show results by the end of 1981 (the current
account deficit in the balance of payments had declined to 13.7 percent of
GDP and the budgetary deficit to 15.6 percent), the political resolve to
continue to apply the needed policy mix weakened in 1982 due in large part to
the Presidential elections and the subsequent referendum to extend the life
of Parliament. As a result, both the external and internal deficits
increased in 1982 (to 15.3 percent and 17.3 percent, respectively) and the
overall growth rate declined to 5.1 percent (the lowest since 1977).
Unfortunately, due partly to a continuation of this election process in
response to post-referendum criticism and partly to the widespread civil



-5-
disturbances in July 1983, the Government has continued to accord priority to
the pressing political/social issues above economic matters. Although policy
measures did contribute to the decline in the current account deficit in the
balance of payments to 12.4 percent of GDP in 1983, the estimated 14 percent
improvement in the terms of trade was the primary factor. By the end of
1983, net international reserves were slightly negative, gross official
reserves equal to about two months of imports, and the debt service ratio
continued to increase (para. 16). In addition, as a result of the budgetary
deficit and some movement in the exchange rate, inflation accelerated to an
average 14 percent during 1983 and the GDP growth rate fell to 4.9 percent.
13.     While the 1983-84 terms of trade improvement is giving the economy
some breathing space, there is not only a need for stabilization measures in
the short term, but also basic structural change is required, above all in
the tree crop and manufacturing sectors, to regain the growth momentum in the
medium term. Therefore, to avoid the consequences of an abrupt downward
adjustment in aggregate demand which is likely to follow from a continuation
of past policies, one of the priority objectives of government policy should
be to restructure the economy away from producing for the very limited domes-
tic market towards exports. The basic thrust of the required policy package
would be to move towards a more neutral incentive framework which would
permit the full diversity of Sri Lanka's particular comparative advantage to
develop. However, in the short run, the implementation of such a policy
package may not be sufficient because, firstly, the capacity of the economy
to respond to a changed set of incentives may be limited and, secondly, the
non-policy-related constraints to economic growth (such as the basic
infrastructure and imperfect credit markets) will continue to require the
careful attention of Government.
14.     Although the uncertain political situation continues to constrain
the Government's ability to adopt a comprehensive economic policy package,
recent measures demonstrate that the Government is both aware of the medium-
term problems and capable of implementing some of the required reforms, To
illustrate, an overdue program of management and incentive reforms in the
tree crops sector has been initiated, and the Presidential Tariff Commission
should present recommendations designed to reduce the overall anti-export
bias of the incentive structure to Parliament in early July. Furthermore,
the revised 1984 budget does imply a further reduction in the budgetary
deficit and the Government is pledged to continue to reform its tax base so
as to increase domestic resource mobilization. Also, there have been several
encouraging institutional developments affecting the budgetary management in
recent weeks. A new committee on economic policy has been created, compris-
ing the President, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance and
Planning, empowered to enforce financial discipline and ensure that Cabinet
decisions on economic policy are implemented. In addition, a comprehensive
inter-ministerial exercise is ongoing, designed to ensure adequate expendi-
tures on O&M which, starting in 1985, will appear explicitly as a separate
category of spending in the budget. Finally, the Cabinet has laid down
criteria for project selection for inclusion in future public capital budgets
which should remedy a maior weakness. Actual implementation of these
measures would improve coordination among the multitude of ministries, and
represent a major breakthrough in budgetary management. Nevertheless, con-
tinued strong measures will be required in order to curtail the size of the
budget deficit and redirect public investment into those areas where it is



-6-
most efficiently used.  Given the rapid build up of the country's capital
stock since 1977, the highest return probably centers around complementary
investments to the existing infrastructure plus a few selected new projects
in those long-gestating activities (e.g., power) which at this time are
appropriate for public sector investment. Ii- these actions are taken in
unison with measures designed to remove the policy-related distortions which
constrain efficient production decisions, the economy could stabilize and
continue to grow at the level attained in the recent past.
15.     The aid community has responded enthusiastically to the Government's
development efforts in recent years. Most of the growth has come in project
aid, reflecting the Government's efforts to increase investment, particularly
in the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. The overall level of aid commitments
increased from $250 million in 1977 to a record $814 million in 1981, equiv-
alent to $55 per capita. Disbursements grew much more slowly and there was a
rapid build up of the aid pipeline to around $1,630 million by the end of
1981. With the need to curtail public capital spending during 1982-83, both
because of implementation and domestic financial constraints, commitments
declined to $550 million in 1982 and $370 million in 1983, halting further
increases in the pipeline. Aid disbursements have grown steadily, from $200
million in 1977 to $450 million in 1983, or close to $30 per capita. The
slow growth of disbursements relative to commitments through 1981 can be
explained largely by two factors: the rapid acceleration in aid commitments
themselves which proved beyond the country's absorptive capacity, and the
relative shift over time from food and commodity aid towards slower disburs-
ing project aid. Continued high levels of aid will depend upon donors'
abilities to finance a sizeable portion of local costs, to provide supplemen-
tary financing for ongoing projects where needed and to increase non-project
aid. The Government will need to maintain donor confidence in its economic
policies and management through a continued vigorous domestic resource mobi-
lization program and continued restraint on government expenditures as the
budgetary situation remains tight. Local cost financing, in support of Sri
Lanka's own resource mobilization efforts will not only provide valuable
relief to these budgetary pressures but also supplement foreign exchange
resources needed in support of the balance of payments.
16.     External public debt outstanding and disbursed stood at an estimated
US$2,393 at the end of 1983, amounting to about 46 percent of GDP.  Although
a greater part of this debt is on long-term concessional terms, the increased
resort to commercial finance during 1981 and 1982 has contributed to the debt
service ratio increasing from 10.1 percent in 1982 to 11.9 percent in 1983
excluding IME charges and repurchases. Even though record tea prices in
recent months continue to maintain Sri Lanka's export earnings at a high
enough level to enable it to reduce its dependence on commercial finance in
the near term, any deterioration in the terms of trade would rapidly reverse
the situation. However, the Government has taLken measures to reduce the
budget deficit and is actively considering policy measures designed to stimu-
late exports and efficient import substitution activities. If the Government
continues to make progress along t]hese lines, the current account deficit in
the balance of payments should decline to approximately 7 percent towards the
end of the decade with the debt service ratio declining to below 15 percent
in 1990 after temporarily rising to almost 17 percent due to existing debt
repayment commitments.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.     Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the
Bank Group has approved nine loans totalling US$115.6 million (net of
cancellations) and 35 credits totalling US$666.4 million (net of cancel-
lations) in support of 42 projects.  About 46 percent of Bank Group assis-
tance has been for agriculture (irrigation, agricultural, and dairy
development), 24 percent for power, 10 percent for transport, and the
remainder for development finance company operations, a program credit
(mainly involving the import of raw materials for industry), water supply,
construction industry, telecommunications, and small and medium industries.
Eight loans and twelve credits have been fully disbursed so far. In this
fiscal year, the Executive Directors approved one IDA credit for US$25 mil-
lion equivalent for an Industrial Development Project, and a second for US$23
million equivalent for a.Third Rural Development Project. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of March 31, 1984.
18.     IFC has a total investment of US$2.04 million equivalent in equity
and US$17.09 million equivalent in loans. The investments have so far been
made in two textiles industries, one polypropelene bag industry, one equip-
ment leasing company, one hotel and for two IFC lines of credit made to the
government-owned Bank of Ceylon (US$7.0 million) for term loans to medium-
sized industries.
19.     The Bank Group's current strategy focuses on the agricultural sector.
It aims to support government efforts to increase food production, reduce
dependence on food imports, and raise productivity, employment, incomes and
living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka. This strategy
includes projects to support basic infrastructure. Projects currently under
preparation include a tank rehabilitation project, a second road maintenance
project, a second dairy development project and a fourth tree crop develop-
ment project.
20.     The Bank Group, as of end-1983, accounted for 10.7 percent (IBRD,
1.6 percent; IDA, 9.1 percent) of Sri Lanka's total debt outstanding and
disbursed, and 5.0 percent of debt service on medium- and long-term debt.
The pro4ected Bank Group's share in total existing external debt outstanding
and disbursed will increase to 17 percent by 1985 (with IBRD's share declin-
ing to 1.3 percent). The Bank and IDA portions of this debt service are
expected to decline to about 4 percent by 1985.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
21.     Agriculture plays a manor role in Sri Lanka's economy, accounting
for about 25 percent of GDP, over 50 percent of the labor force, and about
60 percent of export earnings. About 95 percent of the rural population is
involved directly in agriculture-related activities. In addition, much of
the activity in manufacturing, transport, and services sectors relates to
either agricultural input supply or processing agricultural produce.



-8-
22.     Agricultural development has traditionally been concentrated in the
wet and intermediate climate zones in t:he southwest portion of the island.
These zones, accounting for only one-third of Sri Lanka's surface area,
contain about two-thirds of the population and 50 percent of its paddyland.
Agricultural growth in these zones depends primarily on increasing produc-
tivity of already developed land. In contrast, the dry zone to the north is
sparsely populated and underdeveloped clespite continuing migration and
settlement. Permanent agriculture there accounts for less than 30 percent
of the 2.24 million ha which are consiclered potentially arable nationwide,
with an additional 1.0 million ha under subsistence-type slash and burn
(chena) agriculture.  Cultivation in the southwest monsoon season (yala) is
confined to irrigated area, but even in these, water and other constraints
limit average land use intensities to about 100-120 percent. Considerable
potential exists in Sri Lanka for both increasing cropping intensities on
already developed land and expanding cultivated area, particularly in the dry
zone.
Obiectives and Strategy for the Future
23.     The present Government recognizes the pivotal role of agriculture in
stimulating economic growth and rural development in Sri Lanka. Its medium-
term strategy for agriculture emphasizes bett:er utilization of existing
potential through institutional and policy reform, as well as strategically
selected investments to increase the production base. Among programs given
high priority are: (a) appropriate price incentives for producers;
(b) agricultural support services such as research and extension, credit,
farm power supply, and fertilizer distributicn; and (c) stronger irrigation
water management. Following adopt-ion o- measures in 1977 designed to imple-
ment the above and due partly to favorable weather, the sector responded well
the following year. Agricultural performance over the 1978-82 period
improved substantially with growth averaging 4.0 percent per annum and
increase in paddy production averaging 5.2 percent per annum. This was
depressed, however, by poorer growth in the tree crops sector averaging only
1.6 percent per annum. As a consequence, imports of rice have declined
dramatically. Climatic vagaries, however, continue to plague Sri Lankan
agriculture. To mitigate the impacts of such rainfall variations on
production, the Government is emphasizinig for the long term further expansion
of irrigated agriculture into the dry zone through accelerated development of
its ma4or river basins, including the Mahaweli Ganga and Maduru Oya Basins.
The Mahaweli Ganga Development Pr,gram
24.     The Program is based on a Master Plan prepared iointly by a UNDP/FAO
team and Sri Lankan engineers in 1965-68. The Plan envisaged development of
about 365,000 ha of irrigable land in the dry zone, as well as about 500 MW
of hydropower. It was divided into three phases, each including several
pro lects for stepwise implementation over a 30-year period. Implementation
of the Plan began in 1970. Late in 1977, however, Government realized that,
at the current rates of construction and population growth, the Program would
not have much near-term impact on unemployment and serious food and power
shortages, and that it, therefore, should be accelerated. An Implementation
Strategy Study was carried out with financing from the Netherlands to: (a)
review and reevaluate the UNDP/FAO Master Plan and each of its separate
proiects; (b) examine the implications of various alternative phasings of the



-9--
feasible projects; and (c) recommend a specific action plan taking into
account technical, financial and economic constraints.
25.     The Government accepted most of the conclusions of the Study revising
the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Program (AMDP) accordingly, with the
exception of including the Randenigala Dam Project. Initial work of AMDP was
confined to 4 headworks projects having a total installed capacity of about
500 MW and downstream development was to be limited to about 60,000 ha in
Systems B and C. Development of System H was already ongoing with IDA
assistance. The US is currently providing assistance for downstream develop-
ment of the Maduru Oya Project System B Left Bank (US$90.0 million); it also
has financed an in-depth study of the environmental impact of the AMDP and is
financing a Mahaweli Environmental Project (US$5.0 million) to implement the
Study's recommendations. Canada and the UK financed feasibility studies of
Systems B and C, respectively. The EEC is supporting development of Zone 2
in System C; and IDA, Japan, and the Kuwait Fund are assisting in the
development of Zones 3-6 in System C. The Asian Development Bank is provid-
ing assistance to plan and construct roads in the AMDP area. The proposed
project in System B Right Bank would mark the Bank Group's second area
development effort in the AMDP area.
26.     AMDP and Sri Lanka's Public Investment Program.  The overall costs of
the AMDP have risen substantially during the past years due to rapid domestic
and international inflation and to increased costs associated with more
difficult site conditions for Kotmale Dam than were originally anticipated.
The share of total public capital expenditures devoted to AMDP rose from
about 7 percent in 1977 to about 35 percent over 1980-82, with a high of 46
percent in 1982, contributing substantially to large unfinanced budget
deficits, heavy dependence on external financing, and creating a serious
imbalance between current and capital spending. The Government has responded
to macro-management difficulties by making various adjustments, including
adiustments to the Accelerated Program (e.g., reducing the height of Kotmale
Dam and deferring some downstream development). In addition, it imposed a
moratorium during 1983-84 on new projects not already in its investment
program. The extent to which Mahaweli can be rephased to reduce pressure on
the public investment program is limited by past aid commitments, expendi-
tures on which are expected to peak over 1982-84. Thereafter, declines are
projected, and Mahaweli's share is currently expected to fall to 23 percent
of total public investment by 1985-87. The proposed project for System B
Right Bank development would basically be implemented after the current peak.
It is also intended to complement major headwork investments (sunk costs)
already made in the Maduru Oya Reservoir and Right Bank Transbasin Canal and
to utilize other external assistance provided by donors for downstream
development.
The Bank Group's Role in Mahaweli Ganga Development
27.     With Bank Group assistance, initial construction under the Mahaweli
program began in 1970 under the Mahaweli Ganga Development Project I
(Cr. 653-CE) with diversion headworks at Polgolla on the Mahaweli Ganga and
at Bowatenna on the Amban Ganga, including a 40 MW hydropower plant at
Polgolla. This first project was completed in 1978 and provided an improved
water supply to about 52,650 ha of existing irrigated land and a full supply
for about 29,000 ha of unirrigated land in System H to be developed under



-10-
subsequent proiects. The project was well designed and fulfilled its
obiectives. Under Mahaweli Ganga Development Project II (Cr. 701-CE), with
cofinancing from Canada, the Netherlands, UK, US and EEC, construction work
is nearing completion on irrigation and social infrastructure for about 60
percent of this 29,000 ha of newly irrigated area. 1/ The project has aided
settlement of nearly 15,300 families in the pro4ect area providing them with
a viable means of livelihood in irrigated farming. It has contributed sig--
nificantly to national rice production with an average rice yield of 104
bushels per acre against a national average of 67 bushels per acre in 1982/183
season. The project is expected to be essentially completed by mid-1984,
about one year behind schedule. Mahaweli Ganga Development Project III
(Cr. 1166-CE), with cofinancing from Japan and the Kuwait Fund, provides a
full irrigation supply for about 24,100 ha ofi newly irrigated land and a
supplemental supply for about 3,600 ha in System C. It includes irrigation
and social infrastructure, settlement assistance, and agricultural develop-
ment assistance. The construction of irrigation infrastructure began in
1982. Under a technical assistance credit (Cr. 979-CE), IDA, with EEC
cofinancing, is providing technical assistance for a study to determine
optimal use of available water from the MahaweLi Ganga.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.     The project area is located in the Right Bank of the Maduru Oya River
in System B, and comprises a gross area of 58,000 ha, and a net irrigable
area of 14,000 ha (Map IBRD 17493). System B, the downstream command area of
the recently completed dam on the Maduru Oya, itself encompasses a gross area
of 136,000 ha and a net irrigable area of 39,000 ha (one-third of the land to
be irrigated under AMDP). A feasibility report for System B was prepared by
Acres International, Ltd. in 1980 with financing and supervision from the
Government. A revised report for the Right Bank project, updating technical
and cost data, was prepared by Acres in 1982 with CIDA financing. Detailed
design of the Right Bank Main and Branch canals was carried out in late-1981
and 1982 by the Berger/IECO consulting consortium, with USAID financing, as
part of their Left Bank irrigation system design studies. These reports
formed the basis for appraisal by a joint Bank/CIDA mission which visited Sri
Lanka in June-July 1983. A staff appraisal rep,ort entitled "Sri Lanka -
Mahaweli Ganga Development Project IV" (No. 4885-CE) dated May 4, 1984, is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were
held in Washington, D.C. from March 29 to April 3, 1984.  The Borrower's
delegation was led by Mr. Ivan Samarawickrama, Secretary, Ministry of
Mahaweli Development. Supplementary project data and special conditions of
the proposed loan and credit are given in Annex III.
Project Objectives
29.     The manor obiectives of the profect are to provide a viable income
base in irrigated farming for about 14,000 new settler families, most of whom
1/ Government independently carried out development of the remaining 40
percent.



-11-
would come from low-income groups, and ensure adequate water supply to about
900 existing farm families. It will increase further opportunities for
economic growth and employment for another 4,200 families as secondary and
tertiary industries would develop with the expansion of settlement and
agriculture. The project conforms to the Government's development objectives
of reducing imports of agricultural goods, increasing exports, and generating
employment and settlement opportunities.
Project Description
30.     The proposed project would cover zones 6-8 of System B involving a
newly irrigated area of 14,000 ha (net) and expand irrigation potential on
1,800 ha (net) of currently irrigated area. The project would be implemented
in five years (1985-89) 1/ and would include the following works, facilities,
and programs:
(a) construction of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal;
(b) construction of Right Bank Main and Branch Canals;
(c) construction of an irrigation distribution and drainage system;
(d) construction and upgrading of main and secondary roads;
(e) land clearing of 20,000 ha for agricultural and plantation
development and construction of on-farm facilities for 14,000 ha
(net);
(f) construction of social infrastructure and facilities for new
settlement communities;
(g) construction of operation and management offices and quarters;
(h) settler assistance of house grants, tools, seed, and temporary
shelters;
(i) establishment of cashew and fuelwood plantations;
(j) provision of agricultural extension and supporting services
and research facilities;
(k) a monitoring and evaluation program;
(1) an environmental enhancement and monitoring program;.
(m) provision of technical assistance and training;
1/ Construction of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal, however, was started in 1983
(with CIDA financing), and work is scheduled to start on the Main and
Branch Canals in mid-1984 (with Saudi Fund financing).

(n)  equipment and vehicles for construction supervision and operation
and maintenance (O&M); and
(o)  annual stocking of area waterbodies for artisanal fisheries
development.
Project Organization and Management
3i.     The Mahaweli Authority oif Sri Lanka (MASL) has overall responsibility
for implementing the Mahaweii Ganga Development Program and its subsequent
management. It has been entrusted by the Government with wide-ranging powers
to implement the Program, including coordination of all government institu-
tions involved with carrying out the Program. The Program is being imple-
mented principally by the two operational agencies of MASL, namely the
Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency (MECA) and the Mahaweli Economic
Agency (MEA). MECA would be responsible for all physical works under the
project and would function principally as th;e design and construction agency
for downstream development (irrigation and social infrastructure and on-farm
development). MEA would be responsible for post-construction implementation
of the pro4ject.  Other government agencies would also provide essential
facilities and services to ensure project success. The Sri Lanka Cashew
Corporation (SLCC) and the Forest Department would collaborate with MEA in
establishing and maintaining cashew and fuelwood plantations. Commercial
banking institutions would provide required rural banking services to project
beneficiaries. The Ministry of Health would run health units provided under
the project; the Ministry of Education would staff and equip the schools; and
the Department of Highways would operate and maintain area roads.
Major Project Works
32.     Irrigation Infrastructure.  A small regulatory reservoir would be
provided in the Right Bank Main Canal tD partially regulate the natural
stream inflows and releases for the Right Bank area from the Maduru Oya Dam.
This reservoir would also act as after-'bay storage from power facilities,
when they are developed at Madura Oya Dam. Final designs have been completed
for both NDK Dam and Canals, and a contract has been awarded for construction
of NDK Dam and Feeder Canal with CIDA assistance. Tender documents for the
Main and Branch Canals to be financed by the Saudi Fund have been prepared
and bids for constructing these canals are expected to be called in mid-1984.
Final layout and preparation of detailed designs, cost estimates, and tender
documents for distribution facilities, drains, roads, and social infrastruc-
ture would be carried out with technical assistance provided under the
project.
33.     Land Clearing and On-farm Development.  Land clearing would be
required for agricultural plot development and for cashew, fuelwood and
conservation forest plantations. Rough leveling, land shaping and bund
layouts would be carried out under the project. Construction of bunds,
on-farm ditches and drains, and final farm leveling or grading would be done
by settlers on a labor cointract basis.
34.     Social and Community Infrastructure.  The proiect would provide new
settlers with adequate health, educational and other support facilities to
attain living standards comparable to developed areas elsewhere in Sri Lanka.



-13-
About 18,200 new families (approximately 100,000 persons) would settle in the
project area at full development, including 14,000 farm-families and about
4,200 families for support services.
35.     Agricultural Training and Research.  Farmer-settlers, some with no
practical irrigation experience, would require training in water management
techniques, particularly for diversified cropping, and operation and main-
tenance of tertiary irrigation. Such training would be provided through the
Aralaganwila Training Center and Farm in the System B Left Bank area, cur-
rently being developed and equipped with CIDA assistance.
Settlement and Agricultural Development
36.     The settlement program in System B Right Bank would proceed simul-
taneously with that in other Mahaweli schemes at rates considered achievable
and realistic. Settlement is expected to peak in 1987 and 1988 with 4,500
families established in System B Right Bank in each year and to average about
3,500 families per annum over the implementation period. In total, 14,000
new farmer-settler families would be established in System B Right Bank by
1989.
37.     Farmer-settlers would each be allocated a 1.0 ha irrigated plot and a
0.2 ha houseplot as well as temporary shelter, basic materials for house
construction, basic tools and initial seed. Non-farmer settlers would be
allocated 0.1 ha house plots. Farmer-settlers would receive their houseplots
and farms about six months before irrigation water becomes available.
Settlers would also be eligible for food aid for a period of 12 months after
arrival under a separate agreement between the Government and the World Food
Programme.
38.     About 88 percent of the newly irrigated area in System B Right Bank
would be developed to double-cropped paddy cultivation. An average cropping
intensity of 180 percent is expected at full development. On the remaining
lands, diversified upland annual or perennial crops would be produced.
Houseplots would be developed to provide diverse agricultural commodities for
both home consumption and off-farm sales. The agricultural extension system
to be introduced in System B Right Bank under MASL would be consistent with
the training and visit system planned under the IDA-assisted Agricultural
Extension and Adaptive Research Prolect (Cr. 931-CE) (Section 3.06, draft
DCA). MASL would employ extension workers seconded by the Department of
Agriculture and rely on it for the technical support of extension work.
Adequate credit to project area residents would be provided; such credit
would be supported by adequate supervisory staff and facilities and would be
reviewed periodically and adjusted as required (Section 3.07, draft DCA).
The Government would allocate sufficient amounts of water (about 350 million
cubic meters) for the project from the Mahaweli Ganga (Section 3.08, draft
DCA)
Fuelwood and Cashew Plantation
39.     To provide a long-term and adequate supply of fuelwood to the
settlers, the project would establish fuelwood plantations in about 2,000 ha
of upland non-irrigable areas. MASL would demarcate the locations and the
Forest Department would establish seedling nurseries and coordinate and



-14-
maintain the plantations. MASL would also demarcate another 2,000 ha of
non-irrigable land for planting and management of cashew by the Sri Lanka
Cashew Corporation (SLCC). The Governmnent wrould submit to the Association by
December 31, 1984 for approval a detailed work program for implementation of
the cashew plantation in the project area (Section 3.10, draft DCA).
Monitoring and Evaluation
40.     The monitoring and evaluation system developed under the ongoing
Mahaweli Ganga Development Project III by MASL would be expanded under the
proiect to report progress in project implementation. In addition to the
physical construction program, the monitoring would focus on (a) input
delivery and use, and (b) output achievement in terms of increased
production, improved services andl living standards, water management and use
efficiency, and environmental impact.
Technical Assistance
41.     Consultants for supervision of construction of the Main and Branch
Canals would be financed by the Saudi Fund. Consultants required for final
design, layout and construction supervision of tertiary irrigation and
drainage facilities, on-farm development, roads, and social infrastructure
would be financed by CIDA. Additional technical assistance provided under
the project would include 2 manmonths for establishment of a water quality
monitoring program and 12 manmonths to assisi: in cashew seed material selec-
tion and breeding. In total, the project would require an estimated 58
manyears of technical assistance.
Cost and Financing
42.     Total project cost is estimated at about US$160.1 million, with a
foreign exchange cost of US$85.0 million (53 percent). Cost estimates are
based on end-1983 price levels. lJnit prices for the Main and Branch Canals
are based on recent bids for similar work escalated to end-1983. The cost
for NDK Dam is based on its actua:L bid price. Cost estimates for the ter-
tiary irrigation distribution and drainage system are based on costs of
similar facilities being constructed in Systems I and C and detailed layouts
for sample areas. Physical contingencies were estimated at 10 percent for
the Main and Branch Canals and 15 percent for other civil works. Price
contingencies were calculated on the following basis: 12.5 percent in 1984;
11 percent, 1985; 10 percent, 1986; 9 percent, 1987; 8 percent, 1988; and
7 percent in 1989 for local costs; and, 5.6 percent in 1984; 8.5 percent,
1985; 9 percent, 1986-87; 8 percernt, 1988; and 6.75 percent in 1989 for
foreign costs.
43.     Pro4ect cofinaiicing arrangements are being finalized by the
Government. The Saudi Fund has agreed to provide US$50.1 million equivalent
(about 31 percent of project cost net of taxes and duties). CIDA has indi-
cated its intent to contribute about US$40.0 million equivalent (about 25
percent of project cost) as a grant (about US$16.5 million equivalent) and a
loan (about US$23.5 million equivalent). The above bilateral assistance,
combined with the proposed IDA/Bank contribut:Lon of about US$42.1 million
equivalent, would finance about 83 percent of total project costs (net of
taxes and duties), including 100 percent of foreign and 64 percent of local



-15-
costs. The Bank loan (US$12.1 million), would include a front-end fee of
US$30,175, which would be capitalized into the loan. Effectiveness of the
Saudi Fund loan and CIDA loan and grant would be a condition of effectiveness
of proposed Bank/IDA assistance (Section 6.01(a), draft DCA).

Group. Distribution and field caLnals and the drainage facilities (US$11.3
million equivalent) are unsuited for ICB, because of their small size and
scattered locations. However, they would be combined into packages large
enough (about US$4.0 million equivalent) to attract competition from foreign
contractors in Sri Lanka, who may have interest in such work, and would be
contracted through LCB. Primary and market roads, exclusive of final asphalt
surfacing, would be included in one contract (US$8.6 million equivalent) to
be awarded following ICB in accordance with 3ank guidelines. Local firms are
expected to be competitive for the irrigation facilities and road contracts.
Upgrading of O&M roads to market-road standards, asphalt surfacing of the
primary and market roads (US$3.7 million equivalent), and construction of
smaller village roads (US$2.8 million equivalent) would be contracted follow-
ing LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Land clearing and on-farm
development would be done by both mechanized and manual methods. Clearing to
be done mechanically would be grouped into contracts of at least US$1.0
million each to be awarded following LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Work to be done manually would be divided int:o small contracts and awarded in
fixed rate contracts to small local contractors and settlers. Settlement
assistance, including transportation, temporary shelter, housing materials,
seeds, seedlings, and tools would be prDvided by MEA.  Small off-the-shelf
items costing less than US$20,000 per contract that cannot be bulked into
packages suitable for international tendering or which are required urgently
for project implementation may be procured after solicitation of quotations
from at least three independent suppliers in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. Such purchases would be limited to an aggregate of
US$0.5 million equivalent. All work contracts over US$100,000 and equipment
contracts over US$50,000 would be subject to Bank review prior to award.
Other contracts would be subject to selective post-award review. A
preference margin of 7.5 percent on civil works contracts and 15 percent on
equipment and vehicles would be extended to qualified local manufacturers in
bid evaluation.
Disbursement
46.     Disbursements from the proposed loan/credit blend would cover (a) 100
percent of the front-end fee on the Bank loan; (b) 90 percent of expenditures
for civil works and materials for irrigation distributary canals, drainage
works, land clearing, on-farm development, and roads; (c) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures for directly imported, 100 percent of local expenditures
(ex-factory) for locally manufactured, and 75 percent for locally procured
equipment, vehicles, and spares; (d) 10CI percent of expenditures for cashew
plantation development; (e) 100 percent of expenditures for settlement
assistance, and a declining percenLtage of incremental cost of project
administration and engineering (for a weighted average of about 50 percent of
the total of such cost). Disbursements for civil works under contracts less
than SL Rs 500,000 and for settlement assistance, cashew plantation
development, and costs of project administration and engineering, would be
made against certified statements of expenditure. Submission of the work
program for cashew plantation development by the Government (para. 39) by
December 31, 1984, would be a condition of disbursement for this component
(Schedule I, para. 4(b), draft DCA). All other disbursements should be
fully documented in accordance with the Bankr's standard requirements.



-17-
Project Special Account
47.     In order to facilitate prefinancing of project expenditures under
categories 1,3 and 4 of Schedule 1 to the draft Development Credit Agreement,
a project special account would be opened in the Bank of Ceylon by MASL. An
initial deposit to the account of US$1.0 million equivalent would be made in
Sri Lankan Rupees upon receipt of a direct payment application supported by
appropriate evidence. Establishment of the special account would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the IDA credit/IBRD loan (Section 6.01(b), draft
DCA).
Environmental Impact
48.     On the basis of a study financed by USAID, the Government has adopted
an action plan for environmental protection under AMDP. The Plan comprises a
series of components, each of which identifies both recently implemented and
proposed plans or activities to address specific environmental issues.
Principal negative environmental impacts anticipated with the proposed
project would be (a) reduction of natural vegetation, (b) concomitant loss of
wildlife, (c) changes in water quality and quantity with regard to agro-
chemical runoff, nutrient cycling patterns, and salinity intrusion in the
downstream estuary, and (d) potential spread of communicable water-borne and
vector diseases. To mitigate these, a number of interventions such as fuel-
wood plantations, a water quality monitoring program and adequate health
facilities for the settlers would be included under the project to complement
those being carried out through similar programs. The Mahaweli Environmental
Prolect assisted by USAID is sufficiently comprehensive to minimize and
mitigate adverse impacts on wildlife.
Operation and Maintenance
49.     A Water Management Panel set up under the Director General of MASL
will allocate water resources for irrigation, power, and other uses and
apportion irrigation water among the various Mahaweli irrigation projects. A
water management secretariat set up under MASL and attached to MECA would
operate and maintain major canals and irrigation structures. MEA would be
responsible for O&M of the irrigation and drainage system down to farm
turnouts, social and administrative infrastructure, and village roads. The
Government would annually provide funds necessary for O&M of the irrigation
systems until such time as the full O&M costs are recovered (para. 54)
through water charge collection (Section 4.02(d), draft DCA). It would serve
as an enforcement as well as advisory agency to ensure that irrigation water
is used efficiently by farmers and that unauthorized water diversions do not
occur. MECA would be called upon to make any major repairs or modifications
required to major structures. Water Management Supervisors and Agricultural
Officers at block level would review block water requirements at least weekly
to permit system-wide adTustments to water issues according to need.
Cost Recovery/Impact on Government Budget
50.     Investment costs of proiect works would amount to about SL Rs 2,204
million in present value (PV) terms. Irrigation infrastructure and land
development would represent about 69 percent of this total. Recurrent expen-
ses for O&M of project works would amount to about SL Rs 227 million (PV).



-18-
Thus, the PV of investment and recurrent costs over a 25-year period would
total about SL Rs 2,431 million.
51.     Recoveries and budgetary savings as indicated in the following
paragraphs (52-54) would total about SI. Rs 313 million in PV terms, implying
that about 13 percent of total costs would be recovered through the project.
This level of recovery is considered reasonable in view of (a) the low-income
base of most beneficiaries without the project, (b) the erosive impact of
relatively high projected domestic inflation on the real value of land
installment payments and the historical diffrculties in implementing cost
recovery schemes in Sri Lanka.
52.     A fundamental obiective of the Mahaweli program is establishment of a
viable and sustainable socioeconomnic environment for a large portion of the
poor within Sri Lankan society. Settlers selec:ted for project areas would
mostly come from those experiencing overpopulation and high levels of
unemployment and underemployment. Without the Mahaweli program, therefore,
the bulk of applicants would likely be burdens to the government budget since
they would qualify for food and/or other assistance payments. The project
would save about SL Rs 129 million (PV) in public assistance (at a rate of
about SL Rs 120/family/month). Wood andL cashew sales from the plantation
established under the project are estimated to generate SL Rs 32 million and
SL Rs 45 million (PV), respectively, in gross revenues.
53.     Water Charges:  Inspite of attempts made since 1977 to reactivate
earlier laws and promulgate suitable legislation to tax irrigation
beneficiaries, cost recovery in irrigation prolects has not been generally
successful to date. Under the Irrigation Ordinance the Government was
empowered to impose water charges towards recovery of capital and O&M costs
of irrigation-systems. In 1978, charges were set at SL Rs 75/ha in schemes
of 80 ha or more with over 150 percent cropping intensity, and SL Rs 50/ha
for schemes with cropping intensity of 1.50 percent or less. There were some
collections in certain schemes during 1978-80; but these stopped altogether
from 1981 due mostly to lack of an effecl:ive enforcing mechanism. Under the
Mahaweli Ganga Development Project III, the Government agreed with IDA to
introduce water charges in the Mahaweli area starting September 1982 at a
rate of 22 percent of O&M costs rising to 100 percent by 1991. However, no
action was taken to collect water charges in 1982 due to the political sen-
sitivity of the issue during an election year and prevailing drought
conditions. Additionally, certain deficiencies of the Ordinance itself also
created problems for collection.
54.     To remedy these deficiencies, the Government has made amendments to
the Ordinance reintroducing jurisdiction of magistrate courts to take legal
action against defaulters and empowering government agents to repair damaged
irrigation works and recover cost from the defaulters. Additionally, the
Government approved in July 1983 the following rates: SL Rs 2,000/ha for
major lift irrigation projects, SL Rs 688/ha for drainage, and SL Rs 500/ha
for gravity irrigation to cover current annual O&M costs. Half of such rates
are proposed to be collected initially (1984) with progressive increase of 20
percent of the balance per year until full rates are collected in five years.
The Government has completed all the interim steps, such as publicity,
preparation of registers, and documentation. It has already started collect-
ing from the major irrigation schemes, which will last through the harvesting



-19-
season, ending in May 1984. The Government would carry out a mid-term review
by July 31, 1986, to assess the progress of the collection program and to
determine the needed adiustments to water rates required to cover full cost
of O&M by September 30, 1991 (Section 4.02, draft DCA). The pro ect would
recover about SL Rs 44 million (PV) in water charges at the currently
proposed rate and with enhancements to Rs 500/ha in real terms by 1991.
55.     Land Transfer.  Although land transfer payments have yet to begin in
the Mahaweli area, the Government has reemphasized its desire to implement
the transfer program and recover land improvement costs from the settlers.
Such recovery would meet the costs of settlement assistance, land clearing,
on-farm development, field canals and drains. The Government proposes to
start collection of land transfer payments in System H (Mahaweli Ganga
Development Project II) from April 1985. It is also making arrangements to
collect similar land transfer payments in System C (Mahaweli Ganga
Development Project III). The Government would carry out a similar program
for land transfer and collection of land payment thereof in System B Right
Bank under the proposed project. Land transfer payments would total about
SL Rs 62 million (PV) in real terms.
Pro-ect Benefits and Justification
56.     The project would enable development of currently unexploited and
underutilized land resources in the Mahaweli Ganga Basin for intensive
agricultural development, create a viable financial base in irrigated farming
for about 14,000 settler families, and assure water supply to about 900
existing farm families. As agricultural production expands, secondary and
tertiary industries would also develop thereby increasing further oppor-
tunities for economic growth and employment for another 4,200 non-farming
families. By expanding production of import substituting and exportable
commodities (rice, soybeans, cashews, chillies), the project would have a
beneficial impact on the country's balance of payments. In total, the
project at full development would generate annually an estimated 70,700 tons
of incremental rice, about 770 tons of vegetables, 2,000 tons of pulses,
2,500 tons of citrus, 1.9 million coconuts, 48,000 cubic meters of fuelwood,
and 200 tons of cashew kernels. In addition, about 400 tons of fish would be
produced annually in project area waterbodies as a result of fingerling
seeding activities. Lastly, the project's water monitoring and forest con-
servation interventions would be consistent with the Government's
Environmental Action Program and its goals of development compatible with
environmental protection.
57.     Average effective income of the new settler families would increase
about 2.8 times as compared to without-project levels. Average income of the
farm families currently engaged in moderately intensive irrigation farming in
Punanai system would increase about 2.4 times through greater cropping inten-
sities and yields permitted by the project. Incremental employment oppor-
tunities would total about 3.2 million mandays per annum with the project's
agriculture-based settlement program and higher land use intensities on
existing irrigated area.
58.     The Sri Lankan economy is expected to realize net benefits from
pro'ect investments of about SL Rs 422 million (US$16.9 million) in present
worth (PW) terms, which when annualized over the 40-year expected project



-20-
life would yield about SL Rs 43 million per annum (US$1.7 million). The
economy of Sri Lanka would realize an economic rate of return (ERR) from
total project investments, inclusive oE physical contingencies, of about 12
percent.
Project Risks
59.     The project has no major technical risk.  Barring any increase in
real costs, the project can withstand Up to a one and one-half year delay in
project benefits and remain economically viable. The capabilities of MECA
and MEA to carry out project works would be strained because of these and
other ongoing commitments, particularly in Systems C and B. To alleviate
this problem, the project includes significant technical assistance input to
ensure completion of work as scheduled.
60.     Sensitivity analyses indicate that the project can bear a moderate
amount of shock and still retain its economic viability. If total incremen-
tal costs rise above 13 percent, or if incremental benefits fall more than 12
percent, or if the project is delayed by more than one and one-half years,
the pro4ect's economic viability would be in jeopardy. The project would
remain economically attractive with up to a 13.5 percent shortfall in
incremental rice production, the project's chief crop.  Therefore, economical
and expeditious implementation would be required to avoid real cost
increases.
