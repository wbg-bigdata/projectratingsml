MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IV
(Loani 2437-CE; Credit 1494-CE)
THIRD RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1363-CE)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report is unusual in the sense that it
concerns one project that was; not implemented and another that was only
marginally implemented.
-    A Loan of US$12.1 million and a Credit of SDR 28.3 million (US$30.0
million equivalent) for the Mahaweli Ganga Development Project IV
(Mahaweli IV) were approved by the Board in June 1984, but not
declared effective until January 1988. Project implementation did not
start, however, and Loan and Credit were canceled at the original
closing Date of March 31, 1990, without disbursements having been
made.V
-    A Credit of SDR 21.4 million (US$23.0 million equivalent) for the
Third Rural Development Project (RD III) was approved by the Board in
May 1983, and declared effective in November 1983, and implementation
had started. Disbursements, however, were suspended in March 1986,
and the undisbursed part of the Credit (about 89 percent) was canceled
soon after the Closing Date of September 30, 1989.
This PCR was prepared by staff of the Agriculture Operations Division,
Country Department 1, Asia Region. It is is based, inter alia, on the basic
documents for each project: President's Report, Staff Appraisal Report,
Development Credit Agreement (and Loan Agreement for Mahaweli IV), supervision
reports, project files and correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower.
It was sent to the Borrower on March 13, 1991, and the Government's comments
on RD III are attached.
YExcept for an amount of US$30,175 representing the Bank's front-end fee for
the Loan.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROZECT IV
(Loan 2437-CE; Credit 1494-CE)
THIRD RURAL DEVELOPMENT-PROJECT
(Credit 1363-CE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.          Obiectives.  The Mahaweli IV Project was part of the Government's
large multipurpose Mahaweli Ganga Development Program which was aimed at
solving the country's persistent employment problems and severe food and power
shortanes. In contrast, the Rural Development III Project was designed as a
smaller, low cost, quick maturing progratn that would benefit large numbers of
low income rural dwellers.
2.          Imnlementation Experience.  In both cases, implementation
experience was cut short by the serious ethnic conflict which erupted in July
1983 between the Sinhalese and Tamil parts of the population. The conflict
spread with increasing intensity from the northern part of the country, where
the RD III Project area is located, to the east, where Mahaweli IV was to be
implemented, eventually forcing tha Bank to cancel the loan/credits for both
projects.
3.          Results.  Instead of focussing on narrow project-related topics
and issues which usually form the core of project completion reports, the
present report concentrates on the issues and considerations that played a
role in the Bank's decisions: first, in the case of Mahaweli IV, to continue
extending the effectiveness date; and finally, canceling the Loan/Credits for
both projects. For obvious reasons, quantitative data on financial and
physical implementation of the projects, and on their benefits and impact are
not available.
4.          Findings/Lessons Learned.  In continuing to support the Mahaweli
Project until the last moment, the Bank acted prudently, with the Government's
best interests in mind and taking into account the broader political
ramifications. In so doing, it managed to maintain good relations, both with
the Government and the donors. The cancellation of the Credit for RD III was
more straightforward than for Mahaweli IV. Early Bank supervision missions
reported a generally satisfactory project start, but the security situation in
the project area deteriorated steadily thereafter to the point where the Bank
and the Government finally agreed to cancel the remaining amount of the
Credit.

PART I - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANRK' S PERCEPTIVE
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        This PCR is unusual in the sense that it concerns one project that
was not implemented, and another that was only marginally implemented. In the
case of Mahaweli IV, although the long delay between Board approval and
effectiveness was caused by the withdrawal of one of the cofinanciers, the
ultimate reason for the cancellation of Loan/Credits for both projects was the
same: the security situation in the respective project areas. Serious ethnic
conflict erupted in July 1983, between the Sinhalese and Tamil parts of the
country's population. The conflict spread with increasing intensity from the
northern part of the country, where the RD III project area is situated, to
the east, where Mahaweli IV was to be implemented. A break in the hostilities
appeared imminent in July 1987, when a Peace Accord was signed between the
Governments of Sri Lanka and India by which India would maintain a peace-
keeping force in the contested areas, and the Government of Sri Lanka would
attempt to negotiate a settlement with the Tamil leaders. Prolonged
negotiations, however, had no positive results, and the armed conflict flared
up again. Eventually, the Xndian troops withdrew, and as of November 1991
there appears to be no immediate solution to the conflict in sight.
2.        The causes of the delay in effectiveness of the Mahaweli IV
Loan/Credit, the suspension of disbursements from the RD III Credit, and the
eventual cancellation of both projects were, therefore, extraneous to the
specifics of the projects. Apart from the estimated economic rate of return
in the case of Mahaweli IV, more narrowly project-related topics and issues
which usually form the core of project completion reports had no bearing on
the Bank's decisions. For this reason, the present report deviates from the
guidelines usually followed in preparing project completion reports. There
was little implementation and there were no apparent benefits, and it would
serve no useful purpose to speculate how preparation, design, Bank or Borrower
performance would have affected project results had the projects gone forward.
3.        Instead, the present report will concentrate on the issues and
considerations that played a role in Bank decisions; first, in the case of
Mahaweli IV, to continue extending the effectiveness date; and, finally,
canceling the Loan/Credits for both projects. The present report will start
with a brief discussion of the broader political and macroeconomic context in
which both projects were conceived, and in which the Bank's assistance
strategy and the Government's own development strategy fitted. This will be
followed by two sections on the individual projects.

4.        For obvious reasons, quantitative data on financial and physical
implementation of the projects, and on their benefits and impact, are abeent.
Therefore, the present completion report does not include the usual project
completion data that, according to the guidelines should contain an accurate
and comprehensive profile of the project at the time of completion. Some
estimates of the manpower costs to the Bank of both projects and, ill the case
of RD III, of the use made of the 11 percent of the Credit that was disbursed,
will be made in appropriate places in the text.
B. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Government and Bank Strateav
5.        The two projects under review had in common that they were parts rf
several large development programs a newly elected Government had initiated
upon taking office in late 1977. The 1977 elections marked a sharp turning
point in the Government's economic policies and in its relations with the
foreign donors who formed the Sri Lanka Aid Group./ The new Government had
inherited a very difficult economic situation. The previous Government's
system of pervasive state controls had caused economic stagnation, shortages
and severe unemployment. The new Government stressed a major increase in
employment through rapid growth and development of the country's natural
resources. Its program included liberalization of the economy through greater
reliance on market forces and a vast public investment program, of which the
Accelerated Mahaweli Development Program (AMDP) was the largest, most capital-
intensive element. The Aid Group members responded with unprecedented amounts
of financial assistance to support the new economic prlicies.
MahaweliV
6.        The multipurpose Mahaweli Ganga Development Program has been an
important part of the Government's development efforts for about thirty years.
After some initial discussion and study, a Mahaweli Development Master Plan
was prepared jointly by a UNDP/FAO team and Sri Lankan engineers in 1965-1968.
It envisaged development in three phases over a 30-year period of about
365,000 ha of irrigable land, as well as about 500 MW of hydropower.
Implementation of the Master Plan started in 1970, with the Bank participating
in two projects (paras 13-15).
7.        Late in 1977, however, the new Government announced its decision to
speed up the implementation of the Master Plan. To help solve the country's
!/The Sri Lanka Aid Group, composed of a number of multi- and bilateral-aid
agencies, meets annually under chairmanship of the Bank to discuss assistance
to Sri Lanka.
YThe following two paragraphs provide a brief synopsis of the Mahaweli
Program. For a more comprehensive discussion of the program, and the Bank's
posture toward it, see OED Report No. 6074, dated February 24, 1986, "The
World Bank and Sri Lanka -- A Review of a Relationship."

persistent employment problems and the severe food and power shortages more
quickly, it had drawn up the AMDP, which included five major reservoirs and
three hydroplants with a total power capacity of 500-600 MW, and downstream
development of about 112,000 ha. The Government entered into direct contacts
with several bilateral donors who were eager to support the relatively easy-
to-implement large capital works involved that were also attractive to
commercial interests in their home countries.
8.        Late in 1977, the Government requested the Bank to support AMDP,
followed, in early 1978, by a request to coordinate international support for
it. These requests put the Bank in a somewhat awkward position. It had not
been involved in the preparation of ANDP, which was, in fact, launched by the
Government before full engineering and economic studies were available. The
Bank decided to support AMDP in principle, agreed to the start-up of some
components and advocated Aid Group support, after the Government had agreed to
have an Implementation Strategy Study carried out to recommend a plan of
implementation. The Bank also accepted its role as coordinator of the
financial assistance rather hesitantly. When the request was made, bilateral
negotiations were already far advanced, and the scope of the program was
substantially decided. The Bank made it clear at the 1978 Aid Group meeting
that it would act as a coordinator only after it was understood and agreed by
all parties that the Bank would not interfere with individual bilateral
discussions, but would only attempt to ensure that in those discussions no
elements of the program were left uncovered.
Rural Development
9.        The Government's Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) was
much less controversial than ANDP. It was initiated in 1979 to counterbalance
to some extent the large, centrally controlled investments, particularly the
Mahaweli scheme. In contrast to the large investment programs, the rural
development program was designed as a smaller, low-cost and quick-maturing
program that would benefit large numbers of low-income rural dwellers. The
program also follows from the Government's decision to decentralize
development efforts. It encourages "grass roots" institutional development at
district and village levels. The program consists of a number of individual
district projects, implemented by the district administrations under general
guidance and support of the Central Government. The individual projects were
geared to the specific needKs of the districts, and to an extent to the wishes
of the sponsoring donors.
Economic Developments
10.       The response of Sri Lanka's economy to the Government's 1977
economic program was rapid. Except for the tree crop sector, virtually the
entire economy grew. Exports, employment and real incomes advanced. In a
remarkably short time, the major capital components of the AMDP were well
under way. As a result of the second oil shock, however, the international
economic tide started turning against Sri Lanka in 1979. Rampant
international inflation caused substantial cost increases in Sri Lanka's
investment program. Also, because of relatively low export prices, the
Government found it difficult to generate higher levels of domestic savings.



4
By 1980, the economy showed serious signs of .verheating, with unsustainable
budget and balance of payments deficits.
11.       Initialli, the Government attempted to cover the deficits by short-
term borrowing. But when the longer-term nature of the economic problems
became more evident in the early 1980s, the Government and the Aid Group began
to respond. The emphasis in Bank and IMF reports, and in discussions at the
Aid Group meetings, shifted from the Government's expansionary new economic
policies to what were essentially stabilization issues. The Government had to
take some painful decisions. Tighter discipline was imposed on Government
spending and commercial borrowing, and fewer new projects were started. Cuts
in the Mahaweli Program, however, were limited, as the Government felt that
because of the political, financial and contractual commitments already made,
the program could not really be rephased or altered to any signific-.nt degree.
12.       Just as the stabilization efforts were becoming effective in 1983,
the ethnic conflict broke out with far-reaching negative consequences for the
economy, including delays in the execution of the public investment program.
In spite of continued financial shortages, however, the Government remained
for a long time committed to carrying out the Mahaweli Program. Particularly
after the Peace Accord of July 1987, in its negotiations with Tamil leaders,
it attached great political significance to continuing development in the
contested areas. When the Peace Accord fell through, however, the Government
began to recognize that given the financial stringency, an overstretched
capability to execute new projects, and deteriorating existing assets, a new
economic course was called for. It now recognizes that projects that
rehabilitate and intensify the use of existing assets, and have high rates of
return, should have highest priority in the investment programs.

TheaPlace of Mahaweli IV in the Mahaweli Program
13.       At the time of inception of Mahaweli IV, towards the end of 1982,
the Bank had made four investments in the Mahaweli Program: two before the
Government accelerated the program in late 1977, and two thereafter. The
first project was approved in 1970 and completed successfully in 1978. It
provided water supply to about 53,000 ha of existing irrigated land, and to
about 29,000 ha of unirrigated land to be developed later. Parallel financing
provided for a 40 MW hydropower plant. The second project was approved in
April 1977 and completed in 1985. With cofinancing from Canada, the
Nether!&..is, the UK, the US and the EEC, it provided for construction work and
social infrastructure on the 29,000 ha of newly irrigated land provided by
Mahaweli I. The project was audited by OED, and the audit report noted that
"the Mahaweli II project should be considered successful in regard to
attaining major objectives ...," but that "the project ERR has been
recalculated at -1% (21% at appraisal), mainly due to much lower actual and
forecast prices for rice than those that prevailed at the time of
appraisal."
14.       The first Bank project under the Government's AMDP was a technical
assistance (TA) credit in 1980 (with EEC cofinancing) for consultants' studies
of the transbasin water diversion and other studies related to proposed future
projects. The TA project made a useful contribution to the implementation of
AMDP and provided useful on-the-job training by the consultants of Sri Lankan
staff. The second Bank project under AMDP (Mahaweli III), with cofinancing
from Japan and the Kuwait Fund, was approved in 1981 and scheduled to be
completed in 1987. It is still not completed, however, partly due to the
difficulties described in paras 11 and 12 above.
15.       The purpose of Mahaweli III is to provide full irrigation supply
for about 24,000 ha of land newly irrigated with water that had become
available from headworks financed by bilateral agencies under the AMDP
umbrella. This set a pattern, agreed at Aid Group meetings, by which
bilateral agencies generally would finance the large capital works, including
hydropower plants, and the Bank would stand ready to serve as a lender of last

resort for down-stream irrtgation development. The Mahaweli IV project fits
entirely into this patte"t
Orkins of Mahaweli IV
16.       Towards the end of 1982, one of the major headworks of the AMDP,
the Maduru Oya Project, was nearing completion. That project, financed by
Canada, consisted of a dam and reservoir on the Maduru Oya River, together
with works to divert Mahaweli Ganga water into the reservoir. Since the
project had only limited hydropower potential, its main justification was
providing water for downstream irrigation development in an area known as
System B. Feasibility studies and detailed designs had been carried out by
Canadian and U.S financed consulting firms. At that time, downstream
development on the left bank of the Maduru Oya had already started with
external financing from USAID, the EEC, the Saudi Fund for Development,
Australia and the OPEC Fund. But there were no concrete plans yet to start
development on the right banrs.
17.       Completion of the Maduru Oya was somewhat ahead of schedule.  The
Canadian authorities, who were planning to become involved in the downstream
development on the ri&.it bank, were faced with a dilemma: to demobilize the
Canadian contractor working on the dam, or to convince the Government to
advance right bank development so that costs could be saved by retaining the
contractor. By October 1982, the Canadians had found the Saudi Fund prepared
to participate, but there was still a considerable financing gap. The
Canadian authorities then approached the Bank, which agreed tentatively to
participate after it was understood that the Bank would be "lead agency," and
that there was no objection on the Bank's part to continued work by the
Canadian contractor on the Nagolla Dee-ela Kadiunne-ela (NDK) dam and feed.
canal before formal Bank Board approval. The Government of Sri Lanka made a
formal request for Bank financing in March 1983. The project was subsequently
appraised by a joint Bank/CIDA mission in June/July 1983, and approved by the
Bank's Board in June 1984.
Proiect Features
18.       Conceptually, the Mahaweli IV Project was very similar to the Bank-
financed Mahaweli downstream development projects that had preceded it. It
would provide facilities for new irrigation and settlement on about 14,000 ha;
improvements on an additional 1,800 ha of existing cultivated land; and some
development of conservation forests, fuelwood, cashew plantations and
fisheries. It would also include: management facilities, staff quarters and
vehicles; social infrastructure and settlement assistance; monitoring,
training and the development of crop cultivation programs.
19.       At appraisal, total project cost was estimated at about US$160.1
million. Cofinanciers would finance about US$132.1 million (Bank/IDA US$42.1
million, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) US$40 million
equivalent, and the Saudi Fund for Development US$50.1 million equivalent);
and the Government the remaining US$28 million. Broadly, the Bank/IDA
contribution would finance the irrigation distribution and drainage systems,
roads and land development, as well as settlement assistance. The Canadian



7
contribution would be for the NDK dam and feeder caral, social infrastructure
and training and monitoring, and consultants' services. The Saudi Fund's
contribution would be for main and branch canal construction. The cofinancing
arrangements would be in the nature of parallel financing by which the
components financed by each participant would be procured in accordance with
their respective procedures.
Proiect Issues
20.       The major issues that came up between identification and Board
approval were threefold: macroeconomic considerations, cost recovery, and the
economic rate of return. The macroeconomic conslderations centered on the
question whether it was appropriate to start a new large capital investment
project in Sri Lanka at a time when the economy was seriously overheated,
budget cuts had to be made, and the public investment program had to be
delayed. High-level discussions on this subject took place within the Bank
just before and after project appraisal in June/July 1983. In the end, it was
decided to go ahead with the project on the basis of the argument that if the
Bank withdrew, it would risk unnecessary damage to the relations with the
Government and donors who were already proceeding with implementation of
components of Mahaweli IV. It was also thought that questions of size and
composition of public investment programs could be addressed more
appropriately in the framework of structural adjustment lending, which was
being considered at the time. This, however, never materialized.
21.       As in many other countries, cost recovery and the imposition of an
adequate level of land development and water charges had been a perennial
problem in Sri Lanka. Attempts had been made in previous Bank irrigation
projects to address the probilema, but so far without much success. Once again,
relevant covenants were included in the Loan/Development Credit Agreements of
this project to increase recovery of operation and maintenance costs of
irrigation projects and to implement a program of transfer of land rights to
beneficiaries coupled with fees to recover land improvement costs. Similar
covenants were again included in the Bank's next project in the irrigation
sector: the Major Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1537-CE),
approved in December 1984.
22.       The economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 12 percent at
appraisal.  For that reason it was considered a marginal p:oject, but Bank
management was persuaded to go ahead on the basis of a number of arguments in
favor:
the Bank would maintain its influence in policy issues, such as
cost recovery;
the project would make productive use of large investments already

23.       During the long period of delay between Board approval in June 1984
and Effectiveness in January 1988, when the originally agreed cofinancing was
being rearranged, it became clear that a combination of cost increases and
lower forecasts of rice prices would adversely affect the economic rate of
return. In fact, in 1986 and 1988 the ERR was tentatively re-estimated at
about three percent. But even then the Bank remained committed to financing
its share of the project, first because its support was key in the
negotiations between the Government and potential cofinanciers, and later
because the project had gained important political significance, as it would
mainly serve Tamil settlers, would address Tamil grievances and would be of
help in the Government's peace negotiations.
Cofinancing Difficulties
24.       At the time of Board approval, the Bank had received firm
declarations of intent from its prospective cofinanciers, Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Saudi Fund for Development
(SFD). Effectiveness of the Bank's Loan/Credit was dependent on effectiveness
of their contributions. Soon after Board approval, however, communications
ceased between SFD and the Government. Verbal enquiries solicited evasive
answers, and written correspondence remained unanswered.
25.       This was the beginning of a long period of uncertainty in which the
Government probed other potential cofinanciers about taking the place of SFD.
But others were hesitant to enter the scene before the Sri Lankan Government
had formally declared that it was no longer seeking Saudi financial
participation.  The Government was slow in doing so.  It was not until the
June 1986 Aid Group meeting that a solution started presenting itself. The
SFD had no objection to others taking its place, and the EEC expressed its
willingness to finance part of the project component that would have been
financed by SFD. Aided by the Bank, negotiations between the EEC and the
Government started and on October 30, 1987 an EEC grant of ECU 25 million
(US$28.5 million equivalent) was approved and declared effective. At that
time, the Government had entered into negotiation with the Japanese Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) about financing the remaining parts of the
original Saudi component.
26.       When the EEC grant was declared effective, however, the Bank could
still not declare its Loan/Credit effective because the arrangements between
Sri Lanka and Canada had not yet been completed. The Canadian authorities had
initially approved financing and completion of the NDK dam and feeder canal
(completed in March 1986), but the Canadian Treasury Board had withheld
approval of a CIDA grant for the other components to be financed by Canada.
The main outstanding issue was an adequate representation of Tamil-speaking
farmers among the settlers. The CIDA grant (US$43 million equivalent) was
finally approved in January 1988, whereupon the Bank declared its Loan/Credit
effective. Later, in July 1988, an agreement was concluded between the
Government of Sri Lanka and OECF on a soft loan of US$67 million equivalent to
finance the remaining parts originally to be financed by SFD.

Cancllaion
27.       When the Bank Loan/Credit were declared effective, however, the
security situation in the project area had deteriorated so much that no start
could be made. Periods of optimism and pessimism followed the ups and downs
of the peace negotiations. With the Closing Date approaching (March 31, 1990)
and no quick solution to the ethnic strife in sight, the Bank was faced with
the decision to cancel its Loan/Credit or to extend the Closing Date. Apart
from the seemingly insoluble political problems, economic considerations, such
as the low ERR and the low priority of the project in the country's new
development strategy (para 12) added to the Bank's concern. The Government,
however, continued to attach high political priority to the project.
28.       In October 1989, the Bank suggested to the Government that it
establish a small task force to review all relevant aspects of the project, on
the basis of which decisions could be made by all participants on the future
of the project. The task force was to concentrate particularly on prospects
for reducing project costs, increasing benefits, increasing commercial
activities, and shortening the project implementation period.
29.       The Task Force report was reviewed by the Bank and representatives
of all three cofinanciers in February 1990. The conclusion reached by the
Bank was that some improvements in costs and benefits seemed possible, but
that the revised estimates appeared overly optimistic so that the expected ERR
would remain low.  At the recommendation of the Bank's final mission, Bank
management subsequently decided to cancel the Loan/Credit at the Closing Date
of March 31, 1990 on the grounds of:
*    the project's marginal rate of return;
*    the Government's weakened implementation capabilities as witnessed
by the large delays in the implementation of Mahaweli III;
*    the shift of priorities in the Government's investment program
towards rehabilitation; and
*    the continued bad security situation.
Subsequently, all cofinanciers followed suit.
Conclusio
30.       The extraneous circumstances leading up to the cancellation of
Mahaweli IV are so unique that it is difficult to distill lessons of wider
interest to the Bank, other than perhaps to state that it is difficult to
change the course of a project of such size and complexity once it gets under
way. But even with the benefit of hindsight, it is difficult to argue that
the Bank should have acted differently. In conclusion, it can be said that in
continuing to support the project until the last moment, the Bank has acted
prudently, with the Government's best interests in mind, and taking into
account the broader political ramifications. In doing so, it has managed to
maintain good relations, both with the Government and the other donors.



10
31.       On supervision missions and at headquarters, the technical staff
involved has always been active in taking all possible preparatory steps to
ensure a rapid start-up once the circumstances would permit it. This
involved, in 1985, financing from remaining funds under the Bank's own
Mahaweli TA Credit, consultants' studies and the preparation of tender
documents that would have been financed by the Saudi participation. Later, at
the time of renewed negotiations with cofinanciers, it made sure that all
project elements remained covered and, after effectiveness, that consultant
services were lined up to ensure a speedy start. The Bank's activities
created a good deal of goodwill with the Government, and the costs to the Bank
in terms of manpower were not high. Supervision of Mahaweli IV was always
undertaken in conjunction with supervision of other Mahaweli projects in
execution. The project, which had cost 98 staffweeks up to Board approval,
cost another 29 staffweeks on supervision over the entire six-year period
FY85-FY90.

D. THIRD RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Proiect Identity
Project Name:             Third Rural Development Project
Credit No.:               Credit 1363-CE of SDR 21.4 million (US$23.0 million
equivalent)
Vice Presidential Unit:  Asia
Country:                  Sri Lanka
Sector:                   Agriculture
Subsector:                Rural Development
The Proiect
32.       The cancellation of the Credit for RD III was much less complicated
than that of Mahaweli IV. As mentioned earlier (para 9), the Government's
Integrated Rural Development Program, initiated in 1979, consists of
individual district projects implemeiited by district administrations under
general guidance and support of the Central Government. RD III was one of
those projects. It aimed at increasing productivity, employment, income and
living standards in the districts of Mannar and Vavuniya. It included
rehabilitation of irrigation works; forestry and horticultural development;
provision of inputs and services; and the development of economic and social
infrastructure.
33.       At appraisal, in November 1982, the project was judged to face no
major risks. It was patterned after similar ongoing projects that were being
implemented successfully, some of which were financed or supervised by the
Bank. No major issues came -up during project or Credit preparation. The
Credit was approved by the Board in May 1983 and declared effective in
November thereafter.
SusDension of Disbursements and Cancellation
34.       By the time the Credit was declared effective the ethnic conflict
had broken out. Early Bank supervision reports speak of a generally
satisfactory project start. In the course of 1985, however, the conflict
spread to the project area; it became impossible for Bank staff to visit the
area and for most local staff and contractors to continue project execution.
35.       As of January 13, 1986, the Government agreed to an informal
stoppage of disbursements under which it would not submit any disbursement
requests for expenses incurred after January 13, 1986. When the security
situation did not improve, this was replaced by a formal suspension of
disbursements as of March 13, 1986, except for expenses incurred before
January 13, 1986. The security situation remained poor thereafter, and the



12
suspension was never lifced.  After the Closing Date of September 30, 1989,
the Government and the Bank agreed to cancel the remaining amount of the
Credit as of January 15, 1990. By that time about 11 percent of the Credit
had been disbursed:
Original Amount      SDR     21,400,000
Disbursed            SDR      2.406,226
Canceled             SDR     18,993,774
Issues During Susnension
36.       During the time disbursements were suspended, two issues came up
that required the Bank's attention. First, some twenty newly ordered project
vehicles had arrived in the port of Colombo and could not be delivered to the
project area. Second, the Government was in default with respect to
submitting audited project accounts.
37.       The Bank was concerned that the project vehicles that had arrived
should be used for development purposes. After weighing some alternatives,
the Government, the Bank and IFAD agreed that the vehicles would be taken over
by an IFAD-financed, but Bank-executed new rural development project, the
Kegalle Rural Development Project, implementation of which had started in
1987.
38.       The only consolidated audited project accounts ever received were
for 1983. Some unaudited accounts were received from individual project
offices for later years, which stated that all project activities were stopped
March 31, 1986, and that all financial accounts submitted after that date were
confined to the settlement of liabilities incurred prior to March 31, 1986.
The Bank kept pressing for audited accounts, but none were received. The
matter was deemed important, because the Bank did not want the Government to
be in default in the event of a lifting of the suspension. After that became
unlikely, the matter was not pursued any further. No explanation was ever
given for the failure to submit audited accounts, but it probably had to do
with the auditor's own inability to visit the project area.
39.       According to the Bank's own accounts, 51 percent of the disbursed
amount was for civil works; 42 percent for equipment, vehicles, livestock and
furniture; and 7 percent for consultancies and training. Without the
possibility to visit the project area, it is impossible to ascertain what has
become of the goods and services financed by the disbursements. The total
cost to the Bank in terms of manpower was 75 staffweeks in project and Credit
preparation, and 28 staffweeks on supervision. Of the latter, about 7 or 8
staffweeks were incurred after the suspension of disbursements.
