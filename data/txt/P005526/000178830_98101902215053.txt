INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Sultanate of Oman for the equivalent of US$5.7 million to help
finance an education project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, in-
cluding 5 years of grace, with interest of 7-1/4 percent per annum. The
United Nations Development Programme and the Overseas nevelopment Administra-
tion of the United Kingdom will also participate in the financing of this
project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report on "The Economy of Oman" dated September 12,
1972 (EME 55a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on September 22,
1972 (R72-221). An economic mission visited Oman in November/December 1973
and is preparing its report. Its main findings are given below. Country
data are provided in Annex I.
3.        The Sultanate of Oman covers an area of almost 260,000 sq. km.
With the exception of the narrow fertile coastal plain in the north, a number
of oases in the interior and parts of the plain in Dhofar, the country is
mostly desert or mountainous terrain. The Hajar mountains receive about 10
inches of rainfall mostly in the winter, a considerable portion of which
percolates underground and supplies the interior of Oman and the Batinah
Coast, (which receives no more than 4 inches of rainfall a year), with water
for irrigation and domestic use throughout the year. The Dhofar province
receives about 25 inches of rainfall a year mainly from the summer monsoons.
4.        The Sultanate of Oman is an independent monarchy.  Sultan Qaboos
bin Said, who replaced his father Sultan Said bin Taimur in July 1970, has
effected a number of political and social reforms and removed many of the
restrictions imposed on the people by the former regime. Such reforms have
attracted back a number of Omanis who had hitherto lived abroad. The Sultan,
who is also the Prime Minister, rules the country through the cabinet which
is the highest executive body in Oman. There are as yet no representative
bodies in the country. The Government is engaged in a guerrilla war in the
southern province of Dhofar, that was originallv started a decade earlier.
More recently, this has grown into a political movement known as the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arab Gulf (PFLOAG).  Sustaining
military operations against this movement continues to constitute a major
drain on the resources of Oman.
5.        Little is known about the size of the population of Oman, its cha-
racteristics or geographical distribution. Estimates of total population



vary from a low of 450,000 to a high of one million. On present evidence,
a population figure of 600,000, with an annual rate of growth of about 3
percent, is considered to be the most plausible estimate. The Batinah coast
and a few oases in the interior are the most densely populated areas. About
80 percent of the population are employed in agriculture and fisheries and
the remainder in construction, trade, services and handicrafts. Little is
also known about the mineral resources of the country other than oil. Small
quantities of copper, silver and other minerals have been mined in the past
and deposits of manganese, copper and asbestos are known to exist. However,
the mineral potential of Oman has yet to be established and the Government
has contracted two foreign firms to investigate the mineral wealth of the
country. On the other hand, oil in commercial quantities was discovered in
1964 and exports of crude oil started in 1967. The main oil fields are
located in the Al-Rub Al Khali (Empty Quarter), about 250 miles west of Muscat.
Omani crude oil is of good quality with low sulphur and wax content. Total
proven reserves are modest, and are currently estimated at 300 million tons -
equivalent to between fifteen and twenty years of production at present levels.
Exploration activities in the interior by the Petroleum Development (Oman) Ltd.
(PD(O)), which is the only producer and major concessionaire, are continuing.
Two other companies, which have recently been awarded offshore concessions,
are expected to commence exploration work soon. Though Oman is not a member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or the Organization
of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), the PD(O) Ltd. has, in prac-
tice, matched price and other adjustments negotiated with the various oil
companies in the area.
Recent Economic Performance
6.        Prior to the discovery of oil, Oman had a subsistence economy
entirely dependent on limited agriculture and fishing.  The economy probably
grew very slowly, if at all.  Since 1967 when oil exports began, gross na-
tional product at current prices has grown at an annual rate of about 22
percent per year.  During the period 1967-70, oil was the leading sector
responsible for these high rates of growth as oil production and exports
increased from some 20 million barrels in 1967 to over 120 million barrels
by 1970. However, oil production declined in 1971 and 1972 due to technical
problems. Adoption of new production techniques has now overcome these
difficulties. Oil production reached 106 million barrels in 1973, marginally
above 1972 but still below the 1970 level. Government revenue from oil was
estimated at $198 million in 1973. The contribution of the oil sector to
GDP did not decline to the same extent because of the rise in crude oil
export prices. Between 1971 and 1973 construction and public administration
replaced oil as the leading growth sectors. It is expected, however, that
with the anticipated increase in oil production and prices in 1974, oil will
again resume its preeminent role. Meanwhile, the production of the traditional
sectors has virtually stagnated. Output of agricultural products and fish
has increased by about 3 percent per year while non-oil exports in 1973
declined to about half their 1967 value. GNP at market prices in 1973 is
estimated at OR 136 million ($395 million) and the per capita income is ex-
pected to reach OR 226 ($655) as compared with a per capita income of OR 84



($201) in 1967 and less than OR 40 ($100) in earlier years. However, in
spite of the relatively high per capita income and the high rates of growth
in the recent past, Oman remains extremely underdeveloped reflecting decades
of poverty and neglect.
7.        The relatively high level of income generated has enabled the
economy to sustain high levels of expenditure. This is particularly true
in the post-1970 period when the Government launched major investment projects
aimed at providing the minimum standard of economic and social infrastructure
as well as a substantially increased defense effort designed to cope with
the uprising in the Dhofar province. Gross capital formation increased from
15 to 35 percent of GNP between 1970 and 1973 while the ratio of defense
expenditures to GNP grew from 14 to 31 percent over the same period. Because
of the increase in defense expenditure as well as the recurrent expenditure
brought about by investment in social infrastructure (education, health,
housing, etc.), the ratio of national savings to gross national product dec-
lined from 59 percent in 1970 to 30 percent in 1973. Over the same period
the ratio of public to total consumption increased from 38 to almost 61 per-
cent. Gross fixed investment which as a percentage of GNP had been declin-
ing between 1967 and 1970, increased sharplv in 1971, and averaged around 35
percent of GNP between 1971 and 1973.  Up to 1970, the oil sector accounted
for the bulk of fixed investment. However, the ratio of investment in the
oil sector to total investment declined from almost 75 percent in 1970 to
about 30 percent in 1973. Over the same period, the ratio of public to total
investment increased from around 10 to almost 60 percent.  Private investment
outside the oil sector has remained around 10-15 percent of the total. Private
consumption outside the oil sector is estimated to have increased by 22 per-
cent per year during 1970-1973. However, this increase was unequally distri-
buted as between regions and income groups.
8.        The higher levels of public expendituires, particularly for capital
projects and defense since 1970, brought about a marked deterioration in the
financial position of the Government. The budget which showed a surplus of
OR 25 million in 1970, registered its first deficits of about OR 18.6 million
in 1972 and OR 23 million in 1973. This deterioration took place in spite of
a 40 percent increase in revenue resulting from successive upward revisions in
oil prices and in the Government's share which reached OR 68 million in 1973.
Between 1970 and 1973, development expenditures increased from an estimated
OR 0.3 million in 1970 to OR 30 million in 1973 while defense expenditures
rose from an estimated OR 12 million to about OR 42 million in 1973. The
overall budgetary deficits in 1972 and 1973 were financed partly by short-term
borrowing from banks at home and abroad and partly by drawing down Government
reserves. The increased level of economic activity and Government operations
brought about a substantial increase in money supply which grew from OR 7.6
million in 1970 to over OR 22 million in 1973, an average annual rate of
increase of about 42 percent.  As a result of the expanded Government expend-
itures and the limited produiction capacity of the economy, inflationary pres-
sures were exerted on prices, wages and rents.
9.        The balance of payments of Oman experienced similar trends.  Oil ex-
ports which are the major component of the balance of payments, stagnated in



-4-
1971 and 1972 because of a decline in oil production while Government expendi-
tures were increasing at a substantial rate. As a result, the balance of pay-
ments moved from a surplus position of about OR 30 million in 1970 to its first
deficit position of around OR 16 million in 1972 and an estimated deficit of
about OR 24 million in 1973. The country's gross foreign exchange reserves
declined from OR 60 million in 1971 to about OR 30 million in 1973, equivalent
to about 5 months of imports of goods and services at the 1973 level. However,
with the rise in oil prices and output, Oman is expected to move to a surplus
financial position both on the balance of payments and the budget, beginning
in 1974 and probably continuing to the end of the decade.
Development Potential
10.       The Government's development policy has, since 1970, aimed at the
creation of the essential infrastructure, the provision for the needs in
education, health and housing, the initiation of resource studies and efforts
at institution building, with the first two aims receiving the highest prior-
ity. The allocation of development expenditure reflected these aims and the
priorities assigned by the Government to each. The heavy investment program
undertaken by the Government since 1970 has resulted in the completion of a
reasonably adequate network of roads, a modern port and airport, and the im-
pressive gains made in education, health and housing. However, it has had
little spread effect, and has taxed both the country's financial resources
and its fragile administrative and institutional set up. Severe manpower
shortages were only marginally relieved by the efforts of the Government to
induce educated Omanis to return to the country. Oman is now entering a new
and, probably, a more difficult phase in its economic development. The re-
cent substantial rise in oil prices is expected to relieve the strain on
financial resources of the country and to result in a surplus financial
position throughout the decade. However, the country's development efforts
in the future are likely to continue to be constrained bv manpower shortages,
inadequate knowledge about investment opportunities and the weaknesses of
institutions in practically all fields. Dealing with these constraints is
likely to prove more difficult and time-consuming than during the first stages
of development when the Government addressed itself to the more obvious needs.
In order to cope with these new constraints, the Government is currently
attempting to reorient its development strategy towards manpower training
and institution building as the highest priority with less emphasis placed on
social and economic infrastructure.   In so doing, it has turned to the in-
ternational community including the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the UNDP and bilateral aid donors for technical aassistance in manpower
training and institution building.
11.       The financial position and prospects for Oman over the next five
years are good mainly as a result of the developments in the oil sector.
These include not only the recent price increases, but also an expected 30
percent increase in oil production in 1974, as well as Oman's recent purchase
of a 25 percent participation in the oil company. It is projected that GNP
may grow by 25 percent annually to 1979. A substantial surplus on the bal-
ance of payments leading to a high level of foreign exchange reserves is



- 5-
expected to develop by the end of 1974 and may continue for the remainder of
the decade. In spite of that, Oman needs to continue to look for foreign
aid not so much for the capital transfer element but mainly because of the
value of technical assistance and institution building components that can
be associated with such borrowing.
External Assistance
12.       Up till recently the Government of Oman has shown little desire to
borrow externally for capital development projects. The major development
projects inaugurated to date have been financed on a cash basis from Govern-
ment resources, without recourse to bilateral or international aid channels.
However, Oman has, since 1967, received technical assistance from bilateral
donors particularly the United Kingdom, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia.  Over the past year, the Government, faced with a deteriorating fi-
nancial position, seems to have modified its policies of financing development
projects exclusively out of its own resources. As a result, Oman contracted
its first two medium-term loans mainlv from private sources in 1973. These
were loans of $35 million from the Eurodollar market, and of $25 million
equivalent in Arabian Peninsula currencies. Though both loans were original-
ly contracted to finance future development projects, they were fully dis-
bursed in December 1973 and partly used to pay for a part of the 25 percent
equity participation in the Petroleum Development (Oman) Ltd. At the end of
December 1973, Oman's outstanding external debt amounted to the $60 million
mentioned above, all of which has been disbursed. Debt service payments are
scheduled to begin in 1975 and would amount to $3.1 million in that year
equivalent to 1.6 percent of exports of goods and services at 1973 levels.
Debt service payments are projected to grow to $21.6 million by 1978, but the
debt-service ratio -- given the rapid growth in oil exports - is not expect-
ed to be more than 2 percent. Oman can service substantial additional borrow-
ing on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROIP ACTIVITIES
13.       There have been no Bank Group operations to date in Oman.  The coun-
try's economic situation and prospects suggest a threefold strategy for the
Bank: (i) helping to overcome the major immediate constraints to development
- the absence of information and statistics, trained manpower and essential
institutions; (ii) helping to broaden the benefits of growth, especiallv
through assistance to the agricultural and social service sectors; and (iii)
helping to devise and implement a long-term strategy for the diversification
of Oman's economy.
14.       Lending activityr would be used primarily as a vehicle for the
creation of essential institutions and the provision of technical assistance,
as well as a means of directing local financial resources toward specific
high priority objectives. It would be unrealistic to anticipate that this



- 6 -
contribution could be ma'de to Oman's development without some direct in-
volvement through project lending. However, to counteract the capital transfer
effect of its borrowing, the Government has agreed to off-setting arrangements
with the Bank. It has subscribed $5 million to the March 74 two-year bond
issue and has agreed to lend to the Bank $30 million with interest at 8 percent
per annum and average maturity of about 15 years.
15.       The first three projects in the lending program are designed to
help overcome the most serious constraints to Oman's development: the short-
ages of trained manpower, essential institutions, a data base, a project pipe-
line and established guidelines and procedures for the efficient use of the
country's oil-generated resources.  The proposed education project would ini-
tiate the lending program, and will begin dealing with Oman's long-term re-
quirements for trained manpower. A proposed technical assistance project
will focus on the country's medium-term needs for appropriate institutions,
a development strategy and investment program, and project identification and
preparation work. A power project, presently under consideration, will help
introduce short-term improvements in the way in which the Government uses its
resources, particularly in the procurement of goods and services. In later
years, agricultural projects will have priority, with an emphasis on irrigation
and agricultural credit activities. IFC has made no investments in Oman but
has expressed an interest in a proposed cement factory, port operating company,
and fertilizer operation.
PART III - THE EDIJCATION SECTOPR
16.       The modern education sector in Oman is barely three years old.
Prior to 1970 there were only three government primary schools in the coun-
try, enrolling 900 students. There were about 4,800 children in 50 Koranic
schools, which provided basic religious and literacy training in mosques,
private houses or under trees. A trade school was opened in 1967 by the
oil company - PD (0) Ltd -- but most of its students were foreigners. There
was no secondary education, no agricultural or teacher training of any kind.
Wealthy families who wished to educate their children had to send them abroad,
usually illegally, to schools in the Gulf or elsewhere.
17.       The modernization process in Oman began in earnest after the ac-
cession of Sultan Qaboos in 1970. Initially development expenditure was
concentrated almost exclusively into physical infrastructure - roads, ports
and airports. However, the demand for schools and hospitals was immediate,
and capital and recurrent expenditure for social services increased drama-
tically between 1971 and 1972.
18.       In the past three years, primary school enrollment has increased
very rapidly. Junior secondary education, covering grades 7 to 9, was intro-
duced to Oman in 1972. A Ministry of Education was created in 1971, and
broad educational goals devised with the help of expatriate advisors.



-7-
19.       Despite these developments the education sector in Oman is among
the least developed in the world. Primary education, in the modern sense,
began onlv in 1970. In 1972/73 there were about 25,000 students in govern-
ment primary schools, or about 24 percent of the age group of 6 to 11 years.
Junior general secondary education began only in 1972, and in 1972/73, there
were still no upper secondary schools. The total secondary school enrollment
of about 150 represents less than one quarter of one percent of the relevant
age group. Technical education consists essentially of a limited trade school.
There are no facilities for teacher or agricultural training, or practically
oriented adult education. Because admission to the new schools is unrestrict-
ed, almost 90% of the students are overage. Almost 40% are four or more years
overage. The resulting mixture of students from ages six to fifteen in the
same classes is educationally unsound, and wasteful as many overage students
will not complete six years of primary education, or even enough to achieve
permanent literacy. Yet they deny places to school-age students. A second
major problem is the generally low quality of teaching, curriculum and faci-
lities. The sudden increase in enrollment has far outpaced the supply of
qualified teachers. Onlv one-third of the present teaching staff of 735 have
teaching qualifications. Almost one-half are expatriates, with various
experience, qualifications and teaching methods. Most local teachers use rote
memorization as the basic teaching technique.  There are no local textbooks
or Omani curricula. Half of the new schools are in tents or rented buildings
not suited for school use. Most the schools lack adequate furniture and
equipment.
20.       Administration and planning of education is virtually non-existent.
The Mlinistry of Education is itself less than two years old. In 1972, there
were only two university graduates and five secondary school graduates in the
Ministry. Expansion of the system has been uncontrolled, and there is still
no comprehensive education development strategy.
21.       Yet there are encouraging signs.  The Government has committed
itself to the rapid expansion and modernization of the education system, and
is prepared to allocate the necessary financial resources to this effort.
It has established broad educational objectives, and is actively seeking
external assistance to refine these targets and provide capital and technical
assistance for the development program.  Bilateral aid from Saudi Arabia, Abu
Dhabi, Qatar and Kuwait has been promised for construction of a secondary
school, primary schools, technical and vocational schools, and technical
assistance.
22.       The financing of education should not be the most serious cons-
traint to expansion of the system, unlike many developing countries. Cur-
rent education expenditures increased from RO 8,000 in 1967, to nearly RO 1
million in 1972. This still represented only about 2.5 percent of government
recurrent expenditures.  Capital expenditure for education has more than
doubled since 1971, and now represents about 6 percent of the total develop-
ment budget.  The Government is prepared to, and should be able to, bear the
cost of a significantly expanded system.  By 1985, recurrent expenditures
are expected to be about RO 19.0 million, or about 17 percent of total govern-
ment recurrent spending.



- 8 -
23.       The most pressing needs of the education sector are to:  (a) build
up the management and administration of the system, including the Ministry
of Education, (b) develop modern, practical curricula, materials, and methods,
(c) begin the training of Omani teachers, (d) initiate skill training, and
(e) eliminate the problems of overcrowding and overage students and inade-
quate (or non-existent) facilities through a major program of primary school
and adult education school construction.
24.       The Government's general education goals reflect these priorities,
plus a commitment to universal primary education by the mid-1980's. Bila-
teral assistance is expected to help deal with the most pressing quantita-
tive needs -- new primary, secondary and technical training schools. The
proposed project will concentrate on the qualitative aspects of the educa-
tional system, the development of Omani expertise and the introduction of                   £
special education facilities designed for the unique circumstances of Oman.
PAPT IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project would be an integrated program of assistance
by the Bank, UNDP and United Kingdom, designed to deal with the most pressing
qualitative problems of the rapidly expanding education sector. It would pro-
vide facilities to initiate teacher training, accelerated primary education
and agricultural training in Oman, and would help improve the country's capa-
city to plan and manage its educational system. A loan and project summary
is attached as Annex III together with a map showing the location of the
proposed project schools. A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project
in the Sultanate of Oman" (301a-OM) dated March 5, 1974, is being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
26.       The project is based on the findings of a Bank reconnaissance mission
to Oman in December 1971, and a UNESCO preparation mission in November 1972.
The project was appraised in June 1973. Negotiations were held in February
1974. The Oman delegation was led by John Townsend, Economic Advisor to the
Government.  Representatives of the UhDP and ODA (U.) also participated in
the negotiations.
27.       The proposed project xwould finance:  (a) the construction and equip-
ping of four schools -- a primary teacher training institute, two basic educa-
tion/skill training centers and an agricultural secondary school - and (b)
technical assistance to the Ministry of Education, project schools and the
project implementation unit. Details of the project components are provided
in Annex III. An innovative feature of the project would be the introduction
of nutritional instruction into primary, overage youth and adult education,
and into primary teacher training through the provision of teaching expertise
and fellowships.



-9-
Project Schools
28.       The creation of a modern education system in Oman begins with prim-
ary education and skill training. The four schools to be constructed under
the project will lay the foundation for a primary system adapted to the cir-
cumstances of Oman, and will introduce agricultural training to the country
where 80 percent of the population derives its income from farming and fishing.
29.       A primary teacher training institute in Matrah will provide one
or two year pre-service training for about 300 students, and in-service
training for about 400 teachers annually. The Institute would make possible
the replacement of all expatriate and unqualified Omani primary school teach-
ers by 1982/83. (Until the Institute begins producing graduates, Oman will
need to employ an increasing number of expatriate teachers (up to 1,500) for
primary schools alone). The Institute would also serve as a National Educa-
tion Center, which will develop curricula and teaching methods and materials.
30.       Two Basic education/skill training centers -  the first of their
kind in the country--will be built in Sohar (for boys) and Muscat (for girls).
Their objectives would be to: (a) reduce the pressure of overage youths in
primary schools, (b) demonstrate a valid alternative to formal elementary
schooling, and (c) establish adult education programs of general education
and practical training.  A four year accelerated primary education program
would be offered in the mornings, one year adult craft and basic education
programs in the afternoons, and literary/communitv activities programs in the
evenings.
31.       An agricultural secondary school will be built in the agricul-
tural center of Nizwa and would offer three types of training: a three year
secondary school course to produce middle-level technicians (about 34 each
year), a one year post primary course to train about 70 young farmers in
horticulture, animal husbandry and farm machinery, and one to two weeks train-
ing courses for about 80 to 100 Government staff working in agriculture.
Staff Housing
32.       Because of the exceptionally severe shortage of adequate accommo-
dations in Oman, the Government provides housing to all expatriate teaching
and administrative staff, and is considering the extension of this practice
to Omani staff. Twelve staff houses will be financed under the loan for
administrators on the four campuses to be built under the project. The
Government has agreed to provide the balance of required housing. Some of
the units will be rented. Fifty-five new staff housing units would be built
under the project to meet 100% of the staff housing needs for the agricul-
tural school in Nizwa and the basic education/skill training center in Sohar,
where adequate acommodations are extremely scarce, together with housing
requirements in Matrah for the technical assistance advisors to the Ministry
of Education and for the project implementation. unit (para. 34).



- 10 -
Technical Assistance
33.       The project would provide three types of technical assistance:
(a) Teachers and Administrators - project institutions would be staffed
largely by expatriate teachers and administrators. Fifteen specialists will
be provided through a proposed UNDP/UNESCO project, for the primary teacher
training institute and the basic education/skill training centers. Six ex-
perts would be provided bv the British Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) to the Nizwa agricultural school; (b) Advisory Group to the Ministry
of Education - eight specialists under a separate LtNDP/'UESCO project already
being processed, would form an advisory group to assist the Ministry of Edu-
cation in planning and management, school building design and construction,
curriculum, methodology and teaching material development, and the prepara-
tion of an education development plan (Section 3.03 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment); and (c) a project implementation unit of six specialists, financed by
the Bank, would assist in executing the project (Section 3.02 of the draft
Loan Agreement). In addition to the provision of technical assistance, the
UNDP and ODA programs would include about 31 man/vears of overseas fellowships
for Omani counterparts to expatriate staff.
Project Execution
34.       The nroposed project would be carried out by the Ministry of Edu-
cation with the assistance of the Bank-financed project implementation unit
and the UNDP-financed advisorv group (para. 33). The project implementation
unit would be established within the Ministry of Education, and maintain a
close liaison with the Public Works Department, which is responsible for the
design and construction of all government buildings in Oman. The project
unit would also provide liaison with the UNDP advisory group and government
agencies and would assist in the preparation of a possible second education
project (Section 3.02(a) and Schedule 5 of the draft Loan Agreement). The
project architect and procurement specialist are expected to be expatriates.
Appointment of the project unit Director and Architect would be a condition
of effectiveness of the Loan (Section 8.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
35.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$11.1 million,
net of taxes and excluding interest during construction, with a foreign ex-
change component of about US$7.8 million. The Bank loan of US$5.7 million
would help finance the construction of the new schools, furniture and equip-
ment, some staff housing, the project implementation unit and consultant ar-
chitects' services for the design of buildings and supervision of construction.
It would cover about 51 percent of the total cost of the project, including
S4.3 million of foreign exchange costs and about US$1.4 million of local costs.
The UNDP would finance the advisory team to the Ministry of Education, teachers
and administrators for the primary teacher training institute and basic educa-
tion/training centers ($2.0 million), and the British ODA would finance and
provide the teachers for the Nizwa agriculttural school ($0.45 million). The
balance of $3.0 million, or about 27 percent of project costs would be met by

the Government. Recurrent expenditures for the project institutions estab-
lished by the project are expected to be about $1.6 million annually at full
development and would be met by the Government.
Implementation, Procurement and Disbursement
36.       The schedule for implementing the project foresees the provision
of the UNDP advisory group and the project implementation unit by the autumn
of 1974. Construction of the project schools would be completed by the end
of 1977.
37.       Contracts for construction and for supplv of furniture and equip-
ment would be awarded under international competitive bidding procedures, in
conformity with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The construction ac-
tivity is within Oman's capacity and locally-based firms would probably win
all construction contract awards. Furniture and equipment items would be
grouped to the extent practicable to 'form sizeable bid packages and to permit
bulk procurement. For the purpose of comparing foreign and local bids, manu-
facturers of furniture in Oman would be awarded a margin of preference equal
to the existing rate of customs duty generally applicable to competing imports
or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.
38.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost or
ex-factory price of furniture and equipment, 100 percent of the total cost of
consultant architects and the expatriate staff of the project unit, and 90
percent of total costs of selected civil works(schoo]. constructions, and
housing for experts of the project unit, advisory group and senior staff of
the Nizwa and Sohar schools). Disbursements for the construction of the
Agricultural School will be made only after approval by the Bank of Oman's
plan for the expansion of agricultural extension services (Section 3b of
Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Economic Justification
39.       The proposed project is designed to build the essential foundation
for a modern education system. One part of the project, an institution-
building character, comprises the UNDP advisory group which will help the
Ministry of Education devise an education development plan, produce approp-
riate curricula, teaching methods and materials for the school system, estab-
lish school design and construction standards and manage and administer the
system. The second part of the project--proposed for Bank financing--will
initiate three types of education and training in Oman, corresponding to the
basic and most critical needs of the sector, and the economy: (i) primary
teacher training; (Ii) basic education/skill training; and (iii) agricultural
training.
40.       The project will provide the essential management, pedagogical
framework and pilot facilities for the development of the educational system.
The urgently needed quantitative expansion--new primary schools, a secondary
school and vocational school--will be provided through bilateral assistance.



- 12 -
The project will heln ensure the quality and appropriateness of this expan-
sion program, and offer the direction for the future growth of education.
It will also begin to provide essential local skills for Oman's economic
growth, and will assist in reducing the reliance on oil and spreading the
benefits of the country's newly generated wealth.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Sultanate of Oman and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the resolution approving the                   &
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to in para-
graphs 33, 34 and 38 of this Report.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
