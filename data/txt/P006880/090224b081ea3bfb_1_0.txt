SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
The specific objectives of the Project are: (i) to put in place a new approach in
support of the Borrower's National System for Agricultural Technology Development and
Transfer (including measures to build the institutional capacity required therefor) which
would promote the development and testing of technical packages especially appropriate
for small farmers and for divulgation of new technology; (ii) to promote private sector
participation in agricultural research, by itself or jointly with the public sector; (iii) to
improve the quality and efficiency of agricultural research (including adjustment and
validation) by introducing a demand-driven competitive selection process, as part of the
aforesaid new system, that would enable cofinancing of Research Subprojects by
universities and other private and public sector entities; (iv) to support decentralization
of agricultural research and extension activities through the training of providers of
agricultural extension services, and the strengthening of Regional Units and the
dissemination of information; and (v) to revitalize under-utilized assets (both physical and
human) which currently exist within Colombia's research services system; all of the above
with the aim of reducing rural poverty, increasing rural employment and improving the
competitiveness of Colombian agricultural producers.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modification thereof
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such
objectives:
Part A:       Technology Development and Adaptation
1.     Execution of Approved Research Subprojects consisting in: (a) strategic research
activities directed toward national priority goals, the results of which may lead to future
activities of applied research and, eventually, adaptive research; and (b) applied research
activities, the findings of which have the potential for immediato application by farmers,
for such areas as sustainable production systems, integrated pest ranagement, post harvest
technologies, fisheries, and environmental problems, and such other areas as the Borrower,
with the approval of the Executive Council, and the Bank may agree from time to time
that should be included in the Operational Manual.
2.     Execution of Approved Research Subprojects consisting in adaptive research
and/or technology development activities such as technology transfer through
demonstration parcels, field days, training and other mechanisms as the Borrower, with
the approval of the Executive Council, and the Bank may agree from time to time that
should be included in the Operational Manual; such adaptive research activities will


﻿- 22 -
include adjustment and validation, both to be done with participation of local farmers and
of staff of the relevant UMATA, of technology generated at experimental stations so that
technology could be tested under the most representative ecological setting before the
technological packages are made available to providers of extension services.
Part B:       Institutional Development
1.     Establishment, support and operation of: (a) the Coordinating Unit, including
acquisition therefor, and utilization thereby, of office equipment and computers and
services of consultants and personnel trainers, and carrying out its functions under the
Project, including promotion and advertising activities; (b) the Panel; and (c) the Regional
Panels, including hiring of the necessary services for the operation thereof.
2.    (a)     Establishment, support and operation of Regional Units, including hiring
of the necessary fixed-term services therefor; and (b) enhancement of field services
provided by the UMATAs or the Agriculture Secretariats of Departments or the Regional
Units, through the acquisition by the Ministry and utilization for the Project of motor
vehicles (including boats).
3.     (a)    Setting up by the Ministry of: (i) a supervision system for all activities
under the Project; and (ii) a Project performance review report; and (b) determination by
the Ministry, on the basis of the system under (a) (ii) above, of whether a follow-up
project would be justified, on the basis of sample case studies.
4.     Execution of training programs for: (a) personnel of the Ministry, particularly of
the Coordinating Unit, Panel, Regional Panels, Regional Units and relevant Departments
and UMATAs, all in management and implementation of the Project; (b) field technicians
and other professionals in the effectiveness and relevance of available agricultural
technologies and methodologies; (c) technical staff of public or private entities in the
preparation and management of Research Subprojects; and (d) technical staff in
Municipalities in all aspects of providing agricultural extension services to farmers.
5.     Execution of an assistantship program that will link academic studies with
practical work by means of enabling students enrolled in the program to complete their
graduate work requirements at accredited faculties in Colombian universities while
undertaking research and/or technology development activities in conjunction with specific
Approved Research Subprojects to be or being carried out under Part A of the Project.


﻿- 23 -
6.     Establishment of an information system for agricultural technological packages,
including acquisition and utilization of equipment, and software therefor, which will serve
the needs of entities engaged in Project activities (including universities) and regional
research centers.
The Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001.

Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.   Procurement of Goods and Works
Part A:      International Competitive Bidding
Except as provided in Part D hereof, goods other than vehicles, laboratory and
specialized agricultural equipment and other goods agreed upon between the Borrower and
the Bank for purposes of Part C.1 of this Section I, shall be procured under contracts
awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and
II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by
the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines), and in accordance with the following additional
procedures.
(a)    When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity period,
such period may be extended once, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph 2.59 of the Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to complete
the evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and clearances and award the contract. The bid
validity period may be extended a second time only if the bidding documents or the
request for extension shall provide for appropriate adjustment of the bid price to reflect
changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of extension. Such an
increase in the bid price shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. With respect
to each contract made subject to the Bank's prior review in accordance with the
provisions of Part F.1 (a) of this Section, the Bank's prior approval will be required for:
(i) a first extension of the bid validity period if the period of extension exceeds sixty (60)
days; and (ii) any subsequent extension of the bid validity period.
(b)    In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A, the Borrower
shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such
modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of
the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank,
the Borrower shall use bidding documents based on other internationally recognized
standard forms agreed with the Bank.


﻿- 27 -
Part B:       Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part
A hereof, goods manufactured in Colombia may be granted a margin of preference in
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the
Guidelines and paragraphs I through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto.
Part C:       Other Procurement Procedures
1.     Contracts for vehicles, laboratory and specialized equipment and other equipment
agreed from time to time between the Minister and the Bank and estimated to cost more

bidding, on the basis of evaluation and comparison of bids invited from a list of qualified
suppliers eligible under the Guidelines with established services facilities in Colombia and
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections I and II of the Guidelines
(excluding paragraphs 2.8, 2.9, 2.55 and 2.56 thereof).
2.     Contracts for goods or works estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less
may be awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations solicited from at least
three suppliers eligible under the Guidelines or three local contractors, as the case may
be, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank.
Part D:       Other Procurement Provisions
Without limitation upon the provision of the Guidelines, in respect of procurement
of goods and works under Part A of this Schedule and, only in respect of (f) below, under
Parts A and C thereof:
(a)    no requirements shall be made of local agents for foreign bidders, or for
certification by Colombian consular authorities of translations into Spanish of support
documentation in cases where the bidder assumes the responsibility for errors of the
translation in question;
(b)    no prior registration of foreign bidders shall be required;
(c)    no provision regarding minimum number of bidders shall be applied;
(d)    bids of goods shall be evaluated on a cost, insurance, freight (c.i.f.) basis;
(e)    freight costs quoted by each bidder shall be used for purposes of bid
evaluation; and


﻿- 28 -
(f)    awards shall be made to the lowest evaluated bidders, and no bidder shall
be disqualified because the price of the corresponding bid falls above or below a
predetermined given value, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, or out of a post-bid-
presentation-determined price band.
2.     Unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Bank, and notwithstanding
the provisions of Part A (b) of Section I and of paragraph I of Section II, both of this
Schedule, the Borrower shall invite bids in regard to the procurement of goods for the
Project under Part C. 1 of this Schedule exclusively on the basis of standard documents
agreed with the Bank from time to time and shall inform the Bank on any proposed
departure from said documents before any such tender is made public.
Part E:      Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.     Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
(a)    With respect to each contract for goods estimated to cost the equivalent
of $50,000 or more, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the
Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the
Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed
copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2
(d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out of the
Special Account in respect of such contract.
(b)    With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph,
the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall

pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
(c)    The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall not apply to
contracts on account of which withdrawals from the Loan Account are to be made on the
basis of statements of expenditure.

Section II.   Emplovment of Consultants
1.    In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out of the Project, the Borrower
shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank
as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines).
For complex, time-based assignments, the Borrower shall employ such consultants under
contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank,
with such modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant
standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use other
standard forms agreed with the Bank.
2.     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the provisions of
the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists,
selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts, shall
not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of consulting firms estimated to cost less
than $100,000 equivalent each; or (b) contracts for the employment of individuals
estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each. However, said exceptions to prior
Bank review shall not apply to (a): the terms of reference for such contracts; (b) single-

L     For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)    the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) through (5) set forth
in the table in paragraph I of Schedule I to this Agreement;
(b)    the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
(c)    the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to
$2,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the
Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount
equivalent to $1,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan
Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the
equivalent of $6,000,000.
2.     Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.     After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)    For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)     (i)  For replenishment, of the Special Account, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.


﻿-31-
(ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for
eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the
Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible
Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.     For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for
eligible expenditures.
5.     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
(a)    if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the
provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of
this Agreement;
(b)    if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period

required to be fitrnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the
records and accounts for the Special Account;
(c)    if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the
Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or
(d)    once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.


﻿- 32 -
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after
and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining
on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)     If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or,
if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the
Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may
be.
(b)    If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding amount.
(c)    The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or
any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
(d)    Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the
General Conditions.
