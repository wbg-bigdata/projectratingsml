PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
VIET NAM
DAU TIENG IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 845-VN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Viet Nam Dau
Tieng Irrigation Project, for whicl IDA Credit 845-VN of US$60 million was
signed on August 24, 1978.  The project was co-financed by an additional
US$10 million equivalent each from the Kuwait Fund, OPEC and the Government
of the Netherlands. Subsequently, in April 1984 the Kuwait Fund approved a
supplemental US$20.4 million credit for the project.   The IDA Credit
Closing Date was extanded twice from December 31, l9d4 to December 31,
1986.  The final disbur'ement was made on July 10, 1987, at which time a
balance of US$303,008.53 equivalent was cancelled from the Credit account.
The PCR was prepared by FAO-CP on behalf of the Government of
Viet Nam, on the basis of the Staff Appraisal Report and
other project and credit documentation available in IDA files, as well as
data received and discussions with the Government during an FAO-CP mission
to Ho Chi Minh City and the project area in November/December 1988.  The
Evaluation Summary was prepared by IDA on the basis of an FAO-CP draft.
This PCR was read by tnie Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and Cofinanciers for comments and
they are attached to the Report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
VIET NAM
DAU TIENG IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 845-VN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the FAO/World
Bank Cooperative Program (FAO-CP) on behalf of the Government of Viet Nam
(GOV). It is based on data from the Borrower's Ministry of Water Resources
(MWR), examination of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), Development Credit
Agreement No. 845-VU, IDA supervision reports, and information obtained and
discussions held during a mission to Ho Chi Minh City and the project area
in November/December 1988.
2.          Available data were provided freely to the mission, although
these were not always complete.   Agricultural data were particularly
difficult to acquire.  Records of local construction costs wete presented
by MWR in constant 1981 do.ng, but the mission was unable to analyze the
original figures from which these were derived.  Supervision miss'ons had
expressed frequent concerns that the quantity of fuel used was exceeding
appraisal estimates; however, no means were found to verify the actum fuel
used by the project.   Finally, rapid infiation in Viet Nam and ;arge
disparities between official and unofficial exchange rates required L:!%
fairly fundamental assumptions to be made in order to re-estimate the ERR,
as explained in the PCR.
3.           The PCR mission was asked by IDA to pay particular attention
to reservoir saFety, and the Annex is therefore devoted to this topic.
Project Back&rornd
4.        Dau Tieng Irrigation Project was conceived by GOV as part of its
plan to achieve foodgrain self-sufficiency and to improve the lives of the
working population.   The project, which was to be the first stage of a
proposed development of 172,000 ha of irrigation, comprised the
construction of a dam to form a reservoir on -the Saigon river and
irrigation development of 42,000 ha, mainly for cultivation of rice and
groundnuts.

5.            The project was to be implemented over five years, at an
estimated total cost of US$110 million.   It was financed by IDA Credit
845-VN of US$60 million, which be.came effective on February 22, 1979. The
Kuwait Fund, OPEC and Government of the Netherlands each provided US$10
million equivalent, bringing the total of external financing to US$90
million, for the purchase of construction equipment, fuel and materials.
Subsequently, in April 1984 the Kuwait Fund approved a supplemental credit
of US$20.4 million equivalent.
IImRlementation Experience and Proiect Results
6.         Although construction of some project works will not be finished
before end-1990, about seven years late, the major construction was
substantially completed when the Credit was closed at the end of 1986. The
main reasons for the delay and the associated cost overruns are:
(a) The survey data and maps available at appraisal proved to be
inaccurate and new surveys had to be conducted.   The primary irrigation
canals had to be realigned, a second intake structure added, and the dike
which forms the right bank of the reservoir extended from 22 to 29 km.
I
(b; Procurement delays occurred at the start of the project;
primarily bec&use GOV was inexperienced with international competitive
bidding (ICB).  IDA staff and consultants assisted in preparing the first
three procurement documents under which most of the early construction
equipment was obtained; however, after bids were received, there were very
lengthy contract negotiations and the first deliveries did not take place
until more than oz;t year after receipt of bids.
(c) Government was unable to operate the heavy construction
equipment procured for the pro4ect as intensively or efficiently as assumed
at appraisal. For example, the SAR assumed the equipment would be operated
for two shifts daily, whereas there was only one shift.  Also, the work
force was not familiar with the operation and maintenance (O&M) of such
equipment, partially because local technicians with relevant experience
were not available to work on the project in the numbers originally
anticipated.
7.        As a result of the inaccurate survey, the project area had to be
altered to omit some 14,000 ha which could not be supplied with water in
the absence of pumping.   Although pumping would have been economically
feasible, IDA did not agree to finance this because of the unreliability of
the supply of both electricity and diesel. Instead, to compensate, 14,000
ha served bX the east canal kriginally proposed to form part of Stage II
of the devetopment) was included in the project.



- vii -
8.          During imp?ementation Viet Nam experienced ve.y high inflation
and official exchange rates were overvalued.   At appraisal,  local cost
estimates were based on the prevailing official exchange rate, and were
therefore high in US dollar terms. If actual local costs arc converted into
US dollars at the official rates throughout the project period, cost
overruns appear to be very high.   However, if estimated unofficial rates
are used (as has been done in the PCR), local costs are less than the
appraisal  estimates.   Overall,  the PCR estimates that project costs
increased by about 6% in constant US dollars, or 18% in current US dollars,
above the appraisal estimate of US$110 million (i.e., to about US$129.5
million).   Incremental foreign costs were met through the supplemental
financing from the Kuwait Fund.
9.            The comparatively high unit cost of over US$3,000 per ha
irrigated is due mainly to the dam, which contributed about 48% of total
costs.  However, the dam could supply a much greater area.  k'or instance,
if the reservoir cost were apportioned over 120,000 ha, the cost of Stage I
would reduce to about US$2,100 per ha.
10.       The design and construction of the dam, dike and their structures
appear satisfactory from the point of view of safety, but there has not
been full compliance with the Credit Agreement concerning the preparation
of a spillway operations manual or periodic ii.spections after completion.
The PCR mission considered the lack of adequate spillway operation
procedures to be a source of poten- al danger to the dam and recommended
that, until such procedures are estLjlished, the reservoir water level be
kept sufficiently low to permit the rservoir to absorb the design flood
without having the water level, exceed the designed maximum level.   This
would not restrict irrigation in 1989.   Sound engineering practice also
suggests that the reservoir be inspected annually for the first few years
after completion and then at five-year intervals by independent, qualified
engineers, assisted by other specialists, as necessary.
Sustainability
11.           Although the project has achieved most of its phyrical
objectives, it :,as not yet produced the level of agricultural benefits
assumed at appraisal.  The rCR mission estimates that, at full development
in 1994, paddy production will be about 73% of SAR estimates and groundnut
production 53%; tihese lower estimates are due mainly to lower crop yields.
Crop yields are constrained by low use of fertilizer and insecticide, both
of which are expensive and scarce in Viet Nam. Also, poor drainage in some
areas discourages the use of dwarf HYV rice.
12.       The economic rate of return (ERR) has been re-estimated at 4% for
Stag,e I (cf. SAR 17%) and 7% for Stages I and II (SAR 20%). These reduced
ERRs are partly due to the fact that the current forecast price of rice is
much lower-than that used at appraisal.   Other factors include lower
incremental production, and delays in reaching this, as well as slightly
higher costs.



- viii -
Recommendations
13.       Completion of secondary and tertiary canals is proceeding slowly,
but might be accelerated by increased budget.   The works that have been
completed have not yet been handed over to the newly appointed O&M
organization.   This O&M organization needs to be fully established and
formal inspection, acceptance and handing over effected as quickly as
possible.  Adequate snillway operational procedures do not yet exist, and
these are urgently required. Also, the reservoir is not being periodically
inspected in accordance with sound engineering practice, and this should be
done.   Finally,  agricultural production is constrained by lack of
fertilizers and insecticides, apparently because of shortage of foreign
exchange.   Dau Tieng irrigation project could benefit from additional
financial assistance for:   (a) completion of Stage II, (b) supply of
fertilizer and insect'cides, (c) accumulated maintenance needs, and (d)
technical assistance to establish an effective O&M organizatior..
Lessons Learned
14.       The project was prepared and appraised under great time pressure.
Project implementation *-ould have proceeded more smoothly if adequate
surveys had been carried out and the design of the dam and major works
completed before appraisal. A feasibility study would probably have led to
a reduction in the height of the dam, thereby saving considerable expense.
15.         A first-time Borrower from IDA, having little experience with
international procedures, could have benefitted from stronger external
technical assistance in planning, design, specification, procurement and
construction.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
VIET NAM
DAU TIENG IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 845-VN)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1     Agriculture Is the predominant economic sector in Vietnam. It is
estimated that about 70% of the population earn their income from
agriculture even though agriculture appears to contribute less than half of
the national income. Rice is the basic food. Over 70% of the area sown with
annual crops is for wetland rice. Largely due to limited availability of
fertilizers and other inputs, crop yields are low in comparison with other
southeast Asian countries and Chinese provinces bordering Vietnam, which are
amongst the poorest in China.
1.2     The Dau Tieng Irrigation Project was intended to be the first in a
series but has turned out to be the only project so far funded by the World
Bank group in Vietnam. The objective of the project was to contribute to
making Vietnewm self-sufficient in food by developing 42,000 ha of irrigated
riceland as the first stage of a project which would ultimately irrigate
172,000 ha.
1.3     This report is based on a review of the World Bank's Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR), number 1987a-VN, dated July 17, 1978; the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA); IDA supervision reports and data compiled by the Government
of Vietnam (GOV). The project area was visited and the project discussed
with staff of the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), Technoimport and Tay
Ninh Province People's Committee and other agencies in Ho Chi Minh City and
the project area in November and December 1988. As requested by the World
Bank, the report pays particular attention to reservoir safety (see Annex
A). Although data were made freely available to the PCR mission, these were
incomplete and sometimes conflicting. Credible agricultural data were
difficult to acquire.
II. PROJECT FORIULATION
Project Preparation
2.1     The Dau Tieng Irrigation Project, as originally proposed by GOV in
1977, would have 'ncluded three components:
(a) construction of a storage dam on the Saigon River at Dau Tieng
village, some 65 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City;
(b) Oconstruction of a gravity irrigation system to serve 72,000 ha
of largely rainfed land below the dam; and
(c) development of 100,000 ha of new land under bush and jungle,
for irrigated sugarcane cultivation through a series of
medium-lift pumps drawing water from the reservoir.



- 2 -
2.2     An IDA mission, which visited Vietnam in September 1977 at the
request of GOV, found the investigations for the storage facility and the
gravity irrigation scheme to be in an advanced stage, but noted that the
sugarcane component was considerably less prepared. Furthermore, a
prelJinary cost estimate indicated that the irrigation system for the
-garcane component would cost about US$150 million, and that a further
investment of some US$300 million for sugar factories, power transmission
lines, roads and housing for new settlers would be needed to ensure its
success. In view of this huge investment, GOV agreed to postpone the
development of the sugarcane component.
2.3     Because of foreign exchange limitations, the scope of the proposed
project was further scaled down during appraisal to include only the
reservoir and 42,000 ha of the gravity service area (Stage I). The intake
and diversion canal of the system would, however, be sized to cover the
ultimate 72,000 ha service area. Construction of the remaining 30,000 ha
would be carried out as part of Stage II of the project, while the sugarcane
component would be developed under Stage III.
2.4     Access to the project area during preparation and appraisal was
severely restricted by security considerations and it was difficult for the
missions to obtain reliable data.
The Project Area
2.5     The project is located in the southwestern part of Vietnam (Hap 1).
The 42,000 ha project area includes five of the south.:rn districts of Tay
Ninh Province. It is bounded by the Saigon River on the east and by the
Kampuchean border on the west. Tay Ninh, the provincial capital, is about 85
km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City. The project areas's climate is tropical
and monsoonal.
2.6     The region is characterized by broad plains between gently rolling
hills with elevations between 6 and 20 m above mean sea level. All soils in
the project area were formed from alluvial sediments. The major part of the
project area was rainfed paddy lands (about 75Z) and the remainder
rainfed upland, used mainly for groundnxt cultivation.
The Appraised Project
2.7        Following an appraisal mission in January 1978, the SAR proposed.
that the project would include:
(a) construction of an earth dam and its appurtenant works on the
Saigon River, which would create a usable storage of about
1,000 million m3;



- 3 -
(b) construction of a gravity irrigation system for about 42,000 ha
of currently rainfed land, including an adequate drainage
network, inspection and access roads and two low-lift pumping
stations to serve about 4,000 ha within the 42,000 ha service
area;
(c) training of construction engineers, heavy equipment operators
and maintenance personnel; and
(d)  procurement of vehicles, equipment, construction materials
and supplies.
2.8     Dam and Appurtenant Works.  The clay fill dam would be 1,100 m long
and have a maximum height above the stream bed of 27 m. A dyke, ' to 7 m
high and about 22.0 km long, would be constructed on the right bank of the
river to close the southwest rim of the reservoir.
2.9     To protect the dam and dyke against overtopping, a chute spillway
would be constructed and be equipped with twelve 8.0 m x 5.0 m radial gates.
2.10    The reservoir created by the dam and dyke would inundate some 500
farm families, who would be relocated in the project area.
2.11    Gravity Irrigation System. The principal features of the irrigation
system would be: (a) a gravity intake and an 8.2 km diversion canal to
command 72,000 ha (42,000 ha in Stage I plus 30,000 ha in Stage II); (b) a
43 km-long west main canal to command 42,000 ha, about 4,000 ha of which
would be served by two low-lift pumping stations that would draw water from
the canal; (c) 23 primary canals having a total length of 122 km, and (d)
about 2,430 km of secondary and tertiary canals, which would deliver water
down to 10-20 ha units. Below these, farmers would construct the farm
ditches needed to ensure timely water delivery to their fields with a
minimal amount of field-to-field irrigation.
2.12    An extensive system of existing natural drainage channels would be
enlarged and improved to minimize flooding of low portions of the project
area. In addition, about 430 km of new secondary and tertiary drai.-ns would
be excavated.
2.13    Inspection and Access Roads.  Under the project, about 20 km of new
roads would be constructed to provide access to the dam, dyke, spillway and
quarry areas. In addition, about 200 km of all-waather, inspection E.Lad
access roads would be constructed in the irrigation service area.
Re-vttiations and Effectiveness
2.14    Following a meeting with cofinanciers (Kuwait Fund, Opec Fund,
Government of Netherlands) in Paris on 12 and 13 June 1978, negotiations
were held in Hanoi between 20 and 28 June 1978, when a draft Development



-4-
Credit Agreement was finalized. During negotiations, it was agreed that a
Project Manager would be appointed to oversee both design and construction
rather than only desiEn, the latter being preferred by GOV. IDA did not
agree to specify in the DCA that the panel of dam experts should be
Vietnamese; it was agreed that no nationality would be specified.
2.15    GOV strongly opposed cross default and cross effectiveness clauses
si..ce these could prejudice their negotiating position with other
financiers. After IDA pointed out that the cofinanciers were interdependent
in contributing to the total foreign exchange cost of the project and,
because IDA were concerned about possible delays, they had excluded the
Kuwait Fund from the cross effectiveness clause, agreement was reached.
2.16    The DCA was signed on 24 August 19?8 for a credit of US$60 million.
Cofinanciers were to provide a further USS30 million. The credit became
effective on 22 February 1979 after delays due to slow processing by the
Government of the Netherlands of its loan agreement.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Changes tothe Projet
3.1     During implementation there were several important changes to the
project proposed in the SAR.
3.2     At the dam the spillway was changed from 12 gates, 8 m wide by 5 m
high, on a concrete crest at level 19.4 m above sea level to 6 submerged
gates, 10 m wide x 6 m high, on a cill at level +14 m. This reduced the
width of the spillway and the design flood water level while increasing
the capacity from 2,500 m3/s to 2,800 m3Is. The parapet on the dam crest was
omitted but the fill level was raised to compensate for this. The side
slopes of the dam were flattened to increase resistance to earthquakes.
3.3     The design parameters for the irrigation network were changed to
increase the frequency of irrigation failure from 1 year in 5 to 1 year in 4
to be consistera with practice in the r3st of the country. As a consequence
of this and reconsideration of crop wate3r requirements, canal irrigation
duties were reduced and drain capacities in riceland were increased.
3.4     Following detailed survey, indicating that SAR was based on
inaccurate data, the length of the dyke was increased from 22 to 29 km and
the layout of the west canal was completely revised, requiring an additional
intake some 11 km from the main dam and omitting about 14,000 ha on the
right bank (y the Vam Co Dong River. It was now impracticable to irrigate
42,000 ha using the west main canal without substantial areas relying on
pumping. 'DA was reluctant to agree to this due to doubt concerning
availability of electricity and fuel for pumping; it was therefore agreed to
include also the area mainly served by gravity from the first 20 km of the
east canal as part of the project as shown below:

3.5     Two pumping stations referred to in the SAR (but not included in the
estimated costs) were omitted from Stage I.
3.6     More hydrological information collected after appraisal reduced the
estimate of annual average runoff into the reservoir to 1,830 million
m3/year, some 68X of the estimate at the time of appraisal.
Project Stait-up
3.7     The project suffered initial delays due to lack of suitable survey
equipment, aggravated by delays in finalizing contracts for supply of new
equipment, both for survey and construction. Although some early progress
was made using locally available equipment, it was found that the early



outline designs, on the basis of which the SAR was prepared, were based on
insufficiently accurate survey information. This required a reassessment of
the design particularly with regard to the headreach of the canal.
Procurement
3.8     All procurement was handled by Technoimport, a branch of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade. Although IDA staff assisted with the preparation
of specifications and procurement documents, lack of experience in Vietnam
of international contractual procedures and IDA procurement requirements
caused delay in award of essential contracts. A delay in finalizing the type
of equipment to be financed by the loan from the Government of the
Netherlands (mainly trucks) caused loaders that had been delivered to be
uu'erused.
3.9     Procurement of construction materials and miscellaneous vehicles and
equipment was delayed by communication problems between Washington and
Vietnam; for example, documents for contracts for survey instruments were
lost in the post.
3.10    Some contract negotiations took unusually long. Scrutinizing
delivered equipment in Ho Chi Minh City to ensure compliance with
specifications took so long that extensions of contract periods were needed.
Design
3.11    The Institute of Design and Survey (IDS), part of the MWR, was
responsible for design. Several changes were made to the feasibility study
designs. Significant changes were made to the design of the spillway which
required further model tests, thereby delaying completion of design. A
disagreement arose between the designers and the foreign experts, appointed
to review the dam design, concerning the design of the spillway stilling
basin floor. The designers eventually agreed to adopt the recommendation of
the experts but maintained that the original design would have been
satisfactory. Otherwise, designs appear to have been adequate.
3.12    Design of the irrigation system was delayed by the slow procurement
of survey equipment and the need for fundamental changes as a result of the
new survey information. A result of this is that the west main canal and
intake are designed for greater capacity than is likely to be required,
Construction
3.13    Construction of the dam, dyke, roads, main, primary and secondary
canals and drains was entrusted to MWR's Construction Company No.9. In 1980,
when it was decided that Stage II work, the construction of the east canal,
should proceed simultaneously with Stage I, a number of construction
companies were amalgamated into Construction Enterprise No. 4, which
completed the work. Tertiary canals ard drains were entrusted to the Tay



-7-
Ninh provincial authorities. The appraisal and actual implementation
schedules are compared in Chart 1.
3.14    The start of construction was delayed by design and procurement
difficulties, but by March 1980 work on the dam and dyke with some of the
new equipment was starting about a year behind the SAR schedule. Initial
progress was slow due to lack of dump trucks, fuel shortages and the need to
train equipment operators and maintenance staff. Progress improved but
shortages of fuel, lubricants and spares continued, causing some further
delay until the stupplementary loan from the Kuwait Fund became effective in
1984.
3.15    The Saigon River was closed in December 1983 and work on the dam and
dyke was substantially complete by the beginning of 1985, more than two
years behind the optimistic SAR implementation schedule. The first
irrigation water was diverted in the 1984/85 irrigation season.
3.16    Construction of the main and primary canals was substantially
complete by November 1985. By December 1988, about 95? of the secondary
canals and 90? of the tertiary canals were complete for Stage I area.
It is estimated that all wnrks required to complete the irrigation
network to serve 42,000 ha in the project area will be completed by the end
of 1990.
Quality and Performance of Project Works
3.17    In general, the quality of earthwork seen by the PCR mission
appeared satisfactory. While structures are generally adequate for their
purpose, the finish is not always to internationally-accepted standards.
Leakage through water-retaining concrete, exposed reinforcing bars and
improper electrical cabling was noted.
3.18    The mechanical works at the spillway and intakes to the main canals
appeared to work satisfactorily but corrosion protection of structural
steelwork and machinery housings could be improved. For minor structures,
such as sluice gates at the head of primary and secondary canals, there is
often no sign of any painting or lubrication having been done. In mai.y cases
spindles, headstocks and/or gate leaves are missing. So long as there is
abundant water available and it is feasible to let canals run at all times
and frcquently spill, the lack of operating gates on minor structures will
not be a serious constraint to agricultural development. However, as full
development is reached and reservoir water becomes scarce, rehabilitation of
many water control structures could be required.
3.19    Canal operation is at present demand driven and in general farmers
can have water whenever required. There will be need for an adequate
operation aAd control system when water becomes scarce.
3.20    With regard to safety, the design and construction of the dam, dyke
and their structures may be considered adequate, provided due attention is
paid to operation of the spillway gates and monitoring of dam settlement,



- 8 -
piezometric levels and percolation. The PCR mission recommends that a clear
and simple procedure for spillway operation be established which can be put
into effect immediately. Copies of this procedure should be given to all
personnel concerned and posted in prominent places at the dam. The mission
considers that until this procedure is established the reservoir water level
should be drawn down to level +22.5 m above sea level and not allow.d to
rise above this level. This would permit the reservoir to absorb the
design flood without operation of spillway gates being necessary, but would
still store sufficient water to meet the irrigation requirement in 1989.
Reservoir safety is discussed in Annex A.
Project Costs
3.21    Costs in constant 1978 dollars are summarized below. Foreign costs
have been converted to US dollars from the currency in which they were
incurred using the average exchange rate in the year in which the
expenditure was made. Local costs were given by MWR in constant 1981 dong.
These tave been divided by the estimated average unofficial exchange rate
for 1981 of 43.5 dong/US$ (compared with the official rate of 4.35
dong/US$). For comparision with SAR estimates all dollar costs were then
converted to 1978 dollars, using the MUV index. On the basis "f these
assumptions, actual local costs are about 10X less and foreign costs are
about 1OZ greater than estimated at appraisal as shown below. When expressed
in current dollars local costs are 192 greater and foreign costs 192 greater
than appraisal estimates.

3.22    The changes in design contributed to increased cost. Also,
construction equipment was not operated as efficiently as assumed in SAR and
fuel consumption was much greater than assumed. The cost of the east main
canal was not included in the SAR.
Project Financing and Disbursement
3.23    Total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$110 million. The
foreign exchange component, estimated as US$90 million, was to be financed
by US$60 million from IDA and US$10 million each from the Kuwait Fund, OPEC
and Government of the Netherlands. The initial arrangement for joint
financing (IDA 50 , Kuwait Fund 25Z, OPEC 25Z) of fuel, materials and
supplies was changed to provide parallel financing of different items.
Kuwait and OPEC funds financed 10O of the cost of fuel, lubricants and
steel. The Dutch Government's loan provided communication equipment, diesel
generators, front-end loaders, dump trucks and spare parts for them. IDA
financed 10OZ of the cost of equipment, spares and materials not financed by
the cofinanciers. In April 1984, the Kuwait Fund signed a supplementary
agreement for a further KD6.0 million (approximately US$20.4 million). IDA
did not supplement its credit. The financing is summarized below:

_Cmpliance with Covenants of the Credit Agreement
3.26    Status of covenants is summarized in Table 7 of Part III of this
report. In general, GOV complied with the covenants of the DCA though often
behind schedule. The most important exceptions are described below.
3.27    Section 3.06 of the DCA required the borrower to appoint a panel of
experts and require the panel to provide advice on the preparation of a
spillway operation manual and recommend a suitable maintenance and safety
inspection programme to be carried out aftor completion of the dam. The PCR
mission was not able to establish that the panel of experts had done this
nor to find an adequate spillway operation manual. GOV has not yet complied
with Section 4.06(b) of DCA, which requires the borrower to -ause the dam
and appurtenant works to be periodically inspected after completion in
accordance with sound engineering practice in order to discover if there
are any deficiencies which may endanger their safety and to furnish an
inspection programme to IDA.

IV. PROJECT IMPACT
Intended Impact
4.1     The major production impacts intended by the project were increases
in annual rice production to about 248,000 tons, from the pre-project 79,000
tons, and annual groundnut production to about 66,000 tons from the pre-
project 23,000 tons. These were expected to be achieved through provision of
irrigation and drainage systems and strengthening of agricultural support
services.
4.2     The project area appraised for irrigation development was 42,000 ha
commanded by the West Canal Irrigation Network. It wai projected that ufull
development' production would be attained in 19S8, five years after expected
completion of the project works in 1983.
Crop Development
4.3     There was a substantial change in the location of the project area
as explained in Chapter 3. About 14,000 ha included in the appraised project
area were excluded and tu make up for this, about 14,000 ha located outside
the original project area were added. Total project area therefore remains
at 42,000 ha. It should be noted that the impact of the project on crop
production is not strictly comparable with appraisal estimates because of
the change in location of the project area. However, an attempt has been
made, to the extent possible, to compare actual changes on land use,
cropping patterns, per ha crop yields and total output, with those projected
at the time of appraisal. Re-estimation of the cropping pattern, crop yields
and total output at full development with and without project are dealt in
Chapter 5 and summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
4.4     Land Use. The table below summarizes appraisal projections and

<2> First irrigation was in December 1984 for the 1984185 dry season crop.

4.6     Present overall cropping intensity is estimated at about 214%
(1988), whi6k is close to the intensity projected at the time of appraisal
(226Z). Overall irrigation intensity (the ratio of total irrigated crop area
to total net cultivated area) is however lower, being about 182X, as the
irrigation system in the project area is not yet fully developed.



- 14 -
4.7     It should be noted that the SAR did not consider the irrigated pre-
monsoon paddy in projecting the future cropping p.ttern. Pre-monsoon paddy
cultivation has been in practice in the area since the pre-project time,
where irrigation water is available. In addition, th3 SAR overestimated the
irrigated groundnuts area under the project. However, this is largely due to
difference in land use (proportion of paddy land and upland) between the
original project area and the revised area.
4.8     Crop Yields.  The table below summarizes actual crop yields,

<2> First irrigation was in December 1984 for the 1984/85 dry season crop.
<3> Paddy: unhueked yield; groundnutst unshelled yield.
<4> Includes 'ome area receiving supplemental Irrigation.
4.9     The present irrigated crop yields have not reached the full
development yields projected by the SAR. The lower yields are reportedly due
to insuffickent supply of chemical fertilizers and agro-chemicals. According
to Tay Ninh Provincial Agricultural Service, the current supply of chemical
fertilizers avail.ble can meet only 40Z of the demand in the area, as
estimated by PAS. Available supply of agro-chemicals is estimated to be
about 601 of the demand.



- 15 -
4.10    The prevailing unfavourable fertilizer:paddy price ratio could also
contribute to lower crop yields. The Provincial Government seeks to maintain
the price of 1 kg of urea equal to 2 kg of paddy. However, according to the
mission's interviews with a limited group of farmers in the area, the price
of 1 kg of urea for the current dry season appears to be 3 kg of paddy. In
terms of N:paddy price ratios, this is equivalent to 6.6, which is high
among Asian rice producing countries. The interviews also reveal that the
lower yield of monsoon paddy is due to difficulty of use of dwarf HYV in the
monsoon season because of inadequate drainage in some areas.
4.11    Crop Production.  Annual total crop production as estimated at
appraisal and as actually achieved in 1988 is summarized below:

Paddy (unhusked)             78.8          248.0          72.5          172.0
Groundnut (unshelled)        23.0           66.0          25.3           30.2
4.12    Mainly due to lower crop yields, the present production of paddy is
about 70X of the appraisal projected production at full development. Lower
output of groundnuts (45Z of SAR projection) is a reflection of both lower
crop yield and cropped area.
Farm Incomes
4.13    Detailed data on size of land holding per farm in the project area
were not made available to the mission but the average farm size in the
project area was assumed to be 1.0 ha, as it is said to be larger than the
provincial average of 0.7 ha. Two representative farm budgets for 1.0 ha
holdings have therefore been prepared to show the impact of the project on
farm incomes (Tables 4 and 5). These are intended to represent farm incomes
of the majority of farmers including independent farmers and farmers who are
members of production units. No farm budget for cooperative members was
prepared in view of the paucity of information on cooperative farming.
Moreover, the extent of cooperative development fell short of the appraisal
expectation and the existing numbers in the project area are very limited.
4.14    The two separate budgets reflect the difference in cropping patterns
according to land types. One is for a farm entirely on paddv land, generally
found in low-lying areas, where only paddy is grown due to fine textured
soils and/or poor drainage conditions. The other is representative of well
drained paddy land, found above the low-lying area, where paddy as well as
upland crops (mostly groundnuts) are grown.



- 16 -
4.15    The re-estimated farm incomes compared with the appraisal
projections are summarized below:

Paddy/Groundnut Farm      2.6      7.7    +196         752.9  1,373.8    +82
4.16    The re-estimated net income "with project' exceeds "without project"
net income by about 150X in the case of the farm growTig paddy exclusively
and by about 80X in the case of the paddy/groundnut farm. These estimates
are not strictly comparable with the appraisal farm budgets, which were
based on cooperative management, and the cropping patterns and size
of holding assumed are different from those used in the re-estimated
budgets.
Resettlement
4.17    Families living within the reservoir area were resettled in the area
that will be servgd by pumped irrigation from the east canal. This is some
distance from their original homes and the SAR proposal for them to plant
an annual dry season crop on their original farms as the reservoir recedes
does not seem practicable. However, some 5,500 ha in the reservoir area are
presently cultivated.
Other Potential Benefits
4.18    The resenvoir has potential for development for fisheries and
recreation.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Assumption
5.1     Economic re-evaluation has been carried out for two separate areas
as in the SA&. The first is the 42,000 ha (Stage I) IDA project area and the
second includes also Stage II and totals 97,000 ha. It is assumed that no
irrigation development could go ahead before completion of the dam;
therefore the full cost of construction of the dam has been included in each
analysis.



- 17 -
5.2     It is impracticable at this stage to make realistic estimates of
the costs of construction and benefits of the additional Stage II works that
might be required to make use of the full potential of the reservoir; the
SAR gave a preliminary estimate of some US$150 million for irrigation
development and an additional US$300 million for sugar factories,
power lines, roads and housing for settlers. The economic analysis of Stage
III was not attemptd at appraisal and has not been considered in the PCR.
5.3     Costs. Actual foreign expenditure as provided by Technoimport was
used for estimating foreign construction costs for the Stage I project.
Local costs were as given to the PCR mission by MWR, adjusted as described
below. Although not included in the IDA project, the costs of constructing
the first 2U km of the east main canal were included in the economic
analysis of Stage I on the assumption that the benefits 'rom the area served
by this canal could not be achieved without this expenditure. It was assumed
that completing the Stage I works still outstanding at December 198S would
require US$250/ha for 10,000 ha and would be completed in 1990. The costs
for Stage II works were based on US$300/ha for 28,000 ha commanded by the
east main canal between 1983 and 1989 and USS250/ha for 55,000 ha of land to
be provided with irrigation between 1986 and 1997.
5.4     O&M costs for 1989 onwards have been assumed to be US$24lyear/ha
irrigated. The residual value of construction equipment, based on the
assumed economic life of 10 years, was assumed to be nil.
5.5     Costs and benefits were expressed in 1988 US$ prices. Local costs
were converted into economic values using a standard conversion factor (SCF)
of 0.1. The assumed SCF is very low because of heavy price distortion in the
Vietnam economy, particularly in relation to the official exchange rate
which is far out of line with the real exchange rate. Foreign costs shown in
Table 10 were obtained by taking actual expenditures as given by
Technoimport and converted to current US$ using the average exchange rate in
the year in which Lhe expenditure was incurred. They were then converted to
constant 1988 US$ using the MUV index.
5.6     Local costs, including the cost of the first 20 km of east main
canal, were provided by MWR in constant 1981 dong. These were multiplied by
the SCF and then divided by the 1981 average official exchange rate of 4.35
dong/US$ to obtain local costs in 1981 USS. These were then corrected to
1988 US$ using the MUV index. Local and foreign costs were then summed to
obtain total project costs. The effect of uncertain exchange rates was
minimized by expressing costs of imported goods as well as benefits ia
dollars rather than local currency, but this could not, of course, be done
for labour. Nevertheless, there are sufficient uncertainties in the figures
used that the results should be treated with caution.
5.7     Benefits. Tables 1 and 2 set out assumed future cropping patterns,
yields and overall crop production, as re-estimated for the purposes of the
analysis.
5.8     It  is assumed that the "with project cropping pattern" for the
Stage I area would remain largely unchanged in the future from that



- 18 -
Stage I area would remain largely unchanged in the future from that
prevailing in 1988, except for some increase in cropping intensity due to
completion of irrigation development works. The increase is mainly expected
in the groundnuts cropped area, as the area remaining to be developed is
mostly upland.
5.9     The rather modest increase in the "with project crop yields"
reflects an assumption that the current shortage of fertilizer supply in the
country would not improve drastically in the future. It should be, however,
noted that there is good potential to increase the crop yield to the level
projected at appraisal with use of higher rate of fertilizer application.
5.10    The "without project" cropping patterns and crop yields were based
on the pre-project cropping patterns discussed in Chapter 4. No change in
the cropping pattern was assumed but slight increase in crop yield was
considered.
5.11    With regards to the combined Stage I and II area, it was assumed
that all the area requiring pump irrigation (23,000 ha) is upland for
groundnuts cultivation, and the remaining (74,000 ha) is paddy land, as the
land use data for Stage II area are at present not available. On the basis
of this, the Stage I cropping pattern assumed above was pro-rated for the
combined area. Crop yields identical to those assumed for Stage I were used
for the combined area to estimate overall crop production.
5.12    The "full development" production was assumed to be achieved in 1994
for Stage I, and in 2003 for Stage II, both 4 years after completion of each
irrigation development. Crop budgets used in the analysis are shown in Table
3.
5.13    Prices of tradeables were based on World Bank projections of 1995
world prices, adjusted for local costs of transport, handling and
processing. For unskilled labour, the economic price used was US$0.80.
5.14    The projected 1995 economic farmgate price for paddy was estimated
at US$149/t in 1988 US$. Derivations of economic prices of outputs and
inputs are shown in Tables 6 and 7 and summarized in Table 8.
5.15    No allowance was made for production foregone on land acquired for
project works because families were moved to previously unproductive land.
Costs of transferring these families are included in the construction costs.
Potential benefits from other possible develpments such as recreation and
fisheries development in the reservoir have not been included since these
would also require substantial investment.
Economic Rate of Return
5.16    The calculations for economic rates of return (ERR) were carried out
for 40 years. Cost and benefit streams are presented in Tables 10 and 11.
The results of the re-estimated ERRs are summarized below:

5.17    Estimated ERRs are lower than expected because of higher costs
(about 6Z), delays in benefits, lower incremental production and a 542 lover

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Ministry of Water Resources
6.1     The MWR was responsible for project implementation. This was the
largest irrigation project in Vietnam and the first to be constructed making
such extensive use of construction equipment. It was the first and so far
the only World Bank project in Vietnam. It was therefore not surprising that
MWR lacked experience in the planning and implementation of such a project
and that decision-making often seemed to be slow. Planning and appraisal
went ahead on the basis of inadequate survey data which resulted in
extensive changes to the design of the irrigation system. These required
l



- 20 -
lengthy approval by two deputy ministries of MWR. The Government agencies
involved in the project included: the Institute of Design and Survey (IDS)
of the MfR, responsible for the design of the irrigation infrastructure; the
construction parastatal, Construction Enterprise No. 4 of MWR, carrying out
the major civil works; the State procurement compa&   Technoimport; Tay Ninh
Provincial Administration responsible for the con3truction of the tertiary
canal system and on-farm development; the Ministry of AgricuIture (Hanoi);
and the Tay Ninh Provincial Agricultural Service (PAS), responsible for the
provision of agricultural support services.
6.2     The civil works were designed by IDS. Once correct survey data were
obtained, design was, in general, carried out competently. However, the IDA
supervision mission in 1980 reported that MWR did not prepare technical
specifications to control the quality of construction, with techntcal
instructions included only on the construction drawings. More detailed
specifications could have facilitated quality control, thereby improving the
quality of construction.
6.3     Construction of the main civil works was entrusted to the MWR
Hydraulic Works Company No. 9 which was amalgamated into Construction
Enterprise No. 4 in 1980, whose performance is described in Chapter 3.
6.4     A project manager assisted by a small project unit was responsible
for design and construction but at the outset lacked the necessary authority
for coordination and decision making and the experienced staff necessary for
supervising construction to achieve internationally acceptable standards of
workmanship. In the circumstances, the successful (though late) completion
of the project is a considerable achievement of which MWR can be proud. MWR
could have received much assistance and valuable training had suitably
experienced foreign consultants been employed to assist with planning,
design, preparation of specifications and supervision of construction.
Although IDA supervision missions proposed the employment of consultants,
GOV were reluctant to do this (foreign consultants were employed in 1986 to
prepare a water management programme). Technical assistance was provided by
IDA supervision missions and in particular by the panel of foreign dam
experts (GOV first appointed three Vietnamese experts but IDA and Kuwait
Fund considered that more independent experienced engineers should be
employed. Kuwait Fund financed a report by three sach people, one of whom
was employed as a consultant by IDA on 3 supervision missions). Continuity
of staff, both by MWR azid IDA, ensured that understanding, cooperation and
learning developed.
6.5     Supervision missions reported that project management could be
improved in a number of areas, including financial management and
accounting, and planning and programming. Coordination of the activities of
the different agencies, notably the IDS and the PAS, had been poor. Design
of the tertiary irrigation system and on-farm development did not start
until after secondary canals in some areas were complete; arrangements for



- 21 -
the execution of these works by farmers were not well defined. An
implementatior. schedule of all project activities detailing critical paths,
prepared by the project unit and agreed by all agencies, would have
facilitated planning and programming.
Ministry of Foreign Trade
6.6     Technoimport, which was responsible for all foreign procurement, had
limited experience of such work and none of dealing with World Bank
procurement procedures. Consequently, there were some delays in the early
contracts. Excessive time taken to scrutinize imports in Ho Chi Minh City to
ensure compliance with specification also delayed arrival of plant on
site. However, after these initial problems, Technoimport performed
satisfactorily.
Training
6.7     A vocational school for training construction equipment operators
was established on site in 1979 and the construction company's experienced
operators trained new staff. Suppliers' contracts provided for limited
training with their equipment. Operators were said to be competent and
learning quickly. Although a formal maintenance training programme was
considered to be necessary, this was not arranged.
6.8     Short-term expatriate studies on construction management and
training requirements were completed in July 1981, but there was little
response to the report's recommendations. Two foreign engineers spent 2
weeks in December 1982 providing instruction in construction scheduling and
equipment maintenance. IIWR found the sessions interesting but did not gain
much, possibly due to their short duration.
6.9     IDA organized a four-week visit to Sri Lanka in February 1983 for
project staff and irrigation engineers, led by the Vice-Minister of MWR.
Several irrigation schemes at various stages of construction and operation
were visited. It was one of the first such visits made by Vietnamese
engineers for a long time and gave them a unique opportunity to compare
technologies. The Ministry requested more visits to such countries as
Australia, Indonesia and India to review irrigation design and construction
and hydraulic research but this did not happen.
Agricultural Support Services
6.10    Although the appraisal report recognized the need for strengthening
agricultural support services in the area, no financing for this was



- 22 -
included in the project. Planning and implementation of the p.ogramme were
left with GOV as a condition to the credit agreement. Therefore, the
appraisal report gave almost no account of the institutional apsects of
agricultural support services under the project.
6.11    Tay Ninh Provincial Agricultural Service (PAS) produced a brief
report on the 10-year agricultural development programme in 1984 for the
original 42,000 ha project area commanded by the West Canal Network. The
report does not contain detailed requirements for additional staff,
equipment and facilities, nor organization and management aspects qf the
programme. Since the location of the project area was changed substantially
after 1984, the report requires considerable revision. However, no revised
version has been prepared so far.
6.12    The PAS falls under the Department of Agriculture Production within
the Management Division of the recently reformed Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Industry. The PAS is responsible for providing agricultural support
services, including research, extension and input supply, to the project
area. Each of the six districts involved in the west and east canal command
area, has a District Agricultural Office, an Agricultural Production Company
and District Veterinary Station. There are presently about 70 senior
agricultural staff (university graduate) and about 110 agricultural
technicians in the six project districts. It is reported that the above
facilities and staff were virtually non-existent at the time of appraisal.
The existing support services are constrained, however, by limited financial
and material resources and therefore cannot provide adequate support
services to the project farmers.
Cooperatives
6.13    The appraisal report envisaged that all the farming ae:tivities would
be implemented through cooperatives by organizing private farmers in the
project area, following the GOV policy at that time. In reality, however,
the cooperative development has not been very successful in the project area
and elsewhere in the South. Although GOV still encourages farmers to form
cooperatives or production units by providing easier access to farm inputs
for members, it appears that no significant increase in the formation of new
cooperatives is expected. The exact number of cooperatives in the project
area is presently not available. In Tay Ninh Province, there are 32
cooperatives with 6,400 farm families in total, 1,627 production units with
about 79,000 farm families, and 56,000 private farm far.ilies. The production
unit in the area is a group of farmers who have organized themselves for
work exchange or mutual aid for crop production. There appears to be no
strict profit-sharing system. There is practically no difference between
private farmers sad farmers in production units.
Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
6.14    The main civil engineering works have not yet been formally handed
over to the 0&H organization. It is now proposed that O&M should be the



- 23 -
responsibility of the Combinat for Operation of Dau Tieng Irrigation; the
Project Manager during implementation will become the General Manager of
this combinat. Under the General Manager there will be four manager3
responsible for:
-  operation of the west canal irrigation system;
-  operation of the spillway and east canal irrigation system;
-  operation of the irrigation in Ho Chi Minh district (at the
downstream end of the east canal);
- maintenance and repair of all works down to and including
secondary canals.
6.15    The managers for operation will be responsible for collecting water
charges. Any shortfall between the cost of O&M and the amount collected for
water charges will be provided by the provincial governments.
6.16    Water users' groups are responsible for O&M in tertiary and
downstream works.
Performance of IDA
6.17    The project was prepared and appraised at a time of rapidly changing
social conditions and it was difficult to obtain reliable data. IDA
considered that delays in processing the credit would have adverse effects
on future relations with Vietnam and raise doubts as to the seriousness of
IDA in helping Vietnam's reconstruction and development efforts. Appraisal
went ahead on the basis of insufficiently accurate topographical information,
which contributed to considerable delay in implementation. Further study of
the optimum size of the reservoir might have resulted in the selection of a
smaller reservoir, with considerable cost savings and little effect on Stage
I and Stage II benefits. The SAR did not foresee that the supply of
agricultural inputs would be a constraint.
6.18    Eighteen IDA supervision missions visited the project between 1978
and 1986. IDA supervision staff assisted MWR with design, procurement and
other problems. Continuity of staff on IDA missions helped to achieve good
understanding and cooperation. IDA concern over weakness in design of the
dam was overcome by including dam experts in supervision missions. This
averted what one mission considered to be a major weakness in the design of
the spillway which could have led to failure of the dam. Additional canal
regulator structures were constructed following advice from a supervision
mission. However, IDA did not enforce the convenants concerning operating
instructions for spillway gates and regular inspections of the completed
dam.



_ 24 -
Performance of Cofinanciers
6.19    There were several cofinanciers' meetings to discuss the project.
The Kuwait Fund was the most active cofinancier, mounting at least one
independent supervision mission, joining three IDA superviliion missions as              r
well as financing the dam review panel in late 1982. Disbursement by the
Kuwait Fund was temporarily suspended in 1982 until a satisfactcry review
panel was formed. When the overrun in foreign costs became apparent, only
the Kuwait Fund provided additional finance; this wes on condition that
reliable cost estimates were prepared and satisfactory remedial action was
taken concerning the spillway floor. The Kuwait Fund also represented OPEC's
interests.
6.20    The Government of the Netherlands (GON) financed dump trucks and
other equipment from the Netherlands. There were early difficulties in
agreeing on specifications. GON declined to finance additional spare parts
for their equipment even though only about 80? of their loan was disbursed.
A representative of GON joined one IDA supervision mission.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
Conclusions
7.1     Construction of the project works has been substantially completed
and over 75? of the target area can now receive irrigation; it is estimated
that the necessary minor irrigation and drainage works to permit irrigation
of the full 42,000 ha will be completed by the end of 1990. However,
incremental production due to the project is estimated to be substantially
less than estimated at appraisal mainly due to lower crop yields.
7.2     Because of the unreliability of energy supplies, the location of the
areas attributed to the IDA project has been adjusted to minimize the area
served by pumping.
7.3     Although the flow into the reservoir appears to be less than assumed
at appraisal, there is ample water for irrigation of the project area of
42,000 ha and for the Stage II area now assumed to be 97,000 ha. Further
utudy of water availability would be needed before substantial development
beyond Stage I' is undertaken; this could also be constrained by scarcity of
energy for pumping.
7.4     To make optimum use of the available water, improvement of the water
management and water control would be required.
7.5     DesIgn and construction of the dam, dyke and their structures are
considered safe but, until satisfactory operating procedures for the
spillway gates have been established, it is recommended that the reservoir
level is kept sufficiently low to provide sufficient unused storage cap ity
to absorb the design flood.



- 25 -
7.6     The GOV has not yet established a satisfactory procedure for
periodically inspecting the dam and appurtenant works in accordance with
sound engineering practice, in order to determine whether there are any
deficiencies in the conditions of the structures or in the quality or the
adequacy of the operation or maintenance which may endanger their safety.
7.7     The completed works have not yet been handed over to the newly
appointed O&M organization. The O&M organization should be established and
formal handing-over effected as soon as practicable.
7.8     Achievement of full agricultural development is constrained by the
availability and price of fertilizer, insecticide and quality seed.
7.9     The estimated economic rate of return is much lower than anticipated
at appraisal due r.inly to lower forecast price of rice, delay in completion
and lower crop yields than estimated at appraisal.
Lessons
7.10    Project implementation would have proceeded more quickl7 and
smoothly if adequate survey had been done and if the design of the dam and
major works had been completed before appraisal. This is an inevitable risk
when projects are prepared under extreme pressure to lend.
7.11    Procurement of equipment and materials using ICB in accordance with
Bank guidelines can be a lengthy procedure. It is unrealistic to expect
equipment to be in use on site within considerably less than a year of tne
appraisal report unless the procurement process has started beforehand.
7.12    A first-time borrower from the Bank, with little experience of
international procedures and standards, could benefit from strong technical
assistance with planning, design, specification, procurement and
construction.
7.13    Covenants can be enforced by suspending disbursement as was done by
the Kuwait Fund to ensure appointment of a satisfactory dam review panel.
7.14    Provision of agricultural support services was excluded from the
project at appraisal; although considerable attention was given to this
during supervision, the borrower did not have the incentive to cooperate
with the Bank that could have been provided by the inclusion of specific
items for agricultural support services.
7.15    When appraising a project in a country which is short of fertilizer
and foreign-exchange to buy it abroad, the provision of fertilizer under the
project should be considered and the pricing of inputs and outputs should be
discussed and agreed with the borrower at appraisal.

ANNEX
VIET NAM
DAU TIENG IRRIGATION PROJECT (CREDIT 845-VN)
DAU TIENG RESERVOIR-SAFLTY ASPECTS
A. Introduction
1.     This annex has been written to respond to the World Bank's request
that reservoir safety be given special attention in the project completion
report. Ho Chi Minh ^ity is situated about 65 km downstream of the main
dam and a catastrophic failure of this dam could affect the city.
2.         This annex is based on a 3-day vist to the reservoir and
discussions with staff of the Minisitry of Water Resources (MWR) concerned
with design, construction and operation of the dam.
B. Description of Reservoir
3.      The reservoir has a total storage capacity of 1,580 Mm3. It is
situated in a seismic zone.
4.      The dam proper is a homogeneous earthfill structure, 28.0 m high
above the river bed and about 1.5 km long. An inclined "chimney" sand
filter is incorporated in the downstream section and there is a
sheet-piled cutoff to rock level over the deepest part.
5.      The spillway is a separate concrete structure adjacent to the
northeast end of the dam. It is founded on rock with a downstream channel
leading to the river.
6.      Along the west side of the reservoir, the dam is continued as a
27 km long dyke varying from 8.0 to 2.0 m high. Some 11 km along the dyke
from the main dam there is an auxiliary dam, 20.0 m high.
7.      Appendix 1 gives further details of the main characteristics.
C. Physical Inspection of Dam Works
8.      The dam, spillway, spillway channel and the dyke including the
auxiliary dam were inspected visually. Features noted are grouped under
their headings, not geographically according to their locations.



- 40 -
Percolation
9.      Three cases of percolation were noted dcwnstream of the dam:
(1)      A flow of the order of 3 to 4 l,ie on the left bank at
the downstream toe, assoclated apparently with the
east side of the river diversion culvert, now the
scour culvert. Clear water.
(2)      A flow of about 100 l/s along a rough drainage channel
following the downstream toe on the right bank between
the east intake and the scour culvert. Clear water. This
could be from the dam or from the upstream end of the
east drainage canal or both.
(3)      A significant flow of about 800 1/s discharging below
the east canal (in culvert) to the river, about 100 m
downstream of the dam. This flow, in an earth-lined
channel, was said to come from the downstream seepage of
the 11 km of dyke below the saddle dam ples some natural
surface drainage downstream of the dam. There had been
no rain for at least two weeks, perhaps longer. Clear
water. There was insufficient time to follow this drain
to its origin.
10.    Two cases of percolation were noted along the length of the dyke:
(a)      A flow of perhaps 20 l/s from the auxiliary dam,
confined in an earth channel and discharging into
the west irrigation canal. Clear water.
(b)      A small flow of about 2 1/s at km 19 along the dyke.
Clear water.
11.      In addition, for almost the whole 27 km of the dyke there were
stagnant pools of water, up to about 20 cm deep. These lay in a low
continuous trench on the downstream side of the dyke, confined by the dyke
and the parallel earth road. The trench looked as though it had been
formed by stripping the vegetative cover, probably for the dyke
construction. Groundwater was noted to be less than 1.0 m below ground
surface level in domestic wells immediately downstream of the road.



- 41 -
12.     The only other flow seen downstream of the dam, apart from gate
leakage, was a flow from a culvert constructed through the dam on the
right bank, which had been designed to provide about 200 1/s for a small
electric generator. No generator had been installed. The flow represented
leakage past the control valve and was discharging into the east
irrigation canal, apparently through a hole in the canal lining.
Settlement Monuments
13.     The four monuments to read dam crest levels were inspected. They
each consist of a small concrete plinth with a 4-inch rail set in it,
about . cm proud of the surface. The concrete plinths appeared very fresh,
perhaps 1-2 weeks old.
Piezometric Tubes
14.    There are four tubes on the same cross sections as the settlement
monuments. All had wooden plugs fitted and two, which were checked at
random, were clear down to water level so satisfactory observation was
possible.
Reservoir Water Level
15.     There is a vertical grad .ated staff to provide for visual
observations.
Surface Erosion
16.     Four areas of erosion due to surface water runoff were noted on
the downstream face of the dam. There are probably more. These were
typically 20 m2 to 60 m2 in area and just below the downstream berm at the
19.50 m level. These areas had not been made good and there was no
evidence of remedial work of any kind. Many examples of similar erosion
were noted along the downstream side of the dyke.
Control Gates
17.     All control gates are in position and operating. Presently, the
weat intake gates are operated manually and the east intake and spillway
employ temporary cabling. The leakage observed past the radial spillway
gates-is acceptable. However, the gatehouse structure in the west inlet
is still under construction and the gates could not, for example, be
hoisted for maintenance. The permanent electrical installation for gate
operation remains to be completed. This is scheduled to be done in 1989
before the rains when the transmission line past the dam (now under
construction) is completed.



- 42 -
18.     It required two days to open a spillway gate selected at random
(No. 4). This was mainly because of: (a) the time required to place the
stoplogs; and (b) a problem in extracting the locking crane hooks from the
stoplog sections. Lifting speed is slow at 2 m/hour so that it takes three
hours to open a radial gate fully. All gates may be operated
simultaneously so that in an emergency the spillway could be fully opened
in three hours, provided no stoplogs are in position.
19.     The two-coat paint protection, which was applied four years ago,
was flaking off badly and the steelwork of the gate was very rusty. The
upstream side was almost bare of paint, there was a continuous film of
rust and pitting of the steel surface had commenced.
Spillway Discha.-ge Channel
20.     The :,000 m long spillway channel downstream of the dam conveys
the spillway discharge back to the Saigon River using a former river
channel.
21.    Overburden over a width of about 70.0 to 100.0 m has been cleared
down to rock and some of the more obvious rock obstructions removed.
However, the bulk of the channel is 'as excavated". Just before it joins
the Saigon River there is a rock bar in the channel which forms a natural
sill to be overtopped by the flood discharge before it gains the river.
Construction Quality
22.        In general,  the quality of earthworks  inspected appeared
satisfactory. Concrete structures appeared in general adequate for their
purpose, but the finish was poor.
23.     Defects of concrete finish included the followins:
- insufficient cover to reinforcement for a water retaining
structure (in fact uncovered steel bars in some locations);
- poorly constructed joints permitting leakage;
- evidence of honeycombed finish covered over by mortar
instead of being cut out and made good;
- shutter ties and other rubbish left cast into the concrete
surface.
24. - Access ladders and walkways and the temporary electrical cabling
seen both fall short of international safety standards.

D. Consideration of Records of Dam Behaviour
25.       Appendix 2 lists the data on dam behaviour supplied to the
mission. In addition, reservoir water level is recorded daily and these
records were shown to the mission. Reservoir water level stood at 23.50
m at the time of the visit. In general, these data are as yet too sparse
to permit an informed judgement, particularly in the case of percolation.
Percolation
26.    Percolation downstream of the dam has already been described. The
two sets of values given, taken at the interval of one year, are clearly
insufficient for any judgement of trend. It is important also to remember
that these are estimates based on assessment of area of a rough earth
channel and of float velocities and in consequence affected by subjective
error. They are not readings of absolute values.
27.      The most that can be said is that the values seem consistent,
which is reassuring, and that the flow which is said to come from the dyke
responded to the increase in reservoir level, as would be expected.
28.    However, the flow from the dam on t}.e right bank at almost 100 lis
is significant and should be closely monitored. Part of this seepage may
be from the east irrigation canal and correlation of a aufficient number
of observations with reservoir level and canal level may throw some light
on this. The flow from the dyke (which may also be the natural drainage
of an area downstream of the dam) seems high and should be monitored. This
requires:
- Regular readings at intervals of not more than a month.
- Accurate readings. This means that percolation flows have to
be confined in a brick or concrete channel and measured by
accurately constructed V notches (for the smaller flows) and
weirs or flumes (for the larger).
- Readings of all percolation seepages. Not only relatively large
flows but all flows must be monitored. In addition to the two
flows just discussed, the following should be read:
(a) percolation downstream on left bank in area of scour
culvert (4  /O);
(b) downstream toe of auxiliary dam west of west
irrigation canal (20 1/s);
(c) downstream of the dyke, at km 19 (2 I/s).
I



- 44 -
29.     in the case of the large flows thought to be from the dyke, the
channel should be traced back from its outlet to the point where the dyke
joins the dam proper and the measuring flume sited at this point. This
wSll 'liminate the possibility of reading part of the natural drainage
belowr tlhe dam. In addition, a second measuring point about halfway between
the dEi and the west intake, say at 6 km, should be established. This will
permn.i an assessment of whether seepage is proportional to distance.
30.      In order to do this, it will be necessary to dig a downstream
ditch to drain the stagnant pools of water. Above the auxiliary dam at 12
km, this ditch will have to discharge to the natural drainage. This would
then permit closer observation of seepage along the dyke.
Settlement
31.      The dam settlement readings taken annually indicate a rate of
settlement of about 3 to 4 cm/year, still in progress but perhaps
decreasing. These values are acceptable. It would be an advantage to take
observations at the maximum and minimum reservoir levels (24.00 m and
17.00 m), which would mean about a 6-month frequency and perhaps even
rnid-point observations whilst settlement is in progress.
32.     It is of course most important to continue to take observations
after initial settlement has ceased and the levels observed have become
steady in order to monitor any subsequent movement.
E. Operation of Reservoir
33.        The mode of operation of the reservoir has obviously been
considered deeply and the sequence of operations to regulate water level
over the year is fully appreciated by the designers. What lacks is a set
of clear operating instructions which can be understood and followed by
junior technical grades. This has a special importance in the Dau Tieng
case where controlled spilling can start only by human intervention.
34.     At present, the O&M organization has been designated in the form
of an organization chart and by defining who is responsible for what
section. The complement to this is the operating manual which would
explain the action required and the regular practice of these actions.
35.      One of the conditions (Section 3.06) of the Development Credit
Agreement is that the expert panel would provide advice for the
preparation of a spillway manual and would recommend a maintenance and
safety-inspection programme. This has not yet been done.
36.    Most important in the formulation of these procedures is that the
person at the dam site has full responsibility and must initiate the
required action without first having to refer to Tay Ninh, Ho Chi Minh or
even Hanoi.



- 45 _
37.      Another aspect of operation is the regular monitoring of dam
behaviour. This requires regular observation of not only reservoir water
level but of settlement, percolation and piezometric levels. Monitoring
implies a close watch of trends.
F. Flood Warning System
38.     The flood warning system at Dau Tieng operates as follows. An
operator at a rain gauge in the catchment area makes rainfall readings at
6-hour intervals during the rainy season. He telegraphs this information
once per day to the dam. The weak point in the system is that it requires
the presence on the dam of a person with the intelligence and initiative
to interp.et the information and to decide if action (e.g. opening
spillway gates) is required.
39.    The operation manual already referred to (Section E) for spillway
operation would contain explicit instructions for action, based on
intensity and duration of the rainfall.
40.        The mission visited the Mekong Secretariat in Bangkok and
discovered the existence of another early warning system. A diagram of the
communication  system  between  the  Secretariat  and  the  Regional
Meteorological and Hydrological Centre in Ho Chi Minh City and also Hanoi
is shown in Appendix 3.
41.      Although the information is mainly for flooding in the Mekong
River and Delta, the Secretariat has a satellite forecast of cyclone
activity in the China Sea and a tracking system which operates during the
cyclone season. This is broadcast by radio every morning to the Regional
Meteorological Centre in Ho Chi Minh City. Heavy rains in the wake of
cyclones are one of the causes of flooding in the region and it would
clearly be prudent to establish a formal link bet:ween the Regional
Meteorological Centre in Ho Chi Minh and the dam.
G. Commentary
General
42.       In creating a reservoir in a seismic area which relies on
mechanical operation of the spillway, the designers have relied on
well-trained operating personnel. Amongst the junior staff at the dam
there is the lack of a clear understanding of what physical actions are
required for reservoir operation and what signals would cause these
actions to be taken. All the information required to compile operating
instructions exists already in various reports and calculations; what
remains to be done is to codify this material into clear instructions
meaningful to junior staff.



46 -
43.     At present, the project manager is the only person in a position
to interpret the data and to decide whien to start opening the spillway
gates. Even now it is not clear whether he could initiate this action on
his own responsibility or whether he would have to refer first to a higher
authority in Ho Chi Minh City or in Hanoi. He is not, of course, resident
365 days per year at the dam site.
Hydraulic Design Parameters
44.     The original design flood (SAR) was taken as that with a return
period of 1,000 years. This was estimated to have a total volume of 820
Mm3 and a maximum reservoir inflow of 5,600 m3/s. It was estimated that
this flow would be passed through the reservoir starting from the maximum
operating level of 24.40 and rising to a maximum 25.90 with a spillway
discharge of 2,500 m3/s.
45.    When the dam review panel visited the site in December 1982, these
values were revised taking into account rainfall data from 1915 to 1975
and discharge measurements near the dam site from 1976 to 1979. The 1,000
year flood was then estimated to have a total volume of 563 Mm3 and a
maximum  reservoir  inflow of 5,860 m3/s.  Starting  from  the maximum
operating level of 24.40, this flood would be passed through the reservoir
at maximum level 25.10 and a spillway discharge of 2,800 m3/s.
46.     In response to the review panel's concern with the effects of a
catastrophic dam-burst on the population downstream and to the continued
insistence of the supervision missions, the main embankment level was
raised to 28.00. The top level of the long dyke was left at 27.00. Because
of the risk to Ho Chi Minh City downstream, the panel considered that the
dam should be able to withstand the flood with a retain period of 10,000
years. This is estimated as 700 Mm3 total volume and will pass through
the reservoir at about 26.0 m maximum level with the spillway discharge
at 2,800 m3/s. On the Creager curve for a catchment area of 2,700 km2,
this flood of 7,200 m3/s is 64Z of the probable maximum flood and as such
may be taken as acceptable.
47.     It might be argued that the importance of Ho Chi Minh City merits
an even more conservative flood protection than that of 1 in 10,000 years.
The reservoir designers have provided this extra protection by leaving the
top elevation of the west dyke at le-el 27.00 when the level of the main
dam embankment was raised to the 28.00 level.
48.       If the rare event of a maximum flood occurred and it were
sufficient to overtop the reservoir, the breach would occur in the west
dyke.,This would draw down the reservoir water level thereby protecting
the mai- dam embankment. The resulting flood would pass down the valley
of the west irrigation canal and a newly constructed drain to the valley
of the Vam Co Dong River. This river discharges to the sea without passing
through Ho Chi Minh City.



_ 47 
49.    A consideration of the foregoing discussion leads us to recommend
the following:
(1)     To check that the 28.00 level of embankment is continued
a safe distance past the Saigon River watershed.
(2)      To check, as recommended by the 1982 review panel, the
shape of the design flood hydrographs by analyzing actual
flood hydrographs from the Saigon River or similar
catchments.
(3)      To route the flood resulting from a catastrophic
failure of the dyke and saddle dam down the
west irrigation valley using, for example, the
empirical approech suggested by Kirkpatrick in the
August 1977 issue of "Water Power'. This would give some
assessment of the potential threat to the downstream
population.
(4)      If necessary, to prepare a 'disaster plan' for the
affected area with advance warning as a prominent
component.
50.     The spillway consists of six submerged radial gates each 10.0 m
wide and 6.0 m high with an invert level of 14.00. At maximum reservoir
level (25.10) these 6 openings appear adequate to pass the design
discharge of 2,800 m3/s. At a reservoir level of 26.50 (which still leaves
1.50 m freeboard at the dam) 5 openings will pass the design discharge.
This would allow for the failure of one gate to operate. Spillway capacity
may therefore be accepted as adequate. It must never be forgotten,
however, that spillway discharge depends on correct functioning of the
gates which in turn depend on human action aid perfect maintenance of the
gates and raising equipment.
51.    Maximum jet velocity at just over 13 m/s is below the value of 15
so that cavitation should not pose undue problems. The cut-off wall at the
downstream end of the spillway chute which the 1982 review panel
recommended has been built to prevent erosion from stilling-pool back
eddies. The spillway chute may therefore be considered adequate for its
purpose.
52.   - Under the effect of maximum discharge, the spillway channel will
suffer some erosion but the dam and spillway proper are unlikely to be
affected. Large floods are sufficiently rare to permit repairs and
modifications to be carried out after the event, if necessary. The
discharge channel                   .            e     <

Seismic Design Parameters
53.       The greatest seismic shock recorded in the area (historical
epicentre about 100 km distant) is 6 on the Richter scale. The dam cross
section is designed for a value of 8 on the Richter scale. This is
reasonable. There is no record of induced seismicity during impounding.
There are no steep slopes to the sides of the reservoir and the average
depth of the full reservoir is 6.0 m. It is reasonable to expect no tidal
wave effect rrom these conditions.
Observance of the 1982 Review Panels' Recommendations
54.     A review panel, composed of three foreign engineers, visiteW. the
dam in December 1982 and made recommendations. Most but not all of these
recommendations were adopted. Amongst those not carried out are:
(1)      Construction of a line of relief wells immediately
downstream of the dam about 15 m deep and at 15 m
centres.
(2)      The placing of pore pressure cells at the interface of
fill and vertical concrete walls.
(3)      The placing of pore pressure cells in sand foundation
upstream and downstream of the sheet-piled cut-off.
(4)      Tri-axial tests on dam fill material.
(5)       Effective corrosion protection of hydraulic control
gates by chipping and painting.
55.        The construction of relief wells downstream of the dam as
suggested in 1 above has no immediate function for the operation of the
embankment. It would be advisable to defer any decision to drill such
wells until the mode and amount of percolation is understood.
56.     It is too late to place pressure cells as suggested in 2 and 3
above. These might have yielded useful information on the percolation now
being observed.
57.     It would still be possible to do tri-axial tests on samples
collected from the embankment.
58.       The spillway gates in particular were observed to be badly
corroded. Chipping or sandblasting, cleaning and painting now and at
regular intervals in the future will be required.



49 -
Monitoring and Testing
59.     The percolation flows of 100 l/s and 800 1/s are 1:rge enough to
cause worry. Their origins are not clear. It is therefore most important
to start monitoring on the basis of accurate and regular measurements to
get to now the behaviour of the embankment and to recognize trends.
60.     In addition to percolation there is a need for a programme of
monitorings
- embankment settlement;
- piezometric levels.
61.     As before the purpose of the monitoring is to understand the
behaviour of the structure and to recognize trends away from normal.
Operation of Reservoir
62.    The importance of clearly understood procedures to ensure correct
operation of the spillway at all times has already been stressed. The
writing of these procedures is the immediate priority for the proprietors
of the reservoir. The second priority is to ensure that everyone concerned
down to junior staff is fully aware of these procedures and that operating
instructions are freely available.
63.    Following from this, there should be adequate training which would
include testing of gate opening both with electrical supply and hand
operation, allied to a regular servicing of mechanical parts.
Quality of Finish
64.       The concrete finishes already described under "construction
quality" are poor. This requires repair and regular maintenance to keep
steel reinforcement covered, to prevent further deterioration of joints
and to improve poor or honeycombed surfaces. A regular programme of
systematic repair and maintenance could improve the finish.
Maintenance and Repair
65.       It was an obligation of the dam review panel to recommend a
suitabie maintenance and safety inspection programme. This has not so far
been produced. It is most important to make this programme as early as
possible and to put it into effect. Nothing appears to have been done in
the past two years, for example, to make good surface erosion of the
embankment due to rain.
IS



- 50 _
66.     Such a programme should include systematic attention to:
- embankment erosion: regular replacement and compaction of
material washed out by filling and compacting, for example,
with small aggregate. Construction of erosion barriers in
selected areas.
- concrete finish: repair and making good of surface
imperfections, in particular inadequate cover, exposed
reinforcement and poorly finished joints.
- regular inspection and repair as necessary of upstream concrete
slabs, downstream rip-rap, and stone protection walls.
Periodic Inspection of Completed Rt -vjir
67.      The terms of the DCA (Section 4.02) requires the borrower to
arrange for the periodic inspection of the completed reservoir works in
accordance with sound engineering practice; this would normally require
inspection by independent experts annually for the first few years after
construction and every 5 years thereafter. The DCA requires that the
Government's proposals for the periodic inspections be submitted to IDA
for its consideration not later than December 1981. This has net yet been
done. It is important that these periodic inspections conmence as soon as
possible.
H. Summary of Recommendations
68.    The recommendations for action are summarized below for convenient
reference. The order given is the mission's assessment of priority.
(1)      Prepare a manual in several bound copies of operating
procedures for the reservoir. Promulgate to all
concerned. Until this is done, keep reservoir level
to maximum 22.50 m. This level ensures that the
10,000 year flood can be absorbed in the reservoir
without operation of the spillway gates.
Institute reasonably frequent drills of these procedures
including checks on gate operation (see Operation of
Reservoirs and Commentary).



- 51 -
(2)     As required by clause 4.02(b) of the DCA, make a proposal
to IDA for the periodic inspections of the completed
reservoir works by suitably qualified independent experts
and carry out such inspections.
(3)      Start to monitor percolation closely:
- construct measuring devices;
- take weekly observations;
- make a daily visual inspection (see Dam Behaviour).
r
(4)      Clean, prepare and paint all exposed hydraulic steel-
work - in particular the spillway radial gates - with
at least a 4-coat recommended paint system (see
Commentary).
(5)      Drain the pools of water downstream of the dyke
(see Dam Behaviour).
(6)      Prepare a manual of maintenance and safety procedures
(see Operation of Reservoir).
(7)      Establish a formal dnd permanently live link with the
Mekong early warning system through the Regional
Meteorological Centre in Ho Chi Minh City (see Flood
Warning).
(8)     Increase the frequency of embankment settlement readings
from 1 year to 3 months (see Dam Behaviour).
(9)     Check shape of the various flood hydrographs used in the
design process against a continuously increasing stock
of actual flood hydrographs from the Saigon River (see
Commentary).
(10)     Check that dam crest level of +28.0 m extends a safe
distance beyond the boundary of the Saigon River
watershed and route the catastrophic dyke-burst flood
down the Vam Co Dong valley. If necessary, prepare a
"disaster plan' (see Commentary).
