/1 Before May 1978 different currencies circulated in southern and northern
Viet Nam. The exchange rate between the US dollar and the Northern Dong
(the currency used for all official transactions) varied monthly, averag-
ing approximately D 2.80 per dollar in 1976 and D 2.50 per dollar in
1I77. The latter rate is used throughout this report. A unified cur-
rency system was introduced in early May 1978 (essentially by replacing
the Southern Dong with the Northern Dong in the south) and the new Dong
was pegged to the SDR at the rate of D 2.66358 per SDR. The Dong/US
dollar rate is set on the basis of the SDR/dollar exchange rate and was
D 2.19 per dollar at the end of May 1978.

VIET NAM
DAU TIENG IRRIGATION PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has requested IDA assistance
for the construction of a storage dam and an irrigation system for 42,000 ha
in Tay Ninh Province in the southwestern part of Viet Nam.  Field investiga-
tions and studies for the proposed project were carried out by the Ministry
of Water Conservancy (MWC). This report is based on the findings of a project
preparation mission which visited Viet Nam in September 1977, and an appraisal
mission composed of Messrs. A. Golan, J.T. Caparas, W.P. Ting (IDA), A. Delon
(FAO/IBRD-CP), H. Boumendil and C.S. Reyes (Consultants), which visited Viet
Nam in January 1978. Mr. R.L.P. Harris and Ms. N.K. Boetker also contributed
to the preparation of the report.
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.02      General.  Issues, objectives and strategy in the agricultural and
rural sector are described in the Bank's Introductory Economic Report /1 and
are summarized here. It must be borne in mind that, at a time when consider-
able changes are under way in Viet Nam, it is difficult to give a comprehen-
sive picture of the structure of the economy in general, or the agricultural
and rural sector in particular. Statistics are scarce and statistical ser-
vices limited and in the process of being reorganized. In addition, it
is difficult to reconcile and combine data from the north and the south
collected on different bases, and structural changes being implemented in the
south are not yet accurately reflected in the data.
1.03      Agriculture is by far the most important economic sector in Viet
Nam: it is estimated that about 70% of the population earns its income
from agriculture, which constitutes about 40% of the national income. In
addition, it is the main source of raw materials for the processing indus-
tries, and a major contributor to exports. While the north has concentrated
on mining and manufacturing, the south has traditionally been the agricul-
tural heartland of Viet Nam, accounting for more than half the cultivated
land and paddy production and all the area under rubber, formerly the coun-
try's largest export. However, three decades of almost continuous warfare
seriously damaged the agricultural sector through the destruction and neglect
of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, the loss of draft animals, des-
truction of equipment, defoliation of vast areas of forests, and above all,
by the displacement of population and the abandonment of agricultural land.
1.04      While the country's geography and natural conditions favor agricul-
ture, there are many constraints to the expansion of production. Potential
arable land amounts to 9-10 million ha, but only 5.6 million ha are cul-
tivated at present! with double cropping the total cropped area is about

8.3 million ha, or only 0.17 ha per capita, which is among the lowest in the
world. Factors limiting the expansion of production include the shortage of
heavy equipment for clearing new land, constructing and maintaining irriga-
tion and drainage systems and salinity control works the shortage of inputs,
such as high-yielding rice varieties, fertilizers and agrochemicals, largely
due to insufficient foreign exchange: and the short supply of consumer goods,
which is proving to be a disincentive for farmers and cooperatives to grow
more than their own needs.
1.05      The supply of rice, the basic food, is the Government's foremost
concern.  The north was traditionally a food deficit area, despite well
developed water control systems, the prevalence of double cropping and high
yields. The south, which became a net importer during the war, has conside-
rable potential to expand area, yields and output and resume its former role
as a rice exporting region. Apart from rice, the agricultural sector also
produces a wide variety of food and commercial crops such as corn, rubber,
tea, coffee and jute. Rubber, previously an important export crop, suffered
badly during the war and requires extensive rehabilitation. The same
applies to Viet Nam's fisheries, which supply the second most important item
of the diet and also contribute to exports. The output of the forest
industry was also much reduced by wartime disruption and damage, and it is
difficult to expand quickly because of shortage of equipment and transport
facilities.
1.06      Planning, Objectives and Strategy.  The framework for economic
policy is set out in the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1976-80). The
thrust of the Plan can be summarized in two general aims:  to build the
economic and social infrastructure for sustained and rapid long-term growth
and to improve the material and cultural life of the working population.
A major objective is the full integration of the south into Viet Nam's
socialist economy, while agriculture is given a clear priority among the
productive sectors. Within this broad framework, the Plan has the following
main objectives for the agricultural and rural sector:
(a)  Foodgrain Self-sufficiency.  The food situation remains a major
preoccupation of the authorities. In 1976, food output increased
by 19.5% over 1975, and grain production by about 17%, reaching
13.7 million tons paddy equivalent (including 12 million tons
paddy). Still, this left a food grain deficit of about one million
tons of rice and 150,000 tons of wheat. Daily rations had to be
reduced and stocks fell below security levels. Plans to reduce the
rice deficit to 500,000 tons in 1977 were subverted by cold weather
in the north, droughts in the south, floods and typhoon damage,
coupled with a continued shortage of foreign exchange which limited
purchases of fertilizers, pesticides, other agricultural inputs and
equipment. In 1977, grain production fell to 13 million tons
(including 11.2 million tons paddy), leaving an import require-
ment of 1.5 million tons.



- 3 -
Top priority is now being given to increasing rice output, with
the intention of achieving self-sufficiency in grains by 1980.
With rising per capita consumption to improve nutritional standards
and the growth of population at a rate of 2.5-3.0% also increasing
the amount required over time, self-sufficiency will be difficult
to achieve.
(b) Rural Employment. The Government's second major concern is the
need to create productive employment opportunities. The end of
the war left 3 million people unemployed in the south; by early
1977 the number was still 1.5 million. Additional jobs are also
needed for new entrants to the labor force, estimated at one
million annually. The main effort to deal with the employment
problem consists of the creation of New Economic Zones - agricul-
tural settlements that are intended to resettle four to five
million people by the end of 1980. The majority of settlers are
to come from the overcrowded cities of the south and some from the
overpopulated parts of the Red River Delta in the north. The New
Economic Zones are fundamental to the country's development strategy
in that they are intended both to solve the employment problem and
raise agricultural output. However it is estimated that in 1977
the Government was able to achieve only one-third of its target of
resettling one million people. The Government now plans to appeal
more directly to young people who may be more ideologically com-
mitted to resettle in new areas and to give high priority to these
areas for the delivery of State-procured grains, and the provision
of housing and domestic water supplies.
(c) Cooperatives. In the south the Government will create new
cooperative forms of agricultural enterprise as an important
step toward socializing the agricultural sector, in line with the
evolution of cooperatives in the north. Private farm ownership
is still the rule in the south, although the Government is now
organizing mutual-aid work teams of private farmers and by estab-
lishing pilot cooperatives to gain experience, especially in areas
where the possibility of large-scale, mechanized production exists.
The Government appears to be following a cautious approach to its
program of social transformation in the south, and priority given
instead to increasing production. Although no data are available
on the number of production cooperatives formed, it appears that so
far about 25% of the population has become involved in the social-
ization process.
(d)  Rural Incomes and Incentives.  To a large extent rural incomes are
determined as a matter of policy through a combination of agricul-
tural taxes, production quotas and procurement prices. A progres-
sive agricultural production tax is collected from all private
farmers.  The actual rate imposed is determined by the size of the
farmer's annual production, area of land cultivated and family
size, so that farmers with lower production or smaller cultivated



-4-
area per family member would pay lower rates. The current rates
range from 8-33% of annual production, with the average rate
expected to be about 12%. To encourage double cropping farmers
are taxed only on their main crop, but a tax will be imposed on
second crops once double cropping has become an established
practice. For agricultural cooperatives a floor income exists
with the Government providing assistance in times of natural
disaster. A ceiling is also fixed, to some extent, by the agricul-
tural tax system and the requirement to sell a large proportion of
production to the Government at a predetermined price. Whether
the rural income policy actually gives farmers an incentive to
produce a marketable surplus will largely depend on the availa-
bility and price of consumer goods. In recognition of this fact
the Government is giving increased priority in its industrial
planning to the production of basic consumer goods for rural
areas. Agricultural planning in many areas of the south is based
on reciprocal economic contracts which allow farmers to purchase
a given quantity of materials and consumer goods from the Govern-
ment in return for a specific quantity of products sold to the
state. The Government's social sector policy to provide the
minimum basic needs of the population will also affect production
incentives. Primary education and medical services are now free,
while food, clothing and housing are made available at low cost;
where supplies are scarce rationing is used, as for grains and
textiles. Pricing policies are also used to bring essential
goods and services within reach of the whole population and to
restrict nonessential consumption.
1.07      Irrigation and Rice Production.  The main agricultural area are
the two large deltas! the Red River Delta in the north (1.5 million ha)
and the Mekong Delta in the south (about 6.5 million ha). Rice is by far
the most important crop, covering about 75% of the cultivated area. In the
north, the wet season crop (July-November) occupies from 1.3 to 1.5 million
ha, of which over 1 million ha are in the Red River Delta. Irrigation
facilities have been developed on 70-80% of the agricultural land in the
Red River Delta, and paddy yield under normal climatic conditions is about
3 ton/ha! however, because of uneven rainfall distribution and frequent
typhoons causing flooding and waterlogging, the average yield is estimated
at only 2.5 ton/ha. A dry-season crop (February-June) is grown on almost
all fertile soils with a controlled water supply, or about 1 million ha.
The total area under rice in the south is estimated to be 2.7 million
ha, of which 2.1 million are in the Mekong Delta and 0.6 million in the
coastal plains. As in the north, the wet season crop is the most important
(2.4 million ha). Since only about 10% of the rice area in the south is
irrigated, production is dependent on rainfall, which is unreliable in
terms of timing and amount. However, with small low-lift pumps and short-
duration varieties, yields are becoming more stable and average 2.5 ton/ha.
Double cropping is practiced on only about 300,000 ha, of which 250,000 ha
are in the Mekong Delta. Expansion of double cropping is limited by
salinity problems in the coastal areas of the Delta, and by a lack of
irrigation facilities.



1.08      In line with its objective to achieve self-sufficiency in grains
by 1980, the Government proposes to develop about one million ha of new
land and to intensify cropping on some two million ha of cultivated land,
part of which is already irrigated. Toward this end the Government has,
with its own funds, begun the rehabilitation and improvement of existing
irrigation systems in the north, which were damaged or had deteriorated due
to inadequate maintenance during the war years. It is also constructing
some small and medium-sized systems with whatever equipment is available.
In the south, where considerable potential to expand rice output exists,
the Government is already rehabilitating irrigation and drainage systems in
the Mekong Delta by mobilizing the under-employed labor force. External
assistance is needed mainly for larger scale projects requiring mechanical
equipment. The Government is about to start construction of new irrigation
and drainage schemes with ten large dredges purchased from French suppliers,
and is in an advanced stage of negotiation with the Netherlands for another
water control project which would reduce the risk of crop loss on periodi-
cally flooded rainfed crop land.
1.09      Institutions.  The main institutions responsible for rice produc-
tion are the Ministry of Water Conservancy (MWC) for the design, construc-
tion, operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage facilities; the
Ministry of Agriculture for the provision of research, technical advice to
cooperatives and farmers and supply of inputs through the District Revolu-
tionary Committees; the State Bank (through its Agricultural Development
Bank) for the supply of agricultural credit; and the Ministry of Food for
the marketing, transport, processing and storage of agricultural products.
1.10      Bank Lending Strategy.  The Government and the Bank have just
recently begun a dialogue on the strategy for development of the agricultural
and rural sector. Many questions will have to be explored in greater depth
and detail than has been possible to date, in the course of future economic
and sector work. Topics of particular importance include the overall future
food grain situation, arrangements for transforming southern agriculture
along the lines of the socialist model which has proved successful in the
north and the adequacy of production incentives to encourage the achievement
of target output. Nevertheless, the short-term investment priorities are
clear and the Bank fully agrees with the priorities of the Second Five-Year
Development Plan to increase food grain production and rural employment
through expansion and intensification of the cultivated area, and construction
and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems.
Project Formulation
1.11      The Dau Tieng irrigation project, as originally proposed by the
Government, would have included three components:
(a) construction of a storage dam on the Saigon River at Dau Tieng
village, some 120 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, which would
create a usable storage of about 1,000 MCM;



- 6 -
(b) construction of a gravity irrigation system with adequate drainage
facilities to serve 72,000 ha of largely rainfed land below the
dam- and
(c) development of 100,000 ha of new land, which is currently under
bush and jungle, for irrigated sugarcane cultivation through a
series of medium-lift pumps drawing water from the reservoir.
1.12      An IDA mission, which visited Viet Nam in September 1977 at the
Government's request to look into the state of project preparation, found
the investigations for the storage facility and the gravity irrigation
scheme to be in an advanced stage, but noted that the sugarcane component
was considerably less prepared. Furthermore, a preliminary cost estimate
indicated that the irrigation system for the sugarcane component would cost
about US$150 million, and that a further investment of some US$300 million
for sugar factories, power transmission lines, roads and housing for new
settlers would be needed to ensure its success. In view of this huge
investment, the Government has agreed to postpone the development of the
sugarcane component. Because of foreign exchange limitations, the scope of
the proposed project was further scaled down during appraisal to include
only the storage facility and 42,000 ha of the gravity service area (Stage
I). The intake and diversion canal of the system would, however, be sized
to cover the ultimate 72,000 ha service area. Construction of the remaining
30,000 ha would be carried out as part of Stage II of the project, while the
sugarcane component would be developed under Stage III. Until Stages II and
III are implemented. water originally intended for them would be used to
irrigate part of the 70,000 ha of existing rice lands located below and
outside of the project area, which currently suffer from water shortage
(para 2.10).



2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The proposed project is located in the southwestern part of Viet
Nam (Map 13513). The 42,000 ha project area includes five of the southern
districts of Tay Ninh Province. It is bounded by the Saigon River on the
east and by the Cambodian border on the west. Tay Ninh, the provincial
capital, is about 120 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City.
Climate
2.02      The project area's climate is tropical and monsoonal.  The six-month
wet season from June through November produces about 80% of the 1,760 mm
mean annual rainfall. The project area is virtually typhoon-free, and pre-
vailing winds from the west-southwest are mild (5-6 knots). However, they
suck in the warm, moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Siam, which unloads the
heavy wet-season precipitation experienced in the project area. The months
of January to March are almost rainless. Mean monthly temperatures in the
project area vary between 25 and 29 degrees Centigrade. It is coolest in
December and January (absolute minimum 12 degrees Centigrade) and hottest in
April (absolute maximum 39 degrees Centigrade). The mean relative humidity
is about 77%, and annual evaporation is estimated at about 1,800 mm. Clima-
tological and hydrological data for the project area are given in Table 2.1.
Topographv and Soils
2.03      The region is characterized by broad plains between gently
rolling hills with elevations seldom exceeding 20 m (above mean sea level).
The elevation of low portions of the area varies between 6 and 8 m. Soil
maps at 1-50,000 scale for Tay Ninh Province and at 1-25,000 scale for the
five districts in the project area were reviewed by the project preparation
and appraisal missions. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) examined the
soils from four points in each of the fifty areas surveyed in the project
area. About 18-20 samples were taken from depths of 0-100 cm in each of
the areas covered by the survey. Tests made on the soils showed that total
nitrogen and phosphorous levels are moderate to low and that most soils
would respond positively to nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers. The
soils are acidic and have a moderate organic matter and clay content and a
reasonable cation exchange capacity. A summary of the physical and
chemical properties of the different soils in the project area is in the
project file. All soils in the project area were formed from alluvial
sediments. Their characteristics largely depend upon their topography and
elevation. On the flat and low portions, which cover about 31,000 ha of
the project area, soils are derived from recent alluvium and have a fine
silty loam texture. Because of poor drainage and hydromorphic conditions,
the soils on about 10,000 ha have developed a gley horizon. With the
drains to be constructed under the project (para 3.12), which would permit
drying of paddy fields and lowering of the water table during the harvest



- 8 -
season, these soils would be ideally suited for paddy cultivation. A large
part of the project area had been previously cropped with paddy, and with
the necessary inputs, the soils should present no special problems.
2.04      At higher elevations, soils are derived from old alluvium.  Drain-
age conditions are better than those of the low-lying lands, but the soils are
susceptible to erosion. Their texture varies from sandy loam to silty loam.
On these soils, which represent about 20% of the project area, a wide range
of upland food crops, fruit trees and sugarcane can be grown under rainfed
conditions, but their yields would improve with full irrigation in the dry
season and supplementary irrigation at the beginning and towards the end of
the wet season.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.05      The population of Tay Ninh Province totals about 640,000 of whom
about 170,000 live in the project area. The population density averages
about 140/sq km. The people live in villages consisting of 1,000-1,200
families, of whom the majority are small farmers. The average family of five
to six persons contain the equivalent of about three adult workers.
2.06      Agricultural land in the project area is privately owned.  There
are presently about 21,000 farm units in Stage I of the project and about
15,000 units in Stage II, and the average farm size is approximately 2.0 ha.
Few farms are either larger or smaller than the mean.
Existing Infrastructure
2.07      The project area's thickly populated southern portion is served by
a relatively dense network of asphalt-paved roads. In the northern part,
around Tay Ninh, there are fewer roads, and most of these are surfaced with
gravel, crushed stone, or laterite. The roads are generally in fair condi-
tion, and only minor improvements would be required to make them suitable
for all-weather use. The last 15 km leading to the damsite are, however,
of lower quality than the other roads, and would require considerably more
repairs and improvement to facilitate the delivery of construction equipment,
materials and supplies. The Government is currently improving these roads,
and assurances were obtained that the access road to the damsite would be
completed and ready for all weather use by December 1978.
2.08      The project area is served by the port of Ho Chi Minh City, on the
lower Saigon River, about 120 km southeast of the proposed damsite. Equip-
ment and construction materials to be imported under the project would be
unloaded at this port. By air, the project area is served by the Tan Son
Nhut airport on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City. This airport is of inter-
national standard and in excellent condition.
2.09      Present irrigation development in the project area is limited.
Where available, local runoff is diverted to provide supplemental wet-season
irrigation for paddy. The available water supply is, however, generally
insufficient during the transplanting period and during the crop's ripening



- 9 -
stage. In the dry season, irrigation is confined to narrow strips along the
Saigon and Vam Co Dong rivers and along the navigation canals. A limited
area of groundnuts is irrigated from small tubewells and shallow, hand-dug
wells.
2.10      Downstream of the project area, west-northwest of Ho Chi Minh
City, the Government is currently constructing a pump irrigation system which
would eventually serve about 70,000 ha of riceland. The pumping stations
and main and secondary irrigation and drainage canals are partially com-
pleted: the remaining works are expected to be completed by 1980. The
system would draw its water supply from the lower Saigon River through two
existing diversion/navigation channels which flow through the northern part
of the service area. A battery of low-head pumps would lift the water into
the main canals; from there, the water would be conveyed by gravity to the
service area. The present dry-season water supply for the area is dependent
upon the unregulated flow of the upper Saigon River. Since part of this
flow is rendered unsuitable for irrigation by sea water intrusion during low
flow stages, there is enough supply for only about 10,000 ha. In the wet
season, water availability is dependent on rainfall on the Saigon River
catchment and, when it is delayed, paddy transplanting in the area is set
back by as much as two to three months. The projected construction of a
salinity control dam on the lower Saigon River in the near future would
enable this area to fully utilize the proposed project's excess water supply
(para. 3.16). After full development of Stages II and III of the proposed
project, the incremental water supply for the area would be obtained from the
Dong Nai River through a pumping station and diversion channel connecting it
to the Saigon River. The Dong Nai River flows would initially be unregulated,
but storage dams on the main stream and its tributaries are programmed for
the future.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The proposed project would include-
(a) construction of an earth dam and its appurtenant works on the
Saigon River, which would create a usable storage of about
1,000 MCM;
(b)  construction of a gravity irrigation system for about 42,000 ha
of currently rainfed land, including an adequate drainage network,
inspection and access roads and two low-lift pumping stations
to serve about 4,000 ha within the 42,000 ha service area-
(c) training of construction engineers and heavy equipment operators
and maintenance personnel; and
(d) procurement of vehicles, equipment and construction materials and
supplies.
3.02      The proposed project would involve the use of an international
waterway. The headwaters of the Saigon River, on which the dam would be
built, partly originate from approximately 20% of the catchment area that
lies within Cambodian territory. This portion of the catchment is drained
by 15 small streams, which merge and eventually join the main stream much
farther downstream, well within Vietnamese territory. Since the discharges
of these streams are small, and their potential service areas too hilly and
sparsely populated, it is highly unlikely that Cambodia would divert them for
irrigation. Nevertheless, should Cambodia decide to divert all these streams
in the future, the reduction in the project's water supply would be minimal
and would hardly affect the project's success (para. 3.14). For its part,
the Vietnamese Government has carried out sufficient studies and investiga-
tions to ensure that the reservoir created by the dam would not encroach on
or adversely affect any part of Cambodia (para. 3.07).
Prject Works
3.03      Dam and Appurtenant Works.  Clay, which is abundant in the vicinity
of the damsite, would constitute the major portion of the fill for the dam.
Alternative materials were investigated but subsequently ruled out because
of the high cost of processing and hauling them from quarries located about
16 km (rockfill) and 50 km (sand and gravel fill) away from the damsite.
The dam would have the following principal features-
Maximum height above stream bed          - 27 m
Crest length                             - 1.100 m
Crest width                              -    10 m
Upstream and downstream slopes           - 3.5 H-1.0 V



- 12 -
Upstream slope protection                - riprap
Downstream slope protection              - sodding with appropriate drains
Crest elevation                          - 27.0 m (plus 1.0 m parapet)
Maximum flood water surface elevation  - 25.9 m
Maximum water conservation level         - 24.4 m
Minimum water conservation level    - 17.0 m
Total fill volume                     - 4.4 million cu m
Reservoir area at maximum
conservation level                  - 26,000 ha.
Gross storage                         - 1,450 MCM
Usable storage                        - 1,050 MCM
3.04      A sand and gravel reverse filter would be interposed between the
riprap and impervious earthfill to preclude piping of fine particles
through the riprap. The filter would, however, be porous enough to permit
drainage of the saturated earthfill to take place. The dam would be
founded on sandstone overlain by a 6-10 m layer of clayey sand, which
gradually grades down to a finer layer of silty to sandy clay near the
contact with sandstone. Along the main channel, the river bed is made up
of about 0.5 m of mud underlain by 8-10 m of silty to clayey sand and sandy
clay just above the massive layer of sandstone. The physical and engineer-
ing properties of foundation materials were investigated by drilling and
water-testing 11 drill holes with a total length of 280 m, and by excavat-
ing 97 test pits having a total depth of about 1,000 m. The investigations
disclosed that the foundation is capable of safely supporting the dam.
Seepage beneath the dam would be minimized by providing a clay cut-off on
steel sheet piles driven to bedrock. The cut-off trench would have a base
width of 5.0 m and a depth of 5.0-6.0 m.
3.05      A dike 5-7 m high and about 22.0 km long would be constructed on
the right bank of the river to close the southwest rim of the reservoir.
The dike would be founded on sandy to silty clay underlain by sandstone at
a depth of 8.0-12.0 m beneath the ground surface. To minimize seepage
beneath the dike, a clay cut-off similar to that of the dam would be
provided throughout the dike's full length. The dike would require about
5.0 million cu m of earthfill, which would be hauled from quarries located
along and not more than 500 m away from the dike axis. The dike's upstream
face, which would slope at 2.0 H! 1.0 V, would be protected against wave
action by a layer of riprap. A sand and gravel reverse filter similar to
that of the dam would be provided between the riprap and impervious earth-
fill.
3.06      The reservoir created by the dam and dike would inundate some 500
farm families which have been settled within the last two years on a plateau
at the upper part of the reservoir, adjacent to the dike. Their homes would
be relocated under the supervision of the District and Village Revolutionary
Committees in the project area, with financial assistance to be provided by
the Government. The assistance would be similar to that provided for
settlers in Tay Ninh Province (mud-plastered straw hut on a 0.25 ha lot,



- 13 -
one-year subsistence, seed and fertilizer). The Government has resettled
more than 150,000 families in the vicinity of the project area in the last
two years and should have no difficulty in relocating the 500 families from
the reservoir.   Apart from the new land they would be given to cultivate in
the project area (1.0 ha/family), the relocated families would also be able
to plant an annual dry-season crop on their original farms as the reservoir
recedes.
3.07      To protect the dam and dike against overtopping, a chute spillway
would be constructed on a sidehill cut along the left bank. Its crest would
be equipped with twelve 8.0 m x 5.0 m radial gates. The concrete-lined
chute would terminate in a stilling basin located about 150 m downstream
of the crest. The structure, which would be entirely founded on sandstone,
is designed for a flood whose hydrograph has been synthesized by using the
unitgraph method following the analysis of peak rainfalls that could occur
over the catchment. This flood has a peak discharge of about 5,600 cu m/sec
and a total volume of about 820 MCM. When routed through the reservoir,
the design flood would cause the reservoir water level to rise 1.5 m
above the maximum conservation level, and the resulting maximum spillway
discharge would be about 2,500 cu m/sec. At the maximum flood water level
(El.25.9 m), no part of the reservoir would encroach on Cambodian territory.
The construction of the spillway would require the excavation of about
350,000 cu m of earth and 800,000 cu m of rock, and the placement of about
45,000 cu m of concrete.
3.08      A four-bay, gated sluiceway with a total width of 12.0 m would be
constructed adjacent to the intake of the gravity irrigation system. The
sill of the sluice would be 2.0 m lower than the invert of the intake to
minimize the accumulation of sediment in the vicinity of the intake. The
sluice would also be used to release water for the 70,000 ha temporary
service area (para. 2.10).
3.09      During the placement of fill across the main channel in the last
year (dry season) of dam construction, the river would be diverted through a
cut-and-cover conduit with two 4.0 m x 4.0 m barrels. The diversion conduit
is designed for a December peak discharge that has a 25-year return period.
This conduit would be plugged to effect closure prior to the commencement of
reservoir filling.
3.10      Gravity Irrigation System.  The principal features of the system
are as follows:
(a) a gravity intake and an 8.2 km diversion canal with a design
capacity of 100 cu m/sec, which would enable them to command
72,000 ha (42,000 ha in Stage I plus 30,000 ha in Stage II)
(b) a 43 km-long west main canal, which would be designed to convey
61 cu m/sec and command 42,000 ha, about 4,000 ha of which would be
served by two low-lift pumping stations that would draw water from
the canal-



- 14 -
(c) 13 large and 11 small secondary irrigation canals having a total
length of 122 km, which would branch off from the main canal at
1.0-6.0 km intervals; and
(d) about 2,430 km of tertiary and quaternary canals.
3.11      Control and protective canal structures for the main and second-
ary system would total about 36, of which 17 would be for the diversion
and main canals and 19 for the secondary canals. To complete the system,
about 8.5 million cu m of earthwork would be carried out, of which about
6.3 million cu m would be for excavation and fill and 2.2 million cu m for
excavation that has to be wasted. The structures would require about
110,000 cu m of concrete and 100,000 cu m of masonry. Tertiary and quater-
nary canals to be constructed under the project would deliver water down to
10-20 ha units. Below these, farmers would construct the farm ditches needed
to ensure timely water delivery to their fields with a minimal amount of
field-to-field irrigation, as has been customarily done in Viet Nam.
3.12      An extensive system of natural drainage channels exist in the proj-
ect area. However, their present capacities are inadequate, and they would
be enlarged and improved to minimize flooding of low portions of the project
area. In addition, about 430 km of new secondary and tertiary drains would
be excavated. The drains would be designed to convey the runoff produced by a
three-day storm of 5-year frequency without submerging the crops (paddy) for
more than 72 hours. The required drainage canal capacities based on the above
criteria are 3 1/sec/ha for paddy and 5 1/sec/ha for groundnuts. The
above paddy drain capacity would also permit the drying of paddy fields and
the lowering of the water table during the harvest season. About 4.6 million
cu m of excavation would be carried out to complete the drains, of which
about 2.5 million cu m would be for secondaries and 2.1 million cu m for
tertiaries.
3.13      Inspection and Access Roads.  Under the project, about 20 km of
new roads would be constructed to provide access to the dam, dike, spillway
and quarry areas. In addition, about 200 km of all-weather, inspection and
access roads would be constructed in the irrigation service area. Of the
above, 50 km would be along the diversion and west main canal, and the
remaining 150 km along the large secondary canals. Access roads to the
dam, dike and spillway would have a 6.5 m roadway, and would be surfaced
with 30 cm of crushed rock to enable them to withstand heavy equipment
traffic. The 6.5 m roadway of inspection and access roads along the diversion
and west main canal would be surfaced with 20 cm of gravel or crushed
rock. The 4.5 m roadway of inspection roads along large secondary canals
would be surfaced with 20 cm of laterite or crushed rock.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.14      Water requirements were calculated for the 72,000 ha ultimate
gravity service area. Water supply for the area would be derived from the
runoff of the Saigon River, whose catchment area at the damsite is about



- 15 -
2,700 sq km. There are 37 years of rainfall records over the catchment, but
only 4 years of discharge measurements have been made at the damsite. To
obtain a better estimate of the long-term discharges at the damsite, a
correlai-ion was made with the stream flows at the La Nga Basin (catchment
area = 2,100 sq. km), for which 15 years of concurrent rainfall and runoff
records are available. Data from these concurrent records were used to
establish the rainfall-runoff relationship in the La Nga Basin. Since soils,
topography and vegetative cover in the Dau Tieng catchment are similar to
those of the La Nga catchment, this rainfall-runoff relationship was applied
to the recorded rainfall at the Dau Tieng catchment to obtain 37 years of
stream flow records at the Dau Tieng damsite. The results show that the mean
annual runoff corresponding to a mean annual rainfall over the catchment of
about 2,120 mm would be 990 mm, or 2,700 MCM at the damsite. The annual
rainfall ir a critical year,/1 which is about 1,870 mm, would produce an
annual runoff of about 2,400 MCM at the damsite. In the unlikely event
that the 15 small tributaries of the Saigon River in Cambodian territory
(para. 3.02) are all diverted during the life of the project, the reduction
in annual flow at the damsite would be about 6%. This is based on the
assumption that the run-of-river schemes on these streams would physically
be able to divert 100% of the dry season flows (10% of their total annual
discharge) plus 20% of the rainy season flows. Construction of storage dams
on these tributaries for irrigation would be uneconomic because their dis-
charges are insignificant, storage sites are unsuitable and the potential
service areas are hilly and sparsely populated.
3.15      Water requirements of wet- and dry-season paddy, groundnuts and
sugarcane were based on the proposed cropping calendar (Figure 5.1) at full
development. For paddy, percolation was taken at 1.5 mm/day, puddling water
requirement at 200 mm and area of nursery beds at 5% of the paddy field
area. Flooding for weed control immediately after, and for the two week
period following transplanting, was estimated to be 60 mm. The Blaney-
Criddle formula was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration rates. To
obtain the consumptive use, these rates were multiplied by the appropriate
crop coefficients for the various stages of crop growth. The dependable
rainfall was taken as the rainfall over the service area that has an 80%
probability of occurrence (exceeded in 4 years out of 5), and effective
rainfall was assumed to be 80% of the dependable rainfall, with a maximum
value equal to the sum of consumptive use and percolation. Because of the
relatively efficient distribution and use of water in Viet Nam (para. 4.17),
the overall irrigation efficiency was taken as 70%. This allows for about 15%
field application losses, exclusive of percolation losses,/2 and about 20%
conveyance losses. If percolation and ineffective rainfall are treated as
losses, the overall water use efficiency would be about 64% in a critical
year and about 60% in an average year. Water requirements based on the above
criteria are presented in Table 3.2, while canal capacities based on these
requirements are given in Table 3.3.
/1 Exceeded in four years out of five.
/2 Percolation losses have been treated as part of the water requirements.



- 16 -
3.16      The water balance calculations (Table 3.4) show that the usable
storage would support two crops of paddy on 49,000 ha, one crop of sugarcane
on 7,000 ha, and three crops of groundnuts on 16,000 ha of the 72,000 ha
gravity service area./l In addition, excess water released from the reser-
voir to the lower Saigon River would irrigate some 20,000 ha in the 70,000 ha
perimeter below the project area. After the development of the sugarcane
component of the project under Stage III (para. 1.13), water releases to the
lower Saigon River would cease, and water in excess of that required for the
72,000 ha gravity service area would be used to irrigate about 55,000 ha of
sugarcane.
3.17      The upper Saigon River drains relatively virgin lands, and tests
made on water samples obtained from it indicate that water quality ranges
from good to excellent for sustained irrigation. There would be no physical
or chemical constraints to the combination of Saigon River water with project
soils.
Status of Engineering
3.18      The Ministry of Water Conservancy (MWC), the implementing agency
(para. 4.01), had been planning and investigating the proposed project for
the last two years. Project engineering has reached an advanced stage and,
to date, conceptual and detailed designs equivalent to those needed for the
preparation of tender documents have been completed. The work done includes-
(a) ground survey and mapping of dam, dike and quarry sites at 1-2,000
scale with 1.0 m contour interval, and of the reservoir site at
1:25,000 scale with 2.0 m contour interval;
(b) foundation investigations of dam, dike and spillway sites; investi-
gation of alternative sources of fill material for the dam and
dike: laboratory testing of physical and engineering properties of
materials for earthfill, riprap and concrete aggregatez conceptual
design of the dam, spillway, diversion conduit, sluice and gravity
irrigation intake; detailed design of dike; and
(c) longitudinal profile and cross-section survey of main irrigation
canals; mapping of a 3,800 ha sample area at 1:10,000 scale with
0.5 m contour interval; and compilation of existing photogrammetric
maps of the entire service area at 1:25,000 scale with 1.0 m
contour interval;
(d) conceptual design of main irrigation canals and typical secondary
canals, and detailed design of tertiary and quaternary canals and
structures for the 3,800 ha sample area.
/1 Actual supply for the 42,000 ha Stage I area would be for two crops of
paddy on 31,000 ha and three crops of groundnuts on the remaining
11,000 ha.



- 17 -
3.19      MWC is continuing with the detailed design and preparation of
construction drawings for the various project works, and by December 31,
197P, shortly before the start of construction, MWC expects to complete the
following:
(a) hydraulic model test of the spillway in MWC's Hydraulic Research
Institute, detailed design and preparation of construction
drawings for the dam, spillway, sluice and diversion conduit;
(b) ground survey and mapping for an additional 20,000 ha in the
service area at 1:10,000 scale with 0.5 m contour interval; and
(c) detailed design and preparation of construction drawings for the
3iversion canal, 15 km of the west main canal, and of the second-
ary, tertiary, and quaternary canals and structures for about
10,000 ha.
3.20       In the succeeding years, MWC would complete the detailed design
and construction drawings for the remaining main, secondary and tertiary
canals and structures approximately one year in advance of their actual
implementation.
Implementation Schedule
3.21       The project would be implemented over a five-year period from
early 1979 through December 1983. Preparation of bid documents for all
heavy construction equipment to be purchased under the project (para. 3.27)
has been completed and opening of bids for the procurement of the equipment
is scheduled to take place in October 1978. This would make possible the
delivery of some equipment at the beginning of 1979 for the in-service
training of MWC's operators and maintenance personnel. Work on the storage
facility (dam, dike and spillway) and the irrigation system would commence
in early 1979 after the training of MWC personnel in the operation and main-
tenance of equipment procured under the project. MWC has recently started
preconstruction activities using its labor force and whatever equipment it
has on hand. These activities, which would continue throughout 1978 until
the arrival of construction equipment, include: clearing of the reservoir,
dam, dike and spillway sites; clearing along the route of the main and
secondary canals; and construction of offices and quarters for MWC personnel
and temporary housing for laborers. The construction of the dam and its
appurtenances has been spaced over a four-year period; the irrigation system,
over five years. The implementation schedule is presented in Figure 3.1.
Assurances were obtained that MWC would prepare a project completion report
shortly after the completion of project works.
Cost Estimates
3.22       The total project cost is estimated at US$110 million, of which
TJS$90 million (82%) is the foreign exchange requirement. Because of the tax
exempt status of the implementing agency, the above costs do not include
provision for local, provincial or national taxes. The unusually high



- 18 -
percentage of foreign exchange is largely due to the projected importation of
virtually all equipment, materials and supplies, combined with the low local
currency requirement of the project because of the low wage rates in Viet
Nam, the minimal land acquisition costs for reservoir and canal rights-of-way
and the low overhead of MWC agencies that would implement the project. Had
this project been located elsewhere in the East Asia region, incremental
local costs equivalent to US$5 million for taxes, US$23 million for contrac-
tor's overhead and profit, US$17 million for land acquisition and resettle-
ment and US$5 million for engineering and administration would very likely
have raised total project costs to US$160 million, resulting in a foreign
exchange component of about 56%, which is normal for this type of project in
the region.
3.23      MWC estimated the construction costs of major works (dam, dike,
spillway and main irrigation canals) on the basis of quantities obtained from
preliminary design drawings and unit prices calculated for similar types of
work. Quantities of earthwork and structures for secondary canals were esti-
mated from profiles and cross-sections obtained from 1-25,000 scale maps (1.0 m
contour interval), on which the canals were layed out. Similar quantities
for tertiary irrigation and drainage canals were extrapolated from a sample
area of about 3,800 ha (9% of total area), for which ground surveys and
detailed designs have been made. The estimated quantities were compared on a
per ha basis with some completed systems in Viet Nam and were found to be
reasonable. Construction costs for these works were determined by applying
the appropriate unit prices to the estimated quantities. After the list of
equipment and imported materials to be procured under the project was final-
ized, unit prices were recalculated for the different work items and applied
to the estimated quantities. These unit prices (Annex 1, Table 7) take into
account the prevailing wage rates in Viet Nam, the production capacities of
equipment fleets utilized for specific work items, and the cost of fuel,
lubricants, spare parts, tires and construction materials. Depreciation of
equipment is excluded from the adjusted unit prices because their acquisition
cost has been treated as a separate item in the cost estimate. Engineering
and administration costs and the construction overhead and profit of MWC's
Hydraulic Works Company (para. 4.03) each amount to about 4% of the cost of
civil works. In view of the relatively high salvage value of construction
equipment (US$11 million),/1 whose full cost has been charged to the project,
an allowance in the cost estimate for phvsical contingencies of about 15%
for civil works and about 5% for equipment has been deemed appropriate..
Costs due to expected price increases over the five-year implementation
period amount to about 10% of base cost plus physical contingencies and
assume the following rates of inflation for foreign costs:/2
/1  Upon completion of the project, this equipment will be transferred to
MWC's other irrigation projects.
/2  Local costs, mainly for salaries and wages, are not expected to increase
during project execution.

Financing
3.25      External financing for the full foreign exchange requirements of
the project (US$90 million) would be provided through the proposed IDA credit
of US$60 million and loans from the Netherlands (US$10 million), Kuwait Fund
(US$10 million) and OPEC Special Fund (US$10 million). Lending terms for
all three loans are presently being discussed between the Government of Viet
Nam and the respective donors. The Dutch loan would be parallel to the IDA
credit and would finance the purchase of 8 front-end loaders, 60 dump trucks,
ten 300 kW diesel generating sets, telecommunication equipment and associated
spare parts (Annex 1, Table 6). The Kuwait Fund and OPEC Special Fund loans
would be on the basis of joint financing with IDA and would finance the pur-
chase of materials and supplies. Local expenditures amounting to D 50 million
(US$20 million) would be met through annual Government budgetary allocations
to MWC.
Procurement /1
3.26      All equipment, materials and supplies to be financed by the credit
and to be imported under the project would be procured following international
competitive bidding and prudent shopping (para. 3.28). In line with the
/1 All costs in this section of the report include contingencies.



- 20 -
Government's normal practice, all civil works for the dam and irrigation
system would be constructed by force account by one of MWC's ten hydraulic
companies (para. 4.04), using equipment and materials to be supplied to it by
the Government. This procedure would not only enable the disbursement of a
substantial part of the credit for contracts awarded following international
competitive bidding; it would also permit project works to be built with the
least possible delay, at a cost about 30-40% lower than that possible were
these works to be constructed by foreign contractors.
3.27      Before handing over to the Hydraulic Works Company the equipment
and materials to be purchased under the project, MWC's Construction Department
would enter into an agreement with the Company on appropriate unit prices for
the different work items which would form the basis for payments to the
Company. Since all the equipment, materials and supplies would be furnished
by the Ministry, the unit prices would be based on quantity estimates,
production capacity of the equipment fleet, wage rates for equipment operators
and laborers, the Hydraulic Works Company's overhead and an allowance for
profit. MWC's Planning, Technical, and Finance Departments would have final
approval of the unit prices. Gates for the spillway, sluice and irrigation
structures would be fabricated by MWC's mechanical workshops using materials
to be procured under the project (para. 4.03).   Erection and installation
would be done by the Hydraulic Works Company.
3.28      The Ministry of Foreign Trade's Technoimport Department is respon-
sible for procuring all of Viet Nam's needs for imported goods and materials.
Contracts for the supply of these goods and materials are usually awarded
after obtaining price quotations from suppliers in countries with whom Viet
Nam has trade relations. In some instances where a specific brand is
required, the Technoimport Department negotiates directly with the supplier
of that brand. For the importation of about US$60 million worth of equipment,
materials and supplies to be financed by IDA, Kuwait Fund and OPEC Special
Fund, the Government has agreed to adopt international competitive bidding
procedures in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Equipment to be financed
by the Dutch loan would follow the Dutch procurement procedures under which
bids are open to suppliers from Holland and developing countries. Tender
documents for the supply of construction and O&M equipment (US$27 million)
have been prepared, and bid opening for these items is scheduled for October
1978. A large number of small items costing less than US$10,000 each and
limited to a total of US$3.0 million, for which bidding documents would prove
too cumbersome to prepare, would be purchased through prudent shopping in the
international market. Contracts for the purchase of fuel (US$15 million),
cement (US$3.6 million), materials for gates and hoists (US$3.3 million),
sheet piles (US$0.7 million) spare parts (US$13 million), tires (US$7.6
million), lubricants (US$1.7 million), and reinforcing steel (US$4.7 million)
would be spread over the implementation period to keep their supply in line
with requirements. To the extent feasible, even spare parts would be pur-
chased following prudent shopping procedures. These items would be delivered
directly to the site or to MWC's warehouses. Assurances were obtained that
MWC would provide adequate facilities for the storage and protection of
equipment, materials and supplies procured under the project.

Disbursements
3.29      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against the
foreign exchange cost of expatriate services, training and directly imported
vehicles and equipment. For materials and supplies, disbursements under the
IDA credit would be at the rate of 50% of the foreign exchange, with the
balance being financed at the rate of 25% each by the Kuwait and OPEC Funds.
Disbursements for materials and supplies would be made only after the Kuwait
Fund Loan Agreement has become effective. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by December 1984, about one year after the scheduled completion of
all project works. Estimated schedule of expenditures, disbursements and the
proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit are presented in Annex 1,
Tables 3-5.
Accounts and Audits
3.30      Accounts of the Hydraulic Works Company are audited quarterly by
auditors from MWC's Finance Department. MWC's own accounts are in turn
audited quarterly by the Auditing Department of the Ministry of Finance. The
auditing procedures are rigid and completely satisfactory. Assurances were
obtained that MWC would: maintain separate accounts for the project;
appoint auditors in accordance with Government regulations to audit these
accounts; and send the audited accounts to IDA, together with the auditor's
comments, within six months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.31      MWC's experience in various parts of Viet Nam has demonstrated that
the development of irrigation and drainage systems would have no adverse
effects on the environment. This is expected to hold true in the project
area. Physical damage to the environment due to the construction activity
would be minimal and short-lived. The dam would be dressed after construc-
tion to blend with the surrounding vegetation, as has been customarily done
in Viet Nam. Drainage improvements in the area would reduce the amount
of stagnant water and thus reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases.
Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are already widely used in Viet Nam in
irrigated, as well as rainfed areas, and no hazards are anticipated if care
is exercised in their use.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization
4.01      The Ministry of Water Conservancy (MWC), which is responsible for
the rehabilitation and development of new irrigation and drainage schemes in
Viet Nam, would implement the project. Prior to Viet Nam's declaration of
independence in 1945, irrigation and drainage development used to be the
responsibility of the Irrigation and Drainage Division of the French Public
Works Service, which covered all of Indochina. After independence, this
function became the responsibility of the Irrigation and Drainage Department
under the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam's Ministry of Public Works and
Communications. When this ministry was divided into two ministries in 1955,
the Irrigation and Drainage Department was placed under the Ministry of
Architecture and Hydraulics. In 1958 MWC was created to cope with the
increased emphasis on irrigation development. It was organized along
functional lines into departments, bureaus, sections and working groups,
which were centralized in Hanoi. Local offices in the provincial capitals
reported to the Minister through the respective Department Directors and
Vice Ministers. As the need for special services arose, MWC was expanded to
include 16 departments. Following the reunification of Viet Nam, MWC was
further expanded to enable it to cover the entire country. The present
organization (Figure 4.1) is not only capable of coping with the usual
functions associated with administration, long-range planning, investigation,
detailed design, and construction supervision of specific projects; it is
also geared to train and turn out engineering graduates; fabricate gates,
pumps and some spare parts; repair and rebuild equipment; and construct
medium and large irrigation projects with hardly any outside assistance.
Since its creation in 1958, MWC has designed and constructed medium-sized
and large irrigation and drainage schemes serving more than 500,000 ha.
After the war, it has done a creditable job of rehabilitating damaged
irrigation and drainage systems and of starting the construction of new
medium-sized schemes with its available resources and equipment. Its
offices in Hanoi are currently staffed by more than 1,000 engineers, and
each of its 36 local offices is manned by 30-100 engineers. Included in
this present staff are some engineers who have had post-graduate training in
socialist as well as western countries, and a large number of engineers who
have had 10-20 years' experience in the design and construction of irrigation
and drainage works. This capability is reflected in the technical standards
to which project works have been designed, and in the quality of similar
works constructed elsewhere by MWC's hydraulic works companies. The staff
of MWC should thus have no difficulty in implementing the proposed project.
New positions in MWC's offices and vacancies created by retirees (age 55)
are filled by engineers graduating from its Hydraulic Technical Institute.
This institute graduates about 500 engineers annually.
4.02      Overall responsibility for the project would rest with the Project
Manager, a senior official in the MWC reporting directly to the Ministry's
Vice Minister in charge of the Design and Construction Departments. Aside
from providing overall guidance and supervision the Project Manager would
coordinate the activities of the Design and Construction Directors. Assur-
ances were obtained that a suitably qualified and experienced Project Manager



- 26 -
would be appointed not later than March 1, 1979 and that the Government would
promptly inform the Association of any appointment made to the position of
Project Manager.
Project Implementation
4.03      Responsibility for all design aspects of the project would rest
with MWC's Design Department, which established a Special Project Office in
Ho Chi Minh City to prepare the project for appraisal. This office is headed
by one of the Design Department's Deputy Directors from Hanoi, who has been
designated as concurrent Project Director-Design. The Design Department has
also appointed a Deputy Project Director for the dam and a second Deputy
Project Director for the irrigation service area. The staff of the Special
Project Office would be augmented, as required, to enable timely execution of
the project. The project organization chart is shown in Figure 4.2 and that
of the Hydraulic Works Company, in Figure 4.3.
4.04      MWC's Design Department, through the Special Project Office in Ho
Chi Minh City, would do the detailed design and prepare construction drawings
for all civil works. MWC's Hydraulic Mechanical Workshops Department would
design and fabricate all gates for the spillway, sluice and irrigation
structures. These workshops are efficient, well equipped and have consider-
able experience in fabricating similar gates. One of MWC's ten hydraulic
works companies (Hydraulic Works Company No. 9) would undertake all civil
works construction and gate installation. This Company has had extensive
experience in the construction of dams, levees and irrigation systems in
the north prior to its reassignment in the south in 1976. To cope with the
construction of a large part of MWC's projects in the south, however, it
has progressively augmented its staff by employing experienced equipment
operators and maintenance personnel. It currently has 30 engineers and
about 1,500 technicians and skilled and common laborers in its permanent
staff, and it has been authorized to increase its personnel by 1,800 at the
start of project execution. There are sufficient skilled and semiskilled
laborers in the south to fill this additional requirement. With this
complement of engineers, technicians and skilled laborers, the Hydraulic
Works Company should have no difficulty in constructing the project works.
A Construction Committee under the Project Director-Construction has been set
up by MWC's Construction Department to assume responsibility for keeping
project accounts and certifying payments to the Hydraulic Works Company. In
addition MWC would assign field staff to the Committee, which would have the
responsibility of supervising the work of the Hydraulic Works Company and of
controlling construction quality. To ensure coordination between the design
and construction aspects of the project, design staff from the Special
Project Office would be assigned to the Construction Committee. MWC's
Equipment Department, in consultation with the Hydraulic Works Company,
would determine the project's equipment needs and arrange for their procure-
ment by the Ministry of Foreign Trade's Technoimport Department (para. 3.28).
MWC's Finance and Planning Departments would have the responsibility of
ensuring that project needs (funds, manpower, materials and supplies) are
met. Payments to the Hydraulic Works Company would be channelled through



- 27 -
the State Bank. Assurances were obtained that all Government agencies
engaged in project implementation would be staffed at all times with suitably
qualified and experienced personnel in adequate numbers.
Dam Review Panel
4.05      A- in-depth review of MWC's design and construction scheme for the
iam, dike a-d spillway was carried out by the project preparation mission in
:;eptember 1977 and by the appraisal mission in January 1978, which included
engineers with extensive experience in the design and construction of
similar structures. This review disclosed that: MWC's choice of con-
struction materials is structurally and economically justified; its design
of the dam, dike and spillway is adequate and would result in sound and
stable structures  and its choice of construction equipment to be procured
under the project is appropriate and sufficient to complete the project
within the five-year implementation period. However, to assist MWC in
controlling construction quality and in ensuring the safety of the dam,
assurances were obtained that by December 1978, the Government would appoint
a panel of experts consisting of a geologist, a hydraulic engineer and a dam
design and construction engineer whose qualifications and terms of employment
would be acceptable to IDA and whose responsibilty would be to: (a) review
construction quality and progress at least twice a year: (b) be available for
consultation throughout the construction period on any construction problems
or changes in design or construction schemes prior to their implementation-
(c) provide advice on the preparation of the spillway operation manual! and
(d) recommend a suitable maintenance and safety inspection program to be
carried out after completion of the dam.
Training
4.06      MWJC's present staff already includes some engineers with extensive
experience in planning. designing and constructing irrigation and drainage
structures for medium-sized and large irrigation systems. While the present
numbers would be sufficient to carry out the project, they may be hard-pressed
to cope with the workload that is expected to arise from the projected
accelerated development in the irrigation sector. To upgrade the capability
of MWC staff, local in-service training programs would be set up with the
assistance of expatriates to be engaged under the project for periods ranging
from one to three months.   Training for planning and design engineers would
include familiarization with the latest trends in river basin development,
including the use of computers and programmable calculators to facilitate the
solution of tedious and repetitive engineering problems. Training for
construction personnel would cover the indexing of spare parts and equipment
operation (operating hours, fuel and lube oil consumption, spare parts and
tires used, repair hours and other down-time): operation, maintenance and
repair of equipment; and efficient deployment and utilization of the various
equipment fleets procured under the project to obtain optimal production.
Training programs for the Hydraulic Works Company's 450 operators and mainte-
nance personnel on the use of some 300 pieces of major construction equipment
to be procured under the project would be administered at the construction
site by experienced field men of the equipment manufacturers. Provisions for



- 28 -
such training have been included in the equipment tender documents. On-the-
job training for a second batch of about 400 operators and maintenance
personnel that are currently employed as common laborers would be given by
the best qualified MWC personnel. Similar training would be instituted for
a third batch of some 500 operators and maintenance personnel that the
Hydraulic Works Company is authorized to employ once construction of the
project commences. The above training for MWC personnel would require about
50 man-months of expatriate services for training supervisors for construction
personnel. In addition, the credit also includes funds for overseas training
of MWC staff. Assurances were obtained that the MWC would submit to IDA by
December 31, 1979 for its review and comments details of the proposed over-
seas training program. Assurances were also obtained that training advisors
for construction personnel would be engaged within three months after the
delivery of the first batch of construction equipment.
Right-of-Way
4.07      The dam, dike and spillway, as well as the reservoir, would take
up land that is largely unoccupied, but the irrigation and drainage canals
would traverse some land owned by farmers and cooperatives that are being
set up in the project area (para. 4.13). Assurances were obtained that
whenever necessary the Government would acquire rights-of-way for project
works at least three months before the start of construction on any part of
the works.
Safety of Dam
4.08      The proposed dam would have a maximum height of 27 m above the
stream bed, would create a reservoir with a gross storage volume of 1,450 MCM
and would be so situated that it could be destructive in the unlikely event
of failure. To preclude progressive deterioration that could lead to such
failure, assurances were obtained that the Government would: (a) make the
necessary arrangements to implement the maintenance and inspection pro-
gram recommended by the panel of experts (para. 4.05), following completion
of the dam; and (b) submit to IDA for its review not later than December 31,
1981 the proposal for carrying out the program, together with the timetable
for its implementation.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.09      Most of the project area is located in a zone where intensive
military operations took place during the war. The former regime's Ministry
of Agriculture was, therefore, unable to provide agricultural supporting
services in the area, and the farmers have been left without any form of
technical assistance for many years. With the return of peace and the
reunification of the country, the Government has started to address these
needs, but the provision of extension services, credit and supply of inputs,
such as seeds, fertilizers and agrochemicals still remain inadequate. Not-
withstanding these constraints, farmers in the project area have been able
to resume reasonable production in a relatively short time. An expanded
program of agricultural supporting services would have to be set up in the
area during the construction period to enable the farmers to realize the



- 29 -
full benefits of improved irrigation and drainage. The rroposed project has
high priority in the Government's five-year plan, and it intends to provide
adequate levels of agricultural inputs, services and credit in the project
area at full development. Assurances were obtained that: (a) not later than
December 31, 1979, it would prepare and submit to IDA for its review a
detailed and comprehensive program for agricultural services in the project
area (research and extension services, credit facilities, seeds, fertilizers,
agricultural chemicals, machinery maintenance and repair stations, training
of cooperative managers, and transport, processing and storage of agricul-
tural products), alonR with a timetable for implementing the program; and
(b) it would thereafter implement the said program and inform the Association
of the progress of its implementation. A brief description of present
agricultural supporting services in the area is presented below.
4.10      Research and Extension.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is
responsible for research and extension. At present there are no agricul-
tural research or extension centers in the project area or in the adjacent
provinces. For rice and food crops the only research facilities in the
south are at Can Tho and An Giang (Mekong Delta) and at Eak Mak (highlands).
However, the program of activities at these stations was interrupted for
some years and has resumed only recently. The United Nations Development
Program has recently proposed to the Government a technical assistance
package for strengthening the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences to
enable it to assume the central role of coordinating and supervising the
country's agricultural research programs. The experiment station at Can Tho
would serve as the main regional research center for rice and food crops. It
would also be responsible for the production and supply of foundation seeds
to the seed multiplication centers to be established in the project area
(para. 4.12).
4.11      MOA has carried out a survey to estimate the material and technical
requirements of the districts in the project area that would enable them to
reach the proposed production targets. A redeployment of technical staff
throughout the country is under way. In Tay Ninh Province, 20-30 extension
workers (professional level) currently provide advice to farmers on agricul-
ture, livestock, mechanization, irrigation and input distribution. Agrono-
mists are conducting field trials to establish the management practices that
should be adopted by farmers. The total number of workers, including
technicians (diploma level) is 300. In the project area an average of five
agricultural officers (agronomists and extension agents) have already been
seconded to each district, and five to seven additional staff are expected
to be appointed next year. It is estimated that by December 1978 the number
of agricultural officers in each district would be increased to 10-12 (one
per 1,000 farm families). To meet the additional manpower requirements, the
Government plans to set up a post high school agricultural training center in
the province by 1980. The school would offer a two-year diploma course that
would emphasize paddy and sugarcane production.
4.12      Fertilizer.  Currently Viet Nam imports about 500,000 tons of fer-
tilizer (mainly nitrogenous). This is supplemented by about 250,000 tons of
locally produced nitrogenous fertilizer. To reduce the reliance on imports,
the Government plans to set up additional nitrogenous fertilizer plants in



- 30 -
the near future. It also intends to increase the output of phosphate, which
is currently being mined in the north. At present about 4.000 tons of chem-
ical fertilizers are used in the project area. In addition, farmers apply
cattle manure to nurseries. At full development annual consumption of fer-
tilizer would rise to about 20,000 tons, comprising 12,000 tons of urea and
8,000 tons of TSP. Farmers in the project area would also require 7,000 tons
of lime and some 940 tons of agrochemicals. Currently, farmers pay cash
for inputs bought from private dealers but in future they would be able to
obtain fertilizers from the cooperatives through the District Revolutionary
Committee. The Government would meet the incremental fertilizer requirements
in the project area at full development.
4.13      Seed.  There is no seed multiplication center in the project area
or in the adjacent provinces. In the south, seed multiplication facilities
are at Can Tho, but they have to be improved and strengthened. The center at
Can Tho would be responsible for the multiplication of foundation seeds. MOA
would establish seed multiplication centers in the project area, and it would
ensure the quality and purity of seeds produced. In addition, selected seed
growers in the villages would produce certified seeds for sale to farmers.
Assuming that seeds would be changed once in four years, the annual seed
requirement in the project area at full development would be about 310 tons
for paddy and 400 tons for groundnuts.
4.14      Cooperatives.  Cooperatives are the predominant organizational unit
in the rural sector in the north. By the end of the 1960s, virtually the
entire sector had been organized into about 8,000 high-rank cooperatives
averaging about 150 ha each. The process of cooperative development includes
three phases: a loose form of cooperation by work-exchange or mutual-aid
teams: the establishment of low-rank cooperatives in which part of the
member's compensation is related to the amount of land he contributed; and
the advancement from low-rank to high-rank, where land payment is eliminated
and each member is paid solely according to the work he contributes. Manage-
ment is the responsibility of an administrative committee elected from the
cooperative members each year. In its annual plan the Government, usually at
the provincial or district level, establishes the cooperative's target level
of output for its major products and the amount to be sold to the state at
fixed prices. State agencies also sign contracts with the cooperative to
supply agricultural inputs and to provide credit for the coming year. Within
these broad limits, production, consumption and investment decisions are the
responsibilities of the cooperative management.
4.15      Although the bulk of the agricultural sector in the south still
consists of individual farmers working small plots, the Government is
continuing to expand the socialist sector. The first step toward collecti-
vization is being taken by organizing mutual-aid work teams of private
farmers to rehabilitate and improve irrigation and other infrastructure, and
by joint ownership and use of mechanical equipment. A pilot scheme is
planned for Chau Thanh District in 1978 to determine the optimum size of
cooperatives to be set up in the project area, to define the most efficient
organization and management and to test farmers' response to them. Ultimately,
it is planned that technical advice from MOA and inputs would be channeled
to farmers through the cooperatives.



- 31 -
4.16      Credit.  The Agricultural Development Bank, one of the five spe-
cialized institutions in the State Bank, provides short- and long-term credit
to enterprises and cooperatives (also to private farmers in the south). The
Bank has branches and offices in every province and district. There are six
offices (one Per district) in Tay Ninh Province, with a total staff of about
l'O (approximately 20 per distri't). Each office normally has a manager, two
deputy managers, eight agricultural credit officers, four accountants and
five clerks. Short-term credit isi mainly for seeds, fertilizers and agrochem-
icals. The interest rate is 0.36%/month. To be eligible for short-term
credit a farmer or production cooperative must have an approved agricultural
development plan for the utilization of the funds. In 1977, the short-term
credit amounted to about D 1.25 million (US$0.5 million) for Tay Ninh Province.
The repayment rate is estimated at about 97%. Long-term credit is available
for irrigation, soil improvement, buildings, and the purchase of farm equip-
ment and draft animals. The interest rate is 0.21%/ month, and the repayment
period is three years for draft animals and ten years or more for plantation
crops. The Agricultural Development Bank provides long-term credit on the
basis of its assessment of the technical feasibility and economic viability
of the proposed agricultural development plan. Total long-term credit for
Tay Ninh Province in 1977 amounted to about D 12.5 million (US$5.0 million).
Although the nominal interest rates on agricultural credit appear low,
they also represent real interest rates in Viet Nam because prices are
determined by the Government and inflation is strictly controlled. They
therefore correspond to nominal interest rates of 12-14% per annum in coun-
tries with 10% annual inflation. Furthermore, interest rates are only one of
a set of administered prices for allocating resources between different
goods, time periods and even income classes (para. 1.06). There is no
evidence that this system leads to inefficient resource allocation.
Operation and Maintenance (-&M)
4.17      Upon completion of project works, responsibility for operating
and maintaining them would be turned over to MWC's Irrigation and Drainage
Department, which would assign responsibility for the project to one of the
O&M companies from its local hydraulic office in Tay Ninh. For a period of
one year after construction, however, the Construction Committee (para. 4.03)
would monitor the project's performance to ensure that all works are func-
tioning properly. Corrective measures to remedy the substandard performance
of structures, if any, would be instituted during this period before the
project is completely handed over to the O&M company.
4.18      MWC's Irrigation and Drainage Department would assess water
charges from the project beneficiaries; the Agricultural Development Bank
would collect them. Current levels of water charges on irrigated land in
the north range from D 80-100 (US$32-40)/ha. Of this amount, the Govern-
ment allocates D 18-30 (US$7.20-12.00)/ha for O&M. A breakdown of the
various items for which these funds are used is given in Annex 4. Although
these levels of expenditure for O&M may appear low, irrigation systems
visited by the mission were found to be reasonably well maintained, and
water was distributed equitably and efficiently. The efficient utilization
of water is largely due to the extensive use of return flows in the drains.
Water from the drains is usually relifted to the paddy fields by means of



- 32 -
pumps and manually operated wicker baskets. The low cost of maintenance can
be attributed to the high element of volunteer labor in the daily wages paid
for weeding and desilting canals. In addition, the army and the students
put in some time for the maintenance of irrigation systems as part of the
volunteer labor they normally render for the country's rehabilitation and
development.
4.19      Assurances were obtained that the Government would collect water
charges from all beneficiaries of the irrigation system constructed under the
project, at levels consistent with the capability of beneficiaries to pay
said charges, to cover the cost of sound O&M services necessary to provide
irrigation and drainage for the area served, and to recover over the useful
life of the irrigation system a reasonable portion of its capital cost.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
5.01      The effects of the project on agricultural production and land use
were examined for 42,000 ha on which irrigation and drainage works would be
carried out. The projected changes in land use in the area are summarized
in Table 5.1.
Table 5.1: PRESENT AND PROJECTED LAND USE
Present    With project
--- (ha) ---
Paddy                                 34,000        62,000
Groundnut                             23,000        33,000
Total                               57,000        95,000
Present Cropping Patterns
5.02      In the wet season, 31,000 ha of paddy and 11,000 ha of groundnuts
are currently grown under rainfed conditions in the project area. Some
3,000 ha of irrigated paddy and 12,000 ha of groundnuts are raised in the dry
season. Groundnuts grown in the dry season depend mainly on residual soil
moisture from the preceding crop and, to a limited extent, on irrigation by
pumping from shallow, hand-dug wells.
5.03      Paddy fields are leveled and bunded to store rainfall and runoff.
Fifty percent of land preparation is done by standard four-wheel tractors and
hand tractors and the rest by buffaloes or oxen pulling traditional plows and
harrows. Seedlings are raised in nurseries and transplanted on previously



- 33 -
puddled fields in June; harvesting starts around October. When the monsoon
is late, transplanting and harvesting may be delayed by two or three months.
High yielding rice varieties (IR 22, IR 24 and IR 28) are planted on about
30% of the area; in the area subjected to flooding, taller traditional
varieties are grown.
5.04      Fertilizers and pesticides are used on nearly all crops.  Cattle
manure is usually applied on nurseries. Paddy fields are generally well
maintained and average yield is estimated to be 2.3 ton/ha. Some sugarcane
is grown in early May with the onset of the wet season; it is harvested in
February/ March as a ten-month crop. Ratoons (two in general) are harvested
after about 12 months of growth. Due to lack of high-yielding varieties,
shortage of fertilizer, poor drainage, and severity of the dry season, cane
yields are generally low and average about 40 ton/ha.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.05      Without the project, changes in cropping patterns would be insig-
nificant. The area planted to HYVs as well as the wet- and dry-season irri-
gated areas would remain unchanged. The availability of irrigation and the
prevention of early floods would minimize risks to the wet-season crops.
Paddy would be grown on 31,000 ha, and two crops of groundnuts would be
raised on 11,000 ha at 20-30 day intervals between crops. With an assured
dry-season water supply, 100% of the wet-season paddy area would be replanted
with paddy in the dry season, and a third crop of groundnut would be grown on
the remaining 11,000 ha. The area under HYVs is expected to increase.
Farmers would find it reasonably safe to invest in optimal agricultural
inputs (improved seeds, fertilizer and pesticides). Land preparation would
be done partly by tractors and partly by buffaloes. Tractor stations are in
the process of being established in each district. Because of the improve-
ment and extension of irrigation and drainage facilities, farmers would have
better control of crop calendars and the annual overall cropping intensity
would increase to 226%.
Yields and Production
5.06      The absence of an assured water supply, flooding and the inadequate
level of agricultural supporting services are the main causes of the current
low paddy yields in the project area. Without the project, slightly better
farming practices as a result of the rehabilitation and improvement of agri-
cultural supporting facilities may increase wet season paddy yields from
2.3 to 2.5 ton/ha, irrigated paddy yields from 2.5 to 2.7 ton/ha and ground-
nut yields from 1.0 to 1.2 ton/ha. However, in the absence of assured
irrigation, which the Government considers as a prerequisite to the provision
of optimal levels of inputs and agricultural supporting services, farmers
would be unable to increase crop yields further. Improvements in water
supply, control and distribution as a result of the project, coupled with
adequate supplies of inputs, credit and a strengthened research and extension
program in the area would raise yields of both rice and other crops. The
projected yields would be 3.8 ton/ha for wet-season paddy, 4.2 ton/ha for



- 34 -
dry-season paddy and 2.0 ton/ha for groundnuts. Beginning with the first
crop under improved conditions, farmers are expected to achieve the projected
yields in five years. Paddy and groundnut yields of the above magnitude have
been achieved in many parts of Viet Nam after comparable development periods.
5.07      As a result of the project, paddy production in the project area
would increase from 79,000 to 248,000 tons, and groundnut production from
23,000 to 66,000 tons. Present and future cropping patterns, crop yields and
production are shown in Table 5.2.
Cropping Calendar
5.08      The proposed cropping calendar for the project area is shown in
Figure 5.1. Wet-season paddy would be grown from July to December, and land
preparation (plowing and puddling) would be carried out in July/August.
Seedlings raised in nurseries would be sown in July and transplanted in
August/September, while hand harvesting would be done in December/January.
Some farmers would grow two crops of groundnut and/or other subsdiary
crops from May to August (first crop) and September to November (second
crop). Dry-season paddy would be grown from December to May and groundnut
from January to April.
Drying, Processing and Storage
5.09      The Ministry of Food is responsible for the storage and transport
of paddy from collection centers to rice mills.   It also has the responsi-
bility of processing paddy and delivering rice to Government shops. Farmers
in the project area sun-dry their paddy on the roadside and house yards and
store it in their houses. With the advent of full double cropping, concrete
drying floors with adjacent covered storage would be needed to supplement
existing facilities. Storage at the farm level is adequate since farmers
usually retain just enough paddy for home consumption. The balance of the
crop is sold to the Ministry of Food, which would have to construct addi-
tional storage sheds in the project area to handle the marketed surplus.
Numerous small, privately-owned village rice mills, whose operation is
controlled by local authorities, are currently underutilized and are operat-
ing at less than 50% capacity. The rice milled is medium grade, around 35%
broken. With some improvements, the existing rice mills should be able to
handle the incremental paddy production from the project through 1985, and
about half the incremental production at full development in 1988. Large
mills to process the remaining 80,000-90,000 tons of paddy each year after
full development would cost roughly US$200,000 equivalent, plus civil works
for buildings. Additional demand for drying, milling and storage facilities
would be met by the Government (para. 4.08).

6.  MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      The Government's foremost concern is the supply of rice, the basic
food: top priority is being given to increasing rice output, with the inten-
tion of achieving self-sufficiency in food grains by 1980. However, paddy
output, which was estimated at 12 million tons in 1976, fell to an estimated
11.2 million tons in 1977. After deducting losses, seed and industrial
requirements estimated at 10% of domestic production. 10.1 million tons of
paddy or 6.4 million tons of rice were available for human consumption in
1977. Based on a mid-year population of 49.3 million and a desired consumption
level of 180 kg per capita, rice demand would have been 8.9 million tons,
leaving a deficit of some 2.5 million tons to be covered by subsidiary crops
and imports. With population growing at 2.5-3.0% per year and a target
consumption level of 180 kg per capita, the domestic demand for rice in 1990
would be between 12.2 and 13.0 million tons, or about double 1977 production.
In view of the need to increase rice production by this amount over the next
10-15 years, there should be no difficulty in marketing the incremental
100,000 tons of milled rice expected from the project annually at full
development.
6.02      Although Viet Nam is a net importer of edible oils, groundnuts
are grown mainly for export. Since Viet Nam is unable at present to fill all
its groundnut export orders, no major difficulty is expected in marketing the
incremental groundnut output, which is estimated at 38,000 tons (unshelled)
per annum at full development.
Prices
6.03      All farm inputs and outputs were evaluated at present and projected
1985 farmgate prices expressed in mid-1978 constant prices. For the economic
analysis, the prices for rice, groundnuts and fertilizers were derived from
the Bank's commodity price forecasts of world market prices, adjusted for
transport, processing and handling costs. The price structure for rice and
groundnuts is presented in Table 6.1, while Table 6.2 shows all present and
future prices used in the economic and financial (farm budget) analysis.
6.04      Government procurement prices for paddy and groundnuts are determined
administratively each year before harvest by a Commission on Prices. For paddy
two price levels are fixed. For that part of the crop sold to the Government
according to quotas negotiated each year between the districts and the coopera-
tives, the price is D 400/ton. The size of the quota takes into account the
number of members of the cooperative, potential of the land and actual yields
obtained the previous year. For quantities sold to the Government above the
quota, after payment in kind of the agricultural tax (para. 1.06), the price
is D 900/ton.
6.05      The Ministry of Food estimates that the two price levels result in an
average paddy procurement price of D 650/ton, which is above the present
economic farmgate price of D 365/ton, based on the world market prices and



- 37 -
the official exchange rate. The retail price of rice sold in Government shops
is fixed at D 0.4/kg, which corresponds to a farmgate paddy price of about
D 240/ton. Thus the Government's present price policy results in an average
subsidy of about D 400/ton of paddy.
6.06      The Government also fixes the price of groundnuts procured for
export, and agricultural inputs. The present groundnut price of D 875/ton
is above the implicit economic farmgate price of D 740/ton, while input
prices issued in January 1978 provide a modest subsidy for most farm inputs.
Thus the official financial price structure would appear to provide adequate
price incentives for farmers.
Farm Incomes
6.07      Since the agricultural sector in the south is still undergoing the
transition to socialism, farm models are necessarily hypothetical, but have
been constructed to give a rough indication of the project's impact on farm
incomes. For the present situation three farm models were prepared represen-
ting 2.0 ha privately-owned farms with different cropping patterns depending
on soils, topography and the availability of dry-season irrigation. The
three models are: "paddy/paddy", representing farms on good paddy land near
sources of dry-season irrigation water (7% of the project area); "paddy/ground-
nut" representing farms on good paddy land without dry-season irrigation (67%
of the project area); and "groundnut/groundnut", representing farms on
higher land with lighter soils, without dry-season irrigation (26% of the
project area). In the future it is assumed that farmers would be organized
into cooperatives averaging 150 ha, ar 75 families. Without the project,
since there would be no change in the physical environment, the cooperatives
would have cropping patterns similar to the present private farms. In the
future with the project, full irrigation would be available year-round.
Cooperatives on land suitable for paddy (74% of the area) would grow two
full crops while cooperatives on land suitable for groundnut (26% of the
area) would grow three crops. In all models it is assumed that there would
be no significant off-farm income, and that all labor would be provided by
farm family or cooperative members, with no hired labor.
6.08      Gross value of production was computed by multiplying total produc-
tion by the average procurement price of D 650/ton for paddy (para. 6.05)
and D 875/ton for groundnut. From this were subtracted cash production
costs, interest on production credit, the agricultural tax and water charges,
to arrive at net farm or cooperative income. The agricultural tax was taken
as 12% of gross production, payable in kind and valued at D 900/ton for
paddy and D 875/ton for groundnut. The tax was applied to the main crop
only at present, reflecting the Government's policy to encourage double
cropping, and to all crops in the future (para. 1.06). With the project
farmers would pay water charges to cover the full cost of operation and
maintenance and to repay part of capital cost (para. 6.12). In arriving at
family and per capita income figures it was further assumed that net cooper-
ative income after taxes and water charges would be equally divided among the
members, and that each farm family contains six persons.



- 38 -
6.09      The farm budgets are presented in Annex 2, Table 2, and the results
are summarized in Table 6.3. Present farm income per capita ranges from ND 390
on a 2.0 ha paddy/groundnut farm to D 850 on a 2.0 ha paddy/paddy farm with
full irrigation. In the future without the project per capita incomes of
cooperative members would be roughly the same, with slightly higher production
being offset by slightly higher sales under the paddy quota and the application
of the agricultural tax to second crops. With the project at full development,
per capita incomes would be around D 1,280-1,330 for both the paddy and ground-
nut cooperatives, assuming no major increase in the quota or agricultural tax.

6.10      Comparisons of per capita incomes based on farm budgets with income
data based on national accounts aggregates must be interpreted with caution
under the best of circumstances. This is particulary true in Viet Nam today
where the national accounts do not follow the United Nations methodology for
all sectors, the prices of major inputs and outputs are administratively
determined to meet social objectives, and the exchange rate serves mainly an
accounting function due to the Government's monopoly of external trade.
Nevertheless, such comparisons may give a rough indication of the relative
economic position of project beneficiaries.
6.11      According to the Bank's economic report,/l estimated national
income per capita in 1976 was D 500. The present incomes of farmers

producing one crop of paddy plus a small amount of groundnut (D 390) would
be slightly below the average, while the minority with two crops of paddy
(D 850) would be better off. With the project, per capita incomes of
D 1,280-1,330 would represent a significant improvement above average present
conditions- average national income would have to grow at a real rate of
12% per year t- reach that level by the time of full project development
in 1988. Summarizing these figures, it appears that project beneficiaries
are not far from the average income level in Viet Nam at present; with the
project they would be substantially better off. If the rest of the economy
grows more slowly than incomes in the project area, however, it is likely
that the authorities would want to distribute the benefits of the project
more widely, through increased quotas, taxes or water charges.
Project Charges
6.12      Viet Nam has a well established system of charges applying to all
irrigation schemes where individual farmers or cooperatives are ensured a
reliable water supply. Government policy is to recover directly or indirectly
from the beneficiaries, without impairing their incentives, all operation
and maintenance costs and as much as practicable of capital costs. This
recovery is carried out directly through the collection of water charges and
the agricultural tax, and indirectly through the paddy quota (para 1.06).
According to the Ministry of Water Conservancy, collections of direct
charges are nearly always 100% of assessments. For the proposed project,
water charges would amount to D 100/ha for cooperatives served by the
gravity system (38,000 ha) and D 118/ha for cooperatives served by pumping
(4,000 ha), while the agricultural tax would be an assumed 12% of incremental
gross production, payable in kind. The paddy quota is accounted for by
evaluating gross production at the average procurement price of D 650/ton
(para 6.08).
6.13      In determining the adequacy of these charges, two indices have
been used which are defined as follows for the present project:
(a)  Cost recovery index.  The ratio of the present value of incre-
mental water charges and agricultural tax paid by project cooper-
atives, to the present value of incremental project construction,
operation and maintenance costs; and
(b) Rent recovery index. The ratio of the present value of incre-
mental water charges and agricultural tax paid by cooperatives, to
the present value of "project rent" accruing to the cooperative
before paying project charges, where project rent is defined as
net incremental income less the incremental value of cooperative
labor, management and return on investment./l
/1   In principle a deduction should also be taken for depreciation of
cooperative assets, but since the structure of the cooperatives is
still to be determined, no estimate was possible. No deduction was
taken for risk and uncertainty since it is Government policy to pro-
vide assistance to cooperatives in times of natural disaster, thus
effectively guaranteeing a uXinimum income level (para. 1.06).



- 40 -
All project charges, costs and benefits were measured at present values dis-
counted at 10% over the 40-year life of the project, and in terms of mid-1978
constant prices (Table 6.4).
6.14      In the cost recovery analysis, D 221.2 million construction costs,
(base cost estimate plus physical contingencies) were charged against the
project. Annual operation and maintenance costs are D 25/ha for the gravity
system and D 43/ha for the area served by pumping. The present value of the
construction, operation and maintenance costs, discounted at 10% over the
life of the project, is D 207 million. At full proiect development. water
charges total D 4.4 million per year while incremental agricultural taxes
amount to D 22.6 million. Discounted at 10% and assuming no inflation over
the project's life, their combined net present value totals D 153 million,
giving a 74% cost recovery index for the project. In the rent recovery
analysis, indices were calculated separately for the representative 150 ha
paddy and groundnut cooperatives, comparing water charges and agricultural
taxes with project rent before paying these charges. The rent recovery
indices are 29% for the paddy cooperative and 25% for the groundnut cooper-
ative. The overall rent recovery index for the project is 28%.
6.15      The foregoing analysis indicates that, while water charges are not
particularly high in Viet Nam, the total benefit tax burden on farmers and
cooperatives is substantial. These charges would recover almost three-fourths
of the full cost of the proposed project, but should still leave the intended
beneficiaries with enough material incentive to participate.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      By providing an assured water supply, irrigation and drainage, the
proposed project would increase cropping intensity, yields and production on
42,000 ha, and provide the basis for development of an additional 30,000 ha
in the Stage II area when financial resources permit. It would directly
benefit some 21,000 farm families or approximately 120,000 people. The
project would support the Government's policies to attain self-sufficiency in
food grains, to create productive rural employment opportunities and to
raise rural incomes. The incremental annua' production of paddy (160,000
tons) and groundnut (38,000 tons) at full project development would result in
net annual foreign exchange savings and earnings of about US$40 million,
after deducting the incremental cost of imported fertilizers and agrochemicals.
The project would generate the demand for 6.3 million man-days of agricultural
labor, or the equivalent of some 26,000 year-round jobs. The project's cost
of US$2,400/ha and US$4,800 per beneficiary family, excluding costs due to
expected price increases, is comparable to the cost of other recent Bank
Group-assisted irrigation and drainage projects in the region. The above
costs were obtained by charging the full cost of the dam to Stage I
(42,000 ha). If the cost of the dam is prorated to the total area that
it would eventually irrigate, the corresponding project costs would be
US$1,400/ha and US$2,800/beneficiary family.
7.02      Benefits.  Expected future yields and production with and without
the project are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the economic
farmgate prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank's world market
commodity price forecasts for rice, groundnut and chemical fertilizers. Gross
returns, production costs, net returns (without accounting for labor costs)
and labor requirements per ha are given in Annex 2, Table 2. Figure 5.1 shows
the proposed cropping calendar. Table 7.1 summarizes the foregoing information
and gives the expected benefits at full agricultural development for the
42,000 ha project area.
7.03      Foreign Exchange.  The foreign exchange components of project costs
(82%), outputs (rice and groundnut) and major agricultural inputs (fertilizers)
were evaluated directly in terms of foreign exchange at world market border
prices. Local costs (mainly labor) were evaluated in terms of local currency.
The official exchange rate of D 2.5 = US$1 was used to convert all foreign
exchange to local currency equivalent for use in the economic analysis. This
exchange rate is somewhat arbitrary since, due to the Government's monopoly of
foreign trade, it serves mainly an accounting function. The lack of trade
statistics or other data to compare domestic with border prices, precluded
the calculation of standard or specific conversion factors (or shadow exchange
rate(s)) to correct for possible distortions. Certain transactions such as
tourist currency conversions are given a 50% premium, but making this adjustment
would only raise the project's economic rate of return. In any case, the
economic results are not sensitive to the choice of exchange rate (para. 7.10).
7.04      Farm Labor.  The 21,000 families in the project area each have an
average of 3.0 full-time farm workers. On the basis of 20 days per worker
per month, the total labor supply is now about 1.3 million man-days per month



- 45 -
and 15.1 million man-days per year. Annex 2, Table 3 gives estiraiates of
total monthly labor requirements in the project area. The present annual
requirement is 7.2 million man-days, or less than half the estimated supply.
Present labor demand also has a pronounced seasonal pattern. Peak demand
occurs in September and December/January, and over 40% of the yearly total is
taken up by these three months, when there is nearly full employment. In the
dry season, unemployment is the rule, except on the 3,000 ha where a second
paddy crop can be grown. Without the project, the future labor situation
would be much the same, and could become even worse if more people settle in
the area. With the project at full development, the annual laohr requirement
would be 13.5 million man-days, or about 90% of the annual labor supply. Most
of the additional labor would be needed for the dry-season crop and hence
would increase employment in periods when it otherwise would be lowest. Employ-
ment would be nearly full except during the June-August period of heavy monsoon
rainfall, and would be overfull in April, September and December/January,
possibly requiring some temporary or permanent addition to the labor force
from areas with fewer job opportunities.
7.05      It is assumed that all labor is provided by farm families at
present, and would be provided by cooperative members in the future, with no
outside hired labor. This work force has been costed at ND 1.5/man-day
(US$0.6 at the official exchange rate) which is the Government's fixed daily
wage in rural areas. Due to the current fluid employment situation, it is
difficult to estimate the opportunity cost of labor in the nroiect area.
However, the Government has no difficulty in hiring people at the fixed wage,
and with the population growing at 2.5-3.0% per year, it is expected that
there will be people willing to work for that wage in the future.
7.06      Project Costs. Total investment cost (excluding price contingen-
cies but including physical contingencies) expressed in mid-1978 prices is
US$99.7 million. This consists of equipment and materials (US$37.1 million),
civil works (US$60.3 million), engineering, administration and consulting
services (US$2.3 million). The entire cost of the Dau Tieng dam is included,
even though it would eventually serve an area much larger than the 42,000 ha
to be developed under the project. Costs were spread out over the five-year
implementation period to reflect the year in which resources would actually be
consumed by the project, rather than the year in which equipment purchases or
disbursements would be made. An allowance of 30% was taken for the residual
value of construction equipment in year six. Estimated annual operation and
maintenance costs are US$0.5 million at full development.
7.07      Development Period.  According to the project implementation schedule,
the Dau Tieng Dam would be closed and most of the irrigation service area would
be completed in time for the 1983 wet-season paddy crop- the service area would
be fully operational in time for the 1984 dry-season crop. It is assumed that
yields would reach their expected level in the sixth year after the completion
of the project works, so that full development would be reached in 1988.
7.08      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting costs and benefits over a 40-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return for the project is 17% (Table 7.2). If the investment costs
and corresponding benefits for the 30,000 ha Stage II service area are also



- 46 -
included, the economic rate of return would be about 20%. Although no estimate
of the opportunity cost of capital is available for Viet Nam, the project
appears clearly acceptable on economic grounds. Assuming an opportunity cost
of capital of roughly 10%, the Stage I project's economic net present value
(NPV) would be D 231.4 million (US$92.6 million).
7.09      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analysis was used to determine
which variables would be most crucial to the success of the project. In
carrying out the sensitivity analysis, two measures were developed for each
variable tested - the crossover value and the elasticity. The crossover
value is the value of the variable tested for which NPV discounted at 10% is
zero, and is a measure of how far the variable can differ from its most
likely value before the project becomes economically unacceptable. The
crossover value may also be interpreted as the value of the variable tested,
beyond which the economic rate of return would be below 10%. The elasticity
is defined as the percentage change in NPV discounted at 10% with respect to
a 1% change in the variable tested. It is a measure of the rate of change of
NPV change for any change of variable, at the most likely value of that
variable ./l.
7.10      The numerical results are presented in Table 7.3, which shows that
the success of the project is most sensitive to future yields for paddy and
groundnut. The attainment of target yields would be the focus of attention
for project management and supervision missions in the course of implementa-
tion. The results are also moderately sensitive to future world market
prices. However, these would be outside the control of the project. The other
variables tested would have to differ widely from their most likely values to
affect the viability of the project. The likelihood of these critical
variations is discussed below:
(a) Yields. The crossover values of yields represent an increase of
only 400 kg/ha for wet-season paddy, 500 kg/ha for dry-season paddy
and 300 kg/ha for groundnut, compared to conditions in future
without the project (Table 5.2). The most likely incremental
yields are about three times these figures, and it is therefore
highly unlikely that future yields with the project would be so low
as to cause the project to fail economically. To minimize this
possibility, the Government would prepare a detailed and compre-
hensive program for agricultural supporting services in the project
area (para. 4.08).
(b) Prices. The Bank's commodity analysts have taken the latest
available information on world population, income, technology and
planned investment into account in deriving demand and supply
relationships and price forecasts. It is unlikely that actual
prices will differ by as much as 38% from these forecasts over the
long run, although such differences may occur in some years.
/1 The elasticity generally changes for movements along the NPV-variable
curve.



- 47 -
(c)  Yields without Project.  Barring any increase in cropping intensity
without the project, yields would have to be 66% higher than their
most likely estimates before the NPV falls to zero. These values
are even higher than the expected yields with the project at full
development and are, therefore, highly unlikely to occur in the
absence of project improvements.
(d)  Development Period.  It is possible that full project develop-
ment might be delayed due to a slow buildup of supporting services
or possible disruptions caused by the introduction of cooperatives
in the project area (para. 4.14). However, the results are only
moderately sensitive to this variable and it is not likely that
full development would take as long as 19 years to achieve.
(e)  Combination of (a) and (d).  Although it is difficult to measure
the joint effect of two or more variables in terms of elasticities
and crossover values, an attempt was made to test the case of a
joint delay in reaching full benefits and a reduction in ultimate
yields. For example, the development period would have to be
increased by 40% (to 1992) and yields reduced 14% before the NPV
would fall to zero. Such an event is considered unlikely, but
again underlines the need to stress supporting services, and to
take a pragmatic approach to cooperatives.
(f)  Construction costs.  The results are not sensitive to construction
cost overruns, which would have to be more than 100% before the
project becomes unacceptable.
(g)  Exchange rate.  Since more than 80% of project costs and virtually
all benefits were evaluated directly at world market border prices,
the results show very little sensitivity to the choice of exchange
rate. The sensitivity test also shows that applying a premium to
the official exchange rate (para. 7.03) would increase the project's
NPV.
(h)  Wage rate.  The results showed almost no sensitivity to this
variable. The economic wage rate would have to be five times the
prevailing rate in rural areas before the NPV would fall to zero.
(i)  Cropping intensity.  It was not possible to measure variations in
cropping intensity in terms of elasticities and crossover values.
However, if the cropping intensity of paddy is only 150% instead of
200%, and that of groundnut is 200% instead of 300% (implying an
overall cropping intensity of 162% instead of the expected 226%),
the NPV would still be a positive D 45 million (US$18 million).
7.11      Risks.  Given MWC's experience with projects of similar scope and
complexity, no organization, management or implementation problems are
expected. Perhaps the largest element of risk concerns the organization of
agricultural enterprises in the project area. In spite of its long experience
with cooperatives in the north, the Government may encounter some obstacles
when it starts to form them in the south. The first pilot cooperative in the



- 48 -
project area is being set up in Chau Thanh district in 1978, and it is
difficult to foresee farmers' response to this new form of organization. The
development period may, therefore, take longer than anticipated, or ultimate
yields may be lower than projected. The sensitivity analysis shows, however,
that such changes are unlikely to affect the economic viability of the
project (para. 7.10).
7.12      Since this will be the first IDA-assisted project in Viet Nam, and
because the country, particularly the region where the project is located,
is undergoing political and social changes. the Association expects more
than the usual amount of supervision problems during project implementation.
Existing communication facilities are inadequate- there is a shortage of
typing and copying equipment, as well as translators; the release of any
kind of information requires time-consuming clearances: and visits to the
project area and interviews with the farming population are subject to
prior approval by the Government. Because of the above constraints, corres-
pondence with the Government would be limited to a few key officialsi there
may be some delays in obtaining clearance for visits of IDA missions and in
the transmittal of requested information during project implementation; and
replies to letters and cables from the Association may be tediously slow.
While these constraints may pose more than the usual supervision difficulties,
the Association is confident that they would not affect the quality of
project implementation. Furthermore, these difficulties could, to some
extent, be minimized through more frequent and intensive supervision missions
of small size.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government that,

completion of project works (para. 3.21)-
(c) MWC would provide adequate facilities for the storage and protec-
tion of equipment, materials and supplies procured under the

these accounts- and it would send to IDA the audited accounts,
together with the au4itor's comments and opinion on the hydraulic
works company's certificates of expenditure, within six months of
the close of each financial year (para. 3.30)7

retained during project execution and that IDA would be informed
about any replacement of the Project Manager (paras. 4.02 and 4.03);
(f) it would appoint a panel of experts consisting of a geologist,
a hydraulic engineer and a dam design and construction engineer
not later than December 31, 1978 whose qualifications and terms of
employment would be acceptable to IDA, and whose responsibility
would be to review construction progress at least twice a year; be
available for consultation throughout the construction period on
any construction problems or changes in design or construction
schemes prior to their implementation; provide advice on the
preparation of the spillway manual; and recommend a suitable
maintenance and safety inspection program to be carried out after

(i) it would make the necessary arrangements to implement the maintenance
and safety inspection program recommended by the panel of experts
following completion of the dam, and that it would submit to IDA

carrying out the program, together with the timetable for its
implementation (para. 4.08)
(j) not later than December 31, 1979, it would prepare and submit to
IDA for its review a detailed and comprehensive program for agri-
cultural supporting services in the project area (research and
extension services, credit facilities, machinery maintenance and
repair stations, seeds, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals,
training of cooperative managers and transport, processing and
storage of agricultural products), together with the timetable
for implementing the program- and thereafter, it would implement
the said program and inform the Association of the progress of the
implementation (para. 4.09)- and
(k) it would collect water charges from all beneficiaries of the irri-
gation system constructed under the project, at levels consistent
with the capability of the beneficiaries to pay said charges. to
cover the cost of sound operation and maintenance services necessary
to provide irrigation and drainage to the area served, and to
recover over the useful life of the irrigation system a reasonable
portion of its capital cost (para. 4.19).
8.02      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an IDA
credit of US$60 million under the usual IDA terms. The Borrower would be the
Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.
