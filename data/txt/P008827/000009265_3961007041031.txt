MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR A HOUSING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed Housing
Loan to the Russian Federation in the amount of US$400 million equivalent to support the
development of private housing markets. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable rate
with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    A Country Economic Memorandum for Russia was published in September, 1992. The
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by Executive Directors on May 19, 1994. The
proposed project fits well within the CAS (para 6-8).
A. SECTORAL CONTEXT
3.    BACKGROUND. Housing reforms began early in the transition and are a centerpiece of
the Govermnent's political and economic program. For example, the housing privatization program
privatized about 25 % of the national housing stock in 1992 and 1993. This transfer of assets sparked
a secondary market of housing transactions. Housing is now among the first sectors to stabilize in
the Russian economy: production increased slightly in 1993 after several years of sharp contraction.
Moreover, the recovery is being led by small-scale private enterprise and household production,
rather than by revival of old-style government subsidies. Residential construction could help lead
Russia out of recession because inputs are simple, small firms can participate without much capital
and labor is available. Evidence suggests pent-up demand for housing: it can sell for two to four
times its production cost and twenty times average annual household incomes -- extreme figures of
shortage by world standards.
4.    Several issues still constrain deepening of private housing markets, despite strong demand,
private initiative, and federal enabling reforms. Private developers cannot get access to urban land
as the majority of land is still under government ownership, and there are no appropriate local
procedures for land privatization, urban planning, and property registration.  Nor are there
mechanisms to finance servicing of raw land. Moreover, when developers can get serviced land,
they build for a narrow base of wealthy households or enterprises which pay cash for construction
in advance. Developers do not build for middle-income households -- who have their wealth locked
up in recently-privatized financing units -- as there is no bridge finance available for the construction
period. Finally, because of building materials industry monopolies, the Government faces strong
pressure to direct unsustainable subsidies to the sector while developers face shortages of energy-
efficient, affordable building materials for new types of housing.
5.    GOVERNMENT STRATEGY. The Government detailed its reform strategy in its State
Targeted Program "Housing." This Program parallels the Bank's policy framework in Housing
Reform and Privatization: Strategy and Transition Issues (Green Cover, Feb. 1994). It addresses
supply, demand, and institutional issues and points out that housing is a macro-economic priority
affecting labor mobility, employment generation, capital formation, and financial and fiscal stability.



-2-
While the Government has introduced fundamental federal reforms, it recognizes that implementation
is mostly a local responsibility. Implementation has been uneven so far, as local officials try to
understand how housing markets work.  Government strategy now places high priority on
demonstrating practical ways that private markets can produce housing. The Government has asked
that the first Housing Project support this strategy by financing investments that (a) break up public
land monopolies to increase land supply and reduce the cost of housing, (b) introduce banking
mechanisms for housing construction so developers can expand into markets below the highest
income class, and, its top priority, (c) transform the building materials industry to generate
employment, strengthen management and introduce new types of materials. The Government has
requested that subsequent housing sector projects might address enterprise housing divestiture,
general primary infrastructure, center-city rehabilitation, and housing finance.
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK FINANCING
6.    The most recent discussion of the CAS for Russia was held in May 19, 1994, in the context
of a Financial Institutions Development Project.  At that time, the Bank recommended an
Intermediate Case lending program, in the order of US$1-1.5 billion annually, not including
adjustment lending. The program will be composed of a core of straightforward projects, largely
in infrastructure including Housing, and the social sectors, and an additional set of projects that
would only go forward when the Government has satisfied key conditions for sectoral reforms. The
project is included in the core set of projects under the program, and is intended to advance the
Bank's continuing policy dialogue in the housing sector. As indicated in the CAS, infrastructure,
including the housing sector, is expected to be an important focus for Bank lending over the next
several years, accounting for roughly 23 percent of new commitments during FY93-97 period. The
proposed Project is fully consistent with the Bank's CAS and the Bank's Accelerated Program
requested by the Government in CM Resolution 603 and agreed at the April 1993 G-7 meeting.
7.      The priority objectives of the CAS are to (a) support the development of a market oriented
economy based on private sector initiatives; (b) encourage redirection of public sector involvement
in the economy toward the establishment of open and competitive markets and the provision of
physical, social, legal, and institutional infrastructure not normally provided through the private
sector; (c) establish the Bank as a trusted and reliable development partner through financing of high
priority public sector investments and policy advice on key economic and sectoral issues. The CAS
for Russia recognizes the need to provide assistance to certain key sectors such as infrastructure,
housing, and energy, which will have a direct and fundamental impact on the success of
macroeconomic reform.
8.    The Government's housing sector reform has been a major success over the last three years
and should be sustained and deepened by assisting its practical implementation at the local level
through demonstration projects. The proposed Housing Project directly supports the CAS goals by:
(a) financing an investment project in an area where reforms have been rapidly achieved;
(b) supporting Government initiatives to re-conceptualize housing as a key economic sector, realign
the sector along market lines, and to rationalize and reduce subsidies to the sector; (c) implementing
federal housing reforms at local levels; (d) demonstrating practical ways of having markets produce



-3-
housing; (e) mobilizing foreign direct investment; (f) improving environmental and energy
approaches in the sector; and (f) institutionalizing new regulatory and administrative procedures in
participating cities.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
9.    OBJECTIVES. The main goal of the Project is to support the Government's efforts to
develop housing markets with choice for consumers and competition among private suppliers. The
Project will implement national policies in receptive cities, demonstrate practical ways that markets
can produce housing and generate employment, and institutionalize new principles and practices.
The principal Project Objectives are (a) to break up the present Government monopoly on supply of
land by assisting selected municipal governments in auctioning and developing infrastructure on sites
suitable for residential development; (b) to demonstrate that the private sector can produce housing
that is more efficient and appealing than that provided by the "Kombinats;" (c) to encourage the
banking community to increase the volume of medium-term lending for private sector housing
construction; and (d) to encourage the establishment of industries to produce modern and more
efficient building materials through the Equity Matching Line of Credit. The Technical Cooperation
Component will create the enabling regulatory and technical framework at the local level for Project
Implementation.
10.   LINK TO POLICY  DIALOGUE.  The Project would not include national policy
conditionality because adequate legislative support can be found for all of the components of the
Project. Instead, the Project is designed to implement reforms at the local level that the national
Government has already established as its policy. Each local government has developed individual
Regulatory Action Plans (RAP's) that emphasize (a) property rights development -- including land
and property title registration; (b) urban regulatory reforms -- such as land privatization; land
allocation through competitive procedures; and urban planning, building, environmental, and
permitting procedures; and (c) pro-competition policies for the building industry -- including public
procurement rules and construction management.
11.   COMPONENTS. The proposed Project will include three components: (a) Housing Market
Development, with land development and construction finance sub-components in the Participating
Cities of Barnaul, Moscow (for demonstrations), Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, St. Petersburg, and
Tver; (b) Transformation of the Building Materials Industry, with an equity matching sub-component;
and (c) Technical Cooperation and Project Management. The Government would hold annual project
reviews in order to reprogram investments, technical cooperation and reforms among sub-project
types and cities.
12.   The Land Development Sub-component will assist local governments in auctioning serviced
and unserviced housing sites to private developers. Sub-loans to local governments would help
finance public provision of off-site infrastructure that is needed to provide site services as well as
connecting infrastructure between parcels. Local governments would take the credit risk associated
with the loan and will recover the costs through the sale of the land. Land disposal procedures have
been designed to maximize the local government's return and minimize the risk of non-recovery by:
(a) holding auctions before awarding infrastructure contracts; and (b) allowing private developers to
propose construction of connecting infrastructure through their own means. Site development will



-4-
follow Town Planning Orders that specify land use and densities but allow flexibility so that
developers may build according to their perceptions of the marketplace.
13.   The Construction Finance Sub-component would encourage the banking community to enlarge
the volume of medium-term lending for private sector housing construction. Sub-loans would be used
to construct housing that is modest in size and energy efficient and to complete unfinished apartment
buildings. Housing sub-projects situated on the sites developed under the Land Development
Sub-component would qualify, as well as those within 15 km. of participating cities' boundaries. In
order to qualify, commercial banks also must participate in the Bank-financed Financial Institutions
Development Project (FIDP - Loan # 3734-RU) designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of
specific commercial banks.
14.   The Eguity Matching Sub-component would extend sub-loans to new Russian building
materials ventures that attract substantial new equity from qualified investors. The Government
would on-lend the Bank loan through participating commercial banks which would assume the credit
risk. Sub-loan amounts would be up to double the amount of new cash equity contributed by
qualifying investors. Conservative guidelines have been established to delimit qualifying investors
(i.e. venture capital funds and private companies with experience in producing or distributing modern
building materials), equity, and products in order ensure that this experimental component is
financially prudent and will help to restructure the industry.
15.   The Technical Cooperation Component will support policy reforms, finance project units, and
prepare future projects. The component would be partially financed by the loan (up to $23 million)
and partially financed by bilateral donors including USAID. Technical cooperation includes: (a)
imlementation assistance and programming for future projects (e.g., design and engineering; staff,
consultants and equipment for the Project Implementation Units; and support for implementing
Regulatory Action Plans; (b) housing and construction finance (e.g., training to commercial banks
in coordination with the FIDP; a Housing Finance Study; and training for designers, developers and
local governments on construction technologies, standards, and construction management; (c) land
registration for pilot real estate registration systems; and (d) support for establishing new types of
building materials (e.g. standards and codes; building materials information systems).
D. PROJECT FINANCING
16.   The total estimated cost of the Project is US$758 million, of which the Bank would finance
US$400 million. Foreign exchange costs are difficult to estimate, but may be 50% of the total, in
part because of the interest expressed by foreign contractors in bidding on civil works contracts.
USAID and other bilateral donors have so far committed $8 million towards the Technical
Cooperation Program. Remaining financing would be provided by private investors and local
governments.
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
17.   Because of the Bank's experience in Russian projects, early attention has been given to
creating strong implementation capacity. The Project requires a Central Project Implementation Unit
(CPIU) for successful administration of sub-projects involving federal and local agencies, banks, and



-5-
private enterprises. The CPIU will engage a General Consultant to handle most of the technical
work, including procurement advice, inspection and certification of works and promotion of lines
of credit. The CPIU -- with a Project Manager and a small staff -- will report to the Chairman of
the Interministerial Group (IG). The IG will provide policy guidance, particularly on issues for
interministerial intervention. The IG is headed by the Minister of Construction and includes
representatives of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Economy (MOE), and the Department
responsible for coordination with the Bank. Local Coordinating Committees (LCC), with designated
local coordinators, have been established within local governments. LCC's will supervise Local
Project Implementation Units (LPIUs), which, in turn will implement the Land Development Sub-
projects. The cost of the General Consultant and equipment and consultants for the CPIU and
LPIU's will be covered under the loan.
18.   USAID's Training and Technical Cooperation Program provided US$3.5 million of grant
assistance, including a $2 million trust fund administered by the Bank. Part of this assistance
supported the initiation of a Project Review Unit (PRU) in Moscow to help build the implementation
capacity of the federal authorities, the cities, as well as the Unit itself. LCCs have been established
in each city. The PRU is currently in the process of transition to a Central Project Implementation
Unit. The condition of effectiveness will only formalize this transformation.
F. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
19.   The Project would develop sustainable institutions through an extensive capacity-building TA
program, and through careful project design. USAID has committed $6.5 million for strengthening
sector institutions and for human resource development, at the local and national levels. Cities were
selected mainly on the basis of their willingness to implement local Regulatory Action Plans. They
would recover costs by selling rights to serviced land. Developers would repay construction loans
by selling units. Commercial banks would bear the risk for their construction loans. Building
materials investors would place equity at risk.
G. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGOREES
20.   The proposed project is designed to support the Bank's program objective of private sector
development by financing private investment, ownership, and requiring private real estate
development, housing construction, and building materials industries. The project would provide
technical assistance and training to commercial banks, private developers, and private building
materials enterprises in order to promote good commercial practices in the sector. The Project
would provide assistance to the participating cities to develop the policy, legal, and institutional
framework for an efficient real estate market. In addition, the project is consistent with the program
objective of environmentally sustainable development by ensuring that environmental assessments are
carried out for proposed sites, and by introducing energy efficiency guidelines for construction
finance.



-6-
H. POVERTY CATEGORY/SOCIAL PARTICIPATION
21.   The Project is designed to promote creation of housing markets and does not have a specific
poverty or social participation focus. In transition to markets, the first priority is not to build new
low-income housing, but to allow people to begin moving, thereby freeing up existing units for
others. The Government notes that there is an excess of social housing, and a shortage for those
who can afford to exit from the social stock. As currently designed, the Project would target
families below the highest income levels by using urban planning guidelines, infrastructure standards,
and loan and unit size caps. Most people are expected to obtain the funds they need to purchase
units by selling their newly privatized apartments. Surveys carried out during preparation suggest
that a substantial percentage of families -- in some cities more than 50% of households -- could
afford a small apartment costing US$20,000 by using a combination of savings and money from sale
of their present unit.
I. LESSONS FROM PAST BANK PROJECTS
22.   The lessons learned from other loans to Russia include: (a) the challenge of identifying and
coordinating counterparts; (b) the importance of early attention to implementation and procurement
issues; and (c) the need to include local consultants and institutes in project work. The Project team
has addressed these concerns by working through a formal Interministerial Coordinating Group,
establishing the PRU with foreign and local consultants, and engaging local institutes in all project
preparation activities.
23.   Recent Bank housing loans in reforming socialist countries suggest a range of lessons,
including a tendency toward overly optimistic project implementation schedules. The Poland
Housing Project (Loan No. 3499), which became effective on May 6, 1993, focused on long term
housing finance -- which is premature in Russia. This Project has shown that: (a) establishing apex
or banking mechanisms is difficult in an unstable macro-economic climate; (b) local Project Units
can be helpful in introducing new lending mechanisms and in mobilizing new reform constituencies;
and (c) it is critical to have a strong counterpart to speak for the Project in executive and legislative
debates. The Armenia Earthquake Reconstruction Project (IDA Credit No. 2562-AM), signed on
February 18, 1994, shows the importance of having the Bank take an activist role in project
preparation in countries that are unused to market mechanisms and Bank procedures. As a group,
these projects show the importance of broadening the counterpart beyond Ministries of Construction
to include MOF, MOE and other reform constituencies. Finally, the Bank has carried out extensive
policy and evaluation work in the sector. In particular, the recent Russia Housing Sector Report
provides a framework for the sectoral dialogue in Russia. OED evaluation work on the urban and
water sectors stresses that cost recovery is important but unlikely to be achieved unless careful
attention is given to the sustainability of key sectoral institutions. It also points out that city-wide
regulatory reforms are crucial so that land development projects do not become isolated enclaves.
J. ISSUES AND ACTIONS
24.   Durin2 negotiations, agreement was reached with the central Government, and with
Participating Cities and Oblasts on all terms and conditions. Proposed conditions of effectiveness
for the Loan are: (i) CPIU established, director appointed, and key consultants hired for project



-7-
management; (ii) Sub-loan agreements signed with at least 3 local governments. Conditions for
participating city loan effectiveness are: (i) Establishment of LPIU's; (ii) Funding of project
accounts; (iii) Adoption of local regulations for title registration and land auctions (for both
construction Finance and Land Development Sub-components). Special conditions are also proposed
for disbursement of specific components in the cities. For Land Development and Construction
Finance Sub-components: (i) the Participating City Loan Agreement should be effective between the
city and the Government; for Construction Finance and Equity Matching Lines of Credit: (ii) FIDP
loan should be effective, and at least two banks should be accredited under the FIDP; and (iii) the
Borrower should have signed Subsidiary Loan Agreements with at least two Banks under the

K. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
25.   The Project is rated in Category B. Environmental reviews have been completed on the
initial land development sites. Environmental guidelines for the construction finance and building
materials components are consistent with the Enterprise Support Project, and would, in addition,
give priority to environmentally-friendly new building technologies. The main environmental
concerns relate to lack of adequate sewerage infrastructure in St. Petersburg. A mitigation plan
financed by the Project would provide for strategic small investments in the water and sewer system
to balance the system and strengthen the Northern region of St. Petersburg. This would provide for
project sites and start to address sewage deficits.
L. BENEFITS AND RISKS
26.   BENEFITS. The principal benefits would be to reinforce the sector policy reform by: (a)
providing tangible evidence to Russians about the value of Government's policy to move towards
competitive housing markets; and (b) demonstrating the range of financing, regulatory, and
institutional tools used to develop real estate in market systems. Specific components would also:
(c) break the Government land monopoly; (d) create a transitional mechanism that will catalyze
foreign direct investment, technology, and management to increase the availability of building
materials for self-help and small scale construction; and (e) develop financial sector capacity in real
estate. Finally, the Project will: (f) increase employment in private construction and building
materials enterprises, (g) increase labor mobility and opportunities for military resettlement and (h)
help relieve pressures on the Government to direct unaffordable subsidies to the construction sector.
Quantifiable benefits are large compared to project investments.  The land development
sub-component alone is expected to stimulate construction of over 22,000 apartments, 8,200 town
houses, and 1,000 individual houses; and generate more than 100,000 person years of short term
employment.
27.   RISKS.  The Project contains a number of risks.  The Bank's lack of experience
implementing projects in Russia should be offset by careful sub-project preparation, emphasis on
procurement, and extensive capacity-building TC.  In addition, larger than usual physical
contingencies would partially offset the difficulty of assessing costs in Russia's rapidly changing
macro-economic environment. While the political risk that reforms will falter is endemic, the
Government has shown sustained commitment thus far, and housing reform is endorsed by the
population. More specifically, on land development, the principal risk involves the availability and



-8-
timing of local counterpart funding, given the unsettled state of local budgets and intergovernmental
fiscal relations.  This risk would be offset by advance funding of project accounts and by
reprogranmming investments on a yearly basis. A second risk is that sites will not be marketable at
prices sufficient to recover costs. The Project is countering this risk by consulting early with private
developers, elirninating all but the strongest sites based on the sub-project appraisals, holding
auctions before awarding infrastructure awards, and phasing construction. The third risk is that local
Governments will not follow through on selling land and development rights. The Project is
responding to this risk by focusing on land disposition policies as a prerequisite for financing and
by incorporating specific legal covenants in the implementation agreements to be entered into by the
Participating Cities, addessing the issue of subsequent disposition of parcels to the private sector.
On construction finance, the credit risk of lending foreign currency for domestic production is
mitigated in real estate, where values track hard currency. Sound underwriting practices will reduce
this risk to manageable proportions. The second risk is the lack of well capitalized domestic
developers. Banks indicate that there is substantial demand by private developers for gap financing;
and a pipeline has been developed far in excess of available funds. Conservative loan-to-value ratios
for both construction finance and land development mitigate some of the risk of sharp relative price
changes. On equity matching, one risk is that reform will wither and the component will not
disburse. Another risk is that the proceeds of the loan will flow to non-viable or unscrupulous
enterprises, resulting in misdirection of the funds. This risk is mitigated by the "due diligence" loan
processing requirements for eligible investors and by having the commercial Banks take the credit
risk. A third risk is that commercial banks would be unwilling to undertake term lending. This
could slow disbursements or cause funds to be transferred to other components.
M. RECOMMENDATION
28.   I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

Saccheri, Tarik Pekin, Ray Struyk, David Sullivan, Kevin Villani, Peter Ware, and Joel Zingeser. The
Project Review Unit in Moscow includes Alain Davet, Natasha Kalinina, William Krause, John Lyons,
John Pickard, Piet Nankman, and Boris Smirnov. Richard Podolske assisted from the Bank's Resident
Mission in Moscow. The Project benefitted from advice by Marc Blanc (EC3DR); Claude Blanchi,
Marcelo Selowsky (ECAVP); Charles Blitzer (EC3MO), Costas Michalopoulos (EC3), and Bertrand
Renaud (FSD). A Steering Committee of Jonathan Brown (EC31V), Anthony Pellegrini (EMTIN), and
Michael Cohen (TWURD) for the Bank and Peter Kimm for USAID supervised the USAID trust fund
for project preparation. David Leibson was the liaison with USAID. The Governments of Canada,
Finland, France, and the Netherlands provided support for project preparation and pilot projects. Margret
Thalwitz (EC21N), Jacques Toureille (EC3AI), and Thomas Zearley (LA21E) were the Peer Reviewers.
Jonathan C. Brown and Yukon Huang are the managing Division Chief and Department Director,
