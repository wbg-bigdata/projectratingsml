STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUsSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower      Russian Federation.
Implementing  Interministerial Coordinating Group, Chaired by the Ministry of Architecture
Agencies       and Construction (Minstroi); Participating Cities: St. Petersburg, Tver,
Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Barnaul, and Moscow (for demonstrations);
Participating Commercial Banks.
Beneficiaries   Participating Cities: St. Petersburg, Tver, Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod,
Barnaul, and Moscow (for demonstrations); Participating Commercial Banks;
Private Real Estate Developers, and Building Materials Enterprises.
Poverty        Not applicable
Amount         US$400 million equivalent.
Terms          17 years, including five years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
Commitnent
Fee            Standard.
Onlending     The Government would on-lend the Bank loan in US dollars to local
governments and participating banks. Sub-loans would be made at an interest
rate reflecting the cost to the Government plus a spread of up to 2.5% with
varying maturities and grace periods. Commercial banks will lend to final
beneficiaries (private real estate developers and building materials enterprises) at
market interest rates for maturities of 6 months to 8 years.
Project        The main goal of the Project is to support the Government's efforts to develop
Objectives    housing markets with choice for consumers and competition among private
suppliers. More specifically, the Project objectives are to (a) implement national
housing reform policies in receptive cities, especially to de-monopolize the
supply of land; (b) demonstrate practical ways that markets can produce
housing and generate employment, and (c) institutionalize new principles and
practices, in particular in construction and the building materials industry
Project        Tne proposed Project will include three components: (a) Land and Housing
Description    Market Development, with land development and construction finance Sub-
components in the Participating Cities of Barnauls), Nizhny Novgorod,



SUMMARY
Novgorod, Tver, St.Petersburg, and Moscow (for demonstration); (b)
Transformation of the Building Materials Industry, with an equity matching Sub-
component; and (c) Technical Cooperation and Proiect Management with
technical cooperation and project management Sub-components. The
Government will hold annual project reviews in order to reprogram investments,
technical cooperation and reforms among sub-project types and cities. The Land
Development Sub-component is designed to break up the present Government
monopoly on land supply by assisting local governments in auctioning serviced
and unserviced sites suitable for residential development to private developers.
The Government will on-lend funds to local Governments to implement reforms
and carry out infrastructure sub-projects. The Construction Finance Sub-
component would encourage the banking community to enlarge the volume of
medium-term lending for private sector housing construction. Subloans would be
used to construct housing that is modest in size and energy efficient. This Sub-
component will demonstrate that the private sector can produce housing that is
more efficient and appealing than that produced by large traditional construction
organizations. The Equity Matching Sub-component will encourage the
establishment of industries to produce modern and more efficient building
materials based on transfer of efficient technical and management skills through
joint ventures. The Government would on-lend the Bank loan for this
sub-component to participating commercial banks which would assume the credit
risk for loans to Russian enterprises. Conservative guidelines have been
established to delimit qualifying investors (i.e. venture capital funds and private
companies with experience in producing modern building materials), minimum
equity contributions (at least 1/3 of sub-project cost) and products in order to
ensure that this experimental component is financially prudent. The Technical
Cooperation Component will support policy reforms, finance project units, and
prepare future projects.
Benefits      The principal benefits would be to reinforce the sector policy dialogue by: (a)
providing tangible evidence to Russians about the value of Government's policy
of moving towards competitive housing markets; and (b) demonstrating the
range of financing, regulatory, and institutional tools used to develop real estate
in market systems. Quantifiable benefits are substantial. The land development
Sub-component alone is expected to stimulate construction of over 22,000
apartments, 8,200 town houses, and 1,000 individual houses; and generate more
than 100,000 person years of short term employment.
Risks         The Bank's lack of experience in implementing projects in Russia has been
offset by careful sub-project preparation, emphasis on early procurement
arrangements, and extensive capacity-building TA. In addition, larger than
usual physical and price contingencies would partially offset the difficulty of
assessing costs in Russia's rapidly changing macro-economic environment. The
risk that there might not be adequate demand for the new units has been reduced
by demand studies and would be mitigated during implementation by monitoring
of markets and flexibility to move funds among project components. Another



Summary                                                                                                     ii
risk involves the availability and timing of local counterpart funding for the land
development sub-projects, given the unsettled state of local budgets and
intergovernmental fiscal relations. This risk would be offset by developing local
financial plans and improved budgeting. While the political risk that reforms
will falter is endemic, the Government has shown sustained commitment thus far
in pursuing reform in the housing sector.
Environment    The Project is rated in Category B. Environmental assessments have been
completed on the initial land development sites. Environmental guidelines for the
Construction Finance and Building Materials Sub-components are consistent with
the Enterprise Support Project, and will give priority to environmentally-friendly
building technologies. The main environmental concerns relate to lack of adequate
sewerage infrastructure in St. Petersburg. A mitigation plan financed by the
project will provide strategic small investments in the water and sewer system of
that city.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RusSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
I. THE HousiNG SECTOR
A.    BACKGROUND
1.1   Stabilization. The collapse of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), following the historic political
events in 1991, resulted in massive disruptions in all spheres of economic activity. The inumediate
impact was a sharp decline in real output and investment. In January 1992, Russia launched an
ambitious and unprecedented economic reform program, which consisted of liberalization of prices,
exchange rates and the trade regime.' However, high fiscal deficits caused an explosion of inflation,
with retail prices increasing six-fold and severely changing the price relationships between inputs to
the housing sector such as building materials and labor and outputs such as final house prices. The
tight fiscal situation will make it difficult to increase public expenditures in sectors such as housing,
unless such expenditures can recover costs.
1.2   Household Incomes. Despite output declines, total household incomes grew in real terms by
12% in January-April of 1994 and registered unemployment remains low (1.7% of the labor force
by the end April 1994). However, the average real income in 1993 remained below the level of
early 1990s. The actual decline in consumption standards is difficult to gauge given the previous
scarcity of goods, problems in the distribution system, and the lack of information on private sector
activities. The decline in output and manifold increases in prices during the last three years have
taken its toll on the living standards of the Russian population. Certainly, a significant percent of
the population has fallen below the minimum subsistence level, including, many pensioners.
1.3   Privatization. The Government has initiated a program of economic reform that involves
simultaneous restructuring and progressive privatization of parts of the economy, and the introduction
of competitive markets and pricing systems. Progress in privatization has been the centerpiece of the
Government's achievements in structural reform. The Russian privatization program has privatized
a larger number of enterprises than any other program in the world; Small-scale privatization has
also kept pace, though with significant regional variation; many farms have been technically
privatized, though they remain under collective ownership. Land privatization is accelerating
following the Prime Minister's announced commitment in March 1994 to expand a pilot model of
farm privatization carried out in Nizhny Novgorod. Reforms in the housing sector also have been
dramatic. At the beginning of the transition, approximately 16% of the housing stock was privately
owned. By the end of 1993, nearly 55 % of housing has been transferred to private ownership -- one

of the largest transfers of wealth into private hands by any country.2 An account of recent laws,
decrees and resolutions relating to housing reform is provided in Annex 1.1.
1.4   Financial Sector. There are almost 2000 independent commercial banks in Russia today,
nearly all having been created within the last few years. Although much of the expansion in bank
credit during the past two years was funded through directed credit programs, the level of financing
extended under such conditions is declining steadily. Among the vast number of new banks in
Russia, there may be up to 100 leading commercial banks that are evolving into sustainable banking
institutions.
1.5   G-7 Agreements in 1993. Based on the Accelerated Program of Assistance agreed upon in
a meeting of the G-7 Foreign and Finance Ministers on April 14-15, the Board endorsed a lending
program on the order of US$ 9 billion in new commitments during the period FY94-96 as part of
this accelerated program of assistance, including the proposed Housing Project. During the most
recent discussion of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) on May 19, 1994, the Board endorsed
an Intermediate Case lending program of up to US$1.5 billion annually plus some quick disbursing
assistance with the possibility of a significant increase depending on performance. The program
assumes continued, albeit inconsistent, progress on macro-economic stabilization based on a
framework agreed with IMF, in addition to progress in implementing key structural reforms such
as privatization, trade policies, financial sector development and progress in the energy sector, all
of which are essential in laying the foundation for successful stabilization at a later date.
1.6   Request for an Accelerated Housing Project. In response to the Government's request at the
G-7 meeting in April 1993, the Bank agreed to include a Housing Project in its Accelerated Program.
The Bank agreed to accelerate the Project because of (a) the role of housing sector reforms in
supporting the CAS strategy for macro-economic recovery, (b) the advanced state of sector dialogue
with the Government, (c) the impressive policy reforms that the Government had already undertaken,
(d) and the agreement by USAID to provide US$ 10 million in Project preparation and technical
cooperation support. The relationship of the Project to the CAS is presented in Chapter 2, Section
B: Bank's Lending Strategy for Housing.
B.    URBANIZATION
1.7   Russia is a highly urbanized country with 74% (108.8 million) of its 1991 population of
146.8 million living in urban areas. It has the fourth largest urban population in the world; only
China, India and the USA have larger urban populations. During the post-war period, the Soviet
Union experienced the highest rate of urbanization among the nine main UN demographic regions
of the world. Urbanization has continued in recent years. Between 1979 and 1989, Russia's urban
population increased by 14% (14.1 million), while its rural population dropped by 10% (4.3
million). The distribution of urban population differs from that of most market economies. In
Russia there is less concentration in large cities. Only 26% of the urban population live in cities of
over a million people, nearly 40% of whom live in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Population shifts

are likely to increase as the country moves toward a market economy, as restrictions on places of
residence are lifted3, and as migration from other republics of the FSU to Russian cities continues.
C.    OVERVIEW OF THE HOUSING SECTOR
1.8   In general, Russians are dissatisfied with their housing conditions.  Since 1990, the
Government has moved decisively to initiate far-reaching reforms in the housing sector to confront
this dissatisfaction. Political pressure was only part of the reason for this. There were compelling
economic reasons for the Government to make housing reforms a national priority. Housing is a
large part of the economy; it accounts for 20% of national reproducible assets (as compared to 29%
in the US and 43% in France); and large construction organizations employ 15% of the labor force.
Lack of housing severely constrains labor mobility -- preventing enterprise closure and restructuring -
- and inhibits resettlement of soldiers and migrants from other republics. In addition, housing places
an inappropriate economic and managerial burden on enterprises; and its subsidies have a large and
increasing impact on already strained local government budgets.
1.9   The early stages of the transition have been difficult. Budgetary resources for construction
of new housing have contracted sharply, leading to a drop in production. Housing production in
1992 of 28 million m2 of floor space (about 490,000 units) represented only 60% of the 1987 peak.
1.10   During 1993, the fundamental restructuring in the housing sector began to be reflected in
production figures. Housing is now the first sector to stabilize in the Russian economy: while 1993
production is slightly higher than 1992 up from 4.9 million m2 in 1992 to 5.6 million m2 in 1993,
much more important has been the shift in the financial flows through the sector. The recovery is
being led by small-scale private enterprise and individual household production, rather than through
revival of old-style government building programs.
1.11   Residential construction could be one of the counter-cyclical industries to lead Russia out
of recession because inputs are simple, small firms should be able to enter easily without much
capital, construction labor is readily available, and there is major pent-up demand. This demand is
demonstrated by evidence that some new housing sells for up to tree times its production cost and
twenty times average household incomes -- extreme figures of shortage by world standards. The key
bottlenecks that the Government has identified are: (a) government land and construction monopolies
exacerbated by infrastructure shortages; (b) undeveloped financial systems; (c) shortages of
appropriate building materials for low-rise and single family housing; and (d) unclear property rights.
1.12   This Chapter focuses on the issues traditionally considered within the ambit of the housing
sector.  For a more detailed discussion of private sector development and banking sector
restructuring within which housing reform operates, reference should be made to the Staff Appraisal
Reports of the Enterprise Support Project (ESP, Report No. 12953 R) and the Financial Institutions

Moscow) have continued to enforce restrictions.

Development Project (FIDP, Report No. 12707 R). The Housing Project has been developed in
close cooperation with these Projects and reinforces the policy framework that they have developed.
D.    LEGACY OF THE SOCiALIST HOUSING SYSTEM
1.13  Centralized Housing Sector. Russia inherited the most centralized housing sector of any
reforming socialist country. It also had one of the most severe housing shortages of any country at
its level of development, and little tradition of individual ownership of land and houses. Before
1989, the State owned and maintained 84% of the housing stock--compared with 67% in China, 56%
in Poland, 33% in Romania, and 25% in Hungary. In Moscow and St. Petersburg almost 100% of
the stock was owned by the State. Municipalities or state enterprises allocated units to households
from waiting lists that now include over 23% of households. Public construction monopolies
(Kkombinats") built most housing, but had little incentive to economize or improve designs: the
heavy, concrete-panel high-rise apartment units that they typically produced were of low quality,
poorly located, and energy inefficient. Before 1990, these kombinats executed 90% of new
construction in major cities.
1.14  Sources of Finance for Housing.  Three features of the Russian financing system are
important. First, the overwhelming share of housing investment funds has always come from the
State under the central planning process. Until recently, up to 85 % of new housing construction was
financed directly from the budget or by state enterprises. Now these budgets are being drastically
reduced. There is no tradition of banking services for housing finance. Therefore, construction
organizations have had no reason to differentiate between housingfinance i.e. banking loans to be
repaid at competitive market rates and housing subsidies i.e fiscal grants originating from the State.
Second, enterprise funds played no role in financing housing until the enterprise reforms of 1987
which gave more leeway to enterprises to use their investment funds for housing. By 1992,
however, enterprises had become dominant source of housing finance. Third, the direct financial
contribution of the population has always been (and remains) low. The dachas on which many
Russian families lavish so much care and energy are considered seasonal residences. Their year-
around use is also prevented by a lack of utilities, no social services and poor access to work.
1.15  Starting in the mid-80's the Government recognized that funds for housing should be
mobilized increasingly from the population. During the last years of the Soviet regime, the
Government: (a) permitted construction of new individual housing (until 1985, the production of
new individual housing was illegal in cities with over 100,000 residents.); (b) revived a system of
housing cooperatives; and (c) allocated (usually poorly located and unserviced) suburban lots to
families on the waiting list for housing. Housing cooperatives in Russia are designed to mobilize
more funds from the population on waiting lists. However, cooperatives neither select nor supervise
designers and contractors, nor do they handle maintenance in their own buildings. Raising the
population's share of funding for housing investment and maintenance is a priority objective for the
Government and is one of the key features of its 1993 Housing Reform Program (see para. 1.25-
1.30).
1.16   Monogolies in the Buildin2 Industry. Under the administrative-command system, state
monopoly over financing, reinforced by state monopolies over land and over access to building
materials, led to a highly monopolistic construction industry in every urban region. To worsen



CHAPTER 1                                                                          5
matters, state monopoly over local production became a managerial goal in the early 1980's under
the concept of "one client, one designer, one builder" across the 150 largest cities.
1.17  Types of Housing. The housing product that resulted from construction under state monopoly
consists primarily of high-rise apartment blocks of heavy, reinforced-concrete large panels. This
assembly line housing technology is not liked by most occupants. It is low quality and energy
inefficient, yet it constitutes now over 60% of the national housing stock. Alternative technologies,
designs, skills, and materials have been neglected. The rate of innovation has been extremely low
in Russia and was often blocked by building regulations. The incentive structure motivating
construction organizations has been based on square meters produced regardless of quality or
customer satisfaction. Deferred maintenance is an endemic feature of the system. Once a building
has been delivered to its intended owner, repair and rehabilitation of the existing stock are usually
neglected, in part because of poor design, frequently poor construction and finishings.
1.18 Limited Real Propertv Rights. Certain aspects of housing policy in Russia have shown a
remarkable amount of continuity over the past several hundred years. In particular, Russia has never
had a strongly developed notion of individual land ownership. The second decree passed by the new
revolutionary government in October 1917 abolished all private ownership of land. Before the year
1917 was over, all large residential buildings in cities had been nationalized. Also, Russia has long
limited freedom of movement and settlement with institutions ranging from serfdom in medieval
times to the "propiska" residency permit system of the Communist Era. At the time of the 1917
Revolution, Russia was the least urbanized and most backward European economy with a level of
urbanized population of only 16%. Today Russia's urbanization is essentially completed and its
system of cities has developed without any reference to private individual property, market
mechanisms, or private financing -- and without the institutions associated with them. The legal
continuity of real estate property rights through various rural and urban uses is yet to be developed
in Russia.
1.19  Weak Local Governments. Russia is the largest country in the world with one of the most
diverse geographic and cultural regions. The success of its housing policy will rest on local
governments provided with a sound national policy framework, appropriate autonomy, and adequate
resources.   With the dominance of central-level and sectoral planning over local and spatial
planning, cities always had inadequate resources and limited power to control their own decisions.
Oblast-level governments and line ministries usually prevailed over local preferences and better
knowledge of local conditions.
E.    CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE HOUSING SECTOR
1.20  Restructured Financial Flow. Rapid changes are restructuring the flow of funds for housing.
There are four main types of changes: (a) the reduction of the share of central budget financing in
state funding; (b) the sharp contraction in overall state funding of new production; (c) the large cuts
in subsidies to housing maintenance and the rising burdens of local governments; and (d) the
emergence of (state or private) employers as the dominant source of financing for new housing. This
new dominant role of employers is reinforced by the sharp fall in real household incomes and the
deteriorating household income distribution.

1.21   Reduced Funding and Inflation. Changes in the sources of funds coincide with a major
contraction of the flow of funds for housing investmnent, and maintenance as well.  Due to
preferential treatment by the Central Plan, the construction of new housing had been increasing in
the late 1980's when many other types of investment were being reduced. However, by any
measure, the residential building industry in Russia is in crisis today. (a) In terms of total housing
stock, in 1990, floor area per person in Moscow was 17.8 m2 and in Russia it was 16.4 m2,
compared with typical floor areas per person in developed Western countries of 30 to 45 m2. (b)
As viewed through the production of new housing, production of new dwellings declined at an
accelerating pace between 1990 and 1992, dropping from 61.7 million m2 in 1990 to 28 million m2
in 1992, before stabilizing in 1993. This level of new output barely matches the traditional volume
of removals from the existing stock of dilapidated units, which is low by international standards.
(c) Construction costs have experienced considerable increases with price liberalization partly because
the monopolistic production and distribution of materials and supplies has remained in place.
Inflation in construction and building material costs was extremely severe in 1992 and 1993; for
example, the cost per square meter for large-panel buildings rose from 900 at the beginning of 1992
to more than 800,000 roubles in July of 1994. (d) Construction delays are endemic because of
interruptions in flows of state financing and lack of incentives for kombinats to start new projects
rather than finish existing works.
1.22  Housing Demand and Affordability. Along with contraction of traditional mechanisms for
housing supply, there have been major shifts in the structure of housing demand. Transforming a
predominantly state-financed housing system to a housing market where households pay full price
for their housing is a difficult transition at best. Low wages constrain sales of new units to
individuals, leaving diminished opportunity for savings and development of housing finance systems.
Nevertheless, housing privatization offers a major remedy. Rapid and ongoing housing privatization
is putting an asset in the hands of many households. This asset can both better withstand inflation
and be traded if and when needed. However, pending wage reforms and economic recovery, private
demand by new households will remain constrained and enterprises that can afford it will continue
to offer housing to their employees.
1.23  The Restructuring Challenze. The Russian housing system is now in a state of flux. So far,
the traditional mechanisms of central planning have been breaking down faster than market
mechanisms have been emerging. A whole society has to learn and adopt the conditions of a
demand-driven housing market. High inflation, rapidly-shifting relative prices, and the contraction
of output in the sector do not facilitate the transition to markets. This transition has two main
dimnensions: restructuring of the existing stock, and encouraging the emergence of a competitive,
market-based production of new housing. Given the economic conditions prevailing in Russia,
continuing rapid and voluntary privatization of the housing stock is a high priority. For the
production of new housing, the transition to markets has many legal and institutional requirements.
In summary, this means moving from needs-based, state-financed housing construction to demand-
based, private financing of real estate development.
1.24   The New Housing Market, Despite these problems, 1993 will be remembered as the year
in which the housing market took off. Sufficient housing already has been privatized to create an
active secondary market. New demand by final users is starting to change the type of building
technology being used. New consumers want greater control over quality, design, and prices. These



CHAPE 1                 -                                                          7
changes have started a shift away from the large panel, high-rise buildings and towards more
attractive low-rise buildings. Consumer demand should also lead to a better distribution in housing
unit prices, more in line with the purchasing power of the population. Diversified financing will
encourage diversified technologies and materials for low-rise and individual housing construction.
The share of large-panel industrial housing in total output is expected by the Ministry of
Construction (Minstroi) to fall from 52% in 1991, to 42% in 1992, to a combined share of large-
panel industrial and related technologies of approximately 20% by 1995. One effect of the 1992
price liberalization has been to reveal clearly that this capital and energy intensive housing
technology delivers a mediocre and expensive product. Detailed surveys of the housing market were
conducted in participating cities for the project. A brief overview of the major recent developments
in the housing market that were recorded by these surveys are presented below (See Annex 1.4).
a.    Privatization and Development of Secondary Housing Market. The year
1993 saw a major breakthrough in the development of the Russian
housing market. This surge in housing privatization sparked a rapid growth
of the secondary housing market. A substantial increase in the volume of real
estate transactions, including sales and exchanges, was recorded in all major
urban centers. According to the survey estimates, the number of
housing units that were for sale in 1993 equalled on the average 12% of all
privately-owned housing stock in the cities studied.
b.    Privatization and its Impact on Housing Prices. As demonstrated in the surveys
the substantial growth in the number of tradeable units has had a moderating
impact on housing prices.  Prices remained at the same level in real terms
throughout most of 1993, though they jumped by about 20%-30% in the first
quarter of 1994.  Prices also reflected increased differentiation according to
quality and location of dwelling units.
c.    Macroeconomic Impacts. Early signs of a positive macro-economic impact of the
evolving housing market were detected, for example in increased residential mobility;
the surveys documented an average of 3. 1 % in residential mobility across the five
cities. The development of a competitive secondary housing market seems to have
absorbed some of the inflationary demand pressure in the housing sector and in the
economy as a whole.
d.    Availability of Market Information. Despite alleged difficulties in obtaining adequate
market data about real estate transactions, the surveys documented the ability of
buyers to obtain good market knowledge.  Major progress has been made in
developing new sources of market information and in enhancing existing ones. The
creation of real estate market data networks and the increasing variety and
sophistication of real estate publications and services are among important signs of
this progress.
e.    Decline in Housing Construction.  In 1993/94 the volume of new housing
construction declined, mainly due to the reduction of subsidies and finance from the
public sector. Privately financed construction cannot yet compensate for the drop in



8                                                                            CHAPTER 1
public construction. The surveys emphasized five factors that currently hamper
private construction: (i) lack of construction finance; (ii) competition from the
secondary housing market; (iii) high construction costs due to excessive local
government fees; (iv) a complex and uncertain regulatory environment; and (v) an
unreliable system of title registration.
f.    Lack of Construction Finance. There are four principal sources of construction
finance (listed in order of importance): (a) advances from legal entities, such as
enterprises; (b) developers' equity and/or installmnent payments from future buyers;
(c) public housing subsidies from local governments and subsidized enterprises; and
(d) construction loans from commercial banks.
g.    Availability of Land to Private Developers. Land distributed earlier to enterprises
for employee housing has become an important source of building sites for
developers.  As many of these enterprises are unable to develop these sites
themselves due to a shortage of funds, they are passing on the development rights to
private developers. Some developers also have access to municipal land. The
payment for development rights on municipal land is often a proportion of the
completed units (usually 10-50%), and/or in the form of extra infrastructure built at
the developer's expense.
F.    RuSSIAN GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE HOUSING CHALLENGE
1.25  The Process of Housing Sector Reforn. By initiating far-reaching reforms in housing policy,
the Russian Government has made significant progress in confronting the immediate need to
restructure the housing sector. In fact, the Government regards housing reforms as one of its key
structural reform priorities and major areas of success. The Bank has contributed to this evolving
policy framework through the Technical Cooperation Project, the Housing Sector Report and
preparation of this Project. Technical cooperation has also been provided by USAID, and bilateral
help from Canada, Finland, France, Gernany, the Netherlands and others. Thus far reforms have
introduced key concepts such as housing and limited land privatization at the federal level. However,
the Government stresses that further developments in basic legal rules, implementing regulations, and
administrative and judicial institutions at the federal and local levels are needed to create a fully
functional urban legal system. The transition from a system of well-established socialist rights to
a market-oriented housing system is neither a simple nor linear process.
1.26  Recognition of Housing as Macro-economic Priority.  The Government's June 1992
"Program for Stepping Up Economic Reform" and the August 1992 Decision 602 placed housing
as one of Russia's top five structural reform priorities. In December 1992, the Parliament passed
the "Law of the Russian Federation on the Basic Principles of Federal Housing Polizy," intended by
the Government to be a "Housing Bill of Rights" that provides the legal foundation for a market
economy in housing, including introducing the concept of real estate, broadening housing
privatization, allowing condominiums and private housing maintenance, and establishing the principle
that rents will be increased to cover costs. In June 1993, the Government approved the State
Targeted Program "Housing," (Council of Ministers Resolution 595), which includes (a) creating a
market-oriented legal framework; (b) decentralizing housing policy; (c) increasing private housing



CHAPTER I               _                                                            9
construction; (d) accelerating housing privatization; (e) demonopolizing housing construction and
maintenance; (f) developing private housing finance and reducing subsidies; (g) encouraging new
construction technologies; and (h) reorganizing Government ministries to support the private sector.
The Program is broadly consistent with World Bank housing policies.
1.27  Housing Privatization. The Law on Privatization of Housing was passed in July 1991. It
establishes the right of a registered tenant occupying a state unit to become its owner with fully
guaranteed property rights. The December 1992 amendments to the Federal Privatization Law were
designed to speed up privatization. In 1991, about 1% of the public stock was privatized. By the
end of 1992, according to the State Commnittee on Statistics (Goskomstat), 2.55 million apartments
were privatized, 10.2% of the total publicly-owned housing stock. The rate of privatization
increased in 1993; about 25% of housing units state units nationwide by the end of 1993 have now
been privatized and 55% of the total housing stock is in private hands.
1.28  Land Privatization. The privatization of land has been a highly debated issue in the Russian
Federation. A USSR law on private property passed in March 1990 formally ended the principle
of state monopoly on ownership of land. Yet this law had many flaws for both agricultural and
urban economies. In December 1992, the Parliament passed two amendments to the previous
Constitution that are fundamental to housing reform. The Amendment to Article 12, Part 3 removed
the restriction on the right to freely possess, use and dispose of land plots owned by individuals, but
only if the land remains in residential use. An amendment to Article 58 changed the Government's
obligation to provide state housing to households. A "Law on the Right of Citizens to Acquire As
Private Property and to Sell, Land, Dachas, and Individual Housing Units" (December 23, 1992)
also introduced private property of land in urban and rural areas. The 1992 "Law on Pledge"
establishes the concept of mortgage, but does not improve the legal procedures to enforce a lien,
which remains inadequate.
1.29  A Presidential Decree primarily aimed at agricultural land and entitled "On the Regulation
of Land and the Development of Agrarian Reforms" was published on October 28, 1993. This
decree allows all landowners, whether corporate or individual, to dispose of land at their own
discretion through sale or purchase, bequest, gift, as mortgage collateral, wholly or in part, and in
this respect represents a step toward the privatization of land in all its uses. In addition to changing
the perspective on land privatization, the decree has also the direct benefit of facilitating land use
conversion by permitting local authorities to transfer the use of land from agricultural to commercial
use. However, even this decree does not clearly and unequivocally establish the right of corporate
entities to own land, or the right of individuals to own urban land for purposes other than housing
and gardening. It is also important to note that this decree is temporary and will only be in force
until the new Parliament passes more permanent legislation which might differ in content.
1.30  The new Russian Constitution approved on December 12, 1993 marks a historical turning
point by clearly and broadly recognizing the right to private ownership of land. Its impact on
improving land use and supporting the emergence of urban land markets, rural land markets, and
rural-urban land conversion will remain to be seen over time as implementing regulations are put in
place at the local level, and as local governments gain experience in facilitating market transactions
in land.

G.    HOUSING SECTOR REFORM ISSUES
1.31   Housing reform is not an event, it is a process. There is widespread public support to break
away from the administrative-command system which has lead to such unsatisfactory housing
conditions. However, the housing stock of Russia represents a major share of national wealth. To
move from today's system to a market-based system where housing will be predominantly private,
significant well-coordinated changes are necessary. These changes are necessary on both the demand
and supply sides, at both the federal and local government levels, and in the existing stock and new
production. This section excerpts from the detailed reform strategy discussed in the Executive
Summary of the Green Cover Housing Sector report and presented in Annex 2. 1, a strategy that the
Government has been implementing through its State Targeted Program.
1.32  Given the Russian situation, the comprehensive reform  strategy discussed with the
Government addresses ten key areas where the Government has an important role in facilitating the
emergence of housing markets and regulating them soundly:
a.    Supply-Side Reforms, including (1) building industry restructuring and privatization;
(2) land use and urban regulation; and (3) municipal finance and residential
infrastructure provision.
b.    Demand-Side Reforms, including (4) the basic framework of property rights; (5)
housing privatization from state to individual ownership; (6) rent reforms and
housing allowances; (7) related issues of maintenance and management of public
housing; (8) housing finance systems; and (9) fiscal reforms including taxes and
subsidies.
c.    Institutional Reforms, including (10) new institutions at the central and local levels
able to manage private housing markets.
1.33  In every one of these areas the Government has already taken major actions; considerable
experimentation to find solutions suited to local conditions is taking place at the city level. A short-
term action program to support implementation of Government reform in housing should have four
main thrusts described below.
a.    New  Construction.  Improve resource mobilization to fuiance new  housing
construction: (a) allow unrestricted private ownership of land in cities in order to
reclaim the much needed real estate wealth lost under industrial "fallow land",
(b) develop the legal framework for lending to the housing sector (mortgage law,
foreclosure rules); and (c) develop workable transitional financing to make feasible
the construction and sale of new housing for households below the very highest
income brackets.
b.    Transformation of the Building Materials Industry. Use on-going and new building
projects to support the rapid privatization and restructuring of the building and



CHAPTER 1                _                                                              11
building materials industries and prevent avoidable losses in valuable skills following
the sharp output contraction in the sector.
c.    Housing Privatization. Encourage continued rapid and voluntary privatization of the
state housing stock under appropriate regulations. Pass a sound condominium law
to stabilize operating conditions after privatization.
d.    Restructuring of Implicit Subsidies. Downsize and restructure subsidies in the rental
sector through the creation of autonomous public maintenance companies, rent
reform, and a social safety net clearly targeted on the most vulnerable groups.
1.34   These four reform objectives are consistent with the framework of the CAS, the ESP, and
the FIDP. The Government notes that it has recently taken extensive steps in areas (c) housing
privatization and (d) restructuring implicit subsidies.  For example, in September 1992, the
Government issued an important decree establishing a timetable for raising rents in the social housing
sector and creating a housing allowance program that would change subsidies from the supply side
to the demand side, by targeting poor households directly. Similarly, the Government recently issued
a decree that further separates subsidies from the financial system by eliminating interest rate
subsidies. Both these reforms were strongly supported by the Bank because they make the budgetary
costs of the housing sector more explicit, and easier to target needy households without damaging
the banking system. The Government has requested continued policy dialogue with the Bank in these
areas, but does not want the first Bank lending in the sector to focus on the social housing area.
1.35  Instead, the Government has requested that the Bank's first Housing Project focus on
experimental approaches to creating housing markets and private property rights through (a) the
production of new housing and (b) the restructuring of the building materials industry. The
Government recognizes that a revival of the housing sector based on reforms can contribute both to
economic recovery and to modernization of the sector itself. The Government has stressed its
objective to demonstrate local imnplementation of market mechanisms in projects that (a) implement
federal reforms on the ground, (b) can achieve full financial cost recovery, and (c) advance the
reform dialogue by treating housing as an important economic sector. The proposed Project
addresses these reform and investment objectives directly through a flexible mix of investments,
policy dialogue, technical cooperation, training, and studies.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
IL. BANK LENDING EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGY
A.    BANK EXPERIENCE
2.1   The Housing Project will be among the Bank's first investment operations in Russia. Project
design incorporates the experience of other Bank projects in Russia such as the Rehabilitation Project
(WB Loan No. L3513) and the First Oil Rehabilitation Project (WB Loan No. L3623); and uses
lessons from recent housing projects in other economies in transition, including Albania, Algeria,
Armenia, China, and Poland. In addition, the Project can draw on the Bank's broad experience
with urban sector lending .
2.2    Russia Loans. The lessons learned from the First Oil Rehabilitation Loan and from other
on-going or pending loans to Russia include: (a) the challenge of identifying a consistent counterpart
team with sufficient authority to move the Project forward; (b) the difficulty of coordinating among
interested parties (ministries, agencies, and levels of government); (c) the importance of early
detailed attention to procurement, on-lending, and other implementation issues; (d) the importance
of including local consultants and institutes in project preparation and implementation, giving early
attention to (i) the Government's procedures for loan signing and effectiveness after Board approval
and (ii) setting up PIUs early in the Project with experienced advisers to facilitate procurement.
These issues were discussed  in Moscow in September 1994 at the first Country Portfolio
Performance Review to discuss countrywide implementation issues.
2.3    Housing Loans. Recent Bank housing loans in reforming socialist countries suggest a range
of lessons. The Poland Housing Project (Loan No. 3499), which became effective on May 6, 1993,
focused on housing finance -- which is premature in Russia. The Poland Project has shown that:
(a) establishing apex or banking mechanisms is difficult in an unstable macro-economic climate; (b)
introducing new instruments for housing and construction finance is a complex undertaking; (c) local
Project Units can be helpful in introducing new lending mechanisms and in mobilizing new reform
constituencies; (d) maintaining flexibility throughout project preparation and implementation is
important in an environment of changing economic and development priorities; and (e) it is important
to have a strong counterpart to speak for the Project in executive and legislative debates. The
Armenia Earthquake Reconstruction Project (IDA Credit No. 2562-AM), signed on February 18,
1994, shows the importance of having the Bank take an activist role in project preparation in
countries that are not accustomed to market mechanisms and Bank procedures. It also shows that
providing seminars on procurement to potential local contractors can motivate increasingly responsive
local bids. As a group, these projects show the importance of broadening the counterpart beyond
Ministries of Construction to include reform constituencies such as the Ministries of Finance and
Economy, State Land Committees and other ministries and levels of government.
2.4   Policy and OED Work. Finally, the Bank has carried out extensive policy and evaluation
work in the urban sector around the world. In particular, the recent Urban and Housing Policy



14                                                                             CHAPTER 2
Papers provided the sectoral framework on which policy and lending dialogue in Russia has been
based. OED evaluation work on the urban and water sectors stresses that cost recovery is important
but unlikely to be achieved unless careful attention is given to the sustainability of key sectoral
institutions. It also points out that city-wide regulatory reforms are crucial so that land development
projects do not become isolated enclaves.
B.    BANK'S LENDING STRATEGY FOR TnHE HOUSING SECTOR
2.5    Obiectives of CAS. The priority objectives for the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy are
to (a) support the development of a market oriented economy based on private sector initiatives; (b)
encourage redirection of public sector involvement in the economy toward the establishment of open
and competitive markets and the provision of physical, social, legal, and institutional infrastructure
not normally provided through the private sector; (c) establish the Bank as a trusted and reliable
development partner through financing of high priority public sector investments and policy advice
on key economic and sectoral issues. The CAS for Russia recognizes the need to provide assistance
to certain key sectors such as infrastructure, housing, and energy, which will have a direct and
fundamental impact on the success of macroeconomic reform. The CAS places high priority on
preventing further collapse of the infrastructure base and expanding the legal and institutional
framework for private sector activities.
2.6    Relationship of Housing Project to CAS. The Government's housing sector reform has been
a major success over the last three years and should be sustained and deepened by assisting its
practical implementation at the local level through demonstration projects. The proposed Housing
Project directly supports the CAS goals by: (a) financing an investment project in an area where
reforms have been rapidly achieved; (b) supporting Government initiatives to re-conceptualize
housing as a key economic sector, realign the sector along market lines, and to rationalize and reduce
subsidies to the sector; (c) implementing federal housing reforms at local levels; (d) demonstrating
practical ways of having markets produce housing; (e) mobilizing foreign direct investment; (f)
improving environmental and energy approaches in the sector; and (f) institutionalizing new
regulatory and administrative procedures on land privatization, use, and registration in participating
cities.
2.7    Bank support. The Bank's involvement in Russia to date consists of a mix of rehabilitation,
technical assistance, and investment operations.  The portfolio is expanding rapidly.  As of
December 30, 1994 the Board had approved 12 loans for Russia totalling US$ 3.04 billion with
cumulative disbursements of  US$ 664.4 million.  In addition, the Bank has undertaken a
comprehensive Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) that addressed key sectors for reform,
including housing, municipal finance, and intergovernmental fiscal relations. The TCP in Housing
was initiated in December 1991, and formed the basis of successful policy dialogue in the sector.
The findings and recommendations in housing were reflected in the work program of the
Government, and emerged over the past two years through sector laws, decrees, and regulations.
2.8   Strategy for Future Operations. A comprehensive reform strategy for the housing sector in
Russia has been presented in the Green Cover Housing Sector Report. (A detailed matrix of
recommendations is presented in Annex 2.1) The guidance for future projects in the sector will be



CHAFrER 2                                                                                 15
provided by the Government's Housing Policy, the sector reform strategy, the CAS, and the
empirical capital created during the preparation and implementation of the present project.
2.9    The Government of Russia, with assistance from the Bank and bilateral donors, has instituted
an impressive array of sectoral reforms and programs in a very short time, such as (a) allocation of
housing stock by price mechanism, (b) privatization of housing maintenance, (c) rent reform,
(d) targeting housing allowances to low-income households, with equity among similarly situated
households, (e) stimulation of the private construction industry,  (f) restructuring of building
materials industry, and (g) mortgage finance. In general these reforms support the development of
market economy, and are consistent with the CAS, and should be supported by future sector
operations. The dynamic and unstable nature of the economic and political situation in the country
makes the determination of an optimal sequence of operations somewhat difficult. The swiftly
changing political and regulatory environment will necessitate flexible responses through a range of
operations in the sector, as opportunities present themselves.
2.10   Investment Operations Will Leverage Policy and Institutional Reform. As is the experience
in the present Project, the Bank's future operations will require the institution of a number of
enabling regulations to ensure the success of these interventions.  Although the Government of
Russia has implemented an impressive list of regulations in a short time at the federal level, these
new regulations need to be transferred and reinforced at the local level, while a host of new
regulations still remain to be established. As in the present project, future investment projects in the
sector can provide the leverage to implement the critical policy and institutional reforms necessary
for housing sector reform as outlined in the sector strategy, while addressing the immediate
operational problems in the sector.
2.11   Interventions in the Housing Sector will be Multi-sectoral in Nature. Reform in the sector
will be closely related to the improvement in other institutions and sectors of the economy. For
instance the success of financial sector reform will be crucial to the development of housing finance,
construction finance and the private housing market. Increasing the efficiency of the energy sector
will have an immediate positive impact on the housing sector. In Russia where land, utilities and
a large proportion of the housing stock is still under public ownership, efficient management of
municipal finance will be critical to provision of public services such as heat, water, electricity and
others. Due to such strong correlation with other sectors, operations in housing sectors must by
necessity address issues that are multi-sectoral.
2.12   Bank's First Russia Housing Project. The proposed Housing Project is envisioned as the first
in a series of projects over the next 5-10 years that will support the creation of housing markets.
The Project is designed to respond in a timely manner to Government's housing reform actions, and
the sector reform strategy, and the CAS. The Government has requested that the first Project
demonstrate tangible benefits of moving to markets, while future projects should address long-term
housing finance, urban infrastructure, and social safety net issues when macroeconomic conditions
permit. Therefore, the Bank's strategy for the first Project is to demonstrate practical market
approaches to stimulating housing production in five cities that are willing to implement fundamental
federal reforms. The Project would implement the Government's reforms by financing sub-projects
that (a) break up a government monopoly by rapidly introducing government owned land into the
market, (b) stimulate private investment in new housing construction in cities willing to implement



16                                                                                  CHAfPER 2
sector reforms, and (c) encourage the establishment and growth of private builders and building
materials producers.  Simultaneously -- following the Bank's housing sector analysis and the
Government's request -- the Project would undertake demonstration efforts to help alleviate supply-
side bottlenecks by (a) clarifying the practical framework of property rights at the local level, (b)
creating an enabling framework for implementation of market oriented land use and urban
regulations, (c) stimulating private investment in housing construction, and (d) catalyzing the private
construction industry.
2.13   Future Operations in the Sector.  Future sector operations could include projects in the
following areas:
a.     Enterprise Housing.  The Soviet government increasingly relied on enterprises to
provide housing and social services to the local population. By 1992. enterprises were
responsible for financing and managing about 40 percent of the entire housing stock in the
country. Following privatization of enterprises, ownership of housing technically passes to
cities, but enterprises generally have been required to retain responsibility for maintenance.
The associated management and financial burden on enterprises has emerged as a significant
impediment to restructuring. Because often only 20-40 percent of the tenants of buildings
work for the enterprise that maintain it, enterprise housing has also begun to suffer from a
stewardship limbo that has led recently to a rapid decline in the quality of maintenance. The
size of the enterprise housing stock, as well as its effect on enterprise restructuring, argue
for an early intervention to facilitate enterprise housing divestiture.
At the request of the Government, the Bank is currently identifying a project that
would support the divestiture process in several cities. The project would finance energy
efficiency and other investments designed to reduce the cost of maintenance, which is rising
rapidly as utility tariffs are adjusted to reflect world energy prices. The project would
leverage a number of policy reforms at the federal level, including passage of the (a) Housing
Code, and (b) Condominium Law and Model Charter. At the local level, the project would
stimulate higher cost recovery  (accompanied  by  targeted  allowances), require the
development of private maintenance organizations, and encourage the formation of
condominiums.
b.     Infrastructure Development. The provision of heat, water, electricity and other basic
services will remain an important function of the local governments in Russia. The
inefficiency of these utilities, however, places an enormous financial burden on the
municipalities, while reducing the availability and quality of services provided to the
households.  Projects designed to address these deficiencies through infrastructure and
institutional development will have a high economic rate of return for the economy and a
high financial rate of return to the municipalities and households, and contribute directly to
the sustainability of housing sector reforms.' One such project (Gas Distribution) has been

basis. But a broader project dealing with residential infrastructure and utility rationalization will have sector wide
benefits listed above.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                  17
prepared and is ready for negotiations. Two additional local infrastructure projects (District
Heat and Water and Sewerage) are in the lending program.
The proposed interventions would (i) improve efficiency and reduce the cost to
municipalities for providing the services and subsidies, (ii) improve technical and financial
capabilities of the utilities, (iii) improve the quality of services and their availability to
households, (iv) as the government succeeds in its rent reform and utility costs are
transferred to the households, such an operation would directly benefit the households by
increasing their affordability of improved services, (v) improve billing and cost recovery
from individual households, (vi) develop and restructure institutions involved in provision of
basic services, and (vi) would directly result in improvement of environmental condition of
the cities.
Such operations would provide leverage for supporting and instituting reforms such
as (a) rent reforms and the housing allowances program, (b) privatization of housing
maintenance, (c) rationalization of local government finance, (d) reform of building standards
and regulations, and (e) initiate the institutional reforms for privatization of utilities.
c.    Inner City Rehabilitation.  Central cores of many cities have great economic,
historical, and cultural significance. Much of the housing stock is located in the city centers.
Inner city housing is typically in poor condition with inadequate infrastructure.  The
infrastructure serving the inner cores is typically old and has deteriorated over time. Projects
targeted towards addressing inner city housing, infrastructure and environmental problems
would provide benefits similar to those of infrastructure development. In addition, such an
operation will have benefits such as (a) development of the economic base of the cities, (b)
increase in commercial space, (c) improvement of living standards of existing families, and
(d) stimulation of the private real estate development industry. Such a project will be
feasible in an environment of improved efficiency of the housing market and financial
mechanisms. To the extent involuntary resettlement of households is an issue, it can be taken
care of within appropriate guidelines provided by the existing regulatory framework.
The institutional and regulatory reforms that may be leveraged by such an initiative
will be (a) rationalization of municipal finance, (b) clarification of property rights, including
commercial property rights, (c) development of institutional innovations of infrastructure
financing, such as public private partnerships, and (d) development of the basis for property
taxation in the cities.
d.     Housing Finance. Although the Government has instituted a number of reforms to
make housing finance available to households, given the inflationary environment, larger
scale housing finance initiatives are premature.  Nonetheless, the timely introduction of
housing finance instruments will be critical to the development of the private housing sector
and therefore, the economy at large. When the economy has stabilized and inflation has
declined, the Bank should provide assistance to the government in initiating a sustainable
housing finance system. The present Project has developed a TOR for conducting a study
on a future Housing Finance Initiative.

C.    PROJECT PREPARATION
2.14   Starting in May 1993, the Bank and the Government moved rapidly to identify and prepare
the Project. Funding of US$10 million from USAID has made this intensive preparation possible.
These funds include: (a) a US$2 million trust fund for Project preparation administered by the Bank;
(b) additional funds of US$1.5 million for Project preparation that USAID administers in accordance
with scopes of work drafted by Bank missions; and (c) US$6.5 million for Project related capacity
building and technical cooperation. The USAID preparation funds have financed consultants, studies,
travel, other expenses, and a Project Review Unit (PRU) in Moscow. The Project Review Unit is
an extension of the Bank's operations division. During Project preparation, the PRU has a staff of
five full time expatriate consultants (two urban planners, a financial analyst, a banking specialist and
a building materials industry specialist) and several Russian professionals and support staff. Offices
and furnishings have been provided by Minstroi, and equipment purchased under the AID preparation
funds. The PRU has permitted a continuous Bank presence in Russia to discuss and review Project
preparation with Central and local Government officials, commercial banks, Russian enterprises and
other donors in Russia. The number of expatriate staff in the PRU has decreased recently, as the
PRU begins the transition to Project implementation. The funds provided by USAID for capacity
building technical cooperation has been used thus far to sponsor a series of seminars on land use
models, title registration, building codes and permits, construction finance, and demand analyses.
In addition to USAID's help, other donors have provided generous assistance. Canada is financing
a major training exercise in construction management and techniques in Tver; the Government of
Netherlands is sponsoring a related pilot project in Tver; Finland is implementing a restructuring
study of a large construction organization in St. Petersburg and has agreed to sponsor a major Bank
conference on housing in Russia; and France has financed the drafting of Operating Manuals for the
lines of credit. Five major missions and several smaller missions reviewed progress in preparation
and appraised the Project.  In addition, separate studies have been conducted on site layouts,
infrastructure engineering, housing demand, and environmental analyses.
2.15   Policy Dialogue.  Since the beginning of the Technical Cooperation Project in Housing
Reform and Privatization in 1991, there has been a close, productive policy dialogue between the
Government and the Bank. The strength of this dialogue was illustrated by the Government's
informal endorsement of the draft sector report and a request from the First Deputy Prime Minister
in October 1993 that the Bank provide an Action Plan on priority decrees to create land and housing
markets. A preparation mission in October, together with the Resident Mission, also produced an
Action Plan on Commercial Real Estate, in response to the Government's request. During April
1994, a mission jointly sponsored by the Bank's Legal, Agricultural, and Housing teams for Russia
produced a draft law on land registration, following the Government's request. Presently, Bank
consultants are helping the Government review drafts of the Land, Housing, and Urban Planning
Codes, the Mortgage Law, and related decrees and regulations.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
111. THE PROJECT
A.   PROJECT OBECTIVES
3.1   Main Goal of the Project. The main goal of the Project is to support the Government's
efforts to develop housing markets with choice for consumers and competition among private
suppliers. The Project will implement national policies in receptive cities, demonstrate practical
ways that markets can produce housing and generate employment, and institutionalize the new
principles and practices employed during Project preparation and implementation.
3.2   Project Objectives.  The Project objectives are associated with each of the Project
Components and Sub-components. The principal objectives are:
a.    Housing Market DeveloDment
Land Development Sub-Comnponent. To break up the present Government monopoly on
supply of land by assisting selected municipal governments in auctioning sites suitable for
residential development.
Construction Finance Line of Credit. To demonstrate that the private sector can produce
housing that is more efficient and appealing than that provided by the "Kombinats". To this
end this Sub-component would encourage the banking community to increase the volume of
medium-term lending for private sector housing construction.
b.    Transformation of the Building Materials Industry
Equity Matching Line of Credit. To encourage the establishment of industries to produce
modern and more efficient building materials.
c.    Technical Cooperation
Technical cooperation would be designed to implement national regulatory reforms at the
local level and reinforce each of the components by instituting principles and procedures
necessary to implement the Project.



22                                                                             CHAPrER 3
3.3    Government Objectives. These objectives respond to the Government's request that the first
sector loan:
a.    Encourage private property for housing by:
1.    Breaking up government land monopolies;
2.    Building housing for private ownership;
3.    Clarifying the practical framework of property rights at the local level; and
4.    Selecting cities willing to implement sector reform.
b.    Increase the stock and reduce the cost of housing by:
I.    Encouraging private builders;
2.    Initiating  competitive  bidding  for land, infrastructure  and  housing
construction; and
3.    Facilitating the development of new types and styles of housing and building
materials.
c.    Promote efficiency and preserve employment in the construction industry by:
1.    Stimulating private investment in housing construction and rehabilitation;
2.    Creating  market mechanisms to  finance sub-projects for residential
infrastructure, construction and building materials enterprises; and
3.    Promoting investment, technology transfer, and efficient management in the
building materials industry.
3.4    Link to Policy Dialogue.  The Project would not include national policy conditionality
because adequate legislative actions have been taken in the last few years to promote reforms.
Instead, the Project is designed to implement reforms at the local level that the national Government
has already established as its policy.
3.5   Local reforms will be concentrated on three areas that facilitate private sector construction
for sale on the housing market: (a) property rights developmnent -- including land and property title
registration (b) urban regulatory reforms -- such as land privatization; land allocation through
competitive procedures; and urban planning, building, environmental, and permitting procedures;
and (c) pro-competition policies for the building industry -- including public procurement rules and
construction management.
3.6    Each Participating City, listed in paragraph 3.11 below, has adopted a Regulatory
Action Plan (RAP) for its implementation (para 7.1 .a.2). Because of the remaining gaps in legal
and institutional frameworks that are necessary to address overall housing sector development, the
Project will concentrate on narrow but transitional issues, such as increasing the land available in
private real estate market through auctions. An overview of the RAPs and a summary RAP is
included in Annex 3.3. The following elements of the RAP's will be conditions of effectiveness
for Loan Agreements between the Government of Russia and Participating Cities: a) the city
has adopted a regulation on registration of title, including transactions in land and real estate,



CHAPER 3                                                                              23
acceptable to the Bank; and b) the city has adopted procedures, acceptable to the Bank, on
auction and competitive tender for land on project sites being disposed of by the city (para
7.1c2). Progress in implementation of RAP's will be a basis for reallocating loan proceeds among
cities during annual reviews.
B.    OVERVIEW OF PROJECT COMPONENTS
3.7   The proposed Housing Project consists of three components -- (a) Housing Market
Development, with two Sub-components -- Land Development and Construction Finance Line of
Credit; (b) Transformation of the Building Materials Industry -- through an Equity Matching Line
of Credit; and (c) Technical Cooperation. The Project will support demonstration sub-projects to
rapidly introduce land into the private real estate market, build housing and infrastructure, and to
develop new enterprises for building products. The Project would also support preparation of future
housing projects, including a study on housing finance alternatives.
3.8   Flexible Sub-Project Pipeline. During the period of project implementation, it is important
that the Government have the flexibility to emphasize different types of sub-projects drawn from a
larger menu of allowable sub-project types in order to meet the changing needs of housing market
development. Annual project reviews will be held in order to program investments, technical
cooperation and reforms for the following year among sub-project types. The initial allocation of
the US$758.7 million estimated Project cost among the components is proposed as follows:

C.   HOUSING MARKET DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
3.10 Overview. This component would develop US$517 million of sub-projects to
increase the supply of residential land and new housing. Sub-components would include: (a) Land
DeveloDment -- financing of public infrastructure for land auctioned, or to be auctioned, to private
developers, and (b) Construction Finance -- commercial bank financing to private developers of new
housing and (c) Institutional Development -- creation of enabling frameworks for implementation at
city levels.
3.11   Participating Cities. During May 1993, the Bank and the Government agreed on a set of
criteria for evaluating possible Participating Cities. These criteria stressed reform orientation,
housing market development, and overall economic conditions. Following evaluation visits by the
Government and the Bank to over 20 cities in July, the Government selected cities that ranked high
in the evaluation of agreed criteria. The Housing Market Component will be undertaken in five
cities: Barnaul , Nizhny Novgorod, Novgorod, Tver, and St Petersburg. Moscow will participate
only in the Construction Finance Sub-component. Additional cities that meet the city selection
criteria (reform orientation, housing market development, overall economic conditions) and fulfill
program conditions (promulgation of Declarations of Comrmittment and Regulatory Action Plans,
selection of qualifying housing sites) may be added during project implementation, if funding
permits. One such city, Rostov on Don, submitted three candidate sites during project preparation,
1/ Tle Federal Government will make loans directly to municipalities for this subcomponent. There will be no further
on-lending beyond the municipal level. Municipalities are therefore both the sub-borrowers and the final-borrowers.



CHAPTER 3                                                                             25
but the present moratorium on housing development, which in turn is a function of limitations in the
city's sewage treatment capacity, has meant that these sites cannot be appraised. The city selection
process is described in Annex 3.1 and the underlying city data are available in the Project files.
(1)    LAND DEVELOPMENT SUB-COMPONENT
3.12 Summarv of Sub-component. This Sub-component will support lending from the central
government to local governments for demonstration sub-projects that would increase the supply of
residential land for new housing.2 Serviced, partially serviced, or raw land will be auctioned off to
private developers for construction. Private developers would have the option of constructing the
infrastructure on the sites. Subloans to Local Governments would help finance public provision of
on-site infrastructure to the extent it is required for site development and off-site infrastructure that
is needed to provide on-site services. Local Governments would take the credit risk associated with
the loan and will recover the costs through the sale of the land. Specifically, subloans would finance
(a) some off-site infrastructure linked to project sites, and (b) infrastructure to connect parcels to
be auctioned and land sub-division (See Attachment A of Annex 3.2 for definition of terms). In
addition, technical cooperation and the design of the Sub-component will institutionalize the basic
practical framework necessary for a market-oriented land management system, such as pilot land
registration systems, land allocation system through auctions, and market-based land development
regulatory approval processes.
3.13   Sub-Obiectives. Within the overall Sub-component objective of rapidly breaking Government
monopolies on land supply, the Land Development Sub-component has the following specific sub-
objectives:
a.    Rapidly introducing land into the private real estate development market;
b.    Introducing the concept of land as an asset;
c.    Introducing cost-recovery mechanisms through land auctions that enable repayment
of loans and replication of the development processes;
d.    Establishing a transparent system of land allocation and transfer of ownership from
local governments to the private sector;
e.    Stimulating competition by giving equal access to both small and large home builders;
f.    Introducing new market oriented planning processes at the city and oblast levels
including feasibility analyses, land pricing mechanisms, flexible site design and
development orders with due regard to social, economic and environmental concerns.
2/ Sub-loans would be made from the Central Government to Municipalities with the guarantee of the
Oblast.



26                                                                                CHAFFER 3
3.14   Economic Rationale. The primary justification for the component is based on public goods
arguments: government involvement in land development will be limited to provision of infrastructure
and services that the private housing markets cannot easily provide. Financing sub-projects will
demonstrate the possibility of breaking up the present Government monopoly on urban land by
quickly putting on the market a large number of plots with full property title that are ready to be
auctioned to private developers for development. To qualify for funding, cities will have to
implement a range of appropriate land development policies so that price may determine the highest
and best use of land. Policy reforms will be furthered by the implementation of local action plans,
which will be designed and further developed as part of the Project's technical cooperation program
(see Annex 3.3 for a description of Local Regulatory Action Plans, and Annex 3.7 for Technical
Cooperation plan). Monitorable indicators and annual reviews will ensure compliance with agreed
local action plans.
3.15   Types of Investments. The Land Development component will finance roads, water, sewer,
electricity, gas and district heating networks necessary to connect the parcels to be auctioned, as
well as providing essential social infrastructure.  It will also fmance the primary off-site
infrastructure, which is needed to support these sites, including infrastructure networks such as major
roads, pumping stations, and electricity substations. Investments in primary infrastructure would
focus on incremental service demand associated with Project-funded housing. However, in some
cases, these first infrastructure investments, can start to address the primary infrastructure backlog
accumulated over several decades. For instance in St.Petersburg, the city has identified a need of
US$20 million in primary infrastructure investments that would not only address the water and
sewage infrastructure needs for a few of the sub-project sites, but also address a city-wide backlog
in infrastructure. Off-site roads, community facilities, parks and open space will also be financed
under the Land Development component.
3.16   Eligibility Guidelines. Local governments have prepared the first pipeline of sub-projects
according to an explicit set of guidelines that the Project Team developed with the Participating Cities
during Project Preparation. These guidelines, which constitute (a) site selection guidelines, (b)
planning and marketing guidelines, (c) environmental and relocation guidelines, and (d) cost recovery
and loan repayment guidelines, are detailed in Annex 3.2, Attachment B. For example, the site
selection guidelines suggest that sites (a) have all necessary utilities nearby, (b) have ready access
to public transportation and existing community facilities, (c) not require extensive site preparation,
(d) require no involuntary relocation of existing residents, and (e) be under municipal control and
be generally compatible with existing master plan use. These guidelines will also govern the
inclusion of further projects by the CPIU beyond the initial sub-projects already appraised. Emphasis
for design of sub-projects will be placed on development of modest housing through planning
guidelines -- such as limits on lot sizes, construction of walk up apartments etc (Annex 3.2).
3.17   Status of Sub-Project Preparation. Local governments have identified vacant urban sites for
future development. They evaluated the financial feasibility of these sites by using a computer model
that relates land development parameters and costs of infrastructure to the selling price of land,
developed in accordance with the guidelines. The first series of sub-projects is satisfactory in terms
of site selection criteria, quality of design and detailed information, including densities, salable land
ratios, cost estimates, and technical, financial, environmental, and social feasibility; and
responsiveness to the market. To date, the Project Review Unit in Moscow has appraised a pipeline



CHAPrER 3               -                                                        27
of 16 sites in the five cities totalling 574.3 ha. Four other sites were proposed but rejected before
appraisal based largely on their failure to meet cost recovery requirements. Some of these may be
revised to satisfy the guidelines and appraisal criteria, and could be considered as part of a longer-
term pipeline. The sites that have been appraised are designed to accommodate 31,497 dwelling
units and 432,500 m of commercial space. Portions of six of the appraised sites, including two sites
in St. Petersburg and one in each of the other cities, have been identified as First Phase sites that
will begin implementation in the first year of the project. Preliminary design and engineering has
been completed for the selected sites. Types of housing include single-family, town houses, and
walk-up apartments. All housing would be privately owned.

3.18 Implementation Concept. Sites will be auctioned under procedures acceptable to the Bank to
private developers willing to develop them in accordance with the contractual agreements with the
cities. The contract with the private developers will stipulate agreements on the level of
infrastructure that will be provided by the developers -- while the remaining will be provided by the
local government (para 4.3). Infrastructure may be constructed either (a) by the contractors
themselves, or (b) by the cities, or (c) part of it may be constructed by the contractors and the rest
by the cities. The loan under the Land Development Sub-component will be available to cities only.
Financing for private construction of infrastructure will be available to developers under the
Construction Finance Sub-component. The site development will follow Town Planning Orders
3/ First Phase site.



28                                                                             CHAPTER 3
developed by the cities. The Town Planning Orders will essentially describe the broad planning
parameters of land-use, density, building type, etc., but allow some flexibility so that developers may
build according to their assessments of the market (See Annex 3.2 for detailed development sequence
of the sub-projects).
3.19 Land Disposal Procedures. Land disposal procedures have been designed to maximize the
local government's return from the sale of the land while minimizing the financial risk of
infrastructure expenditures which may not be recovered. (See Annex 3.2 for a detailed description
of the procedures). The principal guidelines for the auctions are: (a) that the auctions or competitive
tenders are advertised; (b) a reserve price as per cost recovery guidelines (Annex 3.2 Attachment
B) is established providing developers with the opportunity to propose construction of connecting
infrastructure themselves; (c) holding auctions before awarding infrastructure contracts; (d) requiring
payments in cash.; and (e) allowing developers to propose extended payment terms.
3.20 Environmental Assessment. International engineering consultants performed an environmental
review of all originally proposed sites (see Annex 3.9). The proposed sites are environmentally safe.
Based on this environmental review, the Government decided to: (a) eliminate or postpone Rostov-
on-Don's participation in the project, based on primary infrastructure deficits, (b) include a US$25
million package of urgent water and sewer investments in St. Petersburg, as part of the
environmental mitigation initiative, to create the capacity needed for future project housing
inhabitants and to begin to address the backlog, (c) change the phasing of site implementation in
order to address mitigation needs on certain sites, (d) require thorough testing of soils to Westerm
standards to award contracts. Bank missions will review soil tests before providing the Bank's no
objection to contract award.
3.21  Cost Estimates.    For appraised subprojects, the estimated cost of connecting on-site
infrastructure is US$93.7 million and off-site infrastructure is US$79.2 million (excluding aquisition
, taxes and interest).  The first phase program (to start in the first year) is estimated to cost
U$$67.6, inclusive of US$25.0 for the environmental package in St. Petersburg.   The estimated
cost for the entire Sub-component is US$339.6 million. This includes both projects that are already
appraised and an allowance for future projects.
(2)    CONSTRUCTION FINANCE SUB-COMPONENT
3.22  Summary. The project would use the emerging commercial sector to funance and implement
construction at their risk. To do this, the Government would on-lend Bank funds for construction
finance to Participating Banks (PBs) in the project cities. In order to qualify, the PB must also
participate in the Bank's Financial Institutions Development Project (FIDP). Private developers
would apply to the PBs for construction finance for sub-projects that meet the agreed eligibility
criteria. Housing projects situated on the sites developed under the land development sub-component
would qualify, as well as those situated elsewhere in and around the participating cities.
Demonstration sub-projects in Moscow would also be eligible. Discussions with PBs and developers
in the participating cities have revealed a considerable demand for construction credits that could
absorb many multiples of the US$80 million allocated under the Loan. The component could support
the construction of about 3,100 housing units of different types.



CHAPR 3                                                                           29
3.23 Sub-Objectives. Within the overall objective of encouraging PBs to enlarge to volume of
medium-term lending for private housing construction, this component has the following sub-
objectives:
a.    to build the construction finance capacity of the PBs by providing technical assistance
in real estate underwriting (through the technical cooperation component);
b.    to encourage the private housing sector (banks, investors, developers, designers and
contractors) to diversify housing supply;
c.    to target benefits at the lowest possible income group that can afford commercially
produced, non-subsidized housing;
d.    to encourage new types of housing and more cost and energy-efficient construction
methods and materials;
e.    to provide the means for completing unfinished construction;
f.    to demonstrate the feasibility, profitability and affordability of these new approaches
in a non-subsidized market environment;
g.    to support the emergence of private, smaller-scale builders (developers, contractors).
3.24 Economic rationale. This component would complement the land development component by
completing the housing development cycle. Given its small size, it is best conceptualized as a
demonstration effort to catalyze commercial real estate lending and support the emerging private
housing sector. Proposed terms and conditions for on-lending to commercial banks are harmonized
with those of the ESP.
3.25 Status of PreDaration. A survey of banks and developers in the Participating Cities has
produced a pipeline of 173 potential sub-projects, representing 47,800 dwelling units and a total
value of US$1,344 million (Details on these sub-projects are available in the Project Files and Annex
3.4).   Many of these sub-projects would not meet the lending guidelines, which have been
formulated to demonstrate production of modest, energy-efficient units. However, they provide
concrete proof that a sufficient supply will exist to utilize the line of credit.
3.26 Lending Guidelines. These have been developed in consultation with developers, PBs and
Minstroi, to ensure that sub-projects correspond to the objectives of the sub-component. (See Annex
3.4) The same channels and lending terms used for the ESP and FIDP will also apply to the credit
lines in this Project.  At negotiations, the Government agreed on specific guidelines for the
Construction Finance Line of Credit. They also agreed that these guidelines would not be
changed without prior agreement of the Bank (para 7.1.a.4). Guidelines specify that: eligible

sub-projects must: (a) be within 15 Km of participating cities (plus Moscow for demonstrations),4
provided that an RAP has been agreed with the relevant jurisdiction (except Moscow); (b) comply
with environmental requirements; (c) meet site design, housing type, and maximum plot and floor
requirements, (d) meet thermo-resistance standards.. The construction of residential and commercial
space and community facilities up to a maximum of 30% of the project's total floor area, as well as
on-site tertiary and secondary engineering infrastructure, would be eligible for construction credits.
Credit limits are 75 % of the current average construction cost per square meter of gross usable floor
area for residential, commercial and community facility purposes, and 75% of the current average
cost of on-site infrastructure per square meter of site area. Average costs will be tracked and
updated periodically by the CPIU.

4/  At the request of the Government, private housing developments in and around Moscow will be allowed
to use a portion of the $40 million initially allocated to the non-site specific construction finance Sub-component.
Demonstration projects in Moscow would be appraised by the Bank on an individual basis to assure that they
illustrate new and advanced market housing techniques. Moscow is especially suited for demonstrations due to its
high visibility and frequent visits from outsiders.

3.27 Tvye of Sub-loans and Final-borrowers. Most of the developers interested in the line of credit
are new private companies with diverse backgrounds and motivations. Among them, privatized
former kombinats probably account for no more than 20 percent. Diversification being a necessity
for new enterprises emerging in the risky business enviromnent of Russia, most developers combine
real estate with other activities. Some are subsidiaries of industrial enterprises that build housing for
their staff but sell part of the production to outsiders. Some enterprises have branched out in real
estate to keep themselves alive. Others developers have started in trade and are investing their
handsome profits in housing and other real estate, turning it into another lucrative activity. Still
others are successful businessmen with a piece of land trying their hand at something new.
Developers may be large or small, they may be contractors themselves with their own labor, or they
may hire contractors. Certain of the new private developers, in order to ensure reliable access at
reasonable prices to building materials (which are in short supply and therefore priced speculatively),
have chosen the path of vertical integration and are acquiring or setting up brick factories and other
building materials plants. Construction subloans would cover the construction itself. Inputs are
mostly working capital consisting of materials and labor. Labor might be contracted or not, and
materials might be purchased by the sub-borrower, manufactured by the sub-borrower, or derived
from sub-borrower stockpiles.
3.28 Relationshin to Other Lines of Credit. The sub-component has been developed in close
cooperation with the Financial Institutions Development Project (FIDP) and the Enterprise Support
Project (ESP) and would complement their activities in the real estate area. The Project team has
proposed a reserved, unsubsidized, construction finance line of credit through potential ISB banks
for Project cities. It is an important part of a tightly integrated package of interventions in the real
estate development cycle. To meet Project objectives, sub-project financing must be available in an
appropriate quantity, place, and time, and within an viable institutional and technical assistance
setting. Lending channel and terms and conditions would be harmonized with the ESP,5 except that
maturities to final borrowers would range from six months (to reflect developer's need for gap
financing) to four years. Commercial banks are required to recycle repayments for additional
construction finance sub-loans during the first two years of project implementation.
51  ESP also provides for co-financing from EBRD under somewhat different terms and conditions.

(3)   INSTrIuTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
3.29 Summary. Institutional Development would accompany and reinforce the housing market
development component. The costs of this institutional development are included in the Technical
Assistance and Training Component (para 3.38). The main objective of institutional development
is to create a practical framework for implementation of the component. In addition, institutional
development will make the institutional and regulatory changes introduced by sub-project
implementation sustainable in the long term in the participating cities. In order to create this
enabling framework for Project implementation, the project will include training and technical
assistance on policy and institutional aspects to personnel directly responsible for implementation
of the sub-projects as well as larger groups of Russian experts and decision makers involved in the
Project. For instance, assistance will be provided for the first land auctions held under the Project,
and Participating Banks will be provided with guidelines and training for real estate lending. A
detailed description of the training and technical assistance program is presented in Annexes 3.7 and
3.8.
3.30 Technical Cooperation Initiatives Undertaken to Date. In preparation for implementation of
the Land Development sub-projects, in each participating city, an Affordability Model has been
introduced to assess the financial feasibility of the projects. Local Regulatory Action Plans (RAPs)
have been developed which address key policies to be implemented in advance of sub-project
funding. A number of seminars and workshops have been held in the Participating Cities on project
finance and development, land allocation and title registration systems.
3.31 Suggested TORs. Terms of References (TOR) in support of the Land Development and
Construction Finance Sub-components, presented in Annex 3.9, include: (a) general consultant for
project implementation; (b) a pilot title registration system; and (c) development of building
materials, housing codes regulations; and a land development regulatory audit. These studies will
help develop standards and norms in land management and planning processes such as zoning and
land-use regulations, introduce system cost sharing between public and private entities, and systems
for administrative control over these processes.
D.   TRANSFORMATION OF THE BUILDING MATERIALS INDUSTRY
(4)    EQUrrY MATCHING SUB-COMPONENT
3.32  Summy. The Equity Matching Sub-Component would extend subloans to Russian building
materials enterprises that attract substantial new equity from qualified investors. The Government
would on-lend the Bank loan through participating commnercial banks (PBs), which would assume
the commercial risk. PBs must also participate in the FIDP in order to be eligible. Subloan amounts
would be up to double the amount of new cash equity contributed by qualifying investors.
Conservative guidelines have been established to delimit qualifying investors (i.e., venture capital
funds and private companies with experience in producing or distributing modern building materials),
equity and products in order ensure that this experimental component is financially prudent and will
help to restructure the building materials industry.



CHAPER 3                -                                                         33
3.33 Sub-Objectives. Within the overall objective of encouraging the establishment of industries
to produce modern and more efficient building materials, the main sub-objectives are to:
a..    Support an active restructuring of the Russian building materials industry;
b.    Encourage the inflow of new direct foreign investment, technology and management
expertise for domestic Russian value-added production; and
C.    Help introduce new building materials that are suitable for small-scale and self-help
construction and that would provide environmental and energy benefits.
3.34 Economic Rationale. The Bank's counterparts in Minstroi, the Ministry of Finance, and the
Ministry of the Economy view transformation of the vast building materials industry as the highest
priority for this Project. The Russian building material kombinats produced materials for an
inefficient production technology that is energy and input intensive, and is linked to serious
environmental degradation. These materials are not appropriate for demand led housing construction,
and especially unsuitable for self-help and small, private contractors. While there are thousands of
potential industrial investments in this sector, most of those proposed by the Government are not
easily bankable. Among bottlenecks to active restructuring is the lack of mechanisms with market
incentives to pick the best from a pool of potential investments. The Equity Matching component
would provide such a mechanism by having commercial banks provide loans to enterprises supported
by equity, management, and technical expertise. The presence of matching private equity would be
a powerful screen to ensure the viability of proposed investments, reduce commercial lending risk,
de-politicize lending decisions, and ensure cost recovery.
3.35 Status of Eauitv Matching Component Preparation. (a) Government Support. The Project
team has detailed the eligibility criteria, financing channel, and implementation criteria for this
channel with the Interministerial Group, with international venture capital firms representing over
US$850 million in equity capital earmarked for Russia, and with many private sector enterprises.
(b) Sub-Project Pipeline. Discussions with venture capital funds have yielded a pipeline of sample
sub-projects that are ready for immediate investment. Initial estimates with fund managers suggest
that the proposed US$80 million experimental Equity Matching component would be drawn down
fairly quickly.
3.36 Eligibiitv Criteria. At negotiations, the Government agreed to guidelines for subloans
under the Equity Matching Line of Credit. They also agree that these guidelines would not be
changed without the prior agreement of the Bank (para 7.1.a.4) A copy of the Guidelines is
available in Annex 3.5. (a) Summary. In order to maintain the highest assurance of full cost
recovery, and to discourage fraud, the initial criteria have been tightly and conservatively defined
as described in Annex 3.5. The line of credit will fund investment projects of eligible enterprises
that produce eligible products or services, with equity participation by eligible investors. Equity
must be for new, legally and financially distinct ventures; be in cash rather than other in-kind



34                                                                             CHAPrER 3
contributions; be for private ventures as defined in the ESP;6 be motivated by value maximization;
and be subject to due diligence and ongoing monitoring. (b) Eligible Investments. Eligible
investments will be buildings, machinery, equipment and incremental permanent working capital used
in the production or distribution of eligible building products or provision of eligible services. (c)
Products. Eligible products would be building materials which may be incorporated in the permanent
physical structure of residential housing or services to support the production and distribution of
these materials. Eligible building materials could include bricks, lumber, windows and insulation.
Standard fixtures (e.g. furnaces and plumbing fixtures) that are attached to the structure would also
be eligible. Eligible services could include leasing of equipment, provision of retail and wholesale
distribution networks, and creation of storage warehouses. (d) Investors. Qualifying investors would
be limited to certified venture capital funds and private corporations with demonstrated experience
in producing modem building materials or which provide services that support the production or
distribution of such products. Corporations must produce at least three years of unqualified audits
from auditors satisfactory to the Bank that their accounts are maintained in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and that financial statements reflect fairly the financial condition of
the company. Venture funds must have a technical partner with experience in the building materials
industry. (e) Equity. Qualifying equity would be limited to cash to avoid difficult valuation issues.
Sub-borrowers would be subject to ongoing financial oversight, including annual formal audits and
quarterly reviews. Covenants in the sub-loan agreements would impose restrictions on dividends,
capital transfers, issuance of new debt, or other measures to assure that capital is maintained at
adequate levels.
E.    TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING
3.37   The Project would incorporate an extensive technical cooperation (TC) program that would
reinforce each of the components.  The Government requested that loan funded  Technical
Cooperation program be limited to US$25 million; however, an allocation of US$23 million should
be sufficient to cover requirements. In addition, the commitment from USAID and other donors are
expected to amount to US$8 million. This program would have the following aims:
a.    Implementation Assistance and Programmingfor Future Projects. This portion of the
TC program would be primarily related to funding directly involved in implementing
investment sub-projects, including design and engineering, staff, consultants and
equipment for the central and local Project Implementation Units (PIUs), particularly
in the areas of procurement and construction inspection.. (See Annex 3.8 for the TOR
for a General Consultant). In addition, the program includes extensive support to
cities to imnplement the Regulatory Action Plans. Help in formulating follow-on
projects for Bank financing would be subsumed into this sub-component.
b.    Housing and Construction Finance.  In close coordination with the FIDP,
participating ISBs would be provided training in underwriting, accounting, and
supervision of real estate lending. The TC program would also support a study of
6/ A 'private' Russian investor is defined consistent with the July 3, 1991 Russian Law on Privatization of
State and Municipal Enterprises, which requires 75% private ownership.

housing finance alternatives for possible future Bank lending in the housing sector.
(See Annex 3.8 which provides a TOR for the Housing Finance Study) Banks,
designers, developers and local authorities would be provided with technical assistance
in design of alternative types of housing, appropriate construction technologies,
construction management, as well as standards and regulations relative to housing
development.
c.    Land Registration. The TC program includes hardware, software, and training for
pilot real estate registration systems in the districts where the land development sites
will be located.
d.    Building Materials. The TC program would support work with Minstroi in revising
building materials standards and codes to bring them in line with market practices.
The TC program would provide information to building materials enterprises about
technical help available under other Bank and donor supported operations, as well as
introductions to potential investors. (See Annex 3.8 which provides a TOR for the
Revision of Building Materials Standards)
F.    PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
3.38   The project has developed performance indicators to measure the achievement of policy,
project and component level objectives (see Annex 5.3). The Project is designed to be flexible,
allowing funding shifts to more successful components and cities. The project should be considered
successful in its demonstration effort if the practices and principles instituted by the Project have
resulted in market oriented housing development outside the Project. These may be measured by
an increase in (a) use of competitive auction and tendering procedures for introducing public land
into private housing market; (b) percentage of city area properties registered in Unified Real Estate
Cadastre; (c) percentage of housing transactions to overall privately owned housing stock; (d)
percentage of new housing construction by private developers to total housing stock; (e) increase in
volume of lending to private parties from commercial banks for construction financing; and (f)
increase in production of non-traditional building materials by private building materials industries.

IV. COST EsTimATES AND FINANCIAL ASPEC7S
A.      COST ESTIMATES
4.1     The total estimated cost of the Project is US$758.7 million. Costs include taxes and duties
and the value of land donated by local governments.' Total cost, net of taxes and duties, is
US$710.5 million. The foreign cost of the Project is difficult to estimate, but it is likely that
expatriate contractors will have a significant role in the land development component due to the scale
of these proposed contracts.2  Costs were estimated in January 1994 prices and include a 15%
physical contingency. Price contingencies are estimated at 2.5 % per year for the life of the Project.
For the civil works components, construction cost estimates were based on quantities from feasibility
studies carried out during Project preparation. The estimated cost of individual Project components
and cost categories are detailed in Annex 4.1 and summarized in Table 4.1.

development sites. Land values comprise the difference between the expected sales prices of houses minus the cost
of infrastructure and other charges.
21 If local contractors win the bids for infrastructure development, direct foreign expenditures would range
from 5-20%, depending on the site. If foreign contractors win, foreign expenditures would be much higher. A
figure of 50% foreign was adopted as a best compromise between the two estimates.



38                                                                             CHAPTER 4
2.5% per annum compounded were applied to civil works costs expressed in US dollars
according to the average annual price increase projected by the World Bank between 1994 and
2002. The physical contingencies were assumed to be 15% of base costs for civil works and
equipment which is somewhat higher than Bank practice for similar projects worldwide because
of the unfamiliarity with the Russian construction environment. If there are major shifts in
relative prices during project implementation, the amount of infrastructure construction loans and
loans to building materials enterprises might be increased or decreased in line with the new
costs.
B.    FINANCING PLAN
4.3    The Bank would finance US$400 million, which is 53%  of Project costs. The Bank
would finance 95% of civil works (net of taxes and duties)3, 70% of technical assistance and the
entire cost of subloans to enterprises and housing developers under the equity matching and
construction finance Sub-components. The Bank loan to the Russian Federation would have a
maturity of 17 years, including 5 years grace, at the Bank's prevailing variable interest rate.
The Govemment, through the Ministry of Finance would on-lend Bank funds to the Participating
Cities for civil works; to Participating Banks for qualifying construction finance loans, and to
Participating Enterprises and Participating Banks to match qualifying equity investments. Local
govemments would finance the remainder of civil works costs including payment of applicable
import duties and taxes, such as VAT for the public sector components and sub-components,
interest during construction, and force accounts for miscellaneous small works. With respect
to the construction financing line of credit and the building materials equity matching line of
credit, the Bank would finance up to 75% of the costs for construction finance and 67% for
equity matching, with private developers and businesses financing the rest. The proposed
financing plan is presented in Table 4.2, Detailed Project Cost estimates are presented in
Annex 4. 1.
2/ Disbursements will cover 80% of civil works including taxes and duties. This is equivalent to 100% net
of taxes and duties. A percentage of 95 % is included here because it is expected that local governments may prefer
to finance some works through force account. This would not be eligible for Bank disbursement.

4.4     Retroactive Financing.  Retroactive financing of US$30 million will be permitted 'or all
components of the project in order to encourage municipalities and banks to start financing sub-
projects in time for the 1995 construction season. Funds will also be used to set up the PIU's and
for final design and engineering in order to initiate project administration in a timely manner.
4.5     Counterpart Funds. The feasibility of the Land Development Sub-component depends, to a
large extent, on the availability of budgetary resources to finance local costs. Because counterpart
funding for the land development component will be a local government requirement, financial
analyses of both the sub-projects and the local governments have been completed. In addition, the
setting up and initial funding of a Project Account in each city will be made a condition of
effectiveness for the Federal Government's loans to each Participating City. The amount of
funding should cover cash flow needs for the first quarter of project implementation. For the
other two components, the private developers and enterprises will be responsible for counterpart
contributions.
4.6     Cofinancing. Training and technical assistance components are about 4%  of the total Project
cost. USAID has already committed to providing US$6.5 million in a Technical Cooperation
Program; other bilateral donors (Canada and France) have committed about US$1.5 million for
construction industry training, including pilots. If the Government is successful in obtaining other

bilateral grants for this purpose, then the use of Bank funds would either be reduced correspondingly
or reallocated to other components following appropriate review and approval by the World Bank.
C.    SPECIAL AccouNT
4.7    A Special Account (SA) would be maintained in a commercial bank selected by the
Government under competitive bidding, acceptable to the World Bank. The amount of the authorized
allocation to be deposited into the SA would be $3 million.4 This is equal to about 4 months of
project expenditures to be financed by the Bank through the SA. The SA would be administered by
the CPIU which will send requests to the World Bank for replenishment of the SA. These requests
would be accompanied by detailed monthly bank statements of the SA up to the prior month. The
Special Account would increase the efficiency of disbursement mechanisms, because it would permit
reimbursement claims to be grouped and disbursed more quickly.
D.    FLOW OF FUNDS
4.8   The proceeds of the loan would be channeled in two ways:  (a) funds for the land
development Sub-component would be channeled to local governments; (b) for the construction
finance Sub-component and Equity Match component, funds would be channeled to Participating
Banks using the mechanism established for the ESP.
4.9   Land Development Channel. The Government would on-lend the funds to participating
municipalities with the guarantee of participating oblasts. Each of the five participating municipalities
and their participating oblast has signed a Declaration of Commitment in which they obligate the
municipality to carry out the land development Sub-component in accordance with the policies and
procedures established at negotiations and described in the Declaration. These Declarations of
Commitment would become legally binding upon the execution of Participating City Loan
Agreements between the Federal Government and the Participating Cities. Funds would be disbursed
directly to contractors after certification of invoices by representatives of the local governments and
the General Consultant (para 5.1). In most cases, the payments would be made to the contractors
from the Special Account. In some cases, the Bank will disburse directly to the contractor. If local
governments first make eligible payments from their own funds, they will be reimbursed. Local
governments will be responsible for repayment of the loan.
4.10   Construction Finance Channel. The Government would on-lend hard currency to the banks
subject to the same prudential provisions established under the FIDP. The commercial banks would
be at risk for loans they issue under this channel and would charge developers interest rate spreads
sufficient to cover their risks.
4.11   Equity Matching. The subloans under this channel would be made through participating
commercial banks (PBs) that are also accredited under the FIDP. The PBs would ensure that
proposed sub-projects meet the eligibility criteria, have adequate and credible financing plans, follow
4/ The $3 million deposit will be made after $5 rnillion has been disbursed from the loan account. Until that
point, the deposit into the special account shall be limited to $1 million.

required procurement and environmental guidelines, and are secured by adequate collateral. PB's
will take the commercial risk on subloans; and thus will need to repay the Government whether or
not their sub-borrowers pay them.
E.    ON-LENDING TERMS
4.12   The prevailing macroeconomic instability makes it very difficult to devise appropriate rouble-
based lending terms for any of the Project components. Therefore the Ministry of Finance has
requested, and the Bank has agreed, that the subloans would be in US dollars. The interest rate and
maturities to sub-borrowers and, in the case of lines of credit, to final borrowers would depend on
the particular component as summarized in Table 4.3 below. In general, the interest rate to sub-
borrowers would be floating, and would be based on the interest rate charged by the Bank to the
Government, plus a margin of up to 2.5% to cover administrative costs and the cross-currency
exchange and default risk. Subloans to commercial banks on which the PB takes the credit risk
would be set at an interest rate that matches the rate for the ESP. Interest rates to final beneficiaries
under both the Equity Matching and the Construction Finance Lines of Credit would be set by the
PBs. Maximum maturities to sub-borrowers for each component would vary depending on the
component, and would be: 5 years for subsidiary loans to municipalities for the land development
component, and 12 years to the PB's. Loans from PB's to final borrowers would be for maturities
of 6 months to four years for construction finance, and 2 - 8 years for EMLOC. Until subloans are
repaid in Land Development Sub-components, local governments will be allowed to use the proceeds
of land sales only for counterpart funding of approved sub-projects, interest payments, or repayment
of the loans.

4.13   Since the amount outstanding and the repayment would be in US dollars, the foreign
exchange risk between the US dollar and ruble would be borne by the sub-borrowers. However, the
Government would bear the cross-currency risk between the basket of currencies in the Bank loan
and the US dollar. The principal amount of the financing given for a subloan would be calculated
in US dollars on the basis of the current exchange rate, on the date of payment of each eligible
expenditure. Repayment of principal and interest would also be made in US dollars or in the rouble
equivalent based on the foreign exchange rate prevailing on the repayment date. The foreign
exchange risk would be borne by the sub-borrowers.  Interest would accrue from the date of
disbursement and repayments would be required on a quarterly basis. Repayment of principal and
interest would be made by the sub-borrower to an agreed account in the agency bank or in a local
bank to be designated by the MOF.



CHAPTER 4                                                                           43
4.14 Summary of Loan Conditions concerning On-lending. At negotiations, the following
conditions regarding on-lending arrangements were agreed: (a) the Federal Government will
sign Participating City Loan Agreements with at least three local governments as a condition
for effectiveness of the Bank loan to the Federal Government; (b) Subsidiary Loan Agreements
will be signed with at least two PBs as individual conditions of disbursement for the
Construction Finance and Equity Matching Sub-components; and (c) the following will be made
conditions of effectiveness of each Participating City Loan Agreement between the Federal
Government and each Participating City: (i) establishment of a Local Project Implementation
Unit (LPIU); (ii) adoption of a regulation on title registration; (iii) adoption of procedures on
auction and competitive tender of land on project sites; (iv) establishment and funding of a
project account (para 7.1.C).
4.15   Use of Reflows to Central Government. The Central Government will receive repayments
of the subloans before it needs to remit the funds to the World Bank. Since the Project is not
intended to provide free foreign exchange to the Government, land development sub-component
reflows will be used for similar purposes prior to their repayment to the Bank. Specifically reflows
from local governments to the central government must be used to repay Bank loan or to fund
similar land development project in the participating cities or in other cities. The Government
would use reflows from the commercial banks for re-lending to commercial banks under terms
identical to those of the Enterprise Support Project (WB Loan No. 3763-RU). The commercial
banks may use these additional sub-loans either for the general purposes permitted under the
ESP or for financing additional construction loans (para 7.1.a.3).
F.    COST RECOVERY
4.16  The proposed Housing Project will finance activities in the public and private sectors. The
Land Development Sub-component may account for up to half of the loan proceeds; the other two
components would each account for about one quarter. Despite the difficult economic environment,
the Government insists on the need to develop lending components that will implement market
principles and ensure full cost recovery. Establishing the principle of cost recovery will be essential
in creating an efficient and sustainable housing sector.
4.17   Land Development Sub-component   For the land development Sub-component, local
governments have concurred in their Declarations of Commitment5 that rights to all land would be
sold to the private sector in a form of tenure that secures to the developer the right to mortgage the
land rights, construct the housing, and dispose of the housing to purchasers. The local governments
have further agreed that they would convey full ownership of the land to housing purchasers, either
individuals or condominium associations, on demand and without additional change of price. To the
extent that local government would provide infrastructure, the subloan for such infrastructure would
be recovered by auctioning or competitive tendering of the rights to the serviced plots to private
developers for housing development. In order to assure that loan recovery would occur, a number
of guidelines have been followed, such as: (a) an initial selection of sites that require minimal off-
5/ Declarations of Commitment will be legally binding once the Federal Government has executed
Participating City Loan Agreements with the Participating Cities.



44                                                                                 CHAPTER 4
site infrastructure, (b) limiting disbursements to 80% of the expected volume of sales revenue
forecast for the site even if construction costs might call for higher disbursements, (c) holding
auctions before infrastructure contracts are signed and (d) allowing developers bidder to propose and
construct infrastructure. Market and financial analyses indicate high sales revenues for the serviced
sites, given the current premium paid by the private sector for serviced, developable land with clear
property rights. At negotiations, the Government and representatives of the Participating Cities
accepted a subloan ceiling for each site, which is not greater than 80% of the expected revenues
from that site (para 7. 1.a.5). In addition to direct cost recovery from sales of sub-project sites, the
local governments would offer additional guarantees of repayment to the Government. If cities do
not recover the required funds from the sale of land, they will meet the debt service from their own
revenues.  This should be possible given their resources.  The Central Government has also
requested additional assurances of repayment, including the guarantees of oblast governments pledged
to back local borrowing.
4.18   Annex 3.2 provides detailed guidelines for preparation of sub-projects under the component
with regard to the cost recovery potential of individual sites. These were developed on the basis of
analyses carried out for the first pipeline of land development sub-projects. First, cost coverage and
loan coverage ratios were developed for each potential site. The cost coverage ratio is the ratio of
the site's infrastructure cost to its estimated selling price. The loan coverage ratio is the ratio of the
loan to the expected sales price. Second, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on critical assumptions
made regarding cost recovery. This analysis covered the following: (a) selling prices of individual
houses, row houses, apartments, and commercial space; (b) cost analysis of construction costs
relative to other cities and relative to selling prices; and (c) whether the percentage of commercial
space appears justifiable given the location of the site and the availability of competing facilities.
The benefits of these analyses were to show municipal officials and urban planners the cost and
benefit of decisions regarding site locations, infrastructure and community facilities standards and
space allocations. Based on the analysis, some sites were dropped or postponed, and others were
redesigned.  However, there is a sufficient pipeline of sites that meet cost and loan recovery
requirements to undertake the program.
4.19   Construction Finance Sub-component. For the construction finance component, accredited
banks are fully liable for loans they make to final users. Cost recovery from the bank to the
Government is credible because this component adopts wholly the prudential regulations built into
the FIDP which limit the risk exposure that will be allowed to any of the accredited banks.
Interviews were conducted during Project preparation with developers and banks in all the Project
cities. These discussions reveal that banks have been very conservative thus far in managing the
limited amount of lending that they offer for construction finance. They require collateral unless the
developer has a stream of income from other sources domiciled at the bank. Typically, the banks
lend for only a small percentage of the cost of the construction project, and monitor investment
progress closely. Banks presently lend at short terms for high rates of interest (35-40% in US
Dollars) though it is hoped that interest rates will come down. Both bankers and developers admit
that housing is profitable.  Housing units typically sell at twice their development costs and
sometimes as much as three to four times their development costs. Technical assistance and training
will be offered to assist the banks in improving their ability to evaluate, monitor and service
construction loans.



CHAPTER 4                                                                                     45
4.20   Eguity Matching Component. Similarly, for the equity matching component, subloan risk
is reduced by a combination of the presence of new cash equity, conservative eligibility guidelines,
including collateral requirements, the requirement that the loan be senior debt, and the rigorous
appraisal of sub-projects by the PB. PB's would take the lending risk on these sub-loans. In
addition, commercial banks are subject to the prudential regulations of the FIDP.
G.    MUNICIPAL FINANCE
4.21   Project Requirements. The cities are faced with two types of financing requirements for the
Project: debt service and counterpart funding. Debt service would be paid from the proceeds of
land sales. In addition, cities have other substantial resources to cover debt service, in the event that
land purchasers do not reply in a timely manner. There appears to be little competing long-term debt
because of the fact that it was not necessary for cities to borrow in the past. However, cities do
appear to be incurring short-term debt in the form of unpaid bills. Because of the inadequacies in
current accounting systems, it is not possible to determine exactly how much of this type of debt is
outstanding. Annex 4.2 presents a detailed analysis of the local governments financial status, and
financing plan for the Project.
4.22   The cities will take steps to limit their financial risk under the Project. They will be required
to hold land auctions before they award construction contracts. The various land disposal alternatives
available to the cities are presented in Annex 3.2. In addition, the cities will phase the projects so
that if land sales expectations are not realized, the Project can be curtailed or modified to limit the
financial exposure. Annex 3.2 presents a detailed phasing plan proposed by the cities for the first
year's pipeline of sub-projects.
4.23   Counterpart funding will require a significant share of the capital program in some cities, but
funds appear to be available since each of the cities has indicated that the Project will be considered
a high priority. In addition, the proceeds from the sale of land from the initial phases will be
available for counterpart funding in the period between the time that the land is sold and when debt
repayments are due.
4.24   Table 4.4 shows maximum6 debt service requirements for each of the cities in comparison
with 1993 adjusted revenue. None of the cities would be required to pay more than 6% of their
revenue for debt servicing.
61 This is based on the assumption that all land development sub-projects in the pipeline as of June 30,1994,
would be financed and cities will not obtain sales revenues for their use prior to basic infrastructure construction.
This is unlikely to occur, as the cities will realize some proceeds from auction of raw or partially serviced law, and
will reduce the size of the sub-projects if the proceeds do not meet expectations. It is illustrative, however, of the
substantial borrowing and repayment capacity that the cities have in excess of Project requirements.

The cities are likely to take at least two years to complete this phase of the Project so the average
requirement over a two year period is shown. Except in Barnaul. the amount is a small proportion
of the total capital program. The krai administration in Barnaul has provided assurance that it will
provide necessary funding to the city. The phasing of future project sites would be planned with the
cities based on their continuing commitment to the Project and their willingness to assure counterpart
finance.

4.26          Local Financial Authority. Local governments have access to major revenue sources
but they do not control the amount of revenue that they will receive from those sources nor do they
control spending responsibilities. Under the Russian system, most revenues are shared with the
Central Government and the oblast level government, and major revenue decisions are made by these
authorities. Higher level authorities also determine spending responsibilities. The recent tendency
has been to increase spending responsibilities at a faster rate than increases in revenue.
Nevertheless, the revenue sources that are available are diversified and sensitive to inflation so the
cities have the potential for a solid revenue base. Revenues include corporate income taxes, personal
income taxes, and payments for land, property, and privatization. Cities have a major source of
potential revenue in the property tax. However, in order to realize these benefits, major work will
have to be undertaken. This includes property registration systems as well as the tax systems
themselves. The Project will initiate some of this work through pilot schemes for land registration
on Project sites, and through fulfillment of action plans agreed with the local governments. Local
governments can also exercise discretion in deciding how to allocate funds among their
responsibilities.
H.    PRocuREMENT
4.27   Major Project elements, their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement are
summarized in Table 4.6 below. All works, goods and technical assistance to be financed with Bank
loan funds will be procured in accordance with relevant Bank procurement Guidelines and, as
appropriate, will be based on the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, as supplemented or modified
with approval of the Bank. Annex 4.3 contains a summary procurement schedule and other details
of procurement administration.

CHAPTER 4                                                                             49
4.28   Civil Works. The five participant communities have proposed a total of 16 sites for new
housing developments, which range from 14 hectares to 88 hectares in size, averaging approximately
36 hectares per site. Additional sites would also be proposed during project implementation. Civil
works will comprise on-site and off site infrastructure including: landscaping, leveling, storm
drainage, roads, potable and waste water conduits, heating supplies, electrical and telephone services,
utility substations, and other site development works. These civil works improvements will support
the construction of single family houses, town houses and walk-up apartment buildings by contractors
and land developers.  Site development designs also include community facilities and some
commercial structures.
4.29   All civil works contracts above $1.0 million shall be through ICB, and above $0.3 million
through LCB. A total of 49 construction contracts for housing with an estimated value of US$189.3
million, infrastructure and utility improvements, are proposed to be tendered under ICB, as outlined
in the Bank's Guidelines, and financed by the Bank loan. These contracts are estimated to be
between US$2 million and about US$14 million, with an average value of about US$5.6 million.
These contracts are expected to cover the major infrastructure works for each development parcel
and utility improvements in the regions. LCB will be used for some utility upgrades and small
works. The threshold below which use of LCB bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank will be
used in procuring for these civil works is US$1.0 million. Approximately fifteen contracts with a
total estimated value of US$6.6 million are expected to be tendered under LCB. Locally bid
contracts are estimated to range in size from approximately US$300,000. up to US$1.0 million, with
an average size of US$440,000. Relatively small scale infrastructure for small groups of houses and
some separate utility installations are identified as potentially suitable for LCB contracting.  In
addition to possible subcontracting opportunities under ICB contracts, these small jobs will provide
opportunities for domestic contractors to participate in the Project.
4.30   Civil works contracts will be tendered using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (Large
and Small Works).  Works packages above US$500 thousand, and resulting contracts and
amendments, if any, would be subject to the Bank's prior review.  In addition, the first two LCB
contracts per city would be pre-reviewed. The remaining packages will be subject to post-review.
Prior reviews will thus cover about 95% of the monetary total of civil works financed by the Bank.
US$10 million will be the threshold above which the Bank's Large Works Standard Bidding
Documents will be used. For LCB contracts, the borrower will use Regional Standard Bidding
documents for works through LCB issued in July 1994. Of the 34 expected ICB bidding packages,
three are identified as being potentially above the US$10 million threshold.  ICB and LCB
solicitations are expected to be divided into four main packages of 7, 12, 18 and 12 contracts each
and are expected to be awarded within a twenty-four month period after the Bank loan becomes
effective. The civil works implementation period is expected to extend over five years. However,
several factors will have an impact on this timetable, such as the relatively short  Russian
construction season, which only extends from April to September in some areas. Phasing of
construction at some sites will be necessary to coordinate infrastructure and other housing
development activities.
4.31   Contractors interested in bidding under International and Local Competitive Bidding
procedures will be prequalified. Contractors will be expected to comply with customary civil works
standards regarding experience, payment terms, and guarantees. During prequalification, financial



50                                                                              CHArrER 4
statements of foreign and domestic contractors, participating as either independents or in association
with other firms, will be examined to establish their financial capacity. In the prequalification,
potential bidders would be qualified to bid for and perform one or more contracts, up to an
acceptable portion to be appraised by the PB of their respective net financial and operational
capacities. The ability of contractors to provide performance and advance payment guarantees is an
issue for domestic firms which will be examined carefully during the prequalification reviews.
4.32   Equipment and Goods  The loan will finance about US$6.3 million in equipment and
materials. Contracting for goods with contract values estimated to be in excess of US$300,000
equivalent will be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB), i.e., an estimated six
contracts, averaging US$567,000 and totaling US$3.4 million, or approximately 54% of goods
procurement.  These purchases will include US$2.6 million in utility inputs: e.g., substation
switchgear, valves, pressure reducers, etc., and about US$800,000 for construction inspection
vehicles and equipment, including spare parts. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the
Procurement of Goods will be used and these contracts will be subject to prior Bank review. For
ICB bid comparison purposes, Russian suppliers will be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or
the existing customs duty that a nonexempt importer would have to pay, whichever is lower, over
the competing price of imports, provided its domestic value-added is at least twenty percent. Direct
Contracting procedures are envisioned for two contracts for dewatering centrifuges and spare parts
(US$900,000) to upgrade existing wastewater treatment equipment in St. Petersburg.   These
contracts will require prior Bank review. International Shopping (IS) will be used for purchases of
utility components that are between US$50,000 and US$300,000 per contract and have specifications
that would be of interest to external suppliers. The LCB purchases, totaling US$1.1 million, will
constitute about seventeen percent of the goods contracts. These are for replacement on items
purchased originally from the Russian Federation. They are expected to number five transactions
and average about US$220,000 each. LCB purchases will follow procedures acceptable to the Bank
and will be advertised in local media. The borrower will use Regional standard bidding documents
and the Bank will pre-review the first contract. Bidding will be open to all qualified bidders, make
use of bidding documents in Russian, and spell out how to bid and how bids will be evaluated.
Awards will be to the lowest evaluated bidder. They will be subject to post-review by Bank staff.
4.33   Smaller value purchases of instrumentation for water treatment and office equipment, e.g.,
photocopiers, facsimile machines, computers, printers, and supplies will be made using International
Shopping and Local Shopping procedures. Purchases of items available from international sources
under US$300,000 per contract will be procured using International Shopping procedures (four
actions estimated at about US$125,000 each). Small value purchases for office furniture, etc. that
would not be of interest to international suppliers (under US$50,000 per contract) will be procured
via Local Shopping procedures, i.e., nine actions averaging about US$44,000 each. These thirteen
smaller value IS and LS procurement actions will be implemented in accordance with solicitation,
evaluation and award procedures acceptable to the Bank. Local Shopping will involve a comparison
of at least three quotes from different eligible suppliers; International Shopping will require at least
three quotes from suppliers in at least three different Bank-member countries. International and
Local Shopping transactions will together constitute about fourteen percent of equipment purchases
and will be subject to post-review by Bank staff.



CHAPTER 4                                                                           51
4.34  Procurement for Eguity Matching Line of Credit. Purchases of equipment and incidental
services financed by subloans under the US$96.0 million Equity Matching (Building Materials
Industry) component of this Loan will be patterned after procurement procedures authorized for the
Bank's Enterprise Support Project (ESP). In particular, individual EMLOC investor purchases under
US$ 250,000 would be carried out on the basis of Local Shopping, i.e., obtaining and comparing
quotations from at least three different local suppliers. For investor purchases that will exceed
US$ 250,000 but be less than US$ 4.0 million, procurement will be in accordance with the
International Shopping procedures, i.e., obtaining three quotations and comparing quotations from
suppliers from at least three different Bank-member countries. Both of these categories of purchases
would be subject to post-review of the normal commercial documentation, as retained in the banks'
or borrowers' files. Expected EMLOC contracts that would exceed the US$4.0 million level would
be procured using the Bank's ICB procedures. Each of these ICB contracts would use the Bank's
Standard Bidding Documents for Goods and be subject to Bank prior review of documentation,
awards and contracts/amendments. Since potential EMLOC equity matching proposals are only in
preliminary stages of development, it is not possible to estimate the breakdown of ICB and IS
categories within this US$ 96.0 million component. However, it is expected that most construction
materials industry investments would consist of the importation of new advanced-technology
manufacturing equipment and, possibly, accompanying spare parts and incidental installation and
support services. As with the ESP, the participating banks would monitor purchases and investment
actions of EMLOC sub-borrowers to ensure their procedures and documentation are consistent with
World Bank requirements. The CPIU and LPIUs would have General Consultants (with procurement
expertise) available to help the PB's with their oversight work and to provide specific procurement
advice as needed.
4.35   Procurement for Construction Finance Sub-component. Sub-loans for housing construction
would be disbursed by PB's in stages against completion of works, as certified by an engineer hired
by the PB and spot checked by the General Consultant. The subloans will cover expenditures for
housing construction. The correctness of the estimate submitted by the developer/contractor will be
checked by the PBs as part of their regular subloan appraisal process in accordance with the
approach agreed with the Bank which would reflect the economic construction of housing. The
definition of construction phases and the percentage of disbursement permitted would be spelled out
in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements with PB's. It is far more practical to monitor procurement by
PB's for construction loans in the same way as for their normal loans to the local housing
construction industry i.e., indirectly. Instead of tracking individual sub-borrower purchases of
materials or services and disbursing against invoices (which are not necessarily generated for all
housing development transactions and can easily be falsified), commercial banks prefer to make
construction finance loan releases on the basis of actual work performed and materials installed, i.e.,
as a percentage of overall sub-project completion. With this method of managing subloans,
commercial banks are able to correlate physical installation and construction accomplishment at a site
with requested 'progress" disbursements. It is a normal practice that commercial banks request their
borrowers to confirm purchases of inputs by periodically presenting invoices for materials and labor,
but the PB is most interested in the degree of successful completion of housing units or facilities at
a site as a basis for tranched subloan releases. This makes sense for loan management, since sub-
loans are usually a percentage of estimated housing completion cost and not tied directly to the
contractor's purchases of inputs.   There should be no concern that payment of subloans against
physical progress at average (rather than actual) construction rates will lead to overpayment, because



52                                                                                CHAPTER 4
each subloan will be limited to only approximately 75% of the estimated total construction cost. (See
Annex 3.4). The PB's project engineer will provide it with a capacity to ensure constructed elements
are consistent with the sub-loan plan and of proper quality before the tranched disbursements are
released.
4.36   In light of the recent development that has taken place within Russian building industry,
developers would be expected to follow commercial practices. Sub-loans for the construction finance
sub-component would be used to finance the construction of housing by a wide variety of small and
large private developers and contractors (see para 3.28). The inputs to construction are mainly
working capital comprised of a large number of separate types of materials, labor (both contracted
and self), equipment, fuel etc. Developers and contractors may either purchase labor through.
contracts or use their own workers; and they may purchase materials or make their own. Developers
and contractors purchase inputs from reliable suppliers whom they can trust. Price is an important
consideration, but may be complemented by factors such as quality differences, availability and
supplier trustworthiness. Larger contractors (who would borrow for larger loans up to $10 million)
are more likely to manufacture their own materials and have a staff of permanent workers. Under
the circumstances and given the variety of large and small developers that might participate in the
sub-component, following specific procurement rules would be difficult. Such requirements would
potentially discourage both smaller and larger developers and therefore hamper the creation of a truly
competitive market.  Also, the services being procured under this line of credit are distinctly
different from the goods being procured under other Bank projects such as the ESP or under the
EMLOC component. Contractors are operating in a competitive environment which will encourage
them to obtain the best price and arrangement for securing needed goods and services.
4.37   Technical Assistance for Procurement. Consultants will be required to assist participating
communities and their Local Project Implementation Units (LPIUs) with staff training and the
development of tender documents and bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. Consulting
services will also be needed to support the LPIUs with contract management functions and the
supervision of construction works. Contract periods for such services are likely to be short-term (up
to 6 months) to long-term (possibly four years for construction supervision services). Consultant
selection would follow the Bank's "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
by the World Bank as Executing Agency ", dated August 1981. The Bank's Standard Form of
Contract for Consultant Services will be used. Short lists, bidding documents, evaluation results,
and contracts and amendments will receive prior review and Bank approval for all contracts with
firms expected to be over US$100,000 each. All Terms of Reference, regardless of size, will be
subject to prior Bank review. It is estimated that about US$21.8 million will be funded by the loan
for consulting services and training. The program envisions a General Consulting Services contract
to cover engineering inspection, procurement, project accounting and reporting activities.  In
addition, there will be approximately twelve contracts for engineering designs and services, averaging
about US$500,000 per contract.  There is expected to be about ten contracts with firms and
individuals for staffing key positions in the PIU, studies of sites, technical analyses, training,
fellowships and evaluations. However these will be smaller and probably will not aggregate to more
than US$2.3 million. Contracts and all related documentation for services by consultant firms over
US$100,000 and by individuals staffing key positions in the PIU's above US$50,000 per contract,
as well as Terms of Reference for all consultancies, will be reviewed in advance by Bank staff, with



CHAPTER 4                                                                           53
"No-objections" issued as required. Contracts with firms and individuals under these levels will be
monitored on an ex-post basis during supervision missions.
4.38  Among their procurement functions, CPIU consultants will advise the five LPIUs and Project
participants on the preparation of standard bidding documents in conformity with Bank requirements
and also help set up activity accounts and confirm construction invoices for disbursement. Bank staff
will conduct prior reviews of approximately ninety-five percent of construction contracts, seventy
percent of equipment purchases, and ninety percent of technical assistance procurement.
4.39   Procurement Reporting.  Procurement information would be collected and recorded as
follows:
a. reporting of contract solicitation, award and amendment information by local communities
or their Project implementation units (LPIUs) would be aggregated by the CPIU and
forwarded through Minstroi to the Bank.
b. comprehensive quarterly reports by LPIUs (as guided by CPIU staff), indicating: (1) overall
procurement progress and Project costing, including current estimates of allowances for
physical and price contingencies; (2) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and
amendment actions, if any; (3) revised schedules of procurement actions, including
advertising, bidding, contract award, disbursement progress and completion times for
individual contracts; and (4) compliance with prior reviews and aggregate limits on specified
methods of Bank-financed procurement.
I.    DISBURSEMENT
4.40  The proposed Project is the first investment project in the housing sector for Russia; therefore
standard disbursement profiles for this country and sector are not available. The Equity Matching
Sub-component uses the same disbursement profile as the ESP. The construction finance component
is based on this but a longer disbursement period is used to reflect the reservation of funds for the
Land Development Sub-component. The Land Development Sub-component is based on the cities'
planning estimates modified by the experience of Bank staff and experience in other urban
development projects in Eastern Europe. The estimated disbursement schedule and chart are given
in Annex 4.4. Table 4.7 gives the categories and amounts to be financed out of the IBRD loan, and
the percentage to be financed in each category. Final engineering designs are expected to be
completed on time and appointment of consultants for Project management will be a condition
for effectiveness (para 7.1.b.2). Given the advanced state of sub-project design on the land
development component, and the relatively simple implementation arrangements for the construction
finance and equity matching components, the proposed disbursement schedule is considered realistic.

4.41   Bank financing would follow normal Bank disbursement procedures as summarized in the
Disbursement Handbook. Loan proceeds would be disbursed against eligible expenditures either
directly to suppliers, by means of special commitments to support letters of credit issued by
borrower's bank in favor of foreign suppliers of goods and services, or by way of reimbursement
to participating private enterprises/agencies where expenditures have already been incurred.
4.42   Disbursements would be made for eligible Project expenditures for:  (a) 80%  of total
expenditures on civil works associated with land development; (b) 100 % of foreign and 80% of
local expenditures for goods associated with land development; (c) 100% of eligible subloans
associated with construction finance and EMLOC components and (d) 100% of eligible technical
cooperation consultant services, studies, and training.
4.43   Disbursements under the Project for the Land Development and EMLOC Sub-components
and for training and technical assistance, would be made against standard documentation except for
goods, consultants, and civil works contracts each valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent which
may be claimed under statements of expenditure (SOE) with related documentation retained by the

CPIU for review by Bank supervision missions. Disbursements for construction sub-loans of US$4
million equivalent under the construction finance Sub-component also may be claimed under SOE
with related documentation retained by the PB for review by Bank supervision missions.
4.44  Disbursement Conditions. At negotiations, The Government agreed to the following
special conditions of disbursement:  (a) For land development and construction finance
subcomponents in a particular city, 7Government to provide evidence of validity of Participating
City Implementation and Loan Agreements; (b)For construction finance and EMLOC, (i)
effectiveness of FIDP loan and (ii) Subsidiary Loani Agreements signed with at least two banks
for EMLOC component and two banks for construction finance Sub-component (para 7.1.c).
J. REPORTING
4.45   Quarterly progress reports covering all components will be prepared by the CPIU and sent
to the World Bank within one month of the end of the quarter in a format to be agreed with the
Bank. The main purpose of the reports will be to provide managers with timely information on
implementation of Project components. It will be the responsibility of the CPIU to set up reporting
guidelines and deadlines so that it receives timely information from the LPIUs and the participating
banks and financial agents in order to prepare the report. The first report will be issued before the
first supervision mission. The quarterly reports will include, inter-alia:
a.    progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key
performance indicators;
b.    the status of all contracts;
C.    work programs and proposed expenditures for the coming quarter;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.    PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SUMMARY
5.1    CPIU. Interministerial Group. Local Project Implementation Units and General Consultant.
The Housing Project requires a strong project management unit for successful implementation of sub-
projects that involve multiple agencies at the federal and local levels, commercial banks, and private
enterprises. The proposed Project will be administered by a Central Project Implementation Unit
(CPIU) that will report to the Minister of the Ministry of Construction and Architecture (Minstroi),
on behalf of the Interministerial Group on Housing Reforms (IMG)'. The Interministerial Group will
provide policy level oversight and guidance for the Project, particularly on issues that will require
interministerial coordination and intervention. Local Project Implementation Units (LPIUs) in each
local government will be responsible for implementation of the land development Sub-component.
The CPIU will be formed out of the currently existing Project Review Unit (PRU), a Bank-supported
group attached to the MINSTROI that has been assisting MINSTROI and the cities with project
preparation and reviews. The IMG already exists and has guided project preparation. The General
Consultant, reporting to the CPIU, will handle the technical functions of the CPIU, including
providing assistance with procurement, project administration, and construction inspection for the
Land Development Sub-component accounting & reporting, as well as assistance in the promotion
and administration of the lines of credit. The costs of staff and equipment for the CPIU, the LPIUs,
and the General Consultant would be financed under the Project.
B.    PROJECT ORGANIZATION
5.2    CPIU Functions. The CPIU will report directly to the Minister of Minstroi and will be
empowered to: (a) recruit and monitor the General Consultant (GC); (b) establish administrative
procedures; (c) open and operate accounts in foreign and local currency; (d) supervise professional
consulting services; (e) review and evaluate proposed land development sub-projects; (f) monitor
compliance and, on an ex-post basis, the eligibility of construction subloans; (g) provide training and
advice on and oversee procurement administration; (h) recommend disbursements; (i) hire auditors
and account for Project funds, including accounts of LPIUs; (j) guide the technical cooperation and
training program. The detailed organizational structure, functions, staffing plans, recruitment of
staff, operational procedures, and authority of the CPIU and the terms of reference for the General
Consultant are presented in Annex 3.8.
1/  The same Interministerial Group that guided preparation would also be responsible for policy oversight
during Project implementation. The IMG was established pursuant to Decree #595 of the Council of Ministers of
June 20, 1993.



58                                                                            CHAPTER 5
5.3    CPIU Staffing. The CPIU will have a small staff headed by a Project Director with overall
responsibility for Project coordination and administration. The Project Director will be selected by
Minstroi. Deputation from the civil service will be allowed for specific assignments. All key CPIU
staff will be expected to have a working knowledge of spoken and written English. The local CPIU
staff would be supported by individual foreign advisors, as appropriate. Most CPIU staff will be
hired under individual consultancy contracts.
5.4   The General Consultant will provide staff support services to the CPIU and technical
assistance to the LPIU's and PB's. The General Consultant will report to the CPIU.  Specific
responsibilities include the following: a) supervise the disbursement and collection of subloans; b)
set up an office including physical place, personnel and complete administrative, communication,
accounting and report systems; c) promote all components of the Project to the Participating Cities,
Participating Banks, private developers, private enterprises, international investors and international
housing technology purveyors; d) identify and resolve implementation problems; e) assist the cities
in procurement and advise on contract supervision; f) Evaluate the progress on the project and
RAP's; f) propose program modifications to redirect resources into the most effect programs; h)
assist the CPIU in managing funds, and in reviewing documents supporting the use of funds by PC's
and PB's; i)certify payments under the land development sub-component; j) cooperate with
supporting technical cooperation efforts for maximum program impact; and k) provide reports to the
Government, local governments, PBs and the Bank. The General Consultant will be selected in
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.  The terms of reference are ready and the
Government is preparing a short list. The General Consultant should be in place by mid 1995.
C.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.5   Land Development. Local Project Implementations Units (LPIUs), administratively attached
to each of the Participating Cities, will be directly responsible for implementing the land development
Sub-component. The CPIU will provide guidance and technical assistance to LPIUs as outlined in
Annex 5.2. In cities where all land development sub-projects are within city boundaries, the LPIU
will report to the mayor. In cities where there are sub-project sites in both the city and the oblast
or krai the LPIU will report to the chairman of the Local Coordinating Committee (LCC). The
LPIU's would provide requested information to the local governments, CPIU, LCC's and the Bank.
5.6   Local Coordinating Committee. LCCs have been established in each Participating City and
will be responsible for: (a) approving the work plans of each LPIU; (b) recommending to the CPIU,
any alterations to the Land Development component; and (c) coordinating the various entities which
will be involved in implementing the Project at the local level.
5.7   Local Project Implementation Unit. The Project implementation functions of the LPIUs will
include the following:  (a) project management, including supervision of detailed sub-project
planning, infrastructure design, environmental analysis, contracting for civil works and construction
supervision; (b) coordinating the implementation of land auctions and land marketing; (c) monitoring
the implementation of regulatory action plans; (d) coordination of local technical cooperation and
training activities; (e) supervision of disbursements from local budgets and loan funds; (f) accounting,
audits and reporting. The LPIUs will require a full-time staff. Some staff may be hired under
consultancy contracts financed by the project.   At negotiations, it was agreed that the



CHAPTER 5_                                                                        59
establishment of a Local Project Implement Unit with adequate staff and the establishment
funding of a project counterpart account would be a condition effectiveness of the Participating
City Loan Agreement between the Federal Government and each Participating City (para 7.c. 1).
The General consultant for project management must be hired as a condition of effectiveness
of the Bank loan to the Government (para. 7.b.2).
5.8   Construction Finance.  Implementation management and arrangements will be the
responsibility of the GC. They will track those of the ESP, except that CPIU of the Housing Project
will take on the functions performed by the Ministry of Finance CPIU in the ESP. Banks eligible
to participate in the component will be limited to those that remain accredited by the Bank Review
Unit of the FIDP. The CPIU, with the assistance of the General Consultant, will (a) administer
Subsidiary Loan Agreements with the participating banks on behalf of the Government; (b) monitor
the procurement and disbursement aspects of the component, which includes providing training and
advice, as needed, to the participating banks and sub-borrowers; (c) submit to the Bank subloan
proposals and other documents requiring their prior approval; (d) monitor, on an ex-post basis, the
eligibility of subloans below the free limit; (e) prepare a yearly review of the lending guidelines and
on-lending arrangements for discussion with the LPRC (see below), the IMG, and Bank; (f) help the
LPIUs and PBs to promote and advertise the line of credit to housing developers; (g) provide regular
reports to Government and to the Bank, and prepare the portion of the Project Completion Report
for the Construction Finance component; and (g) coordinate technical assistance and training to
developers and banks. The IMG plans to appoint a working group, the Loan Policy Review
Committee (LPRC) to review subloans above the free limit ($5 million or a loan greater than 10%
of the bank's capital) and the first two subloans prepared by a commercial bank.
5.9   Eiui_y Matching. The CPIU, with the assistance of the General Consultant, will (a) contract
with the PBs and monitor the performance of the subloans; (b) coordinate technical cooperation and
training; (c) oversee the implementation of audits, accounting and reporting requirements by
participants; and (d) provide ongoing review of building materials standards. The Interministerial
Group (IMG) will provide policy review and management of the Sub-component. The LPRC (a)
approve initial subloans and subloans above the free limit; (b) monitor the performance of the credit
line; and (c) in cooperation with the World Bank, review and revise sub-borrower eligibility criteria,
as necessary. Sub-projects above the minimum qualifying loan size of US$500,000 and below the
free limit of US$5 million that are favorably appraised by the PBs would be forwarded to the World
Bank for disbursement authorization. Sub-projects above US$5 million will be forwarded to both
the Loan Policy Review Committee (a working group set up by the IMG) and the Bank for final
approval. Following subloan approval, the PB would finalize documentation, handle disbursement
requests, reimburse sub-borrowers for qualifying expenses, assure that capital contributions are made
on schedule, monitor the adequacy of collateral, remit repayments to the Ministry of Finance, ensure
that loan agreements are enforced and report periodically to the CPIU on the status of the
component.
D.    IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
5.10  To begin construction during the 1995 construction season, design and engineering contracts
have been supported from USAID project preparation funds. In addition, design contracts may be
eligible for retroactive financing, provided they meet Bank procurement requirements. Additional



60                                                                           CHArER S
design contracts will be awarded upon loan effectiveness. The Project schedule indicates that
following loan effectiveness both LCB and ICB contracts will be awarded for the 1995 construction
season. Project Review Workshops that bring together key members of the Interministerial Group,
the CPIU, LPIUs and local contractors will be held periodically to assess progress in implementation.
For construction finance, start-up activities will focus on training programs in coordination with the
FIDP activities. With equity matching, a Project Launch Workshop will be held within three months
of loan effectiveness. The workshop will bring together key members of the Interministerial Group,
CPIU, and potential investors to discuss the procedures for participation.
E.    SUPERVISION PLAN
5.11   The Project supervision plan is shown in Annex 5.4. The plan includes the schedule for
Bank supervision missions, the skill mix required, staff week input, and cost. During the first year
of the Project, 3-4 Bank supervision missions would be required, followed by about 3 missions
during each of the following years. During negotiations, the Government agreed to hold annual
reviews of the Project, sub-project, action plan and related off-site infrastructure
implementation in order to program investments, reforms, and technical cooperation for the
following year. The program for the following year should be submitted to the Bank for its
approval by September 30 of each year (para 7.a. 1.) One of the supervision missions each year
would be available to work with the Government on these annual reviews. The CPIU will prepare
reports for discussion with the Government and the mission and will provide evidence of necessary
budgetary allocations to carry out the planned work for the coming year.
5.12  Benchmarks for measuring progress in implementation will include the following: (a) the
establishment, staffing and reporting by the CPIU and LPIUs; (b) the hiring of the General
Consultant; (c) the implementation and disbursement progress of land development sub-projects,
construction finance subloans, and equity matching subloans; (d) the passage of regulations and
achievement of specific steps promised under the local Regulatory Action Plans and; (e) the initiation
and implementation of the Technical Cooperation and Training Programs; (f) the holding of the
annual review of progress and the programming for the following year. Annex 5.3 provides details
on specific indicators that will be used to track progress on the sector, city-wide housing market
development, and on the project.

- STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RusSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A.    PROJECT BENEFITS
6.1   Summarv of benefits. The principal benefits would be to reinforce the sector policy dialogue
by: (a) providing tangible evidence to Russians about the value of Government's policy to move
towards competitive housing markets; and (b) demonstrating the range of financing, regulatory, and
institutional tools used to develop real estate in market systems. Specific components would also:
c) break the Government land monopoly; (d) create a transitional mechanism that will catalyze new
direct investment, technology, and management to increase the availability of building materials for
self-help and small scale construction; and (e) develop financial sector capacity in real estate.
Finally, the Project will: (f) increase employment in private construction and building materials
enterprises, (g) increase labor mobility and opportunities for military resettlement and (h) help relieve
pressures on the Government to direct unaffordable subsidies to the construction sector.
6.2   Land Development Sub-component Benefits. This Sub-component will consist of rapidly
introducing land previously under public ownership into the private housing market, and working
with city governments to develop appropriate policies for land. The essential task will be to release
land to private sector builders and developers on a competitive basis without rigid development
constraints, while at the same time preserving basic land use mechanisms that assure that the sites
meet safety, health, welfare and environmental needs of the community. The Sub-component (along
with the Construction Finance Line of Credit) will give particular consideration to development of
real estate property rights, including, for example, real estate registration and titling systems. It will
also introduce a process of transferring land to the private sector that is transparent, and beneficial
to the general public interest. The residential plots will have secure property title and be ready for
immediate residential construction. In addition, the Project will develop fiscally sound finance
mechanisms for providing public sector infrastructure for real estate development.  Finally,
conservative loan-to-value ratios in both this Sub-component and in construction fiance, will mitigate
some of the risk of relative price changes.
6.3    Ouantifiable Benefits on Land Development Sites. Sub-projects with an expected cost of
US$246.7 million have been reviewed by the Bank appraisal mission; and other sub-projects may
be identified, prepared and appraised during Project implementation. The sub-projects already
appraised would have benefits far in excess of their cost. Quantifiable benefit areas follow:



62                         _                                                        CHAPTER 6
1.     Land sales are expected to amount to US$323.3 million;
2.     Housing construction is expected to be in the order of US$890 million; about
US$40 million has been reserved in the construction finance sub-component to
finance a portion of these costs';
3.     Commercial space is expected to sell for an estimated US$411 million;
4.     Taxes generated from housing sales alone are expected to amount to US$300 million;
5.     The Project is expected to stimulate construction of over 22,000 apartments, 8,000
town houses, and 1,000 individual houses;
6.     Construction of housing and commercial space is expected to generate more than
100,000 person years of employmente.
In addition the indirect benefits expected under the Sub-component are:
1.    Primary infrastructure developed under the Project will benefit other sites allowing
for additional development;
2.     Housing construction activity generated by the Project will provide a direct stimulus
to the building materials industry;
3.    Infrastructure development will generate employment;
4.     Income of construction workers spent in the community will have an indirect yet
positive impact on the economy of the cities.
6.4    Many benefits cannot be quantified. For instance, in order to qualify for funding, the cities
will have to implement a range of policy and procedural reforms that will promote competitive land
sales. This will educate and demonstrate to the policy makers and other professionals how the
functioning of market based real estate development tools and procedures work. In the course of
Project implementation, assistance will be provided in instituting market based land allocation
mechanisms, where the market determines the highest and best use of real estate, along with the
basic regulatory and practical framework necessary for the implementation of such procedures and
practices.
6.5    Construction Finance Sub-component Benefits. This component will help build real estate
financing capacity of the banking sector, promote new types of smaller private developers, and
demonstrate the efficiency of the private sector in provision of attractive housing alternatives.
Supported by the technical cooperation program, the Sub-component will introduce real estate
appraisal and underwriting skills to the Russian commercial banking system. It will mitigate the
existing medium term credit shortage and improve the stock of finished dwellings from which to
choose. Smaller private developers who did not have the necessary funds to undertake and finance
1/    Another US$40 million is expected to finance construction on other sites in the five cities plus a
demonstration project in Moscow.
2/  The estimates of person-years are based on the estimates by Russian builders. The Russian estimate of
person-years required for the construction of an average sized apartment unit is 4 person-years, for a town house
it is 3 person-years, and for an individual house it is 5 person-years. An estimated 3 person-days are required per
square meter of commercial space. The analysis presented above is based on 70% of the Russian estimates, on the
assumption of increased construction efficiency.



CHAPrER 6                                                                             63
an entire project will be better disposed to do so if they know that banks are organized to disburse
dedicated funds. Training will help developers cope with the credit application procedure and project
management. Lending guidelines would promote demonstration sub-projects that are particularly
desirable from housing sector, energy efficiency, and environmental perspectives by emphasizing:
(a) affordable housing for the middle class; (b) private initiatives in infrastructure; (c) new types of
housing and materials; (d) completion of unfinished housing; (e) rehabilitation of existing stock; and
(f) mixed use development. Moreover, the eligibility of construction finance sub-projects in each
city will be contingent upon the implementation of the Regulatory Action Plan by the city.
Construction finance to private developers will be available to build infrastructure as well as
buildings. This will promote competition between private developers and municipally provided
infrastructure, such as that financed during the land development Sub-component.
6.6    Eauity Matching Line. The kombinats produced materials for an inefficient technology.
These materials are notoriously energy intensive, use excessive amounts of other inputs, and can only
be used by large construction organizations constructing high rise buildings on large sites. This
component will leverage the private equity finance in sub-projects, particularly from foreign
investors, that domestically produce and distribute commercially viable energy efficient materials.
The reliance on equity and the assumption by commercial banks of the lending risk will depoliticize
lending decisions while safeguarding full cost recovery. The requirement for domestic production
will generate permanent jobs in domestic value-added industries.
B.    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.7    An Inefficient Housing Sector. While all sectors of the Russian economy are distorted and
inefficient, the housing sector has been arguably among the worst. Land use is perverse, land supply
is still government controlled, and queues for housing remain long. Russian households -- and the
labor force -- are still captives of the remnants of central planning.  Enterprise restructuring in
Russia, and the closure of loss-making enterprises, will be politically and economically difficult until
housing markets function at minimally acceptable levels, facilitating labor mobility.
6.8    Relieving SuRplv Constraints is First Priority. The Government is starting to liberalize
housing demand by issuing vouchers to help households purchase a home of their choice. This is
a desirable policy, for it shifts construction subsidies from housing providers to households
themselves. However, policies that subsidize demand will prove unsustainable unless supply
bottlenecks are also reduced. The Project aims to do this in a systematic way in a few cities. The
proposed approach is to free land to its highest and best use, remove bottlenecks to the production
of commercially viable building products, and facilitate a development process for construction and
rehabilitation that responds to undistorted market demand.
6.9    Wealth Distribution. The proposed Project does not use housing production as an instrument
of income and wealth redistribution -- a policy that inevitably distorts markets. Future projects
supported by the Bank or others may address that issue. Relative to the level and distribution of
wealth in Russia, there is a surplus of what may euphemistically be called "lower market" housing.
Any new production built with western quality materials to western standards will, by definition, be
considered better housing. The objective is not to produce more Khruschev-type boxes, but to build
somewhat better -- though still modest -- housing of the type consumers demand in good locations.



64                                                                          CHAmR 6
The resulting vacancies will prompt desirable housing and employment shifts, creating wealth and
income for all.
6.10  Production Cuts.  The housing reforms have thus far decentralized land holdings and
privatized building kombinats, while sharply curtailing budget subsidies. The reduction of subsidies
has sharply cut publicly financed construction in particular and housing production in general. New
private firms cannot fill the gap, partly due to the non-availability of credit from the still emerging
commercial banking system. Unless alternative means are found to increase production, the
Government will be tempted to issue inflationary credits to inefficient former state construction
kombinats and building materials enterprises.
6.11  Competition is Important Now. Local governments still retain strong monopolistic control
over development rights and access to all building resources. If competition is not introduced into
land and building industries before the political power of monopolistic forces becomes entrenched,
the opportunity for reform will likely be lost. In this context, the Project will emphasize competition
by liberalizing the supply of developable urban land; by emphasizing a competitive private sector;
by introducing competitive bidding for public works; and by developing a competitive building
materials industry.
C.    PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
6.12  The Project is designed to promote creation of housing markets and does not have a specific
poverty alleviation focus. In transition to markets, the first priority is not to build new low-income
housing, but to allow people to begin moving; thereby freeing up existing units for others. The
Government has stressed in discussions that Russia has an oversupply of social housing suitable for
low-income households, but a severe shortage of housing for those who have the resources to move
out of the social housing stock and acquire better housing. The Government emphasized that the
Project should focus on creating housing markets that would implement these reforms at a local level
to help develop private property rights in real estate. In addition, the Government rejected the idea
of constructing new social housing, because; it goes directly against the thrust of hard-won market
reforms in the sector; relative over-supply of social housing exists; it would tend to revive the old-
style building kombinats; and because it could not be done on a replicable basis with reasonable cost
recovery.
6.13  As currently designed, the Project would target families below the highest income levels by
using developer and underwriting caps-- e.g. maximum loan sizes and residential plot areas --
through both the land development and construction finance Sub-components. This Project would
encourage the private sector to expand its activities by moving down the income scale, but it would
not, in the short term, target genuinely poor groups. In proposing sub-projects, cities were not asked
to target specific population or income groups, but they have generally understood the basic concept
of satisfying market demand by configuring designs to keep infrastructure costs low and to encourage
smaller units where the market has more depth.
6.14  Affordability Analysis for Land Development Sub-proiects. A detailed Affordability Analysis
was carried out, for housing proposed under the Land Development Sub-component, based on data
from households surveys. The Affordability Analysis is presented in Annex 3.2, Attachment D; the



CHAwm  6                                                                              65
results of the surveys are sunmmarized in Annex 1.4. The surveys found that substantial demand
exists for the housing that will be built under the Sub-component. Following are the summaries of
findings under the Affordability Analysis:
1.    Apartments, which are 70.3% of total number of dwelling units proposed, will be
affordable to 10%-40% of the household population across the five participating
cities; town houses, which are 26.3% of total number of units proposed, will be
affordable to 0.5%-30% of the same number of households, while the single family
houses, 3.4% of total number of dwelling units proposed in the first pipeline of sub-
projects, are affordable to 0.1% - 0.6% of households that can privatize their
apartments across the five participating cities.
2.    A large number of houses will be affordable to an acceptably large segment of the
population. The median dwelling price ($32,000) is affordable by 20% of families in
the five cities, and the median apartment price ($28,000) will be affordable by 30%
of families.
3.     When compared with the percentage of market that the dwelling units will constitute,
its apparent that families that will occupy the Land Development sites will represent
less than 5 % of the universe of those that could afford them. In other words, the
project is reaching out to a fairly large segment of the population, in terms of their
ability to afford such housing. In addition, the number of units fnanced in the
project will in no way constitute an oversupply in the expected price ranges.

The guidelines for construction funance eligibility provide caps on the size of units (e.g. 80 M2 for
apartments, 120 M2 for town houses, and 150 M2 for both detached and semi-detached single-family
houses.) There are also caps on the maximum credit amounts per unit. In addition, guide-lines
cover efficiency requirements in terms of lot sizes, percentage of marketable area on sites etc.
These guidelines will direct the use of Bank support for a wide range of dwelling types, but such
dwellings must be modest to qualify. The use of construction finance for completion of unfinished
housing will result in housing that is particularly affordable to households of most income. In
addition, the construction finance sub-component provides support for rehabilitation of existing
housing, though this is not the principal focus of the sub-component. An analysis of the pipeline
of new sub-projects presented by the developers in the five cities (see Annex 3.4, Attachment A and
B), shows that proposed sub-projects are affordable to a broad segment of the population in the cities
with at least 50% of the units proposed in the initial pipeline of sub-projects, being affordable to at
least 57 % of the population. The figure above shows the pipeline in relation to income distribution.
D.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
6.16   The Project is rated in Category B. An Environmental Review (ER) assessments of proposed
land development sites in the initial pipeline have been carried out. A summary of findings of this
ER appears in Annex 3.9. The ER has been made available to the Public Information Center of the
Bank. The main environmental concerns on the land development side would relate to the
infrastructure deficits and a lack of comprehensive information on soil conditions. As a result of
such concerns, construction in Rostov was dropped from the Project due to infrastructure deficits and
a construction moratorium. Water and sewer infrastructure in Rostov would be reviewed by Bank
missions as the subject of a possible separate Bank infrastructure project. In addition, due to the
already over-stressed water and wastewater systems in St. Petersburg, the Government has agreed
to a mitigation plan costing some US$25 million that would improve small but discrete portions of
the water and sewer system serving all of the sites in the northern region of St. Petersburg.3 The
St. Petersburg authorities have written a formal letter to the Bank expressing their willingness to
fmance these facilities from the loan and indicated that they do not need to inmmediately finance this
package with some of the US$250 million of off-site infrastructure which was previously requested
as part of the loan. This responds to the concerns expressed by the Bank that mitigation plans be
prepared to assure that the housing constructed under the Project will not reduce treated water
supplies to existing population nor increase pollution in the Bay of Finland. Progress in carrying
out the intentions of the St. Petersburg authorities would be part of the annual evaluations of project
implementation and would influence decisions on whether to proceed for the following offer's
program. Regarding soils issues, international engineering consultants have examined each of the
sites and determined that there are no obvious problems with regard to soils. Bank missions also
were provided with certifications on the safety of soils by relevant Governmental officials. Despite
these assurances, given the possibilities of pre-existing issues in industrialized areas of the FSU,
missions insisted on reviewing detailed data on soils. These data would be provided during the
course of detailed engineering, in accordance with detailed guidelines provided by Bank missions.
3/  Specific actions would include a) constructing a 6km water main; and b) completing capacity additions
to the Northern Wastewater Treatment Plant and diverting raw sewage outfalls to treatment facilities.



CHAPTER 6                                                                             67
Relocation of some 16 families is foreseen in Novgorod during the second phase of the project. This
would be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines.
6.17   Environmental guidelines for the construction finance and building materials components
would be identical with the ESP, and would, in addition, give priority to environmentally-friendly
new building technologies. The guidelines include a procedure for ranking potential sub-projects
based on the expected scope of their environmental impact, and the completion of appropriate levels
of environmental review and approval in accordance with the procedures established in the ESP
environmental manual.
E.    PROJECT RISKS
6.18   Summarv.  The Project is subject to a number of specific risks.  The Bank's lack of
experience with project implementation in Russia would be offset by careful sub-project preparation,
emphasis on early procurement activities, and extensive capacity-building technical assistance. In
addition, large physical contingencies would partially offset the difficulty of assessing costs in
Russia's rapidly changing macro-economic environment. While the political risk that reforms will
falter is endemic, the Government has shown sustained commitment thus far, particularly in housing
sector reforms. Moreover, such reforrms are supported by the population, and have a high
probability of continuing. Special studies show that effective demand is strong in the five cities and
would continue to be monitored throughout Project implementation. Moreover, should existing
demand falter, the Project would have flexibility to move funds among components and among cities
during implementation.
6.19   Land Development. More specifically, on land development, the principal risk is that there
is no robust land market to provide market-comparable land valuations. By working through local
governments, the Project could perpetuate the past planning failures. The Project has countered this
risk through five separate and independent sources to verify the demand for the quantity, quality,
location and expected price of the housing that will eventually be produced on the proposed sites.
These verifications include: (a) housing market surveys4 in each city supervised by an internationally
recognized consulting firm; (b) separate surveys in St. Petersburg and Novgorod by a Russian
consultant to determine the sources of funds to purchase housing; (c) a series of briefings with real-
estate brokers, soliciting specific reactions to the proposed sites; (d) meetings with "at risk" private
developers; and (e) an independent check on housing transactions, sales prices, income and capital
assets conducted by a statistical economist employing recent and historic data. The second risk is
that land remains a speculative store of value against inflation. Land prices could be highly volatile
and cities could be encouraged to become land speculators, withholding supply. The Project is
responding to this risk by focusing on land disposition policies as a prerequisite for financing. By
using auctions for land and commercial banking finance for housing, the Project is designed to
minimize the risk that local governments will treat the Project as a grant, not as a loan.
6.20  Construction Finance. On construction finance, the Project faces three principal risks. The
first risk may be attributable to institutional weaknesses. Private commercial banks are new to
4/  Including a household survey, transaction survey, and developer survey in each of the proposed cities.



68                                                                             CHAFFER 6
commercial banking functions and term financing would be an added element of risk for them. The
FIDP would provide the general technical assistance related to commercial banking procedures.
Specific technical cooperation in real estate appraisal and underwriting would be provided to the
banks during Project implementation. The second risk stems from the considerable price distortions
due to unstable macroeconomic situations and inflation in the housing sector itself. Some degree of
alleviation is provided by the fact that the subloan will finance demonstration projects which will
have a high advertising coverage and consequently will sell easily. The third risk associated with
many lines of credit is a lack of loan demand due to procurement rules which are difficult for
established developers (and newcomers alike) to apply. This risk has been substantially alleviated
by allowing developers to undertake their procurement in accordance with established commercial
practices in which disbursement is founded on the percentage of completion rather than reviewing
specific subcontracts.
6.21   Equitv Matching. On equity matching, the first risk is that reform will whither and barriers
to competition from new entrances will be fortified. In this event, equity investors will not be
interested, the component will not disburse, and funds allocated will be cancelled or used by the
other components. The second risk is that the proceeds of the loan will flow to corrupt enterprises,
resulting in the misdirection of funds. This risk is mitigated by the "due diligence" process in
checking equity contributions and feasibility studies and also by requirements of eligible investors
and shareholders. The third risk is the PBs would be unwilling to make the term loans (2-8 years)
for the component. The risk is greater for the relatively longer term lending (4-8 years). If this
happens, some otherwise viable ventures would not receive findings and the EMLOC sub-component
would take longer to disburse. The Government is on notice that if the EMLOC is not 20%
committed within one year of effectiveness, the Bank may exercise its privilege under the General
Conditions to cancel the component and reduce the corresponding amount of the loan.

PENDING FEDERAL LEGISLATION
The Civil Code                The Civil Code is the major initiative in civil  Part One enacted
legislation. Its relevance  to housing and urban  October 21, 1994
development lies in its extensive provisions on
fundamental property rights, including rights to land,
buildings and housing; the definitions of forms of
property tenures; as well as its civil law framework
for the contractual relationships necessary for financial
and property markets. Part One of the Code was
enacted on October 21, 1994, but effectiveness of the
land provisions of the code (Chapter 17) was made
subject to enactment of a new land code.
The Land Code                 The Land Code is a revision of the existing 1991   End of 1994
Land Code intended to bring the land law into
compliance with changes to the Constitution and the
accumulated changes to land rights made through
Presidential Decree and other Federal Law since
1991. Competing versions of the Code have been
introduced into the Duma by the State Land and
Property Committees.  If either of those drafts is
enacted, the Code would firmly establish some of the
conceptual progress of recent years, create several
new rights, including the general right to own land for
any entrepreneurial purpose and the right of juridical
entities to own land, but would also retain many of the
fundamental land concepts of the Soviet era, most
particularly the peculiar forms of property tenure and
extensive state control over the use of agricultural
land. However, at this time a draft prepared by
agrarian interests in the Duma, which is more
conservative than the other drafts, appears to be the
focus of legislative attention. In the opinion of some,
the enactment of the agrarian draft would be a
temporary setback for landed property rights.

The Housing Code             The Housing Code is a restatement of the existing  Mid-1995
1982 Code intended to codify the many changes to
housing law made since 1992 and begin to focus some
attention of the law on the needs of private markets
rather than the social housing sector.   While
considered important, the Housing Code is not a
priority of the government, perhaps partially because
the housing privatization and reform efforts have been
proceeding so well under a combination of new
federal laws, resolutions and decrees enacted in the
past few years. Enactment of the Code is on the
current legislative agenda but it is unlikely to be
enacted before mid-1995.
Law of Title Registration    The State Land Committee, State Property Committee  Mid-1995
and Ministry of Justice have been authorized under
Presidential Decree 2130 to prepare the law and
procedure for a national system of unified real estate
registration. The bureaucratic conflicts between the
Land and Property Committees over which agency
will have control over the system have prevented
action. Roskomzem prepared and delivered to the
Property Committee in May, 1994 a complete draft of
registration law and accompanying documentation, but
this draft has not moved. While there is no law
officially before the Diuma, the Duma has through
working committees taken up the issue on its own,
and has prepared a draft law. Pressure is building to
reach resolution of this issue in 1995, some of which
is caused by the condition included in World Bank
loan No. 3756-Ru, that an acceptable title registration
system be adopted.
Law of Real Estate Mortgage    The Ministry of the Economy has drafted and  Mid-1995
submitted to the Duma on behalf of the Government a
draft Law On Real Estate Mortgage. The law is
essentially a code that detaiis the broad provisions on
real estate mortgage found in the 1992 Russian Law
On Collateral.  It would clarify rights, forms,
procedures, registration and enforcement. While it is
on the President's legislative agenda, and considered a
priority, the accumulated legislation to date, including
the President's June 10, 1994 Decree On Housing
Credits, may be sufficient for the time being. In any
event, the law is likely to take a lower priority to the
issue of title registration when that law ultimately is
brought before the Duma.  In October, 1994 an
Interminsterial Committee was empaneled to resolve
differences in drafting a mortgage law.



ANNEX 1.1                  _                                                                   79
Law on Urban Planning        The pending Law on Urban Planning would be a code  Mid-1995
detailing the 1992 Fundamentals of Town Planning
and introducing several new concepts such as area
wide zoning. Its intended purpose is to move away
from federal control of local planning and land use,
which has happened de facto in any case, and to
establish more flexible planning principles to be
implemented by localities. Prepared by Minstroi, as
might be expected, recent drafts nevertheless retain
significant federal involvement in planning and land
use issues. A draft of the law was submitted to the
Duma in June, 1994. It is of low priority, and it is
possible that the issues will be addressed in a
Presidential Decree before a law can be enacted. A
related law on functional zoning of urban territories
has been prepared by Minstroi and circulated in the
govermment for comments.
Law on Condominium           The February, 1994 Council of Ministers provisional  Mid-1995
Regulation On Condominiums was to be followed in
September,  1994  with  a  national  law  and
recommended form of condominium charter. The law
is being prepared by Minstroi at this time. While it is
unlikely to be enacted on schedule, it will likely be
enacted in 1995. In any event, the absence of the law
has not created any serious obstacles to progress, as
many Russian cities are proceeding with condominium
formation on the basis of the provisional regulation,
their own regulations and legal documents of their
own design.
Regulation on Land           Several attempts have been made to enact a regulation   End of 1994
Privatization                governing the privatization of land by municipalities
and regions through auction and competitive tender
processes. A December 10, 1993 regulation issued by
the Council of Ministers was revoked on December
24, 1993 by a Decree of the President. A new draft
has been prepared by Roskomzem. As in other areas
of the law, the importance of the regulation is unclear;
some cities and regions take the position that the use
of auction and competitive tender is already sanctioned
under federal law and they proceed on the basis of
regulations of their own design. Where there is a
local will to proceed, the absence of this law has
apparently not been viewed as an impediment.

HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 1.2
APPLICATION OF LAWS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL
A.   PROPERTY RIGHTS TO LAND AND HOUSING
1.    This Annex contains a review of local regulatory actions including the current implementation
status federal housing and land legislation. Also attached is a brief summary of local regulatory
programs and pending laws in a table format.
2.    Sale or grant of individual building lots to citizens for individual home construction is
widespread and has been pursued to some extent in each of the cities in which the housing project
will operate. The City of Nizhny Novgorod, for example, has conveyed several thousand individual
construction lots into private ownership.
3-.    It has become commonplace in Russia for local governments and collective farms to convey
land for subdivision to developers under right of lease, use or construction, with the expectation that
upon construction of the housing the housing purchaser will apply to the local administration for
ownership of the plot of land on which the house is located. The process is described in detail in
Butler, The Legal Basis for Land Allocation in the Russian Federation, The Urban Institute, 1993.
4.    Each of the participating localities has at least one experience of conveying land to domestic
or foreign developer or investors for the development of private sector housing.
5.    Most of the localities participating in the program have taken steps to create a process for
allocation of land plots. The Oblast of Nizhny Novgorod, for example, has enacted a regulation
on the auction and tender of land plots and has recently held two auctions of plots - the first of
individual construction sites and the second of garden plots. The City of Nizhny Novgorod has
prepared drafts of a municipal policy on land allocation and its own regulation for auction or tender
of municipal land.
6.    The City of Novgorod has also prepared draft local regulation on auction and tender of land
plots as well as drafts of the necessary conveyancing documents such as contracts of purchase and
sale of individual land plots and lease contracts for other land conveyances.
7.    St. Petersburg has recently enacted its regulation (No. 585-r, June 6, 1994) on the auction
and tender of municipal property, and has begun to dispose of municipal property under the
supervision of the City Investment Tender Commission created under the regulation.

B.    REGISTATION OF PROPERTY TrrLEs
8.    Each of the participating localities has some system of registering titles to land and privatized
housing. The systems now in place generally consist of registration of land interests with the local
land committee and registration of interests in housing with the local Bureau of Technical Inventory
("BTI") or a specially designated housing registry. However, each of the cities is taking steps
beyond the existing system of registration with designs for creating modem systems of juridical,
fiscal and physical cadastre.
9.     St. Petersburg. The City Land Committee has been working in cooperation with other local
agencies, in particular the Tax Inspectorate, for over a year on implementing a unified system of title
registration.  The Land Committee has also worked with various foreign consultants o the
development of appropriate hardware and software systems to create a unified system of juridical,
fiscal and physical cadastre for the entire city. The system has been demonstrated and refined and
now awaits implementation if and when the necessary funding becomes available.
10.    Barnaul. The City of Barnaul has designated the local BTI to create and operate for the city
a unified system of title registration that would register interests in land and structures. The system
would collect data from the land committee on land rights and together with the data on rights to
housing and other structures already held by the BTI create a unified, legally sanctioned title registry.
11.   Novgorod. The city land committee and BTI have begun a program of consolidating
registration data on land and structures with the aim of creating a single, unified title registry. A
this time the two agencies are using the same registration software.
12.   Nizhnv Novgorod. The City of Nizhny Novgorod has created a City Cadastre Bureau with
the mandate to experiment with the consolidation of real estate registration data into a single, unified
legal registry. The city is presently drafting regulations and procedures for registration that will
implement the unified registry by Fall of 1994.
13.   Tver. The City of Tver has created a municipal working group to plan the creation of a
single, unified title registry for land and structures.
C.    MORTGAGE
14.   Lending institutions throughout Russia are beginning to implement mortgage lending
programs, primarily for individual home purchase or construction . In the participating localities,
the Nizhny Novgorod Land Bank, in cooperation with the Oblast, which is providing home purchase
down payment subsidies, and the local GAZ Motor Works, which is providing repayment guarantees
for its employees, has begun a program of individual mortgage lending. Similar programs have been
begun in Moscow by Mossbusinessbank and Menatep Bank for their own employees. There has
been created an Association of Russian Mortgage Banks having over 50 members to act as trade
association to promote private mortgage lending.

D. HOUSING REFORM
15.    As of July 1, 1994, all of the participating localities have begun a program of increases in
rents and communal services charges.
16.    Under the authority of the Provisional Regulation On Condominium, several Russian
cities, most prominently Ryazan and Yaroslavl, have begun aggressive programs of creating
condominium associations in privatized buildings. To date, Ryazan has created approximately 15
operating condominium associations.

ANNEX 1.3
HOUSING POLICY IN RUSSiA
A.    INTRODUCTION
1.    The following is a summary of the legislation and decrees that best describe the Housing
Policy in Russia today. This statement of Housing Policy has been prepared by the Department of
Housing Policy of Minstroi, on behalf of the Interministerial Group on Housing Reforms.
2.    Since the summer of 1991, the Russian Federation has made significant progress in building
the legislative foundation for private ownership for housing. The rights of private ownership and
sale of residential property has been incorporated into the USSR and Russian Federation Laws on
Ownership within the period before the reforms started (Laws of 1981 and 1983). The Law "On
Privatization of the Housing Stock in the Russian Federation" enacted in 1991 and amended in
December 1992, ("On Introduction of Changes and Amendments to the Law of the RSFSR "On
Privatization of the Housing Stock in the Russian Federation," No. 4199-1), while primarily a
vehicle for transferring state and municipal property to private ownership, has also established the
rights to own and freely dispose of residential property (Article 3). The Law On Fundamentals of
Federal Housing Policy (December 24, 1992, No. 4219-1) establishes the rights to own, use, dispose
of and mortgage residential property (Article 6). Such rights extend not only to the individual
owner, but to those natural or juridical persons who build housing for profit -- the "developers," as
defined in the Fundamentals of Federal Housing Policy. ' Combined with the private property rights
to land for residential use, the ownership of a permanent or summer home in Russia today is taking
the shape of the equivalent ownership rights as that existing in market economies.
3.    A comprehensive statement describing the Russian Housing Policy must wait for the
enactment of the restatement of the Housing Code. Until then the Law on Fundanental of Federal
Housing Policy (December 24, 1993), "Housing" State Targeted Program (June 20, 1993) and a
recent set of decrees and legislation describe the nature of Russian housing policy. This annex
presents a summary adopted from the decrees and legislation that best describe the Housing Policy
in Russia today.
B.    A SUmmARY OF ENABLING REGULATORY FRAMWORK
4.    The New Civil Code. The Civil Code of the Russian Federation enacted on October, 1994,
promises to have far reaching effects on all aspects of land and housing relationships. The new code
deals in a fundamental way with issues of property rights of land and housing as well as contractual
1/ However, developers, being juridical persons, do not have the right of absolute ownership of land. They
are limited to use rights and leasing of land.



90                        -                                                      ANNEx 1.3
relationships involved in purchase, sale, and mortgage of real estate. The law was enacted only
recently, and is dependent on enactment of additional laws (including the land code, condominium,
registration, and mortgage laws), so it is too early to assess its ultimate impact.
5.    The New Constitution.  The housing provisions of the new constitution (Article 25 on
inviolability of a house and Article 40) reaffirms the right to housing and postulates that the federal
and lower levels of government "encourage housing construction and create the conditions for
exercising the right to housing." The final provision, however, gives the state the task to
provide housing "free or at affordable cost to low-income and other citizens indicated in the law."
This represents a shift from the amendments to the prior constitution a year earlier which provided
all citizens who needed to improve their living conditions with a right to rent free housing within the
norm. Article 40 reasserts state responsibility towards groups of law income citizens with special
status and harkens back to the pre-perestroika constitutional guarantee of government provision of
low cost housing to all citizens.
6.    Housinz Privatization. The law "On the Privatization of the Housing Stock in the Russian
Federation" is one of the key policy initiatives in the sector. Enacted in July 1991, it lays the
groundwork on reorienting the housing sector towards market principles. The law is built on the
previous legislation and the ideas put forth in the preceding months by several cities. It was amended
in December 1992 to accelerate the rate of privatization. One of the most far reaching changes
implied by this amendment was to make free-of-charge privatization mandatory.
7.     Law on Fundamentals of Federal Housinz Policy. Enacted in December 1992, the Law on
Fundamentals of Federal Housing Policy constitutes the basic law on housing rights. The Law lays
down a general enabling framework for more specific pieces of legislation. The law defines (a) the
concept of real estate and the rights of home ownership, (b) requires local governments to provide
or sell to individuals and developers with plots of land for housing construction, (c) enables
provisions for condominium associations, (d) calls for the gradual phasing out of subsidized rents,
(e) introduces housing allowances for groups with special status under the law, and (e) lays the
ground for mortgage funance by introducing the concept of eviction. These laws fundamentally alter
the economics of the Russian social housing sector by increasing rents, utility and maintenance costs
to market levels and basing housing subsidies on demonstrated financial need. To implement key
provisions of the Law, the Government has enacted several Presidential Decrees. The salient ones
among these are reviewed in the sections below.
8.     "Housin2" State Targeted Program.  Approved by the Government on June 20, 1993, the
program is the most comprehensive policy statement available for the sector as a whole. Although
it is largely an amplification of the contents of the major pieces of legislation already enacted, but
it also outlines new policy initiatives. For instance, the program introduces tax incentives for
housing, recommends to establish the Agency for Mortgage Lending to act as a liquidity facility and
regulator for long-term housing lending, and calls for a major shift in the housing production, away
from heavy panel buildings to single-family and cooperative housing.

C.    POLICIES RELATING TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE HOUSING SECTOR
9.    Increasing Rents and Introducing Housing Allowances. The program introduced in the
Fundamentals was implemented in the Council of Ministers - Government of the Russian Federation
Resolution "On Transition to a New System for Rent and Communal Services Payment and the
Procedure of Providing Compensation (Subsidies) to Citizens for Rent and Communal Services
Payments" (No. 935, September 22, 1993). This regulation provided a phased schedule for
eliminating subsidies to communal services organizations, authorized the local programs of housing
allowances, and required public housing maintenance organizations to convert to contractual
relationships with municipalities.
The five-year phased program anticipated by the Fundamentals and Resolution 935 was recently
modified by Council of Ministers Resolution, "On Additions to the Resolution of the Council of
Ministers of September 22, 1993, No. 935" (Council of Ministers Resolution No. 1329, December
23, 1993) which authorized localities to design their own timetable for rent and communal
adjustments based upon their economic condition and ability to implement housing allowances,
provided that the entire phase out process is to be completed by 1998.
10.   Condominiun Laws.  In the private housing sector, Federal regulations on condominiums
were enacted in Council of Ministers Resolution "On Approval of Temporary Provisional Regulations
On Condominium" (No. 2275, December 23, 1993). This regulation provides the basic legal
framework for creating condominium associations in privatized buildings. having three or more
owners. Under the regulation, legal entities who are owners of housing, including municipalities are
treated as members of the associations, participating and paying charges in proportion to the
remaining units that they own. The provisional regulation calls for the enactment of a law on
Condominium in September, 1994, along with promulgation of a model charter of foundation
document for condominium associations. To date, neither of these documents have been enacted.
11.   Housing Finance. The 1992 Russian Federation Law On Collateral establishes the legal
support for mortgaging interests in land and other real estate2. The law is sufficient in itself for
purposes of authorizing and describing the contents and legal implications of mortgages affecting
interests in structures, but defers to the "land legislation" of the Federation with respect to mortgages
of land. The land legislation of the Federation should properly be deemed to include the 1991 Land
Code and the Presidential Decrees discussed above, particularly No. 1767 On the Regulation of Land
Relationships and the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia, which specifically authorizes
owners to mortgage land (Para 2). While the Decree On the Regulation of Land Relationships
appears to address mortgage of land only by "owners," a more recent Presidential decree, discussed
below, speaks in terms of mortgaging any interests in land.
12.   The right to mortgage residential property is explicitly recognized in the Fundamentals of
Federal Housing Policy (Article 6). Moreover, the role of private sector mortgage lending is a
2/ Mortgages on land and structural objects 'closely connected to land' are described under the continental
terminology of 'hypothec," while the term 'mortgage' is applied to security agreements affecting other types of
collateral.

fundamental premise of the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation "On Developing and
Implementing Non-Budgetary Forms of Investments in the Housing Sphere" (No. 2281, December
24, 1993). One of the main objectives of that Decree is to encourage private investment, including
mortgage lending, in housing.
13.   The most recent enactment on mortgage rights is found in the President's Decree On Housing
Credits (No. 1180, June 10, 1994), issued pursuant to the "Fundamentals of Federal Housing Policy'
and 'On Developing and Implementing Non-Budgetary Forms of Investments." The purpose of the
decree is to establish that legal entities and individual citizens of the Russian Federation will borrow
the resources for housing construction and renovation, housing purchase,
and improvement of land on a commercial basis. The decree goes on to exhort the executive power
bodies of the Federation to stimulate the allocation or sale of land plots for housing construction to
citizens and legal entities. The decree "On Housing Credits" specifically authorizes (1) using
interests in owned land plots, completed and uncompleted structures, or any other property rights
to land and structures (e.g., right of use) as the collateral for mortgage agreements, (2) allocation
of mortgage finance to developers, investors and contractors developing housing in the private sector,
and (3) the right of a mortgage lender to foreclose.
14.   A comprehensive law on mortgage has yet to be enacted in the Russian Federation. A draft
Russian Federation Law On Mortgage was submitted for approval of Russian Federation
Government on May 27, 1994, and upon approval will be submitted to the State Duma. The law
would clarify most aspects of real estate finance, including legal rights and relationships, procedures
for registration and enforcement. Moreover, further support for the concept of real estate mortgage
is found in the pending Civil and Land Codes of the Russian Federation. While all of these laws
are included in the President's 1994 legislative program, it is difficult to predict if and when they
will be enacted.
15.   Land. The December, 1993, Constitution of the Russian Federation is the law that clearly
expresses the rights of Russian "citizens and their associations" to own, use and dispose of land
(Arficle 36). That general assertion of rights is qualified by the limitation that the "conditions and
procedures" of the use of land are defined on the basis of Russian Federal law (Article 36). The
remaining legal framework that regulates land relations consists of the 1991 Land Code and a host
of Presidential Decrees passed since December 1991. Land use is strictly regulated by local and
regional planning bodies and zoning laws with designated land uses for nearly every land plot
according to a master planning document that is often inflexible to market demands for land use.
16.   Legislation enacted both before and since enactment of the new Russian Constitution further
defines property rights in land. The history of Russian Federation land legislation since perestroika
has been one of gradual liberalization. The earliest relevant Presidential Decree "On Urgent
Measures to Implement Land Reform in the RSFSR" (No. 2, December 27, 1991), established the
right of citizens to obtain land in ownership or lease from local administrations through competitive
auctions, but placed significant restrictions on the right to dispose of the land. This was followed
by several laws which have not only reaffirmed the right of citizens to own and use land plots for
specifically defined purposes, primarily garden plots and individual residential construction, but have
also eliminated restrictions on the right to freely dispose of those plots in market transactions.

ANNEX 1.3                                                                           93
17.   Land ownership in the Russian Federation continues to be limited to the right of citizens to
own, use and dispose of land plots for specifically defined purposes. Legal entities, including
developers of land plots for residential construction, may obtain use rights or leases to the land.
After construction, property rights in the structure are transferred from developer to citizen and then
citizens complete a procedure with the local land committee for obtaining ownership rights in the
land plot. As further evidence of the lack of full ownership rights of developers, in many areas,
local administrations will revoke land rights from developers who do not begin construction within
a designated time period (typically 2 years). The July Presidential Decree on privatization contains
a provision which states that privatized enterprises own the land on which they are located. Its
existence and possible significance should be noted.
18.   Land Privatization Procedures.  The Presidential Decree "On the Regulation of Land
Relationships and the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia" (No. 1767, October 27, 1993)
is presently the key policy document in land transactions. Among other things, it (1) allows free
disposition, including mortgage, of land owned by natural persons; (2) requires registration of land
interests and issuance of certificates of title; (3) allows holders of lesser forms of tenure to upgrade
their tide to ownership upon request; and (4) establishes that localities may sell land through auction
or other competitive procedures. This decree provides significant guidance on issues of tide
registration.
19.   The 1991 Land Code was amended by Presidential Decree No. 2287 "On Bringing the Land
Code of the Russian Federation Into Conformity With the Russia Constitution" (December 24, 1993),
transfers much responsibility for land allocation from local soviets and places it in the hands of local
governments. Presidential Decree No. 1767 also called for enactment of a Federal regulation
governing such competitive land disposition procedures. Regulations to this effect promulgated by
the Council of Ministers on December 10, 1993 were revoked two weeks later, on December 24,
1993, in Presidential Decree No. 2287. Consequendy, no federal regulation governing competitive
allocation of land presently exists.  Many localities have accepted the proposition that local
privaization through competitive procedures is generally authorized under the terms of Decree No.
1767 and are proceeding to prepare their own local regulations pending enactment of a federal rules.
20.   Registration of Propertv Rights. With respect to registration of ownership and use of land,
the governing law is Presidential Decree No.1767, "On the Regulation of Land Relationships and
the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia", which requires that ownership or right of use be
registered with the local land conmmittee by registration of a notarized contract. The land committee
in turn is required to issue a certificate of title to each interest holder. In fact, this process of
registration and issuance of title certificate is widespread in most localities at this time. The process
occurs pursuant to provisional 'land book" regulations and forms issued by the Roskomzem which
is distributed to the local land committees.
21.   Russian regulations distinguish between the land itself and structures located on land; the
structures themselves may be owned and disposed of independently of rights to the land. The rights
to the structures have been, and continue to be, registered by the local Bureaus of Technical
Inventory ("BTI") under a collection of Soviet-era laws and regulations. The quality of the existing
records of BTI is contingent upon location. However, where records do exist, they can be quite
comprehensive.



94                                                                                      ANNEX 1.3
22.    The laws of housing privatization require that the "contract of sale" transferring ownership
of an apartment from  the municipality to the privatizing  owner be contracted with  local
administration, enterprise or organization . In implementation, the result of this directive has varied
among municipalities, with some designating the BTI as the registry and others designating a separate
agency such as a housing department. In any event, a housing privatization registry is designated
in most localities.
23.    The housing laws do not specify registration requirements for secondary transactions in
housing. However, the 1964 Civil Code of the Russian Federation, still in effect, requires that
all transfers of residential property be registered with the local Soviet. (See Article 239). Although
the local soviets no longer exist, this provision of the Civil Code is considered sufficient authority
for local administrations to enact regulations requiring the registration of secondary conveyances of
residential property.  Like transfers of municipal housing to private owners, these secondary
transactions are registered with either BTI or a separate designated housing agency.
24.    With respect to mortgages of real property, the Russian Federation Law on Collateral is clear
that mortgages are to be registered in the place where the property itself is registered (Article 11).
Accordingly, mortgages on land itself will be registered in the local land committees, which have
given attention to the registration of mortgages in their new land book procedures and forms, while
mortgages of apartments and other residential structures could be registered in the local housing
registry, most often BTI.
25.    The laws affecting registration of property titles, for example, Presidential Decree No. 1767,
On the Regulation of Land Relationships, sometimes make clear that where registration is required,
the failure to register renders the transaction a nullity. Beyond this basic principle, the Russian laws
of title registration do not yet clarify the legal processes and implications of registration and title
assurance, either in the form of a title guarantee from the state or a private system of title insurance.3
There are few details provided regarding, for example, the resolution of disputes among conflicting
interests or the forms and procedures of registration necessary to provide assured protection. The
absence of clear and comprehensive rules and procedures on registration of titles is compounded by
the maintenance of dual registries for land and structures. For example, there is no indication of
how inconsistency in information recorded in each system would be reconciled. Since under Russian
law property rights to a structure automatically create rights to use the land on which it is located,
it is clear how this dual registry system could give rise to conflicts.
3/ The Law on Collateral does provide that the mortgage registry is liable for any willul or negligent errors
of registration, but no fund is identified to back up this liability. The registration of rights to structures or housing
does not provide for indemnification by the registry. An informal system of conducting title searches has developed
in many Russian cities. Documents from a number of sources (BTI, REU, Passport Office) are collected by the
seller to demonstrate to the buyer that the seller has unencumbered title to the unit before sale. All documents are
notaized by a notary who verifies the authenticity of the documents presented by the seller. Many buyers and
sellers enlist the services of a broker to conduct this title search and gather the necessary documents. As assurance
of the comprehensive of their tide search, brokers also often offer some sort of compensation to buyers should the
buyer's title later be successfully challenged. This compensation ranges from appearing as a witness on behalf of
the buyer in any court proceedings to relocating the buyer in another comparable unit at the expense of the broker.



ANNEX 1.3                                                                                     9S
26.    Propiska System. In some cities, the propiska, or internal passport system, is a significant
factor affecting property rights. Used as a tool to strictly regulate mobility during the Soviet era,
the propiska system endures in many cities today in spite of a 1992 ruling by the Constitutional Court
deeming the practice unconstitutional and in violation of a number of international human rights
norms. In October 1993 President Yeltsin issued a decree abolishing the propiska system. Many
cities, including Moscow, have refused to abolish the propiska arguing it is one of the only tools they
have to control in-migration that is aggravating a shortage of housing. In smaller cities and towns
enforcement of the propiska system has been quite lax ever since the advent of perestroika.
27.    A propiska for a particular address entitles the holder to the tenant protection contained in
the Housing Code, including the right not to be evicted without provision of alternative housing.
Owners of privatized units possess a propiska for the unit they occupy, but may own additional
apartments that they lease or plan to sell for which no propiska is required. All individuals in a
priatized unit, including minors, have a property right in the unit.4 The propiska system is a means
of tracking who those individuals are. Where an owner seeks to sell his unit, he must acquire
written permission from all other propiska holders in the unit. Not to do so clouds the title for the
new purchaser of the unit. Many of the challenges to title that appear in the courts are raised by
propiska holders, particularly minors, from whom permission to sell the unit was not obtained before
the privatized unit was sold-' No clear legal precedent exists for resolution of these types of
disputes. However, absent a system of title insurance, a successful challenge to title by a propiska
holder who did not give permission to sell may result in the new purchaser of the unit being forced
to compensate the propiskaed tenant.
28.    Propiska records are maintained by the militia. When a resident moves from one address to
another he must update his records with the local militia. In the past, individuals could not obtain
a propiska unless one was requested by their employer. Many smaller cities do not actively enforce
this procedure. Where they do, the charge for acquiring a new propiska for a change of address is
minimal. However, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the charge for acquiring a new propiska is
substantial.6 The fees range from thousands to millions of rubles depending upon whether the
individual seeking the propiska is from Moscow or outside the area and whether they fall into one
of the protected categories of citizens (veterans, pensioners, etc.). Given the strong opposition of
larger cities to abolishing the propiska system it is unlikely that the system will disappear any time
soon. To date, no federal action has been taken to enforce the Presidential decree abolishing the
system.
29.    Presidential Decree "On the State Land Cadastre and the Registration of the Documents on
the Rights to Real Property" (No. 2130, December 11, 1993) delegates to Roskomzem the authority
4/ This is true although the minor may not in fact physically possess a propiska.
I/ To ensure that the minor's interest is represented before an apartment is sold, a 1993 law (Article 133 of
the Codex of Law on Family, Marriage and Guardianship) requires that the Department of Public Education, Section
on Marriage issue permission on behalf of all minors (under 18) to sell the unit.
6/ In Moscow, the fees that are being charged are apparently not for the propiska per se, but for a Rlicensew
that appears to be connected obtaining the propiska.

to create and operate a unified system of real estate registration that would register rights to both
land and structures. However, the decree also delegates to Roskomzem, the Ministry of Justice and
the State Property Committee the authority to jointly prepare the rules and procedures for real estate
registration. Roskomzem and the State Property Committee have not yet reached a consensus on
this vital area of privatization. Extensive laws and procedures
developed by Roskornzem, and they are reasonably to this point, have been stalemated by the lack
of cooperation among the three responsible agencies.7
30.   Housing Construction. In June 1994, the Government authorized the implementation of
a program "On Measures of State Support for Restructuring of Housing Construction Production
Base" prepared by the Minstroi. The objectives of the program are to facilitate a technological
restructuring of the construction and construction materials industry base. Although there is little
doubt that the critical situation in the construction industry is a legitimate concern of the
government, the proposed program makes no provisions for economic and financial restructuring
of the troubled industry. In this context, the program appears to be at odds with the fundamental
principles of the Program "Housing" calling for reduced government involvement in the housing
sector and full cost recovery. It is worth mentioning however that the Government resolution
authorizing the program does not commit any substantial budget resources to the proposed
government driven technological restructuring of the industry.
31.   The other most recent in a series of enactments on housing construction are the
Presidential Decrees "On Measures to Provide for Completion of Unfinished Apartment
Buildings" and "On Issue and Circulation of Housing Certificates" (June 1, 1994). Whereas the
former decree establishes a legal basis for auctioning unfinished apartment building to natural
and juridical persons, the latter aims to facilitate private investment in the housing sector by
establishing regulatory framework for issuing construction bonds (housing certificates). Housing
certificates may be converted at maturity into a number of square meters of housing provided
a number of conditions are met , will be covered by insurance and indexed in their principal
amount to the inflation and housing construction cost.
32.   Local Government Policy Initiatives. To compensate for the shortcomings in the federal
legislative framework, a number of local governments have enacted their own housing laws to
accelerate the pace of housing reform within their jurisdictions. While many, perhaps most,
cities of the Russian Federation continue to wait for federal guidance before enacting reforms,
a number of cities have taken the initiative in passing condominium laws, reforming title
registration procedures and introduces rent increases and housing allowances. The cities of
Moscow, Yaroslavl, and Ryazan have all passed their own condominium laws and model
charters and have been registering condominium associations in their cities. Moscow has
2/ A proposed draft of a comprehensive regulation on real estate title registration, with accompanying forms
for the registration records, was delivered by the Land Committee to the State Property Committee in May, 1994.
It should be noted here that several significant World Bank loans to the Russian Federation, including the "LARIS"
Project, have been conditioned on enactment of a suitable national regulation on the registration of real estate titles.



ANNEX 1.3                                                                           97
successfully imnplemented a streamlined procedure for registering property rights in housing
within the Department of Municipal Housing. The cities of Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Ryazan
and other cities are in the process of raising rents and housing allowances.
33.   Future Reform Activity.  The Russian Federation has made substantial progress in
establishing the legal and procedural framework for private housing ownership. The next stage
for Russian housing policy is to develop the legal basis to foster the burgeoning private housing
market. The legal framework should consist of a uniform system of title registration for land
and structures, laws on mortgaging land and real estate, competitive procedures for allocating
land for private use, more flexible land use regulation of land in private hands, procedures for
carrying out and registering secondary transactions, and a permanent federal law on
condominium establishment of a regime of landlord-tenant laws.

HousiNG PROJECT
ANVNEX 1.4
HOUSING MARET ANALYSIS IN PROJECT CITIEs 1993-94
A.   INTRODUcrION
1.    During 1993-94, USAID financed and directed formal surveys of the emerging real estate
market in proposed project cities as part of its Technical Cooperation Program for the Project. The
primnary purpose of the surveys was to describe the dynamics of the housing market and to identify
problems hampering its development. Another important objective of the surveys was to develop
a methodology that would provide benchmark indicators of housing market development that would
permit future monitoring of housing sector reforms over time. Four separate surveys covered:
households, developers, and sales transactions, as well as housing sector monitoring indicators. A
brief analysis of the formal surveys are presented below in Section B.
2.    In addition to the formal surveys, international consultants carried out informal surveys under
the Construction Finance Sub-component. These surveys yielded valuable information on the skill,
organization and composition of the private real-estate industry, its response to the evolving housing
market, and the financing techniques being developed in the present uncertain financial environment
where resources are still scarce. Section C below presents the information gathered through the
informal surveys.
B.    SUMMARY OF FORMAL SURVEYS
3.    Survey Description. Five Russian research groups were assigned to the different cities' to
carry out the surveys. These surveys were monitored for quality control of the data by a consulting
firm on behalf of USAID. Most of the surveys were completed satisfactorily and are believed to
have produced reliable data. However, some of the surveys suffer from inherent limitations. For
instance, preferences indicated in household surveys cannot predict behavior as accurately as
preferences demonstrated in the marketplace. Also, household incomes are typically understated,
given the large informal sector and incentives to avoid taxes. Keeping these limitations in mind, the
following sections present a brief analysis of the survey results.

iv.    Uncertain Regulatory Environment
v.    Lack of Property Titling System, and
f.    Lack of Developable Land in Private Housing Market
a.    Privatization and Development of Secondary Housing Market. The year 1993 saw
a major breakthrough in the development of the Russian housing market. The rate of
housing privatization, still slow at the beginning of 1993, gained momentum during the
second half of the year. This surge in housing privatization sparked a rapid growth of the
secondary housing market. A substantial increase in the volume of real estate transactions,
including sales and exchanges, was recorded in all major urban centers.' According to the
survey estimates, the number of housing units that were for sale in 1993 equalled on the
average 12% of all privately-owned housing stock in the cities studied.
b.    Privatization and its Inact on Housing Prices. As demonstrated in the surveys the
substantial growth in the number of tradeable units has had a moderating impact on housing
prices. Prices remained at the same level in real terms throughout most of 1993, though
they jumped by about 20%-30% in the first quarter of 1994. Prices also reflected increased
differentiation according to quality and location of dwelling units. For example, prices of
low-quality flats in multi-story panel buildings remote from city centers stabilized to a large
extent, while larger units of better quality in prestigious locations increased in value in
response to greater demand. Prices per square meter varied from $500-600 in a five story
"Krushchev" building, to $2,500 for a better quality apartment in a central district of
Moscow or St.Petersburg. Indirect estimates show that location might account for as much
as 40-50% of the housing value. The surveys also found strong correlations between housing
prices and the environmental quality of the area, and the quality of the building and
apartment itself.
c.    Macroeconomic Impacts. Early signs of a positive macro-economic impact of the
evolving housing market were detected, for example in increased residential mobility; the
surveys documented an average of 3.1%  in residential mobility across the five cities.
Second, the development of a competitive secondary housing market seems to have absorbed
some of the inflationary demand pressure in the housing sector and in the economy as a
whole.
d.    Availability of Market Information.   Despite alleged difficulties in obtaining
adequate market data about real estate transactions, the surveys documented the ability of
buyers to obtain good market knowledge. Typical sources of information are advertisements
and informal sources, such as acquaintances or enterprises. Nevertheless, major progress
has been made in developing new sources of market informnation and in enhancing the
existing ones. The creation of real estate market data networks and the increasing variety
and sophistication of real estate publications and services are a few important signs of this
progress.

e.     Decline in Housing Construction3.    In 1993/94 the volume of new  housing
construction declined, mainly due to the reduction of subsidies and finance from the
public sector. Privately financed construction cannot yet compensate for the drop in public
construction.   The surveys emphasized  five factors that currently  hamper private
construction: (i) lack of construction finance; (ii) competition from the secondary housing
market; (iii) high construction costs due to excessive local government fees; (iv) a complex
and uncertain regulatory environment; and (v) an unreliable system of tide registration.
Lack of Construction Finance.  There are four principal sources of construction
finance: (a) public housing subsidies from local governments and subsidized
enterprises; (b) developers' equity and/or installment payments from future buyers;
(c) advances from legal entities, such as enterprises; and (d) construction loans from
commercial banks.
Public housing subsidies have dwindled to insignificant amounts in all cities4. Most
construction was financed by private developers, who, in turn, obtained funding
through installments by future buyers or residents. However, given the uncertain
legal enforcement of developer-buyer contracts, individuals suffer considerable risks
of noncompletion and installment losses. A legal title transfer takes place only upon
the completion of the project.  Sales were generally to legal entities.  In St.
Petersburg, for example, 79% of the buyers were legal entities (e.g. enterprises) and
21% were individuals. Enterprises purchased only 15% of new units for their
employees (mainly chief executives).   They purchased  85%   for re-sale  or to
resettle families from communal flats in the center city that were being renovated
privately. Individual buyers purchased only 3.3% of apartments. In the projects
surveyed, construction loans from commercial banks represented about 20% of
privately funanced construction costs.   Loans were for very short maturities (on
average 3 months) and at high real interest rates5.
ii.    Competition from Secondary Housing Market.  The development of a secondary
housing market with competitive housing prices has meant that the
developers/builders of new housing can no longer shift the increasing cost of
construction to the buyers. The buyers can now purchase existing apartmnents, instead
of undertaking the risks of new development, such as non-completion and loss of
installments. In 1993, for example, the costs of housing construction in

4t Except for Novgorod, where public funds were the major source of financing new housing construction
(71 %), the use of government resources for housing construction was found to be minuscule in all of the surveyed
projecu.

16-22, 1994).



ANNEX 1.4                                                                          103
Moscow increased by 800 percent, whereas the mean housing price rose only by 700
percent. In less than two years, the new home Sales Price-to-Construction Costs
ratio descended from 3.0 ( in 1992) to 1.3 at the beginning of 1994.
iii.   High Construction Costs due to Excessive Local Government Fees.  High local
government fees and taxes, both in cash and in-kind, contribute significantly to high
construction costs. Currently the cities require a fee of 86% of the actual cost of
construction, to be paid by the developer toward a payment for land and
use of city infrastructure'. In addition, 18-30% of finished apartments must be
transferred free of charge to the city upon the completion of the project. Combined
together these city levies represent an equivalent of 219 - 241% value added tax on
housing construction.
iv.    Uncertain Regulatorv Environment.  Most of the surveyed developers reported
interaction with city administrations as the major problem in the development
process. Specific complaints include: (a) lack of written regulations; (b) arbitrary
changes of requirements by the city in the course of the project;  (c) long
development review process; and (d) uncertain and high city charges for land and the
use of city infrastructure (see above).
v.    Lack of Pro2erty Titline Syste m. Nearly all the developers surveyed stated that one
of the largest problems facing the development of a housing market concerns
acquisition and tradeability of property rights. There is no recognized legal basis for
recording and transferring developers' rights, on land or on newly constructed
apartment buildings. Also, the title registration process for buyers is complicated and
lengthy, and characterized by weak and unclear property rights.
f.    Lack of Developable Land in Private Housing Market. Despite the enacted legislation
enabling private ownership of land, municipal governments still own most of the developable
urban land. At the present time there is no established procedure for land allocation; land
sales are neither transparent nor open. Long term land leases are sold at arbitrary prices
through ad hoc procedures. Development of the housing market is hampered further by the
absence of a land titling system. Nevertheless, the number of land-lease contracts is growing
as the formerly state-owned enterprises dispose of their vast land holdings. In addition to
the cities, collective farms in adjacent rural areas are other major potential suppliers of land
for housing development.
B.    SUMMARY OF INFORMAL SURVEYS
5.    In addition to the formal surveys described above, international consultants carried out an
informal survey of some 172 housing projects in the participating cities, followed by consultations
with 40 local developers and bankers, plus extensive interviews with the ten ISB

banks in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Tver. The purpose of these consultations was to develop
guidelines and a pipeline of sub-projects to be financed under the Construction Finance Line of
Credit. These surveys have yielded important information on the skill, organization and composition
of the private real estate industry. In general, the informal surveys corroborate the findings of the
formal surveys described above.
6.    The findings of the informal surveys are presented in the following categories:
a.    Apartments: The Preferred Housing Option for New Construction,
b.    The Market for Other Types of Housing,
c.    Diverse Composition of the Private Real Estate Development Industry,
d.    Role of Commercial Banks in Real Estate Financing and Development,
e.    Financing Techniques in an Uncertain Financial Environment,
f.    Availability of Land to Private Developers, and
g.    Reconstruction and Relocation.
a.    Apartments: The Preferred Housing Option for New Construction. Three-quarters
of the new housing supply planned by developers consists of small two-room apartments of
60-65 m2 gross floor area in mid or high-rise buildings. Two types of developers share this
market.  Privatized kombinats build about one-third of the apartments, generally in
prefabricated panel technology at an average estimated cost of US$ 23,000 per unit. The
more market-savvy and better capitalized of the private developers handle the remaining two-
thirds of the production, consisting of slightly larger and better-finished apartments in various
technologies (brick, brick with reinforced concrete frame, panel) for an average cost of about
US$ 25,000 per unit.
Developers concentrate on the apartment market because it corresponds to the only
effective demand group of any size, i.e. the population that can mobilize cash from savings
and by realizing assets (privatized apartment, garage, dacha), and possibly benefit from
employer and state subsidies. This population seeks to improve their housing conditions at
times by moving from a shared apartment to a privately-occupied one, or by moving to a
larger apartment with an extra room, or by moving to an apartment of better quality, in
better environmental conditions or in a more attractive location. Such moves are as yet
marginal, however for the poorly-housed families these small improvements are significant.
b.    The Market for Other Tvyes of Housing.  The remaining 25 percent of the new
housing supply consists mainly of single-family housing (mostly free-standing cottages) and
some reconstruction of inner-city buildings. This market, which consists predominantly of
smaller private developers attracted by the promise of substantial profits, is also much riskier
and more volatile, because effective demand is small, and signs of oversupply are already
visible.
c.    Diverse Comosition of the Private Real Estate Development Industry.  As
diversification is a necessity in the uncertain business environment of Russia, many
developers have combined real estate with other activities. Most of the developers who

have submitted projects for financing under the Construction Line of Credit are new private
companies with diverse backgrounds. Privatized former kombinats account for no more than
20 percent of developers. Some developers are contractors, while others are subsidiaries of
industrial enterprises that build housing for their staff but sell part of the production to
outsiders. Many are enterprises that have become involved in real estate to keep themselves
alive, while others started in trade and are investing their profits in housing and other real
estate. In some cases, a developer might be the shadow commercial real estate arm of a
municipality. Several of the new private developers are also acquiring or setting up building
materials plants, in order to ensure reliable access at reasonable prices to building materials,
which are in short supply and therefore priced speculatively. A number of commercial banks
are also very active in real estate (see below).
d.     Role of Commercial Banks in Real Estate Financing and Development. Several banks
are active in real estate in the role of developers as well as lenders mostly because it
provides them with a good return on invested capital, and they can use their network of
branch offices to collect deposits dedicated to housing. As developers, banks act through
subsidiaries in which they are generally the majority shareholders. The subsidiaries use their
own or shareholders' equity, some funds from the bank and other techniques to attract
savings, like any other developer. Banks claim they like to lend to companies that they
control, as it allows them to carefully monitor the construction process and minimize risks
in an unregulated environment'.
Banks lend to developers these days mostly for short term financing. Developers
normally only go to banks when they need bridge financing to complete housing construction
for sale to the ultimate buyers. Today, obtaining such financing is difficult for most
developers: first, the banks require collateral unless the developer has a stream of income
from other sources domiciled at the bank; second, the banks also impose close monitoring,
which the developers resent as an invasion of privacy; and finally, due to the scarcity of term
money, developers compete for funds that are otherwise used for financing short-term
activities at extremely high rates of interest (35-40% in US Dollars).
e.     Financing Technigues in an Uncertain Financial Environment. At this moment there
is very little commercial lending for construction activities because of (a) lack of long-term
sources of funds for the banks, (b) competition from other more lucrative lending activities,
(c) high interest rates for short-term credits, (d) severe controls imposed by banks on
developers, and finally (e) unwillingness of banks or developers to share profits. To
overcome these constraints, builders until now have financed their projects from their own
equity as well as from share-participation, advance sales and deposits from prospective
purchasers. These solutions allowed the developer to adapt the amount of the installments
to variations in construction cost'. But now, such techniques are becoming increasingly
7/ Under the Construction Finance Line of Credit, ISB candidate banks are required to decrease lending to
related parties over time, in order to fulfill prudential regulations.
8/ During 1993 the cost of building materials increased faster than inflation.

inadequate, as many enterprises which in the past bought housing for their employees in this
manner have now run out of funds, while individual buyers are becoming market-wise and
are availing themselves of the alternatives provided by the emerging secondary housing
market.
Several innovative methods are being developed to organize savings; however, some
methods' raise questions about the integrity of the fmancial institutions that have launched
them.  Already a few instruments, highly publicized on TV by fly-by-night financial
institutions, have robbed people of their savings. Also, bonds issued by the new mortgage
banks often offer interest rates inadequate to protect the client from inflation. Other bonds
have a face value denominated in square meters and are guaranteed only by the building to
be constructed with the funds coming from the sale of these bonds. These bonds can be
exchanged into new bonds upon completion of the building and invested in a new venture.
A secondary market for such bonds is now developing.
Notwithstanding the nature of raising funds for construction, it is apparent that there
is a necessity for longer term credit for housing construction. Longer-term credits are
expected to: (i) increase the overall volume of construction; (ii) provide leverage to
decrease the cost of construction provided the interest rate is reasonable; (iii) allow
developers to sell the units later in the project cycle, and for a higher price; and (iv) speed
up the process of housing construction.
f.    Availability of Land to Private Developers. Land distributed earlier to enterprises
for employee housing has become an important source of building sites for developers. As
nany of these enterprises are unable to develop these sites themselves due to a shortage of
funds, they are passing on the development rights to private developers. Developers also
have access to municipal land. The payment for development rights on municipal land is
often a proportion of the completed units (usually 10-50%), and/or in the form of extra
infrastructure built at the developer's expense.
g.    Reconstruction and relocation. Privatization of housing has resulted in movement and
redistribution of households according to their financial capacity -- usually between the
centers and the peripheries of the larger Russian cities.
Developers interested in purchasing and refurbishing well located apartments, usually
occupied by middle or low-income families in communal or privatized apartments, are
required to provide alternative units for relocation of these households. The occupants
themselves are increasingly market-wise, aware of the value of location and of their
bargaining power. Many, therefore, are able to exchange their dilapidated or shared
acconmmodations in the city center for a larger, newer and privately-owned apartment in the
2/ Such as investing 'futures' in Rubles -- where a person pays a company one-quarter of the price of a house
that is expected to be delivered in four years. The company then expects to fiance the construction of the building
from the profit it makes by investing these deposits for the next four years in high-yielding investments.

urban periphery. Because of the high cost of new construction, developers now prefer to
provide existing apartments through specialized agencies rather than to build
new ones. The profits from reconstruction are such that adequate relocation of sitting
occupants at the expense of the developer is feasible.

ATTACHMENT A: HOUSING MARKETS IN FIVE CITIES
A.    Moscow
1.    As of January 1, 1993, there were about 3,100,000 apartments in Moscow's housing
stock. By October, 1993, over one million units had been privatized which totaled 30.4% of
overall housing stock. The privatization process in Moscow occurred rather quickly from the
beginning for two reasons: first, under privatization most of Moscow's housing was transferred
to tenants at no cost and second, the market value of housing in Moscow is the highest in the
whole country which encouraged Muscovites to become owners.
2.    From the end of 1992 until autumn 1993 the average sq.m. price (in hard currency)
remained more or less stable between $500 and $700 per sq. m. with just two increases, one in
February/March and one in October/November 1993. In December 1993, however, there was a
significant price increase to well over $800 per sq.m. Prices vary by location and apartrnent
type:, the price of a well located apartrnent may exceed $2,500 per sq.m. of total area, while the
sq.m cost in a five story "Khrushchev block building" is about $650.
As of March 1994 apartment prices varied in US$ as follows:
One room apartmnent:            17,400 to 42,000
Two room apartment:             21,000 to 75,000
Three room apartment:           35,000 to 220,000
3.    Despite having the highest rate of privatization in the country, the level of real estate
transactions in Moscow arnounted to only about 6.5% of overall privatized housing stock. The
percentage of recorded residential mobility was also among the lowest of the five cities, with only
Nizhny Novgorod recording a lower level.
B.    NIZHNY NOVGOROD
4.    As of January 1, 1992, when privatization began, there were 403,347 housing units in the
city. In 1993, 55,669 apartrnents were privatized, which was 14% of all apartments subject to
privatization. Since the beginning of privatization in 1992, a total of 78,463 apartments have
been privatized which represents 19% of all apartmnents subject to privatization.
5.    In the past two years a rather solid basis for the development of a secondary housing
market has been formed, as over a quarter of the city's housing stock is privately owned (the
19% which was privatized in the past two years plus the 6% which was already private property
before privatization). Surprisingly, compared to the other surveyed cities, Nizhny Novgorod had
the lowest level of recorded real estate transactions - about 3 %. The rate of residential mobility
was also correspondingly low -- at 1 %.
6.    New housing construction was primarily financed by state enterprises (75%) and partially
through local, regional and central budgets - 13 %, 0.8% and 3.7%, respectively. According to
the survey, the mean price per sq. m. for housing was $321, the minimum was $101 and the



AMNEX 1.4              _                                                         109
maximum price was $838. The price per sq. m. was lower than $715 in 99.3% of the
transactions.   As of January 1994 the price dispersion of housing in Nizhny Novgorod,
dependent on the location and condition of the apartment was as follows:
One Room Apartment:             $250 to $410 per sq. m.
Two Room Apartment:             $300 to $470 per sq. m.
Three Room Apartment:           $340 to $470 per sq. m.
7.    The 'typical"' apartment in Nizhny is a two room flat with a total area of 49 sq.m.
located 6 km from the city center in a six story panel building with a sq. m. value of $321.
C.   BARNAUL
8.   In 1993 the housing stock in Bamaul consisted of about 166,746 units. By November
1993, 42,699 housing units had been privatized which represented about 26.9% of all units.
The rapid privatization of housing triggered an explosive development of the housing market.
Barnaul had the most active market of the five cities; during the first 10 months of 1993, the
Bureau of Technical Inventory issued 6,238 certificates for sales transactions, 1,781 for gifts and
893 for exchange. This totaled about 21 % of all privately owned housing units.
Correspondingly, the level of residential mobility in Barnaul (5.4%) also significantly exceeds
that of the other cities.
9.    However, despite the rapid growth of the supply of housing units in the secondary
housing market, prices did not stabilize. The surveys showed, for example, that although in 1994
housing prices of newly-built housing exceeded prices in the secondary market by 20-25 %, there
was no shortage of buyers. It appears that buyers are not well informed of the prices in the
secondary market. In the secondary market the mean sales price per sq. m was US$ 163, the
miniimum recorded price was US$ 22 and the maximum was US$ 443. The sales price
distribution in US$ for units on the secondary market in Barnaul in December 1993 was as
folows:
One room apartment:       6,667 - 8,000
Two room apartment:       8,667 - 10,667
Three room apartment:    16,000 - 19,333
10.   Most of the housing construction in 1993 was financed by joint-stock companies (58%),
followed by state-owned enterprises (23%), public organizations (11%) and private individuals
(8%).
JQ/ This is derived from the means of each variable.

11.   According to the survey, the "typical"" housing unit in Barnaul is a 48 sq. m. two room
flat, located about 5 kIn from the city center in an eight story panel building with a value of
approximately $162 per sq.m. The average amount of space per person in Barnaul is 15 sq.m.
D.    ST. PETERSBURG
12.   In 1993 the housing stock in St.Petersburg totaled 1,473,000 units. The rate of housing
privatization in the city was the highest among the five cities; by January 1994, 33% of all
apartments subject to privatization had been privatized.
13.   The housing market was moderately active. In one year about 10.4% of all privately
owned housing units were either sold, exchanged or given as gifts. The level of residential
mobility in St.Petersburg was 3.4% which is the third highest rate after Barnaul and Novgorod.
Prices in the secondary housing market increased by about 730% while the inflation index was
736%; however, construction costs increased tenfold, making new housing construction in
St.Petersburg less and less profitable.
14.    From January to November 1993, 9,134 new units were built. State enterprises were
the main sources of financing for housing construction (84.7%), followed by the municipal
government and central budget transfers at 9.5% and 3.7%, respectively.
E.    NOVGOROD
15.   There were 72,650 housing units in Novgorod in 1993. By the end of the year, 14,870 of
housing units were privatized or 20.5 % of overall housing stock. Despite the moderate rate of
privatization, Novgorod had a relatively high rate of recorded real estate transactions (17.5%)
and residential mobility (3.6%).
16.   Novgorod is among a few remaining cities in Russia where central and local government
funding plays a major role in funancing housing construction. In 1993, for instance, over 34% of
the newly built housing was financed through the local budget and 37% through the central
government transfers. The remainder was financed by state enterprises and private individuals,
27% and 2%, respectively.

- STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RussiAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 2.1
HOUSING SECTOR REFORM STRATEGY
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    This Annex presents the Russia's housing sector reform strategy that was developed in
close collaboration with the Government of Russia under the Technical Cooperation Project on
Housing Reform and Privatization during the year 1992. The strategy is presented in matrix
form. The matrix summarizes actions needed across ten major areas of a housing system during
its transition to market. The proposed strategy also presents a sequencing of reforrns. Although
this matrix is not intended to be the blueprint of reform actions and programs, it presents the
means of apprehending the links between priority policy actions, new incentive structures and
new professions.
2.    The Russia Housing Project has been designed in consonance with the sector reform
strategy, government's priorities and bank's CAS. The Project is designed to implement reforns
at the local level that the national Government has already established as its policy. Local
reforms will be concentrated on three areas that facilitate private sector construction for sale on
the housing market: (a) property rights development -- including land and property title
registration (b) urban regulatory reforms -- such as land privatization; land allocation through
competitive procedures; and urban planning, building, environmental, and permitting procedures;
and (c) pro-competition policies for the building industry -- including public procurement rules
and construction management.
3.    The Participating Cities have developed Regulatory Action Plans (RAP) that will be
agreed with the Government and the cities during negotiations. The following elements of the
RAP's are proposed as disbursement conditions for sub-projects under the Land Development
Sub-component:  a) the city has adopted a regulation on registration of title, including
transactions in land and real estate, acceptable to the Bank; and b) the city has adopted
procedures, acceptable to the Bank, on auction and competitive tender for land on project sites
being disposed of by the city. Progress in implementation of RAP's will be a basis for
reallocating loan proceeds among cities during annual reviews.

RussiAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.1
Cnm SELECTION PROCEDURE
A.    BACKGROUND
1.    The Government of Russia has established extensive reforms in housing policy that have yet
to be integrated on a local level. Land development and construction finance in the Housing project
will be implemented at the city and oblast levels. The selection of a limited number of cities is
necessary to maximize the learning and demonstration effects of the Project. Including cities of a
mnmber of different sizes and types enhances the use of these cities as demonstrations to other cities
throughout Russia. The list of Participating Cities includes the following five: Barnaul, Nizhny
Novgorod, Novgorod, St. Petersburg,and Tver.
2.    Initial discussions on city selection were held between representatives of the Russian
Government, mostly from Minstroi and the Presidential Administration, and the Bank's Project
Identification Mission during May 9-21, 1993. Several key points emerged from the discussions:
(a)   The Russian Government emphasized the need to focus on a number of smaller cities
in Central Russia where there was an identified need to absorb returning soldiers and
refugees from former Soviet republics;
(b)   The mission emphasized the need to focus on a broader range of cities throughout the
Russian federation, particularly on the larger cities which are leaders in market
reforms;
(c)    The Russian Government would be responsible for selecting the cities. The Bank,
on its part, would like to have the opportunity to eliminate cities which it considers
unsuitable.
3.    The results of these discussions was an agreement that the Bank would conduct initial
investigations in twenty-one cities and oblasts and present the results of its investigations to the
Russian Government which would then narrow down the number of cities further. The Bank and
the Russian Government agreed on examining cities and oblasts of three types: the two Russian
megacities - Moscow and St. Petersburg which are clear leaders in market reforms and market
development; seven cities and oblasts in Central Russia (including the two oblasts of the megacities);
and all the Russian cities with a population of over one million people.
4.    Demographic, economic and housing data from published recent statistics were collected for
each of the twenty one cities and oblasts and organized into a set of identical tables for each city.
A large number of potential city selection criteria were identified and translated into possible
quantitative indicators for which data may be obtained during the city visits. A methodology for



128                     _                                                    ANNEX 3.1
conducting the city visits was formulated, dividing the attention between meetings with officials,
private sector and banking representatives, site visits, and factory visits. Two housing specialists
of the Bank's city selection team visited each of the cities and oblasts during the period May 24- July
6, 1993, collecting documents, meeting officials, academics and representatives of the private sector
and visiting Project sites, enterprises and banks. The main findings of the city selection team are
presented below.
B.    CITY SELECTION CRITERIA
5.    The Aide-Memoire issued by the Bank's Project Identification Mission in May of 1993
identified three mnain criteria for city selection: (a) the reform orientation of the local administration
and its interest in enhancing and promoting housing sector reforms; (b) the level of development of
market demand, market relations and private-sector supply in the housing sector; and (c) the
suitability of the city for the key components of the proposed Project.
6.    A large number of statistical variables and field observations were used to try to differentiate
between the cities. There was no significant variation between the cities surveyed on a number of
variables where considerable differences were expected. A number of other statistical findings did
point in the right direction:
(a)    Privatization of the public housing stock is proceeding everywhere but the latest
available statistics, for June of 1992, were out of date. The percentage of units
shown to be privatized by that date ranged from 0.5% to 5.9% (in Moscow).
These low rates of privatizadon did not reflect the existence of a vibrant housing
market in any city except Moscow, and to a lesser extent St. Petersburg, where the
percentage of units privatized was only 0.8 %. More current data for most cities were
not available at that time, however results from surveys underway in all the
Participating Cities have now provided a more accurate indication of housing demand
and recent housing market activity.
(b)    The intensity of overall privatization of public enterprises in 1993, measured rather
unsystematically by a business publication, did vary considerably between city
regions. Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, Orenburg, Cheliabinsk, Ufa and Perm all
had rates below 40%, while St. Petersburg, Novgorod, Pskov and Nizhny-Novgorod
had rates above 75%.
(c)    A similar measure of private ownership, albeit an historical one, is the percentage of
the housing stock in individual ownership as of 1991. Generally, a very small
percentage of the stock was in private hands, with a median of 7.7%.
(d)   There was data available on the percentage of the population in each oblast which
supported the Government's economic reform in the referendum of 1993. More than
60% supported the reforns in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl, Yekaterinburg,
Cheliabinsk and Perm. Less than 50% supported the reforms in Tver, Pskov,
Kostroma, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Volgograd and Ufa. These results, however, did not



ANNEX 3.1                                                                          129
necessarily reflect the attitudes of the local administration which was brought about
more clearly in the city visits.
(e)    Finally, investment risk, measured rather unsystematically by a business publication,
was found to be low in most cities except Kazan and Ufa.
7.    The preliminary statistical findings had to be corroborated by the city visits, and
supplemented by additional recent data on housing market characteristics - privatization, rent and
maintenance levels, housing transactions, and the availability of mortgage finance; housing
production - quantities produced, costs and dwelling unit sizes, waiting lists and unfinished housing,
the state of the construction conglomerates, private sector production, and the presence of
rehabilitation projects; residential land - use, land development, residential land subdivision and the
presence of informal land subdivisions. Again, on a large number of these dimensions there was no
significant variation among the cities surveyed.
8.    While it was not possible to use the data and the observations in a systematic manner for
recommending cities for the Project, the team was able to combine the data to form strong
impressions as to the suitability of each city for participation in the Project. The recommendations
of the team are given in the following section.
C.    RECOmmENDED CUiBEs
9.    The team focused on recommending cities where (a) The Project would have the highest
probability of success; (b) The key components of the Project could be implemented; and (c) The
implementation of the Project would create demonstration effects which could be replicated in other
Russian cities.
10.   Eleven cities were recommended for possible participation in the Russia Housing Project,
with the understanding that discussions with the Russian Government would lead to reducing the
number further. The findings of the City Selection team were presented to Minstroi and reviewed
by the Vice Chairman, Mr. Krivov and the Chairman, Mr. Basin in early July, 1993. At that time
Barnaul was added to the city selection process at the request of the Government and a mission was
sent out to visit Barnaul. Following the visit the Bank agreed to include the city in Project
Preparation due to its reform orientation and market activity.
11.   By the end of July it was decided that the number of cities participating in the Project would
be further reduced to six. The Project has since worked closely with the selected cities to develop
the Project components, relying primarily on the various members of the Project Review Unit in
Moscow to maintain that contact. At an advanced stage in Project Preparation it was decided that
Rostov-on-Don, then one of the six Participating Cities, would not be ready to participate in the
Project by Appraisal in June. The city of Rostov-on-Don has set a moratorium on construction due
to severe deficits in infrastructure that cannot be resolved in the immediate future.
12.   A detailed description of the five Participating Cities follows below. More extensive statistics
per city regarding population and housing density have been compiled and placed in the Project files.

(1)   St. Petersburg:
St. Petersburg is the second largest city in the Russian Federation with 5 million people in
1991. The population grew by about 0.7% per year between 1980 and 1991. About 48%
of the housing stock in St. Petersburg was built between 1951 and 1970. In 1990, the
housing stock stood at 1.5 million units and the average number of persons per dwelling unit
was 3.1. In 1991, only 1.4% of the housing stock was private while 10% was State owned
and 74% belonged to the municipality. Between 1991 and January 1994 the number of units
privately-owned grew to approximately 483,000, which comprised 32% of the total housing
stock in St. Petersburg.
St. Petersburg is widely recognized as one of the most reform oriented cities today, having
been the site of initial economic reforms. Most small ventures are privatized as are most of
the former state-owned companies. Housing privatization has progressed steadily. The
housing market for existing private apartments involved about 4000 transactions a month in
1993. In September 1993, prices of typical flats was between $US455/m2 for those situated
in good down-town locations and $US358/m2 for those less centrally-located . Key
government officials want to focus on new types of buildings and building materials. They
also want to improve procedures for contracting work and allocating land.
(2)   Tver:
Tver's population was 460,000 in 1991, and grew at an average of 1% between 1980 and
1991. In 1990, the average number of persons in each dwelling unit was 3.81, and the
average household size was 3.1. In 1991, 79 % of the stock belonged to the State or the
municipality, and about 13% was private. About 35% of the housing stock was built
between 1951 and 1970. Tver has an open-minded administration, working closely with the
private sector and the new local banks to support a number of initiatives. There are a
number of suburban developments under way, with plans for new self-fincing land
development schemes. The local Komnbinat has been privatized and has initiated a number
of innovative schemes to meet market demands. Tver is one of the localities that is expected
to absorb returning soldiers from the Baltics. It is also receiving help sponsored by the Bank
and funded by Canada in strengthening its construction industry.
(3)   Novgorod:
Novgorod had a population of about 243,000 in 1991, and grew at an annual rate of about
2.5% between 1980 and 1991. In 1990, the average number of persons in each dwelling unit
was 3.7, and the average household size was 3.1. In 1991, 94% of the stock belonged to
the State or the municipality, and about 3% was private. About 33 % of the housing stock
was built between 1951 and 1970. There is a positive environment for housing development
in the city. The government strongly supports new forms of housing such as cottages. hle
private construction building material industry has high potential for supporting new types
of construction. Housing privatization has proceeded satisfactorily. The city has been
actively preparing for the return of military families.



ANNEX 3.1                                                                         131
(4)   Nizhny Novgorod:
Nizhny Novgorod's population was 1.5 million in 1991, having grown an average of 0.7%
annually between 1980 and 1991. The oblast in which the city resides was 78% urban in
1991. In 1990, the average number of persons per dwelling was 4.1, and the average urban
household size (for the oblast) was 3.1. In 1991, 85% of the stock belonged to the State or
the municipality, and about 6% was private. About 13% of the housing stock was built
before 1950. The government has a strong reform orientation, and there is a commission
on housing reform looking at problems in the housing sector. Although they are awaiting
federal guidelines, the government has worked out a set of local acts to support rent
increases. The government has a clear understanding of the need to harness individual
resources for housing, especially for maintenance. The governor, in an attempt to address
the lack of competition in the present system of state-ordered housing, recently signed an act
that forces most construction to come through competition. The governor also believes
money must flow through a properly regulated banking system. Finally, the government and
business community believe they must rely chiefly on their own efforts to save themselves.
(5)   Barnaul:
Barnaul's population in 1992 was 92,603, and grew by 2000 during the past year. The Altai
Krai has about 2,660,000 with growth of about 100,000 in 1993, primarily from Central Asia
migrants. The Krai and the City administration appear to work together well, and the mayor
is dynamic and apparently popular. The city's economic base is a little difficult to determine,
but according to both public and private officials, there are more jobs than workers available,
with housing being a key constraint to their ability to absorb more migrants. The city has
a large historic core with beautiful, turn of the century wooden houses on well-laid out
blocks.   The city has a well-developed tradition of housing construction in wood. A
significant number of the new houses being built are of wood, although most of the big ones
are built with bomb-proof 64 cm. brick walls.
Of 150,000 state units, about 20,000 have been privatized; apparently through a simple
procedure. In addition, there are 40,000 private single family houses, most in poor
condition. There appears to be a fairly active real estate market, with about 15 sales a week.
City priorities appear to be the upgrading of existing single family neighborhoods, the
opening new areas for single family housing, and cadastres.

HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.2
LAND DEVELOPMENT SUB-COMPONENT
A.   OVERVIEW
1.    A critical constraint to the development of a competitive and market-responsive housing
sector is the lack of land available to the private housing market. Under the Communist regime, land
was treated as a public good, owned and managed by the state. The private sector had little or no
access to land ownership or development. Although, starting in early 1990, federal legal and
regulatory reforms have established the enabling framework to private ownership of land and the
right of all land owners, including local authorities, to dispose of land at their own discretion, these
reforms remain to be realized at the local level (See Annexes 1.1 and 1.2 for status of regulations
at the federal and the local level, respectively). Local governments continue to own the majority of
the land, while the traditional land development and management tools available to the local
authorities remain inadequate for efficient, market-responsive land development and management.
As a result, there is a shortage of 'developable" land in the current private housing market. The
Land Development Sub-component is designed to address the policy, regulatory, procedural and
technical constraints to market oriented land management.
2.    This annex presents the objectives, strategy for instituting enabling framework for
implementation of the Sub-component, detailed development sequence of the sub-projects, and
institutional arrangements for implementation of the Sub-components. The attachments present (a)
Definition of Terms, (b) Guidelines for Sub-project Preparation, (c) First Phase, including the First
Year Plan, for Land Development Sub-projects, (d) Feasibility Analysis Data on the Initial Pipeline
of Sub-projects, (e) Affordability Analysis carried out for housing proposed under the sub-projects,
and (f) the phasing plan for implementation of the initial pipeline of sub-projects.
B.    OBJECTIVES
3.    Consistent with Project goals and objectives, the Land Development Sub-component will
address the constraints on availability of land by breaking up government monopoly on supply of
land by assisting the local government in introducing land rapidly into the private housing market.
For this purpose, the Sub-component will provide assistance for the development of a practical
framework of procedural and regulatory environment responsive to a private market-oriented housing
sector at the local level. More specifically, the objectives of the Land Development Sub-component
will be: (a) to implement the national policies, legal and regulatory reforms in the participating cities;
(b) to demonstrate the tangible outcome of the government's policy reforms, as well as the feasibility
of market oriented planning process; and (c) to institutionalize the new regulatory, planning, and
administrative principles and procedures in the day to day functioning of the relevant institutions,
such as title registration system and competitive land disposal procedures. These objectives would
be achieved through (a) Institutional Development -- institutionalization of the relevant procedures

and practices through Training and Technical Cooperation, and (b) Demonstration Land Development
Sub-projects, described below.

4.    In order to transfer land from public to private ownership a number of regulations and
procedural practices have to be in place, such as clarification of property rights, title registration
system, and transparent and open land disposal procedures. The main objective of the Institutional
Development initiatives will be to create such enabling practical framework for implementation of
the sub-project. In addition, while the Sub-projects will demonstrate the feasibility of new policies
and practices, the institutionalization objective will be critical in making the impact of the of the sub-
component sustainable in the long term and establishing a practical framework for implementation
of the sub-projects. Institutionalization of relevant principles and practices of this Sub-component
will be supported by specific initiatives under the Training and Technical Assistance Component.
Detailed Training and Technical Cooperation Program is presented in Annexes 3.6 and 3.7. A
number of Technical Cooperation initiatives have already taken place during Project preparation.
These are stated below.
5.    Specific technical cooperation initiatives that have already been undertaken in support of the
Land Development Sub-component are:
a.    An Affordability Model has been introduced to the participating cities assess the
financial feasibility of Land Development Sub-projects.
b.    Local Regulatory Action Plans (RAPs) have been developed by each city, in
workshops/seminars for Land Policy and Regulations. The RAPs include key issues
that need to be instituted prior to sub-project funding such as title registration, land
allocation procedures, local land use and planning regulations. The longer term issues
included in RAPs that need to be addressed over the life of the project are housing
reform policy and Land use and building regulation. These local action plans also
identify a number of enabling federal actions that need to be addressed for successful
implementation of the sub-project as well as sustainable sectoral reform. Detailed
description of Local Regulatory Action Plans are presented in Annex 3.3.
c.    A number of seminars and workshops have been to provided to participants from
local governments, commercial banks, and private developers, under USAD'Ys
Technical Cooperation Program (Annex 3.7) in: (a) assessment of financial feasibility
of sub-projects through a Land Development Model, (b) Land Allocation and Title
Registration System, (b) Land Development Regulatory Framework, (c) Project
Finance, and (d) Project Development, including (e) Construction Finance Seminar
in the U.S. for select participants.

6.    Future training and technical cooperation activities proposed in support of the Sub-component
include:
1.    Technical assistance for Land Auction Procedures;
2.    Pilot Land Registration System;
3.    Procurement procedures and processes as per World Bank guidelines.
4.    Terms of Reference for: (a) Land Development Regulatory Audit (Annex 3.8) which
will establish the framnework for spatial, engineering and social norms of planning,
norms for development cost sharing between public and private, systems of
establishing administrative control over these processes, and the structure of fees and
taxes related to land development; and (b) Building Materials and Housing
Construction Regulations (Annex 3.8), which will develop and establish codes and
standards for fire safety regulations, building materials, building regulations,
licensing process of private product manufacturers, developers and planning
professionals.
II.   LAND DEvELopmENT SUB-PROJECTS
7.    The Land Development Sub-projects will be developed by the local authorities of the
participating cities. The local authorities will select the sites and develop proposals for Land
Development Sub-projects for appraisal by the CPIU, according to the Site Selection, Planning and
Marketing,and Environmental Guidelines established by the CPIU. These guidelines, presented in
Attachment B, have been prepared by the CPIU in conjunction with Minstroi and local developmental
guidelines. The sub-projects will be monitored by the LPIU while the CPIU with support from the
General Consultant for the Project will administer the loan disbursement and repayment on behalf
of GOR and IBRD.
8.    Presently 16 sub-projects in the five participating cities have been appraised and approved
for eligibility under the land Development line of credit. A summary of the initial pipeline of sub-
projects appraised is presented in Chapter 3, table 3.3. The Economic Rationale, Types of
Investment supported by the Sub-component, and status of the initial pipeline of appraised sub-
projects is presented in Chapter 3, section B.
9.    S=uvary of Sub-comonent Concept. The sub-component's basic objective is to increase
the amount of raw land available in the housing market. The sale of land could, inter alia, be seen
by municipal governments as means of raising resources to discharge some of the community service
responsibilities they are presently unable to meet. Auctioning of land would be desirable as it would
enable them to test the market, secure the highest returns and assure transaction transparency. For
example, participating municipalities will offer land in areas supported by suitable off-site services
by auctioning it to construction companies before construction of on-site infrastructure is undertaken,
thus testing the suitability of the land offered as well as the relative demand for improved and
unimproved land. In such auctions, municipal governments could undertake to deliver on-site
infrastructure within a specified period of time, but housing construction firms would have the option



136                                                                                AN_    3.2
to bid for the same plot of land without infrastructure. Thus, if a bidder believes that it can build
on-site infrastructure at a lower cost or more quickly than the municipal government, it should have
the opportunity to do so. The winning bid should be the one offering the highest net present value
to the municipal government for the unimproved land. For purposes of comparison, the local
government's estimated cost of on-site infrastructure construction should be deducted from bids for
improved land.
1.     Development Sequence
10.   The sub-projects will constitute seven broad steps from design to implementation. These are:
1.     Site Selection;
2.     Planning for future housing development;
3.     Auctioning of land to private developers/builders;
4.     Tendering contract for construction of public infrastructure;
5.     Appraisal of sub-project and sub-loan approval';
6.     Construction of public infrastructure;
7.     Housing Construction.
1.     Site selectlon.  The sites will be selected as per the Site Selection Guidelines (Attachment
B), and feasibility analysis carried out on the basis of Land Development Model introduced to die
cities at the onset of project preparation.
2.     Planning for future housing development. The local design institutes will prepare the sub-
projects as per the Land Development Guidelines established for the sub-projects (Attachment B).
These proposals will include feasibility analyses as per the Land Development Model, financial plan
for cost recovery and loan repayment including a schedule for auction and tendering of the parcels,
and engineering and infrastructure design guidelines. The cities will be required to include
Environmental Assessment reports carried out as per Bank guidelines.
3.     Auctioning of land to private developers/bullders. Sumnuy. In order to transfer land
from public to private ownership the cities will be required to adopt transparent and open land
disposal procedures such as land auction or competitive tendering of land parcels as part of their
Regulatory Action Plans. As a tool for investment decision, the cities are required to auction the
land prior to municipal infrastructure construction. Where auctions are unsuccessful, the reserve
price will be re-evaluated and auctions rescheduled. These procedures will maximize the local
governments rate of return from the sale of land while minimizing the risk of over-investment in land
development and infrastructure construction. The cities will revise and adapt these procedures as
they gain experience.. The cities will be provided technical assistance from the General Consultant
for the entire procedure of land auctioning and tendering.
1/     The design of initial pipeline of sub-projects have been appraised before the auction during Project
Preparation. Ihe sub-loans for these sub-projects will be approved after the auction has been held and the cides
have obtained bids for construction of public infrastructure.



ANNEX 3.2                                                                              137
a.    Auctions or competitive tenders: Sub-project sites will be sub-divided into smaller
parcels of 20-30 houses and auctioned to private builders as per guidelines summarized
below. Each of the parcels will be accompanied by Town Planning Orders, Building Permits
for certain a flexible range of house types, and legal titles for each plot. Cities will be
required to sell land either through auctions or by evaluating competitive proposals.
Competitive proposals must be open, transparent and competitive subject to criteria of
prequalification.  In either case, the local government will solicit offers after publicizing
widely through the local media. Auctions will be open to the public, and competitive tenders
will be available for public scrutiny. The winning bid will be the one offering the highest
net present value to the cities for land. The discount rate used in the evaluation will be
included in the request for proposals. The discount rate for evaluation of proposals by
private developers should be equal to subloan rate to the municipality by the central
government. The cities will publicize the result of the selection of successful bidders, the
terms of the sale and the reasons for the selection. Potential developers will be given
maximum flexibility in proposing terms. Technical assistance will be provided to both the
cities and the bidders for the land disposal procedures.
b.    Eligible Bidders.   Only private developers, co-operatives and other resident
associations, and companies with at least seventy five per cent private ownership, will be
allowed to participate. Reasonable pre-qualification of bidders based on financial capability
and development experience will be permitted.
c.     Reserve Price. The local government will set a minimum reserve price that is at least
equal to the cost of providing infrastructure to the land being sold plus the imputed value of
land. Where optional levels of infrastructure development are proposed by the private
developers, reserve prices will be adjusted accordingly. If the infrastructure benefits more
than one parcel, the local government will allocate the costs of construction on a reasonable
basis. The local government will not sell land for prices below the reserve price without
prior approval from the Bank. The reserve price will not be publicized in advance of
auctions.
d.    Res2onsibility for Infrastructure DeveloDment. The Cities will be responsible for
providing off-site infrastructure. Depending on the outcome of land auctions, the auctions
will close with cities selling either:
i.    Raw land with no infrastructure; or
ii    Land with the local government responsible for infrastructure development;
iii.    Land   with  the   developer   responsible  for  infrastructure
development; or
iv.    Land where the private developers will provide part of the infrastructure and
the cities the rest.
The cities will be encouraged to remain flexible. Based on their experience with the
first sub-projects the municipalities will be better able to assess (a) their capacity to generate
counterpart funding, (b) the financial feasibility of future land development initiatives, and
(c) their consequent ability to generate enough revenue through land sales or auction to cover



138                                                                                ANNEX 3.2
infrastructure costs and loan repayment. This will also allow the cities to provide a greater
choice to the private contractors and developers.
In all of the options the price to developer will be adjusted to take into account the
infrastructure costs being borne by the cities. Where the city is responsible for infrastructure
development and does not complete the infrastructure within the agreed time period, the
developer will be entitled to cancel the offer and receive a refund of the deposit plus interest.
In all cases, the purchasers will be responsible for constructing the infrastructure that will
run from the connecting infrastructure to the individual buildings constructed on the parcels.
e.     Tirring of the Sale. Local governments will be required to auction the land before
they award any contracts for related infrastructure construction. This will minimize the risk
to the cities of borrowing for infrastructure construction that may not be recovered from land
sales. Soliciting bids for design and construction of infrastructure would further miniimize
cost to the cities. However, it might result in significantly lower offers because of increased
developer uncertainty.
f.     Payment Terms. All payments for land will be required in cash. Payments in kind,
for example in the form of apartments or infrastructure construction, will not be permitted.
This will enable a maximum disclosure of the market price and allow for a fair comparison
of alternative offers. It will also permit the local governments to receive the cash needed for
repayment of the Bank's loan.
While this will require developers to provide more cash than normal existing
practices, the impact can be mitigated by allowing for graduated payments over an extended
time period, with the requirement that they deposit at least 10% of the offered price at the
time of the acceptance of the bid or proposal. While repayment may be tied to house sales,
the terms will be designed so that the developers pay full price of the land before half of the
parcels on their land is sold. The terms will always include a fixed date for payment.
The cities will hold the titles in escrow until the developer pays for the land. The developers
may make payments for portions of their sites that are completed and are being sold to
households. At this time the title for individual buildings will be transferred to the individual
households. Titles will not be transferred until payment is received from developers.
g.     Local Project Account and Counterpart Funding Requirement Until the city repays
the Bank borrowing, all proceeds from the sale of land will go into a special account that can
only be used for development of project sites or debt repayment. The cities will be required
to establish and maintain separate Local Project Accounts distinct from the cities' budgetary
accounts.  This will help ensure timely provision of counterpart funding for project
implementation and timely repayments of participating city loans to the Borrower. In
addition, a separate account would facilitate more efficient record-keeping and audits. After
the conclusion of the Project and repayment of the participating city loan, the city can use
the surplus funds in this account as it deems necessary. The Local Project Account must
contain at least four months of estimated counterpart funding requirements at the time of
disbursement for infrastructure contract(s) to a participating city. The Bank would monitor



ANNEX 3.2                                                                          139
the level of counterpart funding available, to ensure that it was sufficient for the completion
of the Sub-projects.
4.    Tendering contract for construction of public infrastructure. The cities in all cases will
be responsible for provision of off-site infrastructure. The outcome of the auctions will determine
the level and amount of additional infrastructure, which the private developers are unable to
construct, to be provided by the cities. At this stage the cities will be required to invite tenders from
contractors for construction of public infrastructure. The contractors for civil works will be selected
through international and local competitive bidding under the World Bank Procurement Guidelines
(see Chapter 4, paras 4.26 - 4.29). After obtaining the fnal contracts for construction of public
infrastructure, the sub-projects will be ready for appraisal by the CPIU (and the Bank). Approval
of contracts will trigger approval of sub-loans. The cities will be provided technical assistance in
the tendering and contracting procedures.
5.    Appraisal and Loan Approval. The sub-project proposals, reflecting the outcome of the
land auction and tendering for construction of public infrastructure, will be appraised by the CPIU
as per the criteria for sub-project selection (Attachment B). The design of the sub-projects in the
initial pipeline has been appraised by the Project Preparation team. Following the approval of the
sub-projects, the cities/oblasts will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the federal
govermnent. The CPIU with support from the General Consultant, will monitor and disburse the
loan from a Special Account (SA) set up in a commercial bank for the Land Development Sub-
component (TOR for the General Consultant is presented in Annex 3.8). The Commercial bank will
be selected by the Government through competitive bidding and acceptable to the World Bank (see
Chapter 4).
6.    Construction of Public Infrastructure. After obtaining the sub-loan approval, the cities will
award Civil Works Contracts and commence the construction of infrastructure. The Civil Works
Contractor may arrange sub-contractors for specialized construction work. Larger sites will be
developed in phases. The infrastructure will be designed and constructed as per the engineering
guidelines developed under the Technical Cooperation Sub-component (TOR for Land Development
Regulatory Audit is presented in Annex 3.8).
7.    Housing Construction. The private developers will construct their share of the infrastructure
in sequence with public infrastructure construction. They will construct the houses as per the Town
Planning Orders developed by the cities. The builders are expected to finance the construction
process either from their own resources or obtain financing from participating commercial banks
under the Construction Finance Line-of Credit, or commercial banks of their own selection. LPIU
will monitor the construction process and sale of the units to private owners to ensure adherence to
the Planning Orders, guidelines, and Building Standards. The commercial banks will monitor the
loan repayment for construction finance.
2.    Institutional Arrangements and Financial Channel
11.   Central Proiect Implementation Unit (CPIU)and the General Consultant. The CPIU will
contract with a General Consultant for overall administration of the Project. The Government will
on-lend funds to the local governments in participating cities to carry out the demonstration sub-



140                                                                           ANN x 3.2
projects through a Special Account (SA) in a commercial bank. The CPIU with support from the
General Consultant, will manage the SA on behalf of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Construction. The General Consultant will be responsible for overall review and monitoring of the
Land Development Sub-component. The specific functions of the General Consultant will be to (a)
monitor the SA and request disbursements as the sub-projects are implemented, (b) review sub-
projects for adherence to Project guidelines, including environmental guidelines, (c) monitor and
assist the LPIU in preparation of the sub-projects proposals, implementing land title registration
system, developing and institutionalizing Planning and Building Regulatory Guidelines, (d) provide
assistance for procurement, and auction of sub-projects sites, (e) inspect construction of
infrastructure, (f) monitor availability of local counterpart funding, and (g) report on progress to the
World Bank and IMC. Detailed responsibilities and staffing pattern are presented in Annex. For
detailed function of the General Consultant see Annex 3.8.
12.   Local Project Implementation Unit (LPIU) A Local Project Implementation Unit (LPIU) will
be established within local governments in each city for sub-project preparation and implementation.
The LPIUs will be responsible for: (a) developing and submitting proposals to CPIU for appraisal,
(b) implementation of land auctions and land marketing; (c) monitoring the implementation of
regulatory action plans and land title registration system; (d) securing collateral and counterpart
financing, (e) project management, including supervision of detailed sub-project planning,
infrastructure design, environmental analysis, contracting for civil works and construction
supervision; (f) supervision of disbursements from local budgets and loan funds; (g) accounting,
audits and reporting, and (h) coordination of local technical cooperation and training activities. The
LPIU will also be responsible for reporting functions to the Mayors of the respective cities when the
sub-projects are within city boundaries, the LCC and the CPIU.
13. Local Coordinating Committee (LCC). The LCC will be responsible for (a) approving the
work plans of each LPIU; (b) recommending to the IMG, any alterations to the Land Development
Sub-component; and (c) coordinating the various entities which will be involved in implementing the
Project at the local level.
14.   Detailed implementation arrangements of the Sub-component are described in Chapter 5.
Detailed responsibility and staffing pattern are presented in Annex 5.2. Financing mechanisms, and
cost-recovery analysis are discussed in detail in Annex 4.2.



ANNEX 3.2                                                                                141
ATrACHMENT A: DEFINITION OF TERMS
Definition of terms as used under the Land Development Sub-component is presented below:
1.    Site: The entire area containing parcels of land to be auctioned for residential and other
development, as well as parks, open-space, community facilities (sometimes called "social
infrastructure") and land needed for utilities and infrastructure such as roads, utility easements, and
substations. There are sixteen sites in the Land Development sub-component.
2.    Parcel: An area of land to be auctioned or sold for development. Generally a parcel is large
enough to contain many dwelling units, and the purchaser will be a developer or builder intending
to construct such units and sell them on the real-estate market. A site will generally be subdivided
into a nunber of parcels, the sum total of which will be the 'net saleable area' of the site. A parcel
purchased at auction generally contains no infrastructure, and may contain a number of plots (see
below). The builder is responsible for connecting his dwelling units to the infrastructure which will
usually be located in the adjacent street.
3.    Plot: An area of land intended for a single building such as a single-family house, a
townhouse or apartment building under the control of its tenants/ home-owners.
4.    Primary Off-site Infrastructure: This is generally a plant or facility serving a wide area of
the city, such as a water-treatment plant, an electricity substation or a heating plant. Primary off-site
infrastructure may be included in the sub-component when the capacity of an existing facility is
insufficient to support the amount of development proposed for a given Site.
5.     Infrastructure Network: The system  of pipes, roads, lines or other conduits linking
development to a Primary Infrastructure facility. For cost-recovery purposes some of this network
is categorized as 'on-site" and some as "off-site". Generally, maintenance of the network is the
responsibility of the city or a utility enterprise, but construction of portions of the network may be
undertaken by either the city or a private developer.
6.     Connecting Infrastructure: For the purposes of this project, this is the portion of an
infrastructure network within the boundaries of a Site which connects or services the various Parcels
of land to be auctioned. The Connecting Infrastructure is generally within a street or on public
property. It may be constructed by the developers of adjacent parcels if suitable agreements on
delivery dates, construction standards and permitting by city authorities can be made. Otherwise city
agencies should be responsible for construction under WB procurement regulations. These authorities
will ultimately

ArrACHMENT B: GUIDELINES FOR SUB-PROJECT PREPARATION
1.    Guidelines for the Land Development Sub-project Selection were discussed and developed
by the Bank in conjunction with the cities during Project Preparation. These generally fall into four
categories:
1.    Site Selection Guidelines
2.    Planning and Marketing Guidelines
3.    Environmental Guidelines
4.    Cost-recovery Guidelines
1.    SITE SELECTIoN GUIDELINES
2.    Site Selection Guidelines were developed after a number of discussions with planners and
developers. It was agreed sites were going to be selected as per the following guidelines:
a.    have all necessary utilities nearby (i.e., at or near the edge of the site);
b.    have ready access to public transportation and existing community facilities;
c.    not require excessive site preparation (landfill, drainage, regrading etc);
d.    be generally compatible with the present Master Plan regarding land-use;
e.    be situated on land already under city/oblast control, or which can be readily acquired
at reasonable cost from a Sovkhoz (collective farm) or other organization/enterprise;
f.    not be pre-allocated to a developer nor be under construction; and
g.    have no major environmental defects which would cause delays due to irnpact studies
or major expense to rectify problems.
2.    PLANNING AND MARKETING GUIDELINES
3.    An Affordability Model which would enable the cities to perform a basic planning and cost
analysis of the serviced sites was introduced at the on-set of Project Preparation. Such an analysis
for the sub-projects is presented in Attachment E. The basic guidelines of the model are as follows:
a.    Anticipated house sales prices and the number of units in a given price-range should
be within potential market demand;
b.    Housing plots should be sized to ensure infrastructure is affordable;
c.    Housing densities should follow master plan norms for each district, but with both
maximum and minimum densities set through the Town Planning Orders;
d.    Percent of saleable land should be at least 55 %
e.    Subsidies: purchase price of serviced land should not show cross-subsidies
f.    Raw land values should be positive.
g.    Proportion of serviced land costs to jQj housing cost to be approximately 30 - 40%
h.    Construction costs should reflect modest standards, while minimizing subsequent
maintenance costs.
3.    ENvRONMENTAL GUIDELINES AND RELOCATION GUIDELNES



ANNEx 3.2                -                                                           143
4.    All sub-project sites must have a preliminary enviromnental assessment carried out as per
Standard World Bank Guidelines, before the preparation of sub-projects proposal. Upon appraisal
and approval of the sub-projects, the cities are expected to carry out detailed Environmental
Assessment for each site.
5.    The initial pipeline of sub-projects have been subject to an Environmental Assessment in
accordance with World Bank Guidelines. The sub-projects have been selected such that there is
minimal relocation of existing housing. The Environmental Assessment was carried out by
international consultants working under a grant from USAID, in conjunction with Russian counterpart
consultant engineers. In general the net environmental impact of all sites is expected to be positive,
in terms of relieving overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in several cities. No significant and
irreversible environmental impacts are anticipated for any of the sites.  Annex 3.9 presents a
summary of the Environmental Assessment carried out for these sub-projects.
4.    CosT RECOVERY AND LOAN REPAYMENT GUIDELINES
6.    The salability of plots is the key to cost recovery; the selection of appropriate sites has been
confirmed by engineers, real-estate brokers and developers in each city. In some cities the private
housing market cannot be documented with adequate data confirming recent sales and sales prices;
in such cases development will be phased in a prudent way in order to test the market in the first few
years. At the same time site plans and the Town Planning Orders which govern each site are
designed to be flexible enough to be adapted to an emerging market.
7.    To minimize financial risk to the local governments and to ensure adequate cost recovery,
the cities will be required to auction land with minimum infrastructure to purchasers. A reserve
price will be placed on each parcel of serviced land to be sold at auction or by tendered bid. In the
event that the reserve price is not realized, the sale will be abandoned, the reserve price re-evaluated,
and the sale rescheduled. The reserve price will include:
a.    the full investment in on-site infrastructure;
b.    relocation costs;
c.    the portion of off-site infrastructure costs allocated to the site;
d.    underlying land value as estimated in the Affordability Model, and
e.    administrative costs associated with project design and implementation.
8.    The proceeds from the land sales are the key to cost-recovery under this component.
Following sections outline the guidelines that were prepared for the cities to ensure full cost recovery
from land development and sale of parcels to private developers. Annex 4.2 presents an analysis
of the loan repayment potential of the local governments, as well as detailed financing plan by
components.
Compter Models. A computer model that has been used in a number of other Bank projects
to analyze potential sites for the project, have been introduced to the local governments. The
model provides a means of quickly analyzing physical and financial alternatives.

Summary of SteRs in the Analysis Process. The guidelines and procedures for deterrn  ng
potential sales' values of the sites selected by the cities, fall in the following categories:
a.     Determine Site Physical Characteristics
b.     Determine Physical Infrastructure Requirements
c.     Estimate Sales Prices and Demand
d.     Planning Infrastructure Construction and Land Sales Phasing
e.     Estimate Base Costs for Infrastructure and Housing Construction
f.     Make assumptions for:
i.    Inflation
ii.    Design Costs
iii.    Supervision Costs
iv.    Bank Share of Project Financing
v.     Interest Rates
vi.    Loan Repayment Period
vii.   Developer Profit Margin
viii.   Customs Duties and Taxes
g.     Conduct sensitivity analysis
a.     Determine Site Physical Characteristics.  Land use, density and construction
characteristics have a major impact on the financial feasibility of the project. The model
analyses the impacts of these factors on the potential sales prices of land. The model helps
plan the percentages of land that will be used for different types of residential construction,
office and commercial space, community facilities, roads and parks and open space, as these
will affect both the revenue and the project costs. Office and commercial space should yield
higher land prices than residential space. Community facilities, on the other hand, will not
yield any revenue but will add to the infrastructure cost.
The model uses assumptions for usable area and the ratio of the usable area to the
gross floor area of individual houses, apartnents and office and commercial facilities, to
deternine the amount of floor space the developer must construct. Floor area rato is
another important assumption in the model since it determines how much construction a
specific amount of land can support and, therefore, how much the developer can pay for the
land. The higher the floor area ratio, the higher the price that the developer can pay. The
cities can control these factors through planning guidelines.
b.     Determine Physical Infrastructure Reauirements Off site-infrastructure often benefits
other sites in the city other than the sub-project sites. However, the cost of facilities that
benefit larger areas is pro-rated in the economic analysis of the site so that only the cost
related to the site is included in the sub-project cost estimates. For instance, if the city must
build new facilities such as waste water treatrnent plant, to service the sub-projects sites, the
model takes into account the total cost of the new facilities as the cities will have to finance
the entire project. However only a portion of this cost is allocated to the site. The cities'
fnancing plans address the total cost. Infrastructure projects include may include -- Water



ANNE 3.2                                                                             145
Treatment and Distribution, Wastewater Collection and Treatment, District Heating, Roads,
Electricity, Schools, Parks, Public Medical Facilities, Other Community Facilities
c.    Estimate Sales Prices and Demand. The model derives land prices by starting with
the final price that consumers will pay for housing and commercial facilities. Separate
estimates must be made for individual housing, apartments and commercial space. The cities
initially used their knowledge of local market conditions to estimate prices. Later, they
revised the estimates based on information from USAID funded real Estate Market Analysis
in each city. The studies, which were carried out by independent research groups, looked at
consumer preferences, their resources, transactions and developers' activities. The purpose
was to evaluate the current conditions and also to establish a framework for further
evaluations over time. A summary of the analysis is presented in Annex 1.4. Assumptions
will be modified for later sites and phases based on the results from the first phases.
d.    Determine Infrastructure Construction and Land Sales Phasing. An important policy
decision facing the cities is the timing of the land auctions in the development sequence of
the sub-projects. There are three possibilities. With respect to infrastructure in the sub-
project sites the cities will have the option of selling:
a.    Raw land with no infrastructure;
b.    Land with the local government responsible for infrastructure development;
c.    Land with the developer responsible for infrastructure development; or
d.    Land where the private developers will provide part of the infrastructure and
the cities the rest.
The cities might prefer to undertake the infrastructure development because they fear
a desire on the part of the infrastructure developers to expect too much profit (possible
because of the risk in these early projects), quality control and developers lack access to
financing. The developers, on the other hand, may be reluctant to bid, or discount land
prices heavily if the infrastructure is not in place and they do not control the infrastructure
development. The cities will deal with these problems by attempting to sell the land after
bids are taken for the infrastructure construction.
e.    Estimate Costs for Infrastructure and Housing Construction. The cities will use the
design institutes to estimate infrastructure costs. The estimates will be reviewed by the
General Consultant firm on behalf of the CPIU. A 15% physical contingency will be added
to the cost estimates. The construction industry in Russia is in a state of transition to private
ownership and management. The bidding procedure is also relatively new while there are
serious financing and material shortages. Cost estimates for later phases will, therefore, be
revised based on actual experience.
f.    Make Other Assum2tions. The other assumptions in the model will be made based
on current Russian conditions.
g.    Carry Out Sensitivity Analysis. Because of the uncertainty regarding the assumptions
and the need to develop broad development controls, sensitivity analyses will be a key to the



146                                                                                  ANNE  3.2
development of the sub-projects. This analysis focuses on the effects of changes on two main
indicators: (i) the Cost Coverage Ratio, and (ii) the Loan Coverage Ratio.
1.     The Cost Coverage Ratio2 is the ratio of the site's infrastructure cost to its estimated
selling price of the land. This ratio is designed to make sure that the site will be
profitable. A ratio of more than 100 per cent would mean that the sale of the land
would not cover the cost of providing infrastructure. The lower the rado, the more
margin there is for error in the assumptions. Off-site infrastructure costs are included
only to the extent that they benefit the site. For instance, if a collector sewer benefits
a larger area than the project site, only a share of its cost would be pro-rated to the
site based on relative expected usage.
b.     The Loan Coverage Ratio is the ratio of the loan to the expected sales price of the
land. This is the percentage of the selling price of the land that must actually be
realized to repay the loan. It is different from the Cost Coverage because (a) It will
be lower because the loan will not cover the full cost of infrastructure - taxes,
capitalized interest,  imputed developer's profit and land acquisition costs are
included in the cost but not in the loan, and (b) on the other hand, this will be off-set
to the extent that the loan finances off-site infrastructure that benefits non-project
sites. The loan will finance as much of the necessary off-site infrastructure as
possible to ensure that funds are available to the cities and that the projects will be
completed in a timely manner. The project will limit this ratio to a maximum of 80
per cent of the expected selling costs of the land.
2X Note that the concept of the coverage ratio used here is the reciprocal of the usual coverage ratio because
it is eier to tink in tems of the percetage of the land saes that must be realized to cover the costs of the project

ArrACHMENT C: FwRST YEAR PLAN FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT SUB-PROJECrS
1.    The sites selected for the first phase program are generally those which have minimal
infrastructure problems and costs, particularly in terms of bringing services to the sites. They have
few environmental problems, if any. The phasing of all sites has been discussed with each city, and
the selected first-year sites have been agreed. The attached table is presented in three parts: the first
section deals exclusively with the first-year program; the second part suimnarizes the infrastructure
costs for all first phase sites(including the first year); the third part presents the site area, mnmber
and type of dwelling units to be constructed in the first phase of the sub-projects.
The sites selected for the first-year program are:
St Petersburg       Kolomagi (townhouses and apartments)
Kamenka (townhouses only)
Novgorod            Pskovskaya (townhouse area)
Tver                Youzhny D (townhouses only)
Nizhny Novgorod    Delovaya (apartmnents)
Barnaul             Solnechnaya Polyana West (single-family and townhouses)
2.    First Year Sub-projects in St.Petersburg and Proposed Environmental Mitigation. The
infrastructure in St.Petersburg presently meets the needs of the current population in a very limited
way. Any site that could be potentially identified for Land Development sub-projects would require
investment in upgrading off-site infrastructure for servicing the sites, similar to that proposed under
the project for the first phase sites. Such investment would be required to (a) extend basic services
to the sub-project sites, and (b) to mitigate the additional water and sewer capacity load created by
the new development. Both of the St Petersburg first year sites are in the northern part of the city
where they will be supported by an independent package of infrastructure improvements agreed with
the city.
3.    The proposed investment in off-site infrastructure for the first phase of Land Development
Sub-component-termed as the 'Environmental Mitigation Package", is smaller in comparison to the
investment required for other sites or any new sites that could potentially qualify for the Project.
The current mitigation plan for the northern sites is aimed at completion of high priority water and
waste-water facility components and items as identified by St.Petersburg Vodacanal and Project's
environmental experts, that are directly related to the sub-project sites.

4.    The present Environmental Mitigation Package, totalling $25 million, of which 18.75 million,
excluding design fees, taxes, and contingencies, will be financed under the loan, consists of the
following:
*     Pumping Station                                $ 4.60 million
*     Primorskaya Highway Collector sewer            $ 4.60 million
*     NW waste-water treatment plant
(grit removal, metering and technical assistance)   $ 3.04 million
*     Water-line rehabilitation                      $12.26 million
(over two years)
Total Cost                                           $25.00 million
Total to be rfanced under the loan                   $18.75 million
5.    The Table. The total first-phase infrastructure program is approximately $67.6 million
(January, 1994 prices exclusive of interest). All site acquisition costs, and taxes are considered to
be local responsibilities--an estimated 20% of the infrastructure construction costs-to be paid for out
of municipal budget, with the rest 80% eligible for financing under the Bank loan.

ATTACHMENT E: AFFORDABILrTY ANALYSIs
1.    This attachment presents the affordability analyses carried out for the initial pipeline of sub-
projects appraised by the PRU present in attached tables. These table present comparison of data
on proposed housing sales-prices in the sixteen Land Development sites, with information on the
housing market derived from the surveys in five cities (The summary of the surveys are presented
in Annex 1.4 and the survey reports are available in Project files):
Table 1      Presents the proposed number and sales-prices for dwelling units of each type
on each site; and
Table 2      Presents the Affordability Analyses of the Units in each on the basis of
housing market survey results.
2.    Potential Beneficiaries. In the Household Surveys, data from a sample grouping each city
was extrapolated for the city as a whole to determine the percentage and finite number of families
would could raise cash for new housing under several scenarios. In each city the number of families
that could privatize their present homes was determined. In general it is between 77% and 97% of
the total number of families in each city. There exists a distinction between total families and families
"that could privatize". The market for new private housing in the near- to medium-term future will
comprise families who can sell their present apartment to raise cash to pay for a new home. The
market for new housing will be drawn from those who can sell their present home, and possibly add
cash savings into the deal. Other sources of financing such as personal savings, mortgage financing
from banks or employers, are not easily available. Also, not all families are free to privatize their
apartments as some are historic or architectural landmarks, or have other restrictions. Therefore
potential beneficiaries are derived from the universe of families who are free to privatize their
present apartments.
3.    Table 2 presents several price-ranges in rubles and doUar equivalents (January 1994 exchange
rates: $1 = Rub. 1500) The figures shown are mid-range in each case. The percentage of families
who could raise cash in each price range is derived from the household surveys, and takes into
account such factors as current income, declared assets, level of affluence as determined by the
interviewer based on observations of the interviewees surroundings and personal possessions. The
percentages and finite number of eligible families in each price range was determined by the surveys
using regression analyses.
4.    The percentages of families who could raise the appropriate amount of cash are shown under
three scenarios:
1.   those who already have cash or liquid assets;
2.    those who have cash supplemented by the ability to obtain a loan; and
3.    those who have cash supplemented by the value of their present apartment. This third
scenario gives the highest results, and thus represents the potential market.
5.    The number of housing units being proposed for sites in the Land Development component
is compared to the potential market in each price range. The proportion of families that can afford
a house in a particular price range is cumulative in that those who can afford a home in any given

price rane can also afford homes in lower price ranges. Table 2 also shows the number of houses
proposed for each site as a percentage of its total market and it indicates the number of houses on
the enire site; and the number proposed for the first-year program.
6.    Conclusions.  The housing proposed under the Land Development Sub-component is
affordable to a large proportion of households with assets in the form of present units. Table 2
shows:
1.    that apartments, which are 70.3 % of total number of dwelling units proposed on the
program as a whole will be affordable to 10%-40% of the household population
across the five participating cities; townhouses, which are 26.3 % of total number of
units proposed will be, affordable to 0.5 %-30% of the same number of households,
while the single family houses, 3.4% of total number of dwelling units proposed in
the first pipeline of sub-projects, are affordable to 0.1 % - 0.6% of households that
can privatized their apartments across the cities.
2.    that a large number of houses will be affordable to an acceptably large segment of
the population. The median dwelling price ($32,000) is affordable by 20% of families
in the five cities, and the median apartment price ($28,000) will be affordable by
30% of families.
3.    When compared with the percentage of market that the dwelling units will constitute,
its apparent that families that will occupy the Land Development sites will represent
less than 5% of the universe of those that could afford them. In other words, the
project is reaching out to a fairly large segment of the population, in terms of their
ability to afford such housing.
7.    Only in Novgorod where the size of the city (and thus the market) is very small, and
therefore, a very snall first-year program is recommended to test the market. There appears to be
some flexibility to reduce sales prices and build cheaper alternative units. In Nizhny Novgorod, too,
a smal first-year program will test the market in certain price-categories.

- STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.3
SUMMARY OF LOCAL REGULATORY ACTION PLANS
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.    As a condition to participation in the Project, each participating city is required to adopt and
implement a regulatory action plan providing the establishment of the basic legal infrastructure
necessary for implementation of the land development and construction finance components and
success in meeting the basic objectives of the project. This annex provides (a) a brief background
on the development of the local Regulatory Action Plans (RAPs), (b) the key issues addressed in
each RAP, (c) the federal actions necessary to enable local RAPs, and (d) the draft RAP from
Nizhny Novgorod as an example.
B.    PREPARATION OF THE RAPs
2.    The RAPs were developed according to the following process.
a. Legal and Regulatory Audit. The team reviewed the laws of the Russian Federation and
aLl participating cities to identify any legal impediments to implementation of the components
and any actions required to provide the legal and regulatory foundation of the components.
The team developed memoranda for the cities identifying actions required to provide the
necessary legal support.
b. Intergovermnental Coordination. The team held further discussions with the cities
based on the issues identified for action in the memoranda, and held a seminar in Moscow
from January 27-29, 1994 focusing on the issues of land allocation, land use regulation, and
title registration. The seminar was attended by officials from six proposed project cities, as
well as several federal ministries involved in land and housing issues. The seminar
emphasized the required actions at both the federal and municipal levels.
c. Preparation of a Federal Action Program. Based on issues raised during the seminar,
the team generated a list of requested federal actions to clarify existing rights and to make
explicit the authority of municipalities to issue regulations in the required fields.
d.    Preparation of Local Action Plans.  All the cities have participated in the
preparation of their own draft RAPs.
e.    Final negotiations. Based on the material supplied by the cities, and discussions with
the cities, final action plans were delivered to each of the six proposed cities and the federal
project representatives (an example of a completed RAP, for Nizhny
Novgorod, is attached) during the first weeks of August 1994.

B.    KEY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE RAPS
3.    The action plans describe steps that the cities will take in the following broad areas, split into
two implementation schedules.
Prior to Project Funding
a. Title Registration. Development and implementation of a workable system of title
registration ( includes transactions in land and real estate) at a scope covering at a minimum
the districts in which the proposed land development sub-project sites are located.
b. Land Allocation Procedures. Development and implementation of rules, procedures,
and development of supporting legal documentation for the competitive transfer of land (by
auction and competitive tender) from public to private ownership.
c. Local Land Use and City Planning Regulation. Development and implementation of
local land use regulation governing the proposed land development sub-project sites that
encourage private-sector initiative in design and construction.
During the Life of the Project
d. Housing Reform. Development and implementation of local regulations necessary to
supplement and implement federal housing legislation in the areas of common ownership of
multifamily housing (condominium and cooperative) and private management and
maintenance of housing.
e. Land Use and Building Regulation. Ongoing audit of local land use and building
regulations in light of changing market conditions.
C.    ENABLING FEDERAL AcTIoNs
4.    In the course of developing the local RAPs, city officials raised several issues that would
benefit from some action at the federal level. While not considered essential to proceeding with the
Housing Project, the federal government is considering action in the following areas to support local
government initiatives:
a. Clarification of the Authority of the Cities/Regions to Allocate Land for Private
Sector Development. Included here are basic issues regarding the authority of cities and
regions to provide land for private sector development, as well as the issues of fundamental
property rights (the rights of housing development enterprises to hold land for development;
the rights of development enterprises to convey land to housing purchasers; the authority of
cities to sell rather than lease land.. .etc.). Following a Presidential Decree No. 2287, of
December 24, 1993 which revoked major provisions of the 1991 Land Code, there was
confusion regarding the status and of existing property rights and the scope of local
government authority to affect these rights. At this time, however, there is a consensus that
there is an adequate legal framework in place to permit localities to allocate land to the



ANNEX 3.3                                                                          167
private sector and to protect the rights of private sector developers and housing purchasers.
A new Land Code is presently under consideration in the State Duma which would clarify
and improve the status of property rights; however, enactrnent of this Code is not a condition
of proceeding.
b. Creation of Procedures and Documentation for the Allocation of Land to Private
Sector Developers. Since the revocation of Roskomzem's proposed regulation on land
auctions and tenders, the authority of cities to develop procedures for land transfer in the
absence of federal regulations has been somewhat unclear. The existence of such procedures
are essential for the Project. However, the legal validity of land allocation through auction
or tender has been recognized in federal law (Presidential Decree No. 2167). Regional
governments throughout Russia ("subjects of the federation") take the position that they have
the authority to enact their own land disposition regulations in the absence of conflicting
federal enactments. This position is also supported by the Ministry of Justice. Accordingly,
while the prompt enactment of a federal regulation on local land disposition proceedings
would be desirable, it is widely believed that regulations enacted by regional governments
or by local governments under delegation of authority from regional governments will permit
minimum project requirements to be met.
c. Clarification of the Authority of the Cities/Regions to Establish Systems of Real
Estate Registration to Accommodate the Needs of the Projects. A system of title
registration should be created for each of the project areas. The system should be capable
of registering both real estate titles and mortgages. The Government's goal of delineating
authority for design of this system by level of govermnent has not been amendable to a
speedy resolution. While the national and regional governments continue to delineate their
respective spheres of authority on land registration issues, it may be necessary to safeguard
the authority of the participating jurisdictions to address these issues by granting authority
to proceed on an experimental basis. However, even in the absence of explicit experimental
authority, there is widespread opinion that pending enactment of a definitive federal law or
regulation, subjects of the federation, or municipalities acting under authority delegated by
a subject of the federation, are free to devise their own regulations to govern real estate title
registration.
d. Clarification of the Authority of the Cities/Regions to Develop Procedures for
Development and Approval of Town Planning Documentation for Private Sector
Development. Minstroi, the federal Ministry of Construction, has provided its assurances
of full cooperation in the event that conflicts arise between technical standards determined
to be appropriate for selected sub-projects under the Project, and the prevailing national
technical standards in force for the Russian Federation.
D.    SAMPLE RAP FROM NiZHNY NOVGOROD
5.    A draft of the RAP developed for Nizhny Novgorod is attached.

- STAFF APPRAiSAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.4
CONSTRUCTION FINANCE SUB-COMPONENT
A.    BACKGROUND
1.     The design of this component is based on a survey of housing projects in the participating
cities, followed by consultations with developers, banks and Minstroi. The survey, carried out by
Russian consultants', has yielded a pipeline of 172 housing projects by 86 developers, representing
about 48,000 dwelling units at an estinated total cost of US$ 1,344 million. Most of these are real
projects, with a site or land development rights, at least preliminary designs, cost estimates, and a
marketing plan. Many of the projects are ready for construction.   After the survey, a general
meeting with bankers and developers was organized in each of the cities to provide information on
the construction fnance line of credit, and to answer questions. Finally, interviews were held with
about 40 local developers and bankers, as well as with ten ISB banks from Moscow, St.Petersburg
and Tver, and Minstroi, to complement project information, listen to their views of the housing
market, and discuss the lending guidelines, terms and conditions. For a detailed description of the
survey fmdings see Annex 1.4.
B.    GOALS AND TARGET GROUP
2.     Because the demonstrated demand for construction finance is far in excess of the funds that
can be allocated under the line of credit (US$ 80 million), the Government has requested that the
available funds be used to test and demonstrate new approaches to housing and to provide support
to the emerging private housing sector. In the light of recent housing policy reforrns2, during
negotiations the government requested that completion of unfinished housing--which is auctioned to
private developers within the guidelines of the Project--be eligible for financing under the lie-of-
credit. Where possible, the leverage of these credits would be used to introduce more appropriate
I/  AUREC from St. Petersburg (for St.Petersburg, Novgorod and Nizhny Novgorod) and POLIS-3 from
Moscow (for Tver), which have also carried out housing market surveys, and M-ART (Barnaul) which was in
charge of designing the land development site in Barnaul.
2/ The Presidential decree "On measures to provide for comnpletion of unfinished apartments' N 1181, June
10, 1994, stipulates that (a) unfinished apartment buildings currently under federal ownership, are subject to transfer
and sale for the purposes of completion through investment and commercial tenders; and (b) where such housing
is currently under ownership of subjects of Russian Federation or local governments, these bodies should adopt
similar resolutions for disposition and subsequent completion of such housing. The decree also regulates the
procedure of the transfer and sale of unfinished apartment buildings for the purpose of completions, through
investment and commercial tenders, documentation and monitoring the sale-purchase contract. In case of
commercial tender, the building would be sold on a competitive basis on condition of completion of housing, while
giving the developer the right to sell the finished apartments.



178                     _                                                      ANNEX 3.4
planning and housing standards, to diversify housing supply, and to encourage the production of
affordable private housing accessible to a larger section of the population.
3.    Target group. The ultimate target group for the component is the lowest possible income
group that can afford to pay the full price for un-subsidized housing produced under market
conditions. Initially the ideal purchasers would be trend-setting middle-income families who would
generate a demand for alternative types of housing and building technologies that, in turn, would
encourage developers to respond.
4.    In order to better the benefits of the component to this group better, and prevent the line of
credit from being used for expensive housing, limits would be set on plot sizes, floor areas, and loan
amounts.
C.    LENDING GUIDELINES
5.    The lending guidelines translate these objectives into practical criteria for the selection and
design of projects. The aim of the guidelines is to demonstrate or encourage:
a.    diversification of housing supply (e.g. town houses, row houses, low or medium-rise
apartments, etc. that provide alternatives to the present limited choice between
standard apartmnents in high-rise buildings or unaffordable single-family housing);
b.    alternative building methods and technologies, using currently available local building
materials in more effective ways;
c.    lower construction, operating and maintenance costs;
d.    greater energy efficiency, (i) in production of materials, (ii) in building methods, and
(iii) in heating of buildings;
e.    the emergence of private, smaller-scale builders (developers, contractors) by favoring
building methods and housing types not requiring heavy investment in plant and
equipment;
6.    Eligible Borrowers. Eligible final borrowers will be private developers (legally separate
civilian enterprises with at least 75 percent private ownership), residents' associations and housing
cooperatives;
7.    Eligible Products and Services.  Subloans will have to be in the housing sector  for
construction finance purposes only and will have to comply with the technical guidelines detailed in
these guidelines.



ANNEX 3.4                _                                                           179
8.    Location and Regeulatorv Action Plan. Sub-projects eligible for Construction Finance Line-of-
credit should be located either (i) in the jurisdictions of the participating cities3 and Moscow, or (ii)
in other jurisdictions within 15 Iam from the limits of these city jurisdictions, provided that a
Regulatory Action Plan has been agreed upon with the relevant jurisdiction and the oblast/krai. For
Moscow, no Regulatory Action Plan is required. Housing projects situated on the land development
sites, financed under the Land Development Sub-component of the Loan, are also eligible under the
same lending guidelines, terms and conditions.
9.    Environmental Review. All sub-projects must comply with the environmental requirements
of the Russian Federation and the World Bank. The participating bank will be responsible for
ensuring that environmental reviews are carried out in accordance with "Environmental Review
Procedures for Participating Banks" developed for the Private Enterprise Support Project. These
procedures and requirements are independent but parallel to the Russian Federations's regulatory
requirements for environmental review, and would be monitored by the CPIU and IBRD.   The
environmental review would be carried out at the expense of the participating bank or its borrower.
The cost of conducting the review would be eligible for financing under the sub-loan.
In summary, the procedure entails the following steps:
(a)   as part of their application for credits, the participating bank and its borrower will
submit for each site an environmental screening form indicating the nature of the sub-
project, the category of the project in terms of its environmental impact, and whether
an environmental assessment will be needed; all new construction sub-projects
consisting of 10 or more units constructed on virgin land or land to be acquired will
require an environmental assessment.
(b)   in case it is required, an environmental assessment will be carried out by the sub-
borrower to identify, predict, evaluate and mitigate the environmental impacts and
risks that may arise from the proposed sub-project.
10.   Site Design. At least 60 percent of the land area on the project sites should be marketable
as residential or commercial plots.
11.   Eligible Tyves of Housing Proiects
(a)   low-rise apartment buildings (less than five floors, no elevator);
(b)   townhouses (three floors or less);
(c)   small detached or semi-detached single-family houses;
(d)   apartment buildings of up to ten floors (in larger cities only or for completion of
unfmished apartment buildings);
3/ St.Petersburg, Novgorod, Tver, Nizhny Novgorod and Barnaul.



180                                                                                 ANNEX 3.4
(e)    reconstruction of inner-city buildings;
(f)    rehabilitation of privatized apartrnent buildings;
(g)    Completion of unfinished apartment buildings (up to ten floors only).
12.    Plot and Dwelling Size Within a given housing project, only the costs directly related to
the construction of dwelling units answering the following plot size and floor area criteria will be
eligible for credits:
Table 1: Maximum plot size and floor area per type of dwelling
Dwelling type                                        | Maximum          Maximum gross

Apartment (Also applicable to unfunished buildings)                     80
Town house                                             200              120
Semi-detached single-family house                      300              150
Small detached single-family house                     400              150
13.    Land and Infrastructure Development   of on-site (secondary or tertiary) engineering
infrastructure is eligible for separate construction credits, either as part of a housing project, or on
its own in view of the sale of serviced plots. However, the following items are not eligible for
financing: (i) the cost of utility hook-ups, which is considered to be part of the normal building
construction cost, and therefore not eligible for separate credits, and (ii) the cost of urban or district
heating and hot water supply for single-family housing.
14.   Off-site (primary or secondary) infrastructure as a rule is not eligible for construction credits.
However, on the sites financed under the land development component of the project, when housing
developers take responsibility for building infrastructure outside their parcels, these works are
eligible for construction credits.
15.   Only infrastructure works undertaken under the responsibility of the housing developer are
eligible and the maximum amount of credit will be determined on the basis of designs and cost
estimates. General infrastructure contributions or taxes, sometimes charged to developers by
municipalities, are not eligible for financing under the component. Social infrastructure is eligible
for financing under commercial space (see below).
16.   Commnunitv Facilities and Commercial Space    Community facilities (so-called social
infrastructure) and commercial space included in a housing project are eligible for construction
credits, up to a maximum of 30 percent of the total floor area, including residential, commercial and
community facilities, that is eligible for credits.



ANNE 3.4                                                                             181
17.   Comletion of Unfinished Apartment Buildings.  Subloans are available to finance the
completion of unfinished buildings. Subloans may finance construction only; they are not available
to purchase the building itself. Decree #1180 of July 10, 1994 defines government's program for
completion of unfinished apartnent building. Subloans must be used to support the completion of
unfinished construction that was declared as unfinished before effectiveness of the World Bank loan.
Developers must have acquired buildings for completion through the commercial bidding process
described in Decree #1 180.
18.   Maximum Credit Amounts.  Credit limits for building construction and infrastructure are
75 percent of the estmted cost (including VAT), with a maxiimum of 75 percent of the average cost
(including VAT). Average construction costs and credit limits shall be updated prior to negotiation
of the Loan and periodically thereafter, during the yearly project reviews, to reflect inflation and
construction costs increases4.
19.   Buildin2 Construction. Currently, the average construction cost per sguare meter of floor
ae is USS 380, based on the estimated cost of the projects in the pipeline. Therefore, the current
credit limit is 75 percent of this amount, or USS 285 per square meter of eligible gross floor area
for residential, commercial or community facility purpose. Combining maximum eligible floor areas
and maximum credit amounts, the maximum credit per unit for different types of housing is as
follows:
4I Section 6 of this annex shows an analysis of current construction costs.

Town house, row house (max. 120 m2)                                   34,200
Detached or semi-detached single-family house (max. 150 m2)           42,750
20.   Infrastructure. The current average cost of on-site engineering infrastructure is US$ 25
(including VAT) Mer square meter of land or site area6, based on the average estimated cost of on-site
infrastructure in the Land Development Component. Thus the current credit limit is 75 percent of
this amount, or US$ 18.75 per square meter of land serviced.
21.   Construction Technoloyv.   With the exception of reinforced concrete panel (solid or
sandwich) for outer walls, and reinforced concrete volumetric blocks, all construction technologies
are permitted, provided they comply with the energy efficiency criteria below. Reinforced panel
construction will be permitted only in the cases of completion of unfinished buildings or rehabilitation
of existing buildings.
22.   Energy Efficiency.   Construction details of the outer shells of the buildings must comply
with minimum thermo-resistance standards. Prior to completion of Subsidiary Loan Agreement,
Minstroi will propose thermo-resistance norms acceptable to the Bank. The table below summarizes
some of the data.
5/ Loans are limited to 75% of construction cost, subject to the maximum ceilings stated in the table.
6/ Note that the credit limit for building construction relates to floor area, and the credit limit for
infrastructure to land area. Therefore, these two amounts cannot be added to, or subtracted from each other.

23.   In case of completion of unfinished buildings, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of existing
buildings, no norms for outer walls and floors against the ground would apply, unless the walls or
floors are to be replaced.
24.   District or urban heating and hot water supply for single-family housing is not eligible for
construction credits. In the case of apartment buildings, if district heating and hot water supply are
financed, provision must be made for (i) consumer control of heat and (ii) later installation of thermal
energy meters.
25.   Sales and OwnershiR.  All new dwelling units produced would be sold at market prices.
Ownership rights will be the fullest permitted by law at that time. For apartment buildings a
condominium association or comparable arrangement would be required to ensure un-subsidized and
adequate maintenance at the expense of the owners and/or occupants.
26.   Periodic Revision of the Guidelines.  This set of guidelines, including maximum credit
amounts per square meter, would be reviewed and amended, where necessary, during the yearly
project review.
27.   Summar of lending guidelines The table below summarizes the lending guidelines and
maximum credit amounts.

I/ Determined as 75 % of the current average construction cost, which in August 1994 was US$ 25/m2 of
floor area for building construction and USS 25/m2 of site area for on-site engineering infrastructure; during project
implementation these amounts would be revised periodically as needed.



ANNEX 3.4                                                                          185
D.    ON-LENDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1.     Participating Banks (PBs).  Twenty private candidate PBs have been selected for
participation in the FIDP, during a multi-stage selection process carried out since mid-1993 in close
cooperation with the Russian authorities and with the support of several other international agencies.
In this process, two thousand Russian banks have been screened.
2.    Among the twenty banks is a mixture of "zero" banks (new banks) and "spin-offs" from
former specialized state banks. The twenty banks also vary in size, and include several of the largest
Russian commercial banks, as well as relatively small banks. The aggregate capitalization of the
candidate PBs is about US$ 700 million, on the basis of June 1993 data.
3.    Participating commercial banks will enter into subloan agreements with final borrowers
utilizing their own resources and those provided through a loan to the Government by the World
Bank. The agreements will be in accordance with the project specific subloan terms and conditions
and prudent banking practices. The PBs would be required to meet and maintain conformity with
the eligibility criteria established by the Government and the Bank, as described in Annex 5 of the
SAR of the Enterprise Support Project (Report No. 12953) titled "Accreditation Criteria and
Monitoring of the Performance of Participating Banks". The PBs would also follow Prudential
Standards as described in Annex 6 of the same document, titled "Proposed Prudential Standards for
Participating Banks".
4.    The twenty PB candidates are based in nine cities representing a diverse geographical scope
spanning the Russian Federation. Although all the banks can be involved in financing construction
under this component, not all of them are equally represented in the six selected cities of Moscow,
Saint-Petersburg, Nizhny-Novgorod, Novgorod, Tver and Barnaul. Also some banks are more active
than others in real estate. PBs headquartered in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg or Tver are not limited
in geographical scope as they can and do act through branch offices and/or corresponding banks.
5.    Terms and Conditions of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement There would be a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government of Russia and each Participating Bank (PB). The terms and
conditions of these subloans are the same as terms and conditions for the Enterprise Support Project
(ESP). This agreement would stipulate the financial and other obligations of the PB for the subloans
made with resources from the proposed Bank loan, including responsibilities for risks under each
subloan, reporting requirements, etc. Only commercial banks which have been audited and
accredited under FIDP procedures would be allowed to participate in the line of credit. PBs will also
undertake, under the FIDP, an institutional strengthening program and demonstrate achievement of
agreed milestones of prudential standards and performance improvement.
6.    The Government would make subsidiary loans to PBs under the following main terms and
conditions':
9/ These terms and conditions are the same as for the Enterprise Support Project.



186                                                                                 ANNEX  3.4
a.    funds will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis. The total amount borrowed
under the ESP and the present loan should not exceed 100 percent of the PB's
capital;
b.    the interest rate charged will be equal to the base rate of funds to the Government
plus 2.5 percent and rounded to the nearest 0.5 percent interval. The base rate will
be adjusted semi-annually and the subsidiary interest rate will be adjusted as required
by the above formula. A commitment fee of 0.33 percent per annum will be charged
on the balance of undisbursed commitments to individual banks. At present, this
would imply a rate of interest of around 9.5 percent. The Loan Agreement between
the Government and the Bank provides for an interest rate spread of up to 2.5%.
The objective of providing this flexibility is to permit the Government to adjust the
interest rate that it charges on this line of credit to the interest rate charged for
similar lines of credit, such as the Enterprise Support Project.
c.     a signing fee of US$ 25,000 would be payable at the time of signing of the subsidiary
loan agreement and would count against interest charges incurred under the
agreement;
d.     an amount of 0.125 percent would be charged on amounts prepaid. During the first
two years after the conclusion of  a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the
Government, the PB would be required to commit to utilizing the liquidity that arises
from the mis-matching of the terms of the subsidiary loans and those of the subloans
to private developers for construction finance for financing further eligible loans for
construction finance. After the first two years, this liquidity could be used to finance
eligible enterprises for eligible purposes as defined in the Enterprise Support Project
(ESP),'" as well as for purposes under the CFLOC and the EMLOC. Any reflows
to the Government would be used either to service the loan under CFLOC or relent
to the PB for eligible purposes as defined in the ESP or this project.
7.     Terms and Conditions of the Subloan Agreement with Final Borrowers.   The following
principal terms and conditions are proposed for the line of credit through commercial banks:
a.     Sub-borrowers. Eligible sub-borrowers will be private developers (legally separate
civilian enterprises with at least 75 percent private ownership), residents' associations
and housing cooperatives;
b.     Sub-projects. Sub-projects will have to be in the housing sector and will have to
comply with the technical guidelines detailed in section 3 of this annex;
I0/ Subloans may be provided for capital investments and incremental permanent working capital. Loans will
be provided for the purchase of assets in any type of business, but not for refmnancing existing obligations, land
purchase, or for producing tobacco-related products, military products or arms, or illegal drugs, or for nuclear
plants or equipment.



ANNEX 3.4                                                                         187
c.    Subloan from Banks to Final Borrowers:
i.    will be made for construction finance purposes only;
ii.    will be evaluated in accordance with the PB's normal project and credit
evaluation procedure, but will also cover the evaluation aspects set out in the
"Guidelines for Subloan/project Evaluation" (see attachment to the present
annex);
iii.    will be in US Dollars. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the sub-
borrower. Subloan pricing will be determined by the PB who will be free to
set their lending rates in response to market conditions. Subloan maturity
will not be less than six months, and the grace period will not exceed two
years;
iv.   the subloan amount will not exceed US$ 10 million unless otherwise agreed
by the Bank;
d.    Subloan Review. The PB will be required to submit to the Bank and the CPIU for
approval the following subloans, which are estimated to represent about 20 percent
of the total loan amount and number of subloans:
i.    the first subloan appraisal of each PB;
ii.    Subloans above US$ 5 million or greater than ten percent of the bank's
capital.
8.    Allocation of Construction Finance Credits  for the Land Development Component Out of
the credit allocation of US$ 80 million, half (US$ 40 million) would be reserved initially to finance
housing construction and infrastructure of part of the private developer's investment plan on the sites
to be developed under the project's Land Development Component. The remaining US$ 40 million
would be available immediately upon effectiveness of the credit for housing projects other than those
sites which are located in approved geographical areas. During implementation, once housing
construction has started on the land development sites, at the Annual Project Reviews this allocation
would be revised as needed.
E.    PROJECT APPRAisAL AND LOAN APPROVAL PROCEDURES
9.    Institutional Arrangements. Potential investors require that the application review process
be quick and be free from political influence. To meet these demands and ensure the funding of
economically-viable projects which conform to project criteria, the Construction Finance sub-
component provides a thorough project review and appraisal by a Participating Russian Bank (PB).
In addition, projects above a specified Free Limit (proposed as $5 million) will be presented for
review and final disposition to the Interministerial Committee (IMC) and the Bank.

1.    APPRAISAL OF LOAN REQUESTS BELOW THE FREE LIMIT
10.   All project applications will be submitted to a PB. The PB will act as commercial bank
under Construction Finance Line of Credit . As such it would: (a) appraise sub-project applications,
reviewing them for conformity with eligibility criteria; (b) manage financial flows and carry out
lending functions normally provided by commercial banks; and (c) take the risk on subloans.
11.   The PB would review the loan application to ensure that it complies with these guidelines,
that it is financially feasible, and that the sub-borrower is credit-worthy.
12.   World Bank staff will provide a detailed review of the first two sub-projects submitted by
each PB. After this initial screening the World Bank will automatically authorize disbursement of
loans below the free limit upon receipt of satisfactory summary sub-project documentation from the
PB. This documentation will include information on the investors and borrowers, the investment
sub-project and its financing plan, and a draft sub-loan agreement with the terms and conditions of
the sub-loan.
2.     APPRAISAL OF LOAN REQUESTS ABOVE THE FREE LIMIT
13.   The IMC is a Commission established by the Government for the purpose of representing the
Government's interest in the administration of the project. The Minister of Construction is the
President of the Interministerial Commission. The IMC intends to establish a working group, the
Loan Policy Review Committee, to review specific subloans above the free limit.
14.   Subloans above the Free Limit of $5 million will be reviewed by the same process as all
other sub-projects, with the following addition. After review by the PB, sub-project documentation
will be forwarded to both the IMC and the Bank. The Bank will provide a detailed review of the
project and report to the IMC whether the sub-project meets all required criteria and is financially
viable. However, even if the Bank informs the IMC that it has no objection to its finncing, the
IMC may reject the sub-project through its Loan Policy Review Committee. If the IMC rejects the
subproject, it will be requested to provide the reasons for its rejection to the Bank.
15.   Other functions of the IMC will be to monitor the progress and disbursement profile of the
Construction Finance Sub-component, adjusting lending criteria as necessary in consultation with the
World Bank. It intends to carry out these functions through a Central Project Implementation Unit
supported by a General Consultant. PBs will need to cooperate with these structures and permit
checks on project implementation and disbursement. World Bank supervision missions will provide
ongoing oversight of the operations of the project. This will entail visits to the PBs.
F.    LENDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
16.   Loan Security. Current deficiencies in the existing legal system may require that the subloan
be secured by collateral in excess of the loan arnount. Collateral requirements will be subject to
adjustment based on improvements in the legal infrastructure supporting the enforcement of security
interests in property (e.g., implementation of a functioning collateral registration system). Case-by-
case assessment of collateral thresholds will be part of the responsibility of the PBs.

F.    SUPERVISION OF SUBLOANS
17.   Oversight of Firm  Activities.  The final borrower will be restricted from  deviating
substantially from its proposed activities in the construction sector. Each legal entity funded under
the line of credit will be subject to accelerated loan repayments should it deviate substantially from
the stated investment project without prior approval by the PB.
18.   Procurement Practices.  Final borrowers are expected to follow commercial practices in
obtaining materials and labor, and equipment that will assure that the end-product is constructed
efficiently and at lowest cost.
19.   Supervision of Sub-Drojects. PBs will supervise the-subloan. PBs will be required to use
professional engineers to check the quantity and quality of construction and certify completion of
construction stages. Such certification will be required for disbursement of subloans. Disbursement
by the World Bank and by the PB will be in stages based on satisfactory completion of the prior
stage.

- STAFF APPRAiSAL REPORT
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.5
EQUITY MATCHING SUB-COMPONENT
A.    BACKGROUND
1.    A key bottleneck to developing a well-functioning housing market in Russia is the shortage
of building materials that support market-driven housing production. The failure of industry to meet
the demand for these materials is due both to the historical legacy of the command economy and the
static of corporate governance regimne that enabled settled housing industry management to remain
in place notwithstanding the process of privatization.
2.    Under the command system, large, vertically-integrated regional organizations controlled the
housing construction process. These housing "kombinats" filled the role of physical planner,
designer, builder, material supplier, and owner/operator. These monopolistic structures were
responsible for the uniformity of residential designs, and the materials in production reflected their
preferences toward large energy inefficient, enviromnentally-damaging, and input-intensive, concrete-
panel high rise apartments that stand as monuments to the Soviet past.
3.    Strategic restructuring of these organizations has barely begun. Existing management has
shown little inclination to adjust to even the most basic demands of the emerging market economy.
Technology lags far behind global norms. Investment capital required to address market dynamics
is almost nonexistent. Compounding these problems, lack of macroeconomic stabilization and
continuance of severe price distortions cloud the market signals required for firms to redeploy their
existing assets productively.
4.    Privatization in the building materials industry has done little to address these structural
problems. Privatization has generally transferred enterprise ownership and management control from
the state to enterprise managers and workers. The result has been the creation of "insider' corporate
governance structures with owner incentives adverse to restructuring. Managers and employees, as
the dominant enterprise shareholders, prefer to use revenues to fuel wage increases and fund existing
operations rather than to restructure production to meet the growing demands of the emerging
market.
5.    The greatest threat to this static management structure is the promotion of outsider
investment.  Such investment would exert both pressure and market discipline on enterprise
managers. If the investment was sufficiently large and made by sophisticated investors, it might also
provide much-needed injections of management skill, technology, and capital. One way to promote
such investment is through the development of financial institutions, mainly the emerging commercial
banks and investment funds.



202                                                                          ANNEX 3.5
B.    BANK INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECTOR
6.    The Bank is addressing the problem of enterprise restructuring generally in the Enterprise
Support Project (ESP) and the complementary Financial Institutions Development Project (FIDP).
The ESP will provide medium-term credit to enterprises through a core of domestic commercial
banks. These banks will be strengthened over the next few years through twinning arrangements and
extensive technical cooperation under the FIDP.
7.    While these programs are crucial to the long-term restructuring of Russian industry, more
can be done to address the immediate needs of the housing sector. Housing reform cannot begin
without immediate investment in the production and efficient distribution of building materials that
support small-scale developers and diversified types of housing construction, including low-rise
construction. Equity investment provided by foreign building materials companies and venture
capital funds, as well as competitive Russian firms, present a significant potential source of such
investment.
8.    The ConceRt of Eauitv Matching. Foreign investment represents a vast untapped potential
for the transfer of much-needed management, technology, and capital to facilitate the restructuring
of Russia's ailing building materials industry. To the extent Russian firms satisfy these objectives,
they will also take part in the line-of-credit. The absence of competitively-priced debt to leverage
this equity has kept its inflow to a minimum. Traditional programs of the international fmancial
institutions have not been effective, as their high investrnent thresholds fail to address the smaller-
scale equity investments ($2-5 million) characteristic of the current Russian market. The Equity
Matching sub-component provides an innovative alternative to leverage these smaller investments.
9.    The objective of the Equity Matching Line of Credit (EMLOC) is to leverage private-sector
investment in Russia's building materials industry, making commercial bank financing available on
reasonable terms for projects which are sufficiently attractive to secure sound private equity capital.
The line would mobilize the restructuring of Russia's building materials industry by leveraging new
equity investrnents in the sector with domestic finance. Credits would only be made against
investments made by "qualified' investors, that is, investors that are pre-screened to assure adequate
capital management. Credits would be lent up to double the amount of new, cash equity invested
by a qualified investor in an eligible sub-project. Accordingly, the amount of equity provided by
an investor would be equal to or greater than one-third of the total sub-project cost. The risk on
subloans made with resources from the proposed Bank loan would be assumed by the participating
commercial banks. Unless at least 20% of the line-of-credit has been commnitted within the a year
of effectiveness, the Bank may cancel the line-of credit after consultation with the government.
10.   The following example illustrates how the line of credit will operate. An enterprise seeking
new capital will bring an investment proposal to a 'qualified investor' (either a venture capital fund
or a building materials company). Most likely, these enterprises will be joint ventures between a
domestic firm (possibly a spin-off from a former kombinat) and a foreign partner (backed by the
managerial skills and technology necessary to modernize the enterprize). If the investor deems the
proposal worthy of investment and agrees to invest new, cash equity in excess of $500,000, the
enterprise will be eligible to submit an application to a qualified Russian commercial bank for a loan



ANNEX 3.5                                                                        203
from the EMLOC. If successfully appraised by the commercial bank (and approved by the GOR and
the Bank if above the free limit) the enterprise will receive the loan for the sub-project up to double
the amount of equity contributed by the investor.
11.   The EMLOC component would finance the establishment or expansion of building materials
manufacturing or distribution enterprises. Subloans from the Equity Matching sub-component will
be denominated in foreign currency (e.g., in US dollars). The minimum and maximum size of
subloans will be US$500,000 and US$10 million equivalent, respectively. Subloans outside of these
limits could be considered as exceptions on a case-by-case basis by the Government of Russia and
the World Bank. The total amount of subloans cannot exceed two-thirds of total sub-project cost.
The Participating Bank (PB) would take the full commercial risk of its subloans. Subloans would
be for a minimum of two years and a maximum of eight years, including up to two years grace.
Interest rates on subloans would be set by the PBs. The EMLOC will provide debt up to twice the
amount of new cash equity participation by "eligible investors." However, this guideline does not
require that a firm borrow the full amount of its entitlement under the EMLOC.
C.   ON-LENDING TERMS AND CoNDrrIONs To SUB-BORROWERS
12.   Subsidiary Loan Agreement with PBs. There would be a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the GOR and each Participating Bank (PB). This agreement would stipulate the financial
and other obligations of the PB for the subloans made with resources from the proposed Bank loan,
including responsibilities for risks under each sub-loan, reporting requirements, etc. The PB would
pay interest at the interest rate on the Bank loan plus a spread of up to 2.5 % p. a. and rounded to the
next .5% interval, to cover the GOR's administrative costs and risks under the EMLOC; the PBs
would also pay a commitment fee of 0.33% p.a. on the undisbursed balance of subloans from the
date they are authorized for disbursement by the Bank. Flexibility is provided on the interest rate
of subsidiary loans to allow the Government adjust the interest rate of subsidiary loans to
commercial banks to the interest rate for the Enterprise Support Project (ESP) financed by the World
Bank and/or other lines of credit. In general, the terms and conditions of subsidiary loans are the
same as terms and conditions for the ESP.
13.    Participating Banks.  Participating commercial banks (PB) will enter into sub-loan
agreements with final borrowers utilizing the resources provided through the line of credit. They
may also utilize their own resources, at their option. The agreements will be in accordance with the
project/specific sub-loan terms and conditions and prudent banking practices. The PBs would be
required to meet and maintain conformity with the eligibility criteria established by the Government
and the Bank, as described in annex 5 of the Staff Appraisal Report of the Enterprise Support Project
titled 'Accreditation Criteria and Monitoring of the Performance of Participating Banks." The PBs
would also follow Prudential Standards as described in annex 6 of the same document, titled
"Proposed Prudential Standards for Participating Banks."
14.   Terms and Conditions of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement. Only commercial banks which
have been audited and accredited under Financial Institutions Development Project (FIDP) procedures
would be allowed to participate in the line of credit. PBs will also undertake, under the FIDP, an
institutional strengthening program and demonstrate achievement of agreed milestones of prudential
standards and performance improvement.



204                                                                                 ANNEX 3.5
15.   The Government would make subsidiary loans to PBs under the following main terms and
conditions:
a.     funds will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis. The total amount borrowed
under the ESP and the present loan should not exceed 100 percent of the PB's
capital;
b.     the interest rate charged will be equal to the base rate of funds to the Government
plus 2.5 percent and rounded to the nearest 0.5 percent interval. The base rate will
be adjusted semi-annually and the subsidiary interest rate will be adjusted as required
by the above formula. A commitmnent fee of 0.33 percent per annum will be charged
on the balance of undisbursed commitmnents to individual banks. At present, this
would imnply a rate of interest of around 9.5 percent. If the resultant interest rate
using this formula is higher than the interest rate charged under the ESP or other
similar lines of credit, the Government has the option of adjusting the spread between
its cost of funds and the interest rate that it charges the PB so that the interest rates
between the lines of credit are equal or harmonized appropriately.
C.     a signing fee of US$ 25,000 would be payable at the time of signing of the subsidiary
loan agreement and would count against interest charges incurred under the
agreement;
d.     an amount of 0.125 percent would be charged on amounts prepaid. The PB would
be required to commit to utilizing the liquidity that arises from the mismatching of
the terns of the subsidiary loans and those of the subloans to the enterprises for
financing further loans to eligible enterprises for eligible purposes as defined in the
Private Enterprise Support Project.' There would be no reflows available for
re-lending under the EMLOC Sub-component.
16.    The PB will be required to submit to the World Bank and the Loan Policy Review committee
(LPRC) of the Interministerial Commission (IMC) chaired by the Minister of Construction  for
approval the following subloans, which are estimated to represent about 20 percent of the total loan
amount and number of subloans:
i.    the first two subloan appraisals of each PB;
ii.    Subloans above US$5 million or greater than ten percent of the bank's capital
L/ Subloans may be provided for capital investments and incremental permanent working capital. Loans will
be provided for the purchase of assets in any type of business, but not for refinancing existing obligations, land
purchase, or for producing tobacco-related products, military products or arms, or illegal drugs, or for nuclear
plants or equipment.



ANNEX 3.5                                                                          205
D.    ON-LENDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS To FINAL-BoRRowERS
1.     ELIGIBILITY OF FINAL-BORROWER
17.   Eligibility Criteria. The line of credit will fund investment projects of (a) eligible enterprises;
(b) that produce eligible products or services; (c) with equity participation by eligible investors (d)
that is both new and in cash. Funds from the line of credit will only be available to invest in
"eligible investments." Each of these definitions is outlined in detail below.
18.   Eligible Enterprises. The EMLOC would only fund legally-isolated enterprises that will
manufacture or distribute building materials. Enterprises must be "legally isolated" to prevent cross-
subsidization of activities within a firm. The investment project must be to produce or distribute
building materials or provide services to support the production or distribution of such materials.
All stock of the enterprise must be held by private investors. A "private" Russian investor is defined
by the ESP, requiring 75% private ownership. Private foreign firms are defined as 100% privately
owned.
19.   Eligible Investors. Equity contributions to sub-projects eligible for matching credits must be
made by:
a.    Certified venture capital funds which have a qualified technical partner involved in
the investment enterprise with an adequate share participation or other incentive
arrangement with the technical partner to assure that the investment enterprise is
competently managed from the technical point of view. The certification process for
venture capital funds is similar to that of the International Finance Corporation and
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, both of which are participating
in and often maintain representation on the boards of such funds. It will be designed
to ensure that participating venture funds are insulated from political control,
professionally managed, and chartered to maximize financial returns and ensure
qualified management in new ventures.
b.    Private corporations with adequate demonstrated experience in producing modern
building materials or which provide services that support the production or
distribution of such products. Such corporations must provide financial statements
(income statements, balance sheets and flow of funds statement) for each of the three
years prior to the application for the loan. The statements must be accompanied by
an unqualified opinion, from an independent auditor with international experience
acceptable to the World Bank, that the statements present a fair and accurate
representation of the corporations' financial position, results of operations and
changes in financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
2.    ELIGIBLE SUBLOANS
20.   Eligible Products and Services. An eligible building product is any product that may be
incorporated in the permanent physical structure of residential housing, and an eligible service is any



206                                                                          ANX 3.5
service that supports the production and distribution of such products (e.g., provision of retail and
wholesale distribution networks, warehousing, etc.). Firms which lease equipment would qualify
as providers of an eligible service. All products and services must conform to federal and local
environmental, building material, and construction codes and standards. Eligible investments will
be buildings, machinery, equipment, and incremental permanent working capital used in the
production or distribution of eligible building products or provision of eligible services.
21.   Procurement.  Purchase of goods up to US$500,000 equivalent may follow normal
commercial practice. Contracts for goods above this amount will be required to follow the Bank's
International Shopping (IS) procedures, requiring at least three quotations, at least two of which must
be from different eligible countries as defined by World Bank guidelines. In the event that
equipment to be purchased must be of the same make or technical specification as existing
-quipment, and is only available from one source, the Bank's Direct Contracting (DC) method will
be allowed. All civil works contracts above a $2 million threshold will require International
Competitive Bidding. Equipment purchased under the EMLOC must be new. If it is determined
that this requirement is unduly restrictive and prevents the EMLOC from disbursing, consideration
may be given in the future to permitting the purchase of second-hand equipment.
22.   Disbursements. Disbursements would be made against full supporting documentation to
assure goods and services financed by the Bank meet all of the Bank's disbursement and procurement
requirements.
23.   Environmental Assessments.  PBs will be responsible for ensuring that investors have
obtained all required environmental approvals. Environmental guidelines will be identical to those
developed under the ESP.
E,    PROJECT APPRAISAL AND LOAN APPROVAL PROCEDURES
24.   Institutional Arrangements. Potential investors require that the application review process
be quick and be free from political influence. To meet these demands and ensure the funding of
eco omically-viable projects which conform to project criteria, the Equity Matching sub-component
provides thorough project review and appraisal by a Participating Russian Bank (PB). PBs must
also be accredited under the FIDP. In addition, projects above a specified Free Limit (proposed as
$5 million) will be presented for review and final disposition to the Interministerial Commission and
Bi? Pank.
1.    APPRAISAL OF LOAN REQuEsTs BELOW THE FREE LIMIT
25.   All project applications will be submitted to a PB. The PB would: (a) appraise sub-project
applications, reviewing them for conformity with eligibility criteria; (b) manage funancial flows and
carry out lending functions normally provided by conmmercial banks; and (c) carry the full risk on
sutJoans.
26    Under EMLOC the borrower's application will include a financing plan that provides pro
fn-ma estimates of ongoing capitalization. The borrower will be required to undergo quarterly
r.? iews and annual audits to assure that the firm maintains adequate capital and adheres to the



ANNEX 3.5                                                                          207
accepted corporate finance structure. Borrowers would be required to refrain from any distribution
of assets, through excess dividend payments or other mechanisms, that could impair capital. Any
such distribution would be grounds for requiring accelerated loan repayments.
27.   The PB would review the loan application to ensure that (a) equity investors meet the
eligibility criteria; (b) the investment project is eligible for financing; (c) the financing plan of the
investment sub-project is sound; (d) the investment sub-project complies with all procurement
procedures; and (e) the investment sub-project meets all environmental obligations.
28.   Bank staff will provide a detailed review of the first two sub-projects submitted by each PB.
After this initial screening the Bank will automatically authorize disbursement of loans below the free
limit upon receipt of satisfactory summary sub-project documentation from  the PB.  This
documentation will include information on the investors and borrowers, the investment subloan, the
investment sub-project and its financing plan, a draft subloan agreement with the terms and
conditions of the subloan, and a list of goods to be acquired under the investment sub-project.
2.     APPRAISAL OF LOAN REQUESTS ABOVE THE FREE LIMIT
29.   The IMC is an Interministerial Commission established by the Government partly for the
purpose of representing the Government's interest in the administration of the Project. It consists
of appointed members from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction (Minstroi), the Ministry
of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, as well as other bodies. IMC was established by
Resolution 595 of June 20, 1993 as the body responsible for implementation of the State-targeting
Program Housing. The IMC intends to establish a smaller working group called the Loan Policy
Review Committee (LPRC) to review guidelines for lines of credit under the project and to review
and approve subloans above the free limit.
30.   Subloans above the Free Limit of $5 million will be reviewed by the same process as all
other sub-projects, with the following addition. After review by the PB, sub-project documentation
will be forwarded to both the LPRC and the World Bank . The World Bank will provide a detailed
review of the sub-project and report to the LPRC whether the sub-project meets all required criteria
and is financially viable. However, even if the Bank informs the LPRC that it has no objection to
its financing, the LPRC may reject the sub-project. If the LPRC rejects the sub-project, it will be
requested to provide the reasons for its rejection to the Bank.
31.   Other functions of the LPRC will be to monitor the progress and disbursement profile of the
Equity Matching Sub-component, adjusting lending criteria as necessary in consultation with the
World Bank. World Bank supervision missions will provide ongoing oversight of the operations of
the IMC, the LPRC and the PBs.
F.    LENDING TERMs AND CONDrrIONS
32.   Loan Security. Current deficiencies in the existing legal system may require that the subloan
be secured by collateral in excess of the loan amount. Collateral requirements will be subject to
adjustment based on improvements in the legal infrastructure supporting the enforcement of security



208                      _                                                   ANNEX 3.5
interests in property (e.g. implementation of a functioning collateral registration system). Case-by-
case assessment of collateral thresholds will be part of the responsibility of the PBs.
33.   Oversight of Firm Activities. The borrower will be restricted from deviating substantially
from its proposed activities in the construction and building materials sectors. Each legal entity
funded under the line of credit will be subject to accelerated loan repayments should it deviate
substantially from the stated investment project without prior approval by the PB.
34.   Cavital Maintenance. The borrower's application will include a financing plan that provides
pro forma estimates of ongoing capitalization. The borrower will be required to undergo quarterly
reviews and annual audits to assure that the firm maintains adequate capital and adheres to the
accepted corporate finance structure. Borrowers would be required to refrain from any distribution
of assets, through excess dividend payments or other mechanisms, that could impair capital. Any
such distribution would be grounds for requiring accelerated loan repayments.
35.   Reflows. There would be no reflows available for re-lending under the Equity Matching sub-
component.
G.   DEMAND PROJECTIONS FOR THE EQUITY MATCHING SUB-COMPONENT
36.   Market Analysis of Potential Borrowers. There is a large amount of private equity earmarked
for investment in Russia. Through an informal survey, members of the project team have identified
and discussed the line of credit with 10 venture capital funds chartered to invest in Russia. Together
these funds represent over $850 million in equity capital. Initial estimates by managers of these
funds indicate that demand could be as high as $85 million. Additionally, there are likely to be other
funds of which the team is not aware.
37.   The project team has also identified and discussed the line of credit with many domestic and
foreign firms with projects in Russia's building materials sector and a willingness to finance their
investments with venture capital. Based on these initial surveys of investor interest and activity in
the sector, the funds available under the line should be quickly subscribed.
H.    SUMMARY OF SAMPLE SUB-PROJECTS
38.   The following is a list of sample sub-projects that have been developed for immediate
financing. The firms sponsoring each of these projects have expressed interest in the Equity
Matching sub-component and a desire to draw on the line of credit should it become available to
finance these or other similar investments.
a.    Production of Dimensioned Lumber. This potential project involves the expansion
of an existing dimensioned lumber production facility in Karalia. The $5 million
joint venture between a privatized Russian forestry firm and its foreign counterpart
is seeking $1.65 million in expansion financing. The firn has been exporting 17%
kiln dried, stress graded M.75 dimensional lumber to the U.K. since July 1992, with
some sales to the domestic market. The new investment would be used to acquire
equipment to build the capacity to diversify product output, secure adequate supply



ANNEX 3.5                 _                                                            209
and quality of raw material inputs, and allow it to begin production from cut logs
rather than lumber. The proposed investment is as follows: (1) $1.15 million to
acquire ownership and control of two firms with the logging rights to harvest 490,000
m3 of timber annually and (2) $.5 million for the purchase of a log sorter, acquisition
of a new kiln house to dry the additional timber, and rent of a mobile sawmill to
process the additional inputs. The investment would result in the following annual
incremental increases in building materials production: 6,000 m3 of M75 lumber;
10,000 m3 of Pallet components; 25,000 m3 of high-grade pine; and 1000 m3 of low-
grade rejects.
b.    Production of Hollow-Core Doors.  This $5 million project would capitalize an
interior hollow-core door production facility. Russian owners of the enterprise will
be: (1) a building materials distribution company, (2) a privatized construction
company, (3) two energy firms with large construction activities, and (4) a wood
processing firm.  Foreign owners will be (1) an American management and
investment corporation, and (2) an international venture fund. Under the command
economy, door production was controlled by the industrial concern
Glavmosstroymaterial. The agency had construction facilities across the country and
produced 4 million doors per month. This production has fallen off dramatically, and
there is a shortage of even these sub-standard doors on the domestic market. This
investment project intends to fill the gap between high-priced inputs and scarce, sub-
standard production by supplying competitively-priced western-quality doors to the
domestic market. Investors will maintain full-time foreign management presence in
the enterprise. The required investment would be for the following: (1) total
machinery purchase cost (including taxes and import duties): $3.4 million; (2)
working capital for the first three months of operation: $1.6 million. Anticipated
after tax profits: $.7 million in year 1, rising to $6.2 million in year 5. Product
output: 220,000 doors/year in year 1, rising to 500,000 doors in year 5.
c.    Integrated Production of Comonents for Sinele-Family Home Construction.
Including: Joists, Trusses, Wall Panels. Insulation. Windows, Doors and Roof
Shakes. This $9 million project would establish an integrated facility to produce
manufactured housing for domestic sale, either as a system or as individual materials.
The firm would be a greenfield enterprise owned by a domestic Russian investor and
three foreign investors (including an international venture capital fund). The joint
venture would establish a housing component production facility with the capacity to
produce unfinished housing units (completed structural housing shells) for the region.
The facility would consists of a saw mill to transform raw timber into production
lumber, and six separate but integrated production facilities for each of the products
listed above. The facility is designed to produce sufficient components for the sale
of 1000 integrated housing units/year, with unit production cost of $15,000. Housing
units of similar size built by local contractors sell for $30,000. If sold as integrated
units, the firm will finish units (with material from sources in the United States and
Canada) for an additional cost of $30,000. Again, locally-constructed finished units
sell for $90,000. The required investment would be for the following: (1) $4
million for the purchase of all factory equipment and technology, (2) $3 million for

improvements and modernization of the facility site, and (3) $2 million for acquisition
of a sawmill. Anticipated product output: components sufficient to supply 1000
units/year.

ANNEX 3.6
TECHNICAL COOPEmRON AND TMAINING PLAN
A.   CAPACrrY BUILDING AND SECrORAL REFORM
1.    Russian homebuilders, building materials manufacturers, local and national officials,
investors, bankers, coordinators, managers and consultants that will be participating in the program
are eager for the new skills that will be necessary for successful Project implementation. The cities,
firms and institutions they represent want to build a sustainable capacity for the kinds of investments
that the Project will demonstrate. Continued support for sectoral reform will be necessary to achieve
the Project's Objectives.
2.    Technical Cooperation and Training will be aimed at public and private participants in each
component of the Project. Two interactive channels managed by the Central and Local Project
Implementation Units (PIU's) will be put in place for this assistance.
a.    The General Consultant (Annex 3.8) will assist with project implementation, design
and engineering, procurement, construction supervision, management of credit lines
and project accounting.
b.    Sector studies, staff training, fellowships and evaluation will build institudonal
capacity and reinforce each of the Project components.
3.    Technical Cooperation and Training will be funded with a combination of loan financing,
in-kind local support and grant resources made available through USAID and other donors.
a.    Consultants, staff and office equipment for Central and Local Project Implementation
Units will be loan funded. Office space and operational support will be provided by
the Ministry and local governments. Expatriate advisors will be grant funded and
loan funded.
b.    The General Consultant and contracts for site design and engineering work will be
loan funded with any applicable taxes funded locally.
c.    Sector studies, staff training, fellowships and evaluation can be both loan funded and
grant funded. USAID and Project Implementation Units will consult regularly on
programming of resources.

4.    Grant funding includes $6.5 million comnnitted to the Project by USAID. An additional $3.5
million from USAID was also provided for Project preparation and appraisal. Collaboration with
the World Bank and first year support for the Bank supported Housing Project are detailed in Annex
3.7 which follows. This support, which began in January 1994, includes an ongoing program of
workshops, market analyses and training in the U.S. and Russia. The Plan will be reviewed and
revised in the Fall of 1994. Anticipated support for 1995 includes two or more advisors to the
Project Implementation Unit, pilot land auction and title registration projects, support for sectoral
studies and continued funding for ongoing workshops, and training.
5.    In addition, other USAID activities indirectly support the Project. The Housing Sector
Reform Project financed by USAID has been supporting the transition to a market economy and
housing reform in Russia since 1992. Work undertaken under this project with the national
government on housing policy, legislation and finance ties closely to the regulatory action plans
(Annex 4.3) that will be undertaken by local governments in cities participating in the World Bank
Project. A proposed program with the U.S. National Association of Homebuilders could directly
support the building materials component of the Bank Project. Resident advisors based in local
governments around the country are a resource for exchange of experience on pilot projects they
have undertaken with cities participating in the Bank-supported Housing Project and USAID's Officer
Resettlement Program will give builders and developers real experience with housing projects similar
to those that will be financed by the Bank Project.
6.    Other Donors including the Governments of Canada, France, Ireland and Netherlands have
also indicated interest in participation in the Bank-supported Housing Project and about $1.5 million
has been committed for construction industry training, including pilots. If the Government is
successful in obtaining other bilateral grants for this purpose, then the use of Bank funds would
either be reduced correspondingly or reallocated to other components following appropriate review
and approval by the Bank.



ANNEX 3.6                                                                                 213
B.    OBJECTIvEs
7.    The Technical Cooperation and Training Plan will support overall project goals, as well as
the objectives of each component of the Project (see Chapter 3). It's targets are the Russian
homebuilders, manufacturers of building materials, local and national officials, investors, bankers,
coordinators, managers and consultants that will be participating in the Project and the cities, firms
and institutions they represent.
8.     An important objective of the Technical Cooperation and Training Plan is institutionalization
of the principles, financial mechanisms and processes supported by the Project. While the Sub-
projects will demonstrate the feasibility of new policies, financing mechanisms and planning
processes, the institutionalization objective will be critical in establishing a practical framework for
implementation of the sub-projects and making the irnpact of the Project sustainable in the long termn.
Principal initiatives for institutionalization of relevant principles and practices the processes will be,
as follows:
a.     To provide technical assistance and training to relevant institutions and personnel
involved in implementation of the Project;
b.    To provide training targeted to larger audiences of Russian experts and decision-
makers to introduce various policy and project level concepts; and
C.     To ensure that the practices and procedures introduced by technical assistance is
transcribed into brief and simple written guidelines.  These guidelines should
principally be developed and written by the relevant Russian experts themselves, with
assistance from (foreign or local) advisors, where necessary;
d.     Specific assistance will be provided for the development of important norms and
standards related to each stage of implementation of the Project, such as zoning and
land-use regulations, construction permitting procedures, fees and taxes related to
land development, building codes and standards, regulation of building materials, real
estate lending, and procurement etc.;
e.     Where necessary, recommendations and technical assistance will be provided for
institutional restructuring and reform.
f.    In order to achieve a long term multiplier effect, the basic strategy will be to work
with and train a select group of progressive professionals and officials in the relevant
principles and practices of market oriented housing development. These experts may
then provide principal technical assistance for the subsequent stages of the project,
reducing the necessity of foreign involvement to the minimum.

C.    KEY ELEMENTS OF THE TECHNCAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING PLAN
9.    Assistance with Project Implementation: The General Consultant (Annex 3.8) will act as the
Government's agent in promoting, administering and monitoring the Project. The consultant will
report to the Director of the Central Project Implementation Unit and will supervise disbursement
and collection of the subloans, manage funds, certify payments, inspect works, and account for and
report on Project expenditures.   The General Consultant will also advise Local Project
Implementation Units with design, engineering, procurement and construction supervision. Finally,
the General Consultant, in coordination with USAID and other donors, will provide advisors,
training and technical expertise on each component of the Project.
10.   Two or more advisors will also be placed in the Central Project Implementation Unit to assist
it and Local Project Implementation Units in monitoring sectoral development, maintaining Project
linkages with national and local policy, ongoing evaluation of Project impact and coordination with
the World Bank, USAID, other donors, the Interministerial Group and Local Coordinating
Committees.
11.   Assistance with Transformation of Land and Real Estate Markets: An ongoing program of
workshops has already gotten underway. These have included development of affordability models
for project design, principles of land allocation and regulation, project development and project
finance. The next series will be built around "kick-off" of the Project and guidelines for
procurement.  These will be followed by more specific workshops on each phase of land
development and construction projects.
12.   Another set of consultancies and workshops has been built around support to participating
cities on implementation of their regulatory action plans. This assistance is detailed in Annex 3.7
Key to success will be pilot land auction and title registration projects in each of the participating
cities. These are detailed in Annex 3.2 .
13.   A land development regulatory audit (Annex 3.8) would help adapt existing norms and
development standards to new market conditions. The study would provide a framework for
calculating the impact of norms and standards on land development costs including land costs,
infrastructure costs and the cost of administrative controls, registration fees and permits. The study
would provide each city with a menu of options including cost implications, performance based
alternatives and mechanisms for distribution of costs borne by developers and costs recovered
through tariffs, specific city budgets and general taxation.
14.   Assistance with Construction Finance: Workshops airned at Participating Banks will review
the Project, subsidiary agreements, sub loan responsibilities, procurement, disbursement, repayment
and reporting. Subsequent workshops on assessment and underwriting of real estate and construction
loans will address project application and review processes and guidelines for bankers on real estate
development risks, construction practices and alternative technologies.
15.   A second set of workshops will be aimed at developers and builders to help them understand
the loan application and review process. Also important will be workshops and events that get



ANNEX 3.6                                                                               215
participating banks and developers together to build professional relationships between them and for
discussion of problems and opportunities in the sector.
16.   A specialist will work with participating banks and developers in each stage of the loan
process including marketing, appraisal and loan management as well as to facilitate technicai
cooperation and training in risk management, valuation of collateral, and financial planning specifiQ,
to real estate and construction loans.
17.   Assistance with Transformation of the Building Materials Industry: Workshops aimed at
participating banks, similar to workshops on construction financing, will review the Project,
subsidiary agreements, sub loan responsibilities, procurement, disbursement, repayment and reporting
on the EMLOC Sub-component. Subsequent workshops on assessment and underwriting of loans
for investmnents in the building materials industry will address equity matching loan application and
review processes and guidelines for bankers on risks, practices and alternative technologies in thtI
building materials industry.
18.   A  Kick-Off Conference will bring together Russian enterprises, foreign investors,
participating banks and representatives of international technology to explain the credit line.
encourage collaboration and stimulate business ventures.
19.   Subsequent roundtables will focus on subsets of the industry, particularly wood, brick and
masonry and energy conserving building products. These workshops will be designed to stimulate
technology transfer as well as investment.
20.   Workshops aimed at Russian building materials firms will help them understand joint venture
practices, assessment of business proposals and preparation of loan applications. Workshops aimec
at international investors in the building materials industry will help them understand business
practices and opportunities in Russia.
21.   The U.S. National Association of Homebuilders will explore assistance to the Ministry and
representatives of the Russian homebuilding and building materials industries in creation of a
building and information technology center to foster transfer of technology and help promote joint
venture investments. The center will be designed to facilitate participation by other countries, nor
just the U.S., and will seek to become a self-supporting private sector organization.
22.   Assistance on regulations for building materials and housing construction (Annex 3.8) would
aim to facilitate local approvals of housing designs, building materials, and construction methods tc
be financed under the project and provide technical cooperation to advance reforms in buildirng
material standards, building codes and enforcement methods in the housing construction sector.
23.   A specialist will work with Participating Banks and to help promote the equity matching jlTie
of credit in each stage of the process including marketing, appraisal and loan management as well
as to facilitate technical cooperation and training in risk management and business planning specific
to the building materials industry.

24.   Traiing:  In addition to ongoing programs and workshops, fellowships will be made
available for individual and group participation in short term courses and programs in Russia, the
U.S. and other donor countries. The Central and Local Project Implementation Units and the
General Consultant will facilitate identification of needs, potential programs and selection and
processing of candidates.
25.   Sectoral Studies and Preparation of New Projects: The Central Project Implementation Unit,
the World Bank, USAID and other donors will consult on needs for analysis related to continued
sectoral development and preparation of new projects. Terms of Reference for a proposed housing
finance study are detailed in Annex 3.8. Other areas where assistance may be provided include,
divestiture of enterprise housing, rehabilitation of historic inner-cities and municipal infrastructure.
D.    REVIEW AND EVALUATION
26.   The Technical Cooperation and Training Plan must remnain flexible and adaptable to changes
in the Project as it evolves. The plan will be reviewed and revised annually.

RussIAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.7
USAID TECHNiCAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING PLAN
A.    USAID SUPPORT FOR SECTORAL REFORM
1.    USAID's Housing Sector Reform Project has been supporting the transition to a market
economy and basic reforms in the housing sector of Russia (and other Newly Independent States of
the Former Soviet Union) since 1992. Resident and short term advisors have been working with the
Federation and with local governrnents in Moscow, Novosibirsk and Ekaterinburg. They are
working with private banks, developers, realtors and management companies and have contributed
to the formulation of housing policies based on privatization of existing stock, private development
of new housing, private ownership, private financing, market pricing, and improved targeting of
subsidies. They have helped introduce market oriented legal and financial instruments, organized
dozens of seminars, distributed more than 25,000 handbooks and have developed a growing cadre
of Russian professionals and firms. USAID has already extended this assistance to Nishny Novgorod
and will begin extending it to other cites participating in the World Bank loan program.
2.    USAID's advisors have also helped put together demonstration projects testing competitive
contracting for management and maintenance, auctioning of development rights and the feasibility
of mortgage financing. Approximately 450 homes for demobilized military officers funded by the
U.S. to test the capabilities of private sector design/build firms are nearing completion in half a
dozen cities, and a test of vouchers for open market purchases will also soon be launched.
3.    USAID's Housing Sector Reform Project has thus far committed about $25 million to efforts
in Russia (including support for the World Bank Loan). With continued progress toward reform and
demonstrable results from current USAID support, additional funding could be possible.
4.    Other USAID projects support reform in the sector as well. The Municipal Finance Project
provides advisors and training to Moscow and Nishny Novgorod on financial management. The
Association and Educational Development Project provides opportunities for training and linkages
with U.S. professional associations and the USAID Mission in Moscow is currently designing a
major land privatization project that will support policy and legal reform including the framework
for urban land and private sector development.
B.    USAID AND WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
5.    In discussions of economic reform with the G-7, the Government of Russia placed housing
as one of its top five priorities. After the April 1993 G-7 discussions, USAID and the World Bank
agreed to collaborate and accelerate loan assistance in the sector. In June 1993, USAID approved
an additional $10 million through the Housing Sector Reform Project for project preparation and
technical cooperation supporting the proposed World Bank loan.

6.    The grant funding approved by USAID includes:
*   A Trust Fund managed by the Bank for project preparation ($2.0 million);
*   Assistance with project preparation through contracts managed by USAID (1.5 million);
*   Technical Cooperation and Training designed and managed by USAID ($6.5 million).
7.    USAID support for project preparation (total $3.5 million) has funded the Project Review
Unit in Moscow, support in Washington, consultant assistance with preparation and appraisal,
developer and demand surveys, the environmental assessment and reviews of site and infrastructure
planning. Preparation funded through the Trust is to be completed by June, 1994.
8.    The Technical Cooperation and Training Program ($6.5 million) is already underway. A
summary of accomplishments to date and plans for the first year is attached. These include
workshops, specialist assistance, training and some funding for resident advisors. The Program will
be evaluated and revised semi-annually. Full funding for the Program has been authorized and
USAID is agreeable to expenditures of up to $2.0 million even before loan approval, though all
activities funded must be completed by September, 1996.
9.    Specific assistance may also be available through other USAID projects. Some training, for
example, may be available through a project designed to support needs across all sectors. Pilot
projects in land titling and cadastre may be included in the Land Privatization Project that USAID
is now designing. Importantly, USAID's Housing Sector Reform Project, through which support
for the World Bank loan is funded, will continue to provide assistance with sectoral reform at the
national and local level including assistance with housing policy, privatization, the legal and
regulatory framework, project development, maintenance and management, mortgage finance and
housing allowances.

D.   SUMMARY OF THE TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING PLAN
11.   The Technical Cooperation and Training funded by USAID will support each of the
components of the World Bank Loan. Support will include workshops and individual training
programs, resident advisors backed up by short term specialists and arrangements with U.S. and
Russian academic institutions, institutes and professional associations. Support will be targeted to
builders, developers, and building materials manufacturers, selected banks, local officials responsible
for land privatization and infrastructure and Federal officials responsible for the policy and regulatory
framework.
12.   Land privatization and development:  Assistance will focus on: policy planning and
procedures for making land available for residential development, cadastre, valuation, subdivision
and transfers, market and financial analysis, project development and finance, infrastructure planning
and finance.
13.   Construction finance: The World Bank-financed Financial Institutions Development Project
will provide technical assistance to selected banks. USAID assistance will focus on underwriting
loans for land development and construction.

ANNEX 3.8
DRAFT TORS FOR PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION AND PROJECT STUDIES
A.   INTRODUCTION
This annex presents draft terms of references for Project Implementation and project studies:
(i) General Consultants, (ii) Land Development Regulatory Audit and Building Regulation, and (iii)
Housing Finance.
I.    GENERAL CONSULTANT TERM OF REFERENCE
a.    Background
1.   Implementation of the Housing Project to be supported by a loan from the World Bank is a
complex undertaking that requires experienced, strong management and accurate monitoring at both
the central and local levels. The project includes a diverse range of activities including infrastructure
construction, sales of land to private developers in conjunction with six participating cities and loans
through private banks to finance construction and an equity matching line of credit requiring foreign
participation to finance building material businesses. The Government of Russia (GOR), will realize
the full benefits of the project, only, if it has a qualified management team representing it. Effective
management will require the adoption of approaches which are new to Russian trained professionals
and detailed requirements for both assisting and monitoring progress in cooperation with the
responsible governments (federal and local) and the commercial banks. The project will introduce
new financing methods, competitive purchasing procedures, appraisal requirements responsive to
international standards and be held to standards of both the GOR and the World Bank.
2.    The introduction of new financial and business practices in the rapidly changing economic,
financial and political environment of Russia will require; constant monitoring of progress, on-going
adjustmnents and the possibility of significant program revisions. The assumptions made in the
planning process (Project Preparation), need to be implemented, tested and fined tuned based on the
actual project experience. In spite of recent housing mnarket studies and information provided by the
participating government entities there is a shortage of reliable data. Unreliable data, informal
markets, a transitional market system and evolving conditions demand a strong, responsive
management team with special sensitivity and flexibility toward loan disbursement, sub-loan progress
and the ability to recommend and implement adjustments which will ensure a successful loan
program.
3.    The project will be managed by a central project implementation unit in the central
government (CPIU) and a local project implementation unit (LPIU) in each of the participating cities.
The CPIU will report directly to the Interministerial Group (IMG), and be authorized to perform



226                     _                                                   ANNEX 3.8
prescribed functions on behalf of the GOR. Participating banks (PB) will administer loans for
construction financing and building materials industries. The General Consultant will provide staff
support services to the CPIU and technical assistance to the LPIU's and PB's. The Project its
components and the specific functions of each of these units is described below.
b.    Project Description
4.    The primary goal of the Project is to support the GOR's effort to develop private housing
markets and create housing market systems. To implement federal reforms at the local level and
demonstrate how markets can produce housing, the proposed project will include three components:
(a) Land and Housing Market Development, with land development and construction finance sub-
components in the Participating Cities (St. Petersburg, Tver, Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Barnaul
and Moscow/Demonstration only); (b) Transformation of the Building Materials Industry, through
an equity matching line of credit to encourage modernization and restructuring of the supply side and
(c) Technical Cooperation and Project Management with supporting technical cooperation and project
management sub-components.
5.    Land Development. For the land development sub-component, the Government will on-lend
funds to local Governments in the Participating Cities (PC's), to carry out demonstration sub-
projects, implement reforms and institutionalize procedures. Sub-projects will service residential land
and privatize it through auctions and competitive tenders. Coordination of both local and federal
government as well as the introduction of many new procedures will require strong central
management and strong local representation.
6.    Construcdon Finance. For the construction finance sub-component, the Government will on-
lend funds to participating commercial banks for residential sub-projects in the Participating Cities
(PC's), which have demonstration value and which meet eligibility criteria. This sub-component is
viewed as an experimental effort to demonstrate real estate lending, design innovation and new
building methodology.
7.    Transformation of the Buildiny Materials Industra. For the Equity Matching Line of Credit
(EMLOC) the Govermnent will on-lend funds to participating commercial banks (PB's), for sub-
projects that meet eligibility criteria. New foreign equity will be matched with two equal arnounts
of debt, one guaranteed by the GOR and the other by the participating bank. The participating bank
will act as both a commercial bank and the agent of the Government. Technical eligibility will
encourage products suitable for mid and low-rise residential construction and support the GOR's
housing policy 'DWELLING.'
8.    Technical Cooperation and Project Management. The Project includes technical cooperation
(TC) that will support and reinforce each of the components and provide assistance and training

e.    Land Development Sub-Component
19.   The land development sub-component will require co-ordination of diverse activities under
tight time deadlines. Serviced or possibly unserviced land must be brought to the mnarket and
funded quickly with as little risk as possible. Many of the basic concepts are untried in Russia,
especially on this scale. The sub-projects are complex because they include the full range of
infrastructure development: water and waste-water facilities; roads; schools; heating plants and
transmission systems; gas, electricity and telephone transmission systems; schools, clinics and other
social facilities. Since local governments face serious financial problems, careful planning and
management of the substantial local funding necessary for the project will be necessary. The
Consultant must maintain professional competence to properly perform the duties described herein.

II.    TOR: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATORY AUDIT,
REGULATIONS FOR BUILDING MATERIAL AND HOUSING CONSTRUCTION
a.   Background
1.    Existing Russian city planning approach was created by old administrative-command system.
The main principles of urban planning included: (i) centralized economic planning; (ii) the full
nationalization of land; (iii) extremely normative land use, and (iv) extreme standardization of urban
service. Concerning a housing construction, the Russian system was controlled through a collegial
process wherein a few large clients procured buildings from a few large contractors with the help
of a few large architectural/engineering institutes. All of them were entities of the government and
all of them, including the clients, had in-house technical expertise. The ministerial departments and
municipal departments provided the ultimate technical expertise not as regulators, but more as
mediators.
2.    Under a market economy, with the potential for creating an adversarial construction process,
the traditional roles must change. The government's role in the construction process of a market
economy is as regulator. As such, the government is responsible for protecting health, safety and
welfare of individual building users and the society at large, as it may be affected by buildings. The
government is not responsible for the various other goals of the different building process participants
(i.e., economy, functionality, esthetics, technological development, social and political goals). These
other goals are accomplished through the play of market forces and through the terms of contractual
agreements between the various participants.
3.    The government's role as regulator is accomplished by promulgating up to date building
codes and standards, enforcing these codes and standards by means of a process of competent
building design review and inspections during the construction process, and instituting licensing and
certification processes for key participants in the process. Through a series of enactments and
supporting rules, the system for regulating building materials and products and building construction
in Russia has started to be reformed. Much remains to be accomplished.
For the purposes of this effort the overall system can be thought of as consisting of four components:
a.   The system for development and elaboration of standards (GOST) and norms (Snip).
b.   The system for product approvals and certification.
c.   The system  for licensing building material and product manufacturers, building
construction contractors, and building design and construction professionals.
d.   The system for enforcement including permits and inspections.
4.    Under the current system, during the transition toward a market two key questions are central
to the urban economy and urban development:
a.   What changes in existing urban land use approach will be needed to operate sound
urban land markets.
b.   What changes in existing laws, institutions, and various town planning
documentation will be needed to operate sound urban land markets.



ANNEX 3.8                                                                        239
The development of market-oriented land use system for Russian cities has too many legal, technical,
institutional, social, environmental, and economic dimensions. The point is that land use is not only
a system of standards, but also a system of legal rights and relationships among the various areas
of documentation; what the hierarchy of the authority among master plan, regulations, and special
permits; for instance, can the master plan be waived or modified, and if yes, how, etc.
5.    Two main consultancy contracts will be let under the technical assistance:
a.   Contract No.1: Land Development Regulatory Audit.
b.  Contract No.2: Regulations For Building Materials and Housing Construction.
b.  Terms of Reference for Contract No. 1
1.    OBJECTIVES
a.    The main objective of the land development audit is to adapt existing norms and development
standards to the new market conditions prevailing in Russia. The study would provide a framework
for calculating the impact of norms and standards on land development costs. This will require taking
into account (i) the cost of the land, (ii) the cost of the infrastructure and (iii) the cost of
administrative controls, registration fees and delivery of subdivision and building permits. The
aggregate cost of the development implied by norms will first be calculated; then a proposed break-
down between costs borne directly by developers, and those recovered through tariffs, specific city
budgets and general taxation will be proposed.
b.    The study aim at providing each city with a menu of quantified options which then can be
adjusted by each city depending on its own situation and the existence of local constrains. While each
city might adopt different norms to reflect its own situation and its own set of priorities, it is
important to maintain a uniform format in the definition of norms and the presentation of regulation
in order to make the law transparent and to facilitate periodic revision as required by predictably
changing economic and technological environment.
2.    SCOPE OF WORK
a.    The study would record all the norms and regulations related to land development. These
would be divided into six regulatory topics:
(i)  Spatial norms regulating distances and areas.
(ii)  Engineering norms and practices regulating the design of infrastructure.
(iii) Community facilities norms and practices concerning the provision of superstructure.
(iv) The development cost sharing system between private and public.
(v) Administrative control process regulating the provision of subdivisions and building
permits.
(vi) Fees and taxes related to land development.



240                                                                          ANNEX 3.8
b.    The above topics will be analyzed quantitatively in a matrix form. The impact of the above
regulatory environment on development costs will be tested on 3 types of sites: (i) small scale (2
hectares); (ii) medium scale (15 hectares); (iii) large scale (100 hectares).
c.    The six regulatory topics will be analyzed in a quantitative manner for the three site types
mentioned above using the following indicators:
(i)  Spatial norms will be expressed in square meter of land per square meter of floor space
built.
(ii) Engineering practices will be expressed as infrastructure costs in US$ per square
meter of land and floor space.
(iii) Community facilities cost in US$ per square meter of land and floor space.
(iv) Cost sharing will be expressed in cost for the public and private sector per m2 of land
and usable floor space developed.
(v) The administrative process will be expressed in months between initial request and final
approval.
(vi) The taxes and fees will be evaluated in cost per m2 of land and floor space.
d.    Finally, the different land use and costs will be assembled for the three site types and
presented following the Land Use Development Model currently used in the project. Iterations will
then be made by adjusting some standards to be able to reduce the minimum cost of land
development. These iterations will be presented to different cities as possible adjustments in the
norms.
e.    The scope of services consists of two types of activities. Phase One is in direct support of
the efforts to develop land in the five participating cities. Phase Two is in support of the Project's
goals related to general land use reform throughout the Russian Federation. Phase One - Working
in close cooperation with Cities and the LPIU, the consultant shall undertake the local (regional)
aspects of this study, specifically related to each of the five participating cities. Phase Two - Working
in close cooperation with the CPIU and Minstroi to prepare a draft of a New Land Use Regulation.
3.    CONSULTANTS OUALIFICATIONS
The consultant providing the services noted herein must have:
a.   A thorough knowledge of land use regulatory system as it operates in a free market
economy.
b.  Knowledge of the existing Russian system for land use regulation.

m.   TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR HOUSING FINANCE STUDIES
a.  Introduction
1.    Housing fmance during the Soviet Era was completely controlled by the State: Soviet banks
served mainly as conduits to carry out state-determined investment programs, and lending to
households for privately-owned housing was minuscule. In addition, the ability of households to
finance investments was severely limited by circumscribed property rights and heavily taxed savings.
2.    The Government of Russia has started restructuring the housing sector from a centralized
model of housing provision to a self-financed one. The "Law on Federal Principles of Housing
Policy in the Russian Federation" proposes to make the housing sector "loss-free" and capable of
contributing to the overall macroeconomic performance of the country.  In this context, the
development of a sustainable system of mortgage fmnance is critical for moving from a supply-driven
system of state-owned housing to a demand-driven system of privately-owned housing, within which
households as final owners would help determine what is produced.
3.    The GOR took several important actions in 1992 and 1993 to initiate a market-based housing
finance system. First, the GOR established the legal foundation for real mortgage lending and by
adopting the Law on Collaterall. Next, in 1993 the GOR submitted to the Parliament for approval
the "Law on Mortgage".  This bill is designed to address the lack of clear foreclosure and
registration procedures, currently a major impediment to the development of mortgage lending,
Finally, in December 1993, a Special Presidential Decree "On Development and the Introduction of
Non-Budget Forms of Investmnent into the Housing Sector" introduced the basic institutional
framework for mortgage lending. The decree created the Agency for Mortgage Lending which was
given the following primary responsibilities: (a) to act as a liquidity facility for mortgage lenders and
to have the power to issue mortgage-backed securities to generate funds, and (b) to work with trade
groups, such as the Association of Mortgage Banks, to develop the necessary training for bankers
engaged in mortgage lending. In addition, the Agency would serve as the industry's regulator by
working closely with the Central Bank of Russia.
4.    The Government believes there is a political and economic imperative to move quickly on
establishing a workable mortgage finance system. Such a system could indirectly increase housing
construction and provide the means for some people who are not presently housed to purchase a
dwelling unit.  However, local governments still retain monopolistic control over land and
development rights, building materials are scarce, wages are heavily taxed, and household savings

ANNEX 3.8                                                                              245
are "confiscated" by high inflation2. Any credit policy that would fuel housing demand under current
conditions of low price elasticity in housing supply would further inflate housing prices which would
make housing even more unaffordable for the majority of Russians.
5.    At present, Russian banks invest only a tiny percentage of their assets in long-term residential
mortgages (usually earmarked for their own employees). High and volatile inflation rates generate
major liquidity and interest rate risks for long-term lending, because the banking system's liabilities
are heavily concentrated in short-term accounts. Economic uncertainty and the lack of information
on potential borrowers create high credit risks exacerbated by the difficulty of foreclosing in case
of default.
6.    These institutional and economic constraints pose an enormous challenge to creating an
appropriate structure for housing finance in Russia. In this context, the GOR indicated a strong
interest in a Program that would help identify the macroeconomic and sectoral prerequisites to the
development of a sustainable system of housing finance in Russia; and they have asked the Bank to
assist in coordinating technical cooperation in this area and in analyzing its results.
b.  Objectives
7.    Technical Cooperation in housing fuiance should culminate in an agreed perspective on the
characteristics of a well-functioning market- based housing finance system. It may also lead to future
Bank supported operations to help initiate a housing finance system. The specific objectives of the
three studies carried out in this Technical Cooperation Sub-component include:
a.   To articulate the critical components of a viable system of housing finance;
b.  To identify sectoral and macroeconomic prerequisites that would make introduction of
mortgage finance successful; and
c. To define the steps necessary to fulfill the prerequisites and move from the current
system of housing finance operative in Russia toward a more effective, sustainable one.
c.   Scope of Work
8.    Consultants are required to submit a detailed research proposal and a work plan for
conducting studies on any or all of the three tasks. The tasks are fully interrelated and would require
consultants working on individual components to coordinate their efforts. Consultants would work
closely with the working group described under "General Design and Organization." A general terms
of reference for each of the task as is given below:
TASK A
9.     The consultants would review the existing systems of housing finance in well-developed
Western market economies to determine critical components of a sustainable system of housing
2/ Although the housing construction industry is currently operating at about half capacity, it is not
equipped to respond to the demand for new type of housing such as low-rise and cottage construction.

finance. The review is expected to result in a report that would lay the groundwork for a series of
workshops for Russian policy-makers involved in housing finance reforms. In particular, the report
would cover the following issues:
a.    Mortgage Lending Institutions. Major types of lending institutions (public and private)
that specialize in mortgage lending in market economies should be examined. The
review should outline the functions of different financial institutions including
depositary institutions, financial companies, and mortgage insurance agencies in the
mortgage market.
b.   Sources of Funds. The report will examine fund-raising practices for mortgage lending.
It will review the role of capital markets, deposits, and savings contracts in mobilizing
household savings.
c.   Mortgage Instruments. The consultants will review the mechanisms, the major risks,
and the pricing of mortgages mostly-used in volatile economic environments including
existing major classes of alternative mortgages, such as the PLAM (Price-Level-
Adjustable-Mortgage).
d.   Role of the State. The report will outline the role of the government in different
systems of housing finance including regulatory, tax, insurance, subsidy, and direct
credit policies. The report should be able to assess different types of government
intervention in mortgage credit markets in terms of its welfare and cost effects under
different economic and cultural regimes.
TASK B:
10.   The consultants will review the relevant experience of other countries, including Mexico,
Bolivia, Argentina, and countries of Eastern Europe, in developing sustainable systems of long-term
housing finance in conditions of economic transition and high-level inflation. A further study should
be conducted to determine the prerequisites and constraints on the development of long-tern housing
finance in Russia. In this context, the study will:
a.   articulate macro-economic stabilization - housing finance relationship in transitional
market oriented economies;
b.  identify the impacts of housing and macro-policies on the effective demand for
mortgage finance under different policy regimes;
c.   explore welfare and cost implications of substituting government subsidies for housing
with mortgage finance instruments under different economic scenarios including
different rates of inflation and wage tax;
a.   Housing Finance Institutions. The study is directed at studying current practices of
mortgage lending in Russia and will investigate the institutional capacity of existing
mortgage lenders (both private and public including Sberbank) to compete for and
properly utilize financial resources. In particular, the study will analyze the following
issues:
-     Mortgage interest setting;
-     Tax incentives and cost of credit;

-    Maturity structure of banks' assets and liabilities;
-    Pricing of savings instruments used by the mortgage banks to attract financial
resources;
-    Financial infrastructure and regulatory systems including refinancing facilities,
mortgage insurance, credit risks and underwriting standards, housing bank
supervision; and
-    Organizational structure and managerial ability to assess and supervise mortgage
credit and to monitor collections.
b.  State Subsidies. The study will evaluate government options in allocating resources for
housing. It will review fiscal instruments used by the GOR in the housing sector
including subsidies, housing allowances and tax policies in terms of their economic and
social implications for the housing sector and macroeconomic stabilization.
c.  Legal Environment.  The consultants will scrutinize existing real estate laws and
banking regulations to identify possible regulatory impediments to the development of
long-term sources of housing finance. The Program will pay particular attention to the
enforceability of housing-finance contracts in the Russian context. As a part of this
effort, the Program will also assess the impact of existing tax laws on the effective
demand for housing and mortgage finance.
d.   Secondary Market. The study will explore the potential for a secondary mortgage
market and/or a facility for providing liquidity for primary lenders. It will also help the
GOR outline specific policies to facilitate the development of such a facility and
market.
d.  General Design and Organization
11.   Agency Responsible. To oversee the Program, a Consultative group will be formed from the
Governnent of Russia, including Minstroi, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, major Russian
conmmercial banks, and other private institutions. The World Bank will also actively work with this
Consultative group. A study team will be identified to carry out the outlined tasks and specific
assignments of the Consultative Group. The Group will periodically review and advise the study
teamn on the proposed scope of work and the studies themselves.
12.   Study Team. The Program will be carried out by a group of Russian and international
consultants and will consist of experts in the fields of housing, housing finance, banking, and
macroeconomics. This group would be also responsible for arranging meetings of the Consultative
Group and integrating received feedback into the research.
13.   Seminars. Under the supervision of the Consultative Group, the study team will prepare and
conduct a series of seminars, round-tables, and workshops for a limited group of Russian policy-
makers including representatives of the Agency for Mortgage Lending, private banks, and Sberbank
on the issues of housing finance examined by the studies, as outlined above. The outcome of these
seminars is expected to introduce corrections and finalize the agenda for the research of long-term
housing finance in Russia.

e.   Output
14.   The Program is expected to identify the long-range strategic options for the development of
a market-based system of housing finance in Russia. The Program would help the GOR establish
housing finance reform objectives, develop an action plan, and define specific needs for capital,
technical assistance and regulatory reforms. In particular, the study will result in three study reports
and three seminars based on the findings of the reports:
a.   Mortgage Lending in the Western Economies: Institutions and Lending Practices.
b.   Housing Finance and Macroeconomic Environment in the Period of Transition in
Russia.
c.   Building a System of Housing Finance System in Russia: Assessment of Current
Lending Practices and Potential for Expansion.
f.   Timetable
15.    The consultants will be expected to submit detailed research proposals and work plans for
the studies/tasks in accordance with above outlined terms of reference by    (date). The
consultants will begin work by   __      (date) and thereafter will carry out an action plan
developed with full consultation with USAID and satisfactory to the Bank, and the Government of
Russia. The final study reports are to be presented to the Bank and USAID by _.(date).
16.The entire Program will take place over 20 months. Inception reports for all three tasks will be
produced within 3 months, and interim reports within 6 months. A draft final report will be made
available by the end of 18th month. Recommendations for reforms will be included in the report at

HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 3.9
SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
A.    INTRODUCTION
1.    This environmental assessment (EA) was conducted in the Russian Federation by a consultant
team contracted and financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
under a grant in support of the Housing Development and Reform Project. This EA covers all the
housing sites proposed for initial development under the Infrastructure and Land Development Sub-
component of the Project. The other sub-components of the Project, The Construction Finance Sub-
component and the Equity Matching Sub-component do not have specific site or sub-project selection
at this initial stage and, therefore, environmental guidelines define the environmental assessment
requirements for the sites and sub-projects to be proposed. These guidelines are referenced later in
this Annex. For the purposes of this EA summary, the term "project" represents mainly the package
of initial development sites.
B.    BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT
2.    Affordable and suitable housing is a pressing need in most major cities of Russia. The
project goals are to alleviate this need as well as establish a new pattern of environmentally-sound
land development in Russia. The goal of the project is also to support the replacement of the
historical State financing and construction of dwellings with the concept of land purchase and
construction by individuals and enterprises. Funds for the project would finance site development,
such as infrastructure and the cost of bringing off-site infrastructure services to the sites. Funding
for the project is provided by the World Bank as well as by regional and city administrations. The
project is targeted to benefit middle income families. A total of 14 sites in the participating cities
of Nizhny Novgorod, Barnaul, St. Petersburg, Novgorod and Tver comprise the project. During
the environmental assessment, three additional sites in the city of Rostov-on-Don and one additional
site in Tver were included (for a total of 18 sites) but the development of these three sites is
postponed. The currently proposed 14 sites are summarized in Table 1, along with the anticipated
number of direct beneficiaries to receive dwelling space. The dwelling units are the combined total
of the single family, townhouse and apartment units. City populations are also noted to show the
relative magnitude of the developments.
C.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESmNT FRAMWORK
3.    The EA conducted is consistent with the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01. The
proposed project was assigned to Category B by the World Bank prior to the EA work. Under
Category B, environmental analysis is required but a full EIA is not required. To meet the Category
B requirements, this EA addresses the entire project package at preliminary design level. Before this
project is permitted, more comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessments will be performed by

MINSTROI on a site-by-site basis in accordance with the current Russian regulations. These
comprehensive assessments will include evaluation of on-site and off-site impacts of construction and
review  compliance with construction standards.  MINSTROI will also include:    background
environmental data routinely collected and complied by meteorological centers, state epidemic and
sanitary inspections boards, and water resource boards. Environmental sampling of on-site soils and
groundwater is also required for all sites to verify site suitability.

ANNEX 3.9               _                                                          251
Sub-contracts were negotiated with six local design institutes for data collection. Scopes of
work for the Design Institutes were prepared and issued in English and Russian.
b.     Site Visits.  Consultant teams conducted visual inspections of the 18 initially
proposed sites and discussed environmental and engineering issues with city officials and
Design Institute staff. The teams used existing studies, plans, maps, and statistics to evaluate
and identify the significant environmental issues present. Additional teams consisting of two
or three local environmental engineers were concurrently dispatched to each Design Institutes
to assist in the collection of the required data. The primary focus of the assessment was the
sighting of the developments and their associated environmental impacts.
c.     Evaluation and Presentation of Data. After the site visits were completed, the data
collected (including on-site and off-site infrastructure data) and reports from the field
engineering teams were compiled and evaluated.
5.    Following the EA work in March and April 1994, additional environmental studies were
conducted until August 1994 with particular focus on environmental investigation of site soils. Soil
investigation plans for the 14 sites were developed by detailed study of baseline data and on-site and
off-site past and present land uses .
E.    ENVRONMENTAL LMACTS
6.    The socio-economic impacts of the proposed projects should be highly beneficial. The need
for additional housing in Russia is critical. The proposed housing developments target middle
income families and should assist in relieving general over-crowding in housing. The successful
completion of the project should also have far-reaching positive impacts in the general housing
market of Russia by launching the much needed housing reforms. It is against these overwhelming
benefits that the proposed project is evaluated.
7.    A wide range of environmental issues were addressed in the evaluation. The Physical
Environment component addressed local geology, topography, soils, climate, meteorology, air
quality, hydrology, water quality and site history.    The Biological Environment component
evaluated existing flora, fauna, rare or endangered species, sensitive habitats, species of commercial
importance, pest species, and disease vectors. The Socio-Cultural Environment component identified
land use, planned development activities and cultural properties. Additional areas of evaluation
included local landfills and disposal areas, site soil/groundwater contamination, radiological standard
exceedance areas, and nearby hazardous waste sites and industrial facilities.
8.    In the light of recent findings and site visits it became clear that an absence of documented
data on site contaminations can not be considered a proof of the absence of negative environmental
impacts (Novgorod as an example).
9.    Adverse environmental impacts associated with the project are minimal. The sites are
considered suitable for development within the constraints and recommendations presented in this
Annex. There are, however, some potential environmental problems at one site (Novgorod) that
need to be addressed. These problems include the existence of an undocumented landfill, a leaking



252                                                                              AMEX 3.9
petroleum product pipe and the need for an exploratory excavation for artifacts. These problems may
cause some delay in the construction schedule or modifying the site. Based on the findings, there are
no major environmental issues (except the Novgorod site) as a whole that would preclude the World
Bank from proceeding with this much needed housing development project'. The feasibility of the
sites are more a function of the availability of nearby municipal infrastructure services than existing
environmental factors. The development schedule for some of the sites will be governed by the
schedule for installation of nearby municipal services. However, environmental soil investigations
are required on all sites to determine the presence and absence of soil contamination as discussed
further later.
10.     The sites are mostly extensions of the existing urban environment within the cities or its
suburbs. The background conditions for most of these sites are representative of a stressed urban
area. The most significant urban problem is the municipal water supply and particularly wastewater
treatment in some cities.  In the metropolitan St. Petersburg, there is a water deficit of about 0.5
million m3 per day during peak demand. The maximum supply is 3.6 million m3 day.  The
wastewater treatment capacity is deficient and about 1.0 million m3 of sewage is untreated.
However, the impacts due to the residents of proposed developments in St. Petersburg can be
mitigated in the short-term. Water and wastewater services to the site residents and a high number
of other St. Petersburg residents can be provided by financing a package of high priority projects.
In Rostov, the one overriding environmental factor associated with the projects is the required
improvements to the city's wastewater treatment facilities. Currently, there is a severe treatment
under-capacity causing deterioration in receiving water quality and there is a formal moratorium on
new construction. The construction component in Rostov will not be considered for financing in the
early stages of project implementation. Water and sewer infrastructure in Rostov will be reviewed
by Bank missions as the subject of a possible separate Bank infrastructure project. The completion
of the water treatment facilities, that is outside the scope of work of this project, will need to be
monitored during project implementation. In Novgorod, currently, there is a need for additional
wastewater treatment capacity but the treatment plant expansion is locally funded and is expected to
be on schedule.
11.   During this assessment special attention was given to potential presence of contamination and
hazardous media (soils, groundwater, and air) within the proposed sites. This initial evaluation based
on limited information did not identify the presence of hazardous soils or contaminated groundwater.
However, there was concern that the local practice for industries had been to dispose of their wastes
by their own means without any outside controls and, therefore, potential undocumented
contamination could exist. The EA report of May 1994 specifically recommended detailed
characterization of all media (soils, groundwater and air) given the limited available information.
During the June 1994 visit of the World Bank Mission to St. Petersburg, the consultants contacted
several agencies and found that the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Service claimed that some of
the proposed sites have soils contamination and some have not been tested. On the other hand,
limited tests by one Finnish firm on one of the sites with claimed contamination did not show any
contamination. A detailed baseline study for all of the 14 sites was initiated by the consultants in
July 1994 to develop soils/groundwater investigation plans including sampling and analysis for
1/ The Novgorod site is included thus far in the tables of this SAR as a first year site.



ANNEX 3.9                _                                                         253
potential contamination. Screening for radioactive contamination was also performed at all sites by
taking measurements at ground surface. Based on this recent work all sites still appear suitable for
development except the Pakovskaya Poschad site in Novgorod which may have serious soil
contamination problems. This site is adjacent to an old landfill which is believed to contain industrial
wastes and also a petroleum products pipeline runs through the site, with leakage that was not visible
earlier under snow cover.
12.   Past soil contamination on any site, naturally, is not a result of the proposed development
project and therefore cannot be regarded as an irnpact of the project. Removal or treatment of such
contamination is site remediation (per hazardous and solid waste terminology). Significant site
remedial work would require a long schedule and high costs, and therefore, development on such
sites would not be feasible.
13.   A summary of environmental issues for each site is presented in Table 2. The impacts and
mitigation summary refers to the environmental imnpacts of the project. Soil contamination is a basic
site selection and site suitability issue and is not included in rating of the potential impacts (e.g.,
minimal or   moderate) of the project.
F.    IN}RAsrRUCTURE ACCESSIBILITY
14.   BARNAUL
a.    Salnechnaya Polyana - Most of the off-site infrastructure is in place, including water
and sewer mains, gas service and telecommunications. District heating for kindergarten, the
schools, and the Medical Center will be supplied from an existing facility located 1 km from
the site. Residential housing will be on gas heating. Some improved street lighting access
will be required. A substation is located at 1.5 km but a new power substation must also be
constructed to meet the demands of a fully developed site. Construction on this station has
not begun but is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1995. This could be delayed due
to potential disputes between the municipality and the power company over unresolved bills.
Overall, the site is well suited for construction.
15.   TVER
a.    Youzhny - The on-site services will be connected to adjacent or nearby municipal
networks which have sufficient capacity to support the proposed development. Currently,
the site is bordered by a school, a high-rise housing complex and a State-run fueling
station.
b.    Batino - On-site services will be connected to adjacent or nearby municipal networks
which have sufficient capacity to support the development.

municipal wastewater treatment plant is being expanded by local funding and is expected to
be completed before the completion of the housing development on this site.
17.   ST. PETERSBURG
a.    Yugo-Zapadny. According to the City, it will be necessary to install 12-krm long
main water and sewer lines, as well as a hot water line of 4-km and a gas line of 18-km to
extend services to the site and adjacent areas. The South West Wastewater Treatment Plant
that would serve this site is about 30% complete but construction has been halted due to lack
of funds. These conditions require the phasing of this development to a later date.
b.    Kolomnaki. The off-site services are in the vicinity. There are deficiencies in the
municipal water and wastewater services but the impacts of the site can be mitigated as
discussed later.
c.    Kamenka.  The off-site services are in the vicinity. There are deficiencies in the
municipal water and wastewater services but the impacts of the site can be mitigated as
discussed later.
d.    Severo Primorskaya.  -The off-site services are in the vicinity.  There are
deficiencies in the municipal water and wastewater services but the impacts of the site can
be mitigated as discussed later.
e.    Severnaya Dolina. The off-site services are in the vicinity. There are deficiencies
in the municipal water and wastewater services but the impacts of the site can be mitigated
as discussed later.
18.   NIZHNY NOVGOROD
a.    Bughri.  No on-site infrastructure currently exists. Adequate power and gas are
available near the site, however no water or wastewater facilities are present. The nearby
village is served by a local well. The proposed plan provides for the drilling of four or more
wells for water supply and the construction of a package wastewater treatment plant (the
treatment plant will be shared with other developments). The need for multiple wells is
based on the production of the one existing well and must yet be field tested to assure that
adequate volume with acceptable quality is available. Heating will be supplied by individual
gas units. The existing access to the site will require upgrading. A 2.5 km road is planned
to comect the site directly with the main highway to the west. The environmental impacts
of this off-site road construction has not been evaluated and should be studied as part of the
comprehensive studies. In general, the site is adequate for the development, but because of
its remoteness it must depend on stand alone utility services for water, sewerage, and
possibly snow removal, as well as solid waste disposal and local transportation services.
b.    Beshentsevo 1. Adequate gas, sewer and water mains are near the site as well as
power lines. New water main and collector are planned by the Municipality. A new

substation is planned will be shared with other developments. A new access road is required.
The development will use individual gas heating units rather than district heating.
c.    Beshentsevo 2. Conditions are similar to Beshentsevo 1, except the conditions to off-
site utilities and road access are of greater distances. Heating will be by individual gas units.
d.    Novo Prokovskaya. Utilities are in the area, and are adequate to support the
development. New water main is planned. Only a short sewerage connection is required.
An existing substation will serve the site. A new access road will be built. Individual gas
heating units will be used.
e.    Delovaya. The site is at the junction of two major highways and borders a hospital
heating plant on one side. A major district heating plant is also nearby. All other necessary
utilities are in the vicinity and individual gas heating units will be used.
G.   MITIGATION PLANS SUMMARY
19.   Based on a review of the available information and construction details for the proposed
development projects, no significant negative impacts are expected. There are, however, some
important environmental issues for the Novgorod site and a number of minor envirommental issues
for the others that mitigation measures should be considered for.
a.    Loss of potential farm land. In the cities of Bamaul and Nizhny Novgorod, 82 and
164 ha respectively of fertile land previously used for farming are being developed as project
sites. In all cases the land is currently fallow. No farmers will be displaced because of
development and as such the net environmental impact is expected to be positive because of
the mitigative positive impacts of the project (landscaping, tree plantations, improved
drainage). Mitigation measures are not needed.
b.    Displacement. The issue of displacement is a socio-economic one. In the case of
the displacement of 16 families in Novgorod and the kitchen gardens in St. Petersburg,
compensation and resettlement should be considered. The best solution in the case of
Novgorod would be to resettle the families into the development project's improved housing
sites. If this is not possible, resettlement elsewhere with appropriate monetary compensation
would be an equitable solution. Monetary compensation would also be equitable for
displacement of the kitchen gardens at the St. Petersburg site. For the relocation of the 16
families at the Novgorod site, the current relocation plans and the associated local regulations
clearly provide equitable solutions and should be adopted as the mitigation plan. Budgeted
relocation costs include $42,000 for each family (cost of a new unit) plus compensation for
useful trees and moving expenses. Local regulations governing relocation are strict: families
will be offered choice of new housing either on or off-site; they have the opportunity to
refuse what is offered. Initial contact with the families normally occurs 24 months prior to
relocation. Written consent to relocate is needed. The relocates may stay in their homes
until Phase 1 is complete. Families which are currently doubling-up will get two separate
new units. Families who do not wish to move from the site, or to accept City-offered



256                     -                                                    ANNEX 3.9
housing may also be offered alternative accommodation by builders who wish to bid for the
site area on which the existing homes are located.
c.    St. Petersburg Water and Wastewater Services. The critical municipal services
in St. Petersburg are the water and wastewater (the developments will use gas heaters and
therefore demand on heat plants is not an issue). The basic plan for mitigation is to finance
a package of high priority and clearly definable projects in the Metropolitan area with
benefits to the Northern part of the City. This plan will mitigate the impacts of all the St.
Petersburg development sites except the Yugo (South) Zapadny site. The budget is about $12
to $20 million which is roughly equivalent to what would cost to provide off-site utility
extensions and connections to the Northern sites with residents of about 20,000. For example
one project in the package for discussion is a proposed 6 Iam water main from the new water
treatment plant in the Southern suburb of Kolpina (observed to be 95 % complete) which will
bring 125,000 m3 of water to the metropolitan distribution system to serve about 300,000
people at an estimated cost of $3 million. Similar investment in the Northern Wastewater
Treatment Plant will bring on line an added capacity equivalent of 1 million users, again
providing high cost-benefit ratio. Other high priority projects will bring the cost to the $20
million range. The budgetary relief brought by this finance package will allow the City to
complete other minor off-site infrastructure items related to the sites such as power
connections or gas line extensions. The above described projects package is short-term and
addresses the impacts of the housing developments only. There are also system wide and
sectoral problems in St. Petersburg that should be addressed within the context of long-term
metropolitan programs. These include excessive water use due to low water rates, water loss
due to system leaks, untreated wastewater discharges and unfinished facilities.
d.    Historical areas.  The Novgorod site is in a historical area and exploratory
excavations for artifacts is required to be done prior to construction. The Director of the
Novgrod Kremlin which overlooks the site has also raised aesthetic issues concerning the
height of the proposed housing which needs to be resolved. This site, of course, needs to
be free of suspected soil contamination problems as a prerequisite to any development
activity.
e.    Other environmental issues. Other issues that were present include: removal of top
soil (Severnaya Dolina) and airport noises (Barnaul, Tver). These impacts are reversible and
can be midgated with engineering controls or noise mitigation plans.
H.    ENviRONMENAL GUIDELINES FOR CONSTRUCTION FINANCE AND
BUILDING MATERALS SUB-COMPONENTS
20.   Environmental guidelines for sub-projects to be proposed under the Construction Finance
Sub-component are identical to the requirements for the proposed sites under the Land Development
Sub-component. All sub-projects must comply with the environmental requirements of the Russian
Federation and the World Bank. As part of their application for credits, the participating bank and
its borrower will complete and submit for each site a preliminary environmnental assessment carried
out by a qualified independent consultant. This assessment will follow Russian guidelines and shall
be consistent with World Bank Operational Directive 4.01. As part of the site assessment and



ANNEX 3.9                                     _                                    257
selection, potential contamination of site soils and groundwater will be investigated and documented.
Upon appraisal and approval, a detailed environmental Impact Assessment for each site will be
carried out. The cost of the assessment is to be born by the participating bank and/or its borrower,
and can be flnanced under the credit.
21.   Environmental guidelines for the sub-projects to be proposed under the Building Materials
(Equity Matching) Sub-component will be identical to the "Environmental Review Procedures for
Participating Banks, Russian Federation, Enterprise Support Project" dated June 14, 1994 or its
revised versions.
I.    CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
22.   Adverse environmental impacts associated with this project are generally minimal. All sites
are considered suitable for development within the constraints and recommendations presented in this
appendix. However, environmental problems at the Novgorod site need to be further investigated.
Based on these findings, there are no major environmental issues that would preclude the World
Bank from proceeding with this project, provided that environmental safety of site soils is
demonstrated or remedial action can be taken economically. An assurance should be obtained that
detailed site investigations satisfactory to the Bank should be carried out and reviewed by the Bank
prior to awards of contracts and commencement of works.
23.   Individual and comprehensive environmental impact assessments according to Russian
Regulations should be conducted for each site as part of the earliest design activities. These
assessments should also address infrastructure construction details such as the best routes for off-site
roads and utility connections. Construction details are not yet well developed as the designs are at
preliminary stages.
24.   Selection of one or two sites in each city for the first year of the development program is
being planned by the World Bank. These first year sites should be selected from those sites that
appear to have no or minimal soil contamination potential. Environmental soil investigations should
be initiated on these sites as the next activity on the basis of the investigation plans developed in
August 1994.

HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 4.2
LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT FINANCIAL ANALYSiS
A.    INTRODUCTION
1.    Local Governments have two financial obligations under this component: they must provide
counterpart funding during the project execution and they must repay the loan together with interest.
For the first phase of the project, the cities will provide the counterpart funding from their capital
budgets. In subsequent phases, the cities will supplement their capital funds with the profit from
sales of land in earlier phases while the profits from land sales will provide funds for the repayment
of loans. As additional security for the loans, the participating governments will pledge their own
revenues for debt repayment in the event that the proceeds from the land sales are not inadequate for
debt repayment. In addition, in cities other than St Petersburg (which is an independent city), the
oblast or krai will also provide a guarantee for the repayment of the loan.
2.    The cities have carried out detailed examinations of the proposed cost recovery from land
sales. They have modified site designs, project phasing, and eliminated sites to make the sites more
viable financially as per cost recovery guidelines presented in Annex 3.2, Attachment B. Financial
viability of the proposed sites are crucial because of the uncertainty of city budgetary finances.
USAID has funded independent reviews of both sales and engineering estimates. The cities'
expectations to repay the loans from the proceeds of the land sales appears reasonable even if key
assumptions fail to fully materialize. By phasing the projects and holding land auctions before signing
infrastructure contracts, the cities will minimize their financial exposure under the project.
3.    If the cities do not fully recover the money from the sale of land, they should still be able
to meet debt service from their own revenue, although it will mean curtailing other programs. The
cities have a substantial revenue base, even though the revenue available to cities is determined
mainly by higher level authorities. Although the cities' authority to set tax rates is very limited at
present, it is increasing. In any case, the local governments do have the authority to structure their
own expenditures. In addition, the property tax is a potential source of revenue that is under the
control of local governments. If, for some reason, the cities do not meet their obligations, the oblasts
will step in with a guarantee and their revenue is substantial. Guidelines developed to ensure cost
recovery from the Land Development sub-projects are presented in Annex 3.2, Attachment D. The
Financing Plan by Financiers and Base Cost for the Project are presented in Annex 4.1.
B.    LocAL GOVERNMENT FINANCiAL PosrrION
4.    Russian cities face a great deal of fiscal uncertainty. Their funding sources and spending
responsibilities are uncertain from year to year, and, sometimes, from quarter to quarter. There is
no question that local governments in Russia face serious financial problems. In general, funding
is not available to carry out all of the programs that would be desirable. But the cities are working



264                     _                                                     ANNEX 4.2
to improve their financial position and management and are designing a project implementation
strategy that will minimize their exposure and their financing requirements.
5.    St. Petersburg provides an example of the problems that the governments face and their
response to tliem. In 1992 St Petersburg's share of the Value Added Tax was increased by the
federal governrnent from 20% to 50%; then in 1993 it was cut back to 25%. The VAT is a major
revenue source, accounting for 21 % of the city's 1993 revenue. Additional changes in national tax
laws allowed businesses to defer many of their first and second quarter payments - further reducing
city funds. There was also an increase in business tax exemptions, an increase in the allocation of
the personal income tax to the national government and a reduction in federal transfers. The net
result was an expected loss of 21% in the city's revenues.
6.    The city felt that it could not increase taxes by enough to fully compensate for the losses
without adversely affecting business development and local residents' incomes. So, they introduced
a combination of cost cutting measures and revenue increases. As a result, they were able to
maintain a capital budget in excess of US$ 100 million for the current year. They will be able to
provide the funding necessary for the initial project sites within this budget.
7.    Reorganizations included combining the city's Economy and Finance departments to
strengthen financial management and combining a number of construction departments to improve
both the planning and implementation of construction activities. Both of these moves will improve
their capability for successful project implementation.
C.    STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE CITY FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
8.    Even though the cities face serious problems, they still have significant resources available.
Table 4.4 in Chapter 4 show the ratio of revenue to potential debt service and counterpart funding
requirements. So long as the program is a high priority, funding can be provided. The cities see
this project as a high priority because it will meet immediate needs but, more importantly, because
it provides the start of a process that will generate net revenue. By establishing a procedure for
developing and selling land, the cities will increase their net revenue capability. Moreover, this
increase will take place very quickly - within one or two years from the start of the project.
9.    The loan is providing start-up capital that will allow the city to undertake further projects
from land sales proceeds in this project but the impact goes beyond strengthening the cities' own
development potential. Developers will also be strengthened as they sell the houses that they build
on the sites that the cities provide. In addition, the banks will be strengthened through interest
earnings on loans that they provide for the developers and housing purchasers. All of this will lead
to an on-going self-sustaining development program.
C.    MARKETING PLANS TO MINMZE RISK AND BUDGET REQUIREMENTS
10.   Because of the uncertainties over the cities' financial positions, it is important to minimize
the potential use of city funds and their risk exposure. As a result, the cities will develop plans for
marketing the sites that minimize their financial risk. The plans for call for early land sales with a
minimum of investment. This will provide funds for the counterpart financing in later stages and



ANNEX 4.2                                                                                 265
help assure that the sites that are being developed are financially viable. If the early stages of a
project do not achieve the expected return, the cities can stop the development.
11.   In addition, the cities may sell the land without infrastructure with an arrangement to develop
it later in accordance with plans agreeable to both the cities and the developers. This offers several
advantages to both the cities and the developers. The lack of on site infrastructure is likely to
improve the marketability of the land by allowing the developers more flexibility in site design. The
cities' risks will be greatly reduced because they will not have the on site infrastructure development
in place before they sell the land. The cities will also benefit by requiring the developers to provide
the counterpart funding for the loan. City development of the infrastructure will ensure proper quality
control and timely completion. Without the use of the loan funds for the development of the
infrastructure, the developers are likely to find it difficult to get financing for timely completion.
D.    Crry FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES
12.   Traditionally, the cities have had very limited financial management responsibilities.
Consequently, they are in the process of developing financial management systems and procedures
in response to the changing conditions in Russia.I The financial crisis that they find themselves in
has provided pressure to introduce new systems but, at the same time, has limited the funding and
the time available for developing new approaches. This limits the information available for financial
analysis.
13.   Nevertheless, cities are reorganizing, computerizing and introducing new budgeting and
accounting processes. The financial staff in the cities generally seem interested in change and
anxious to learn new techniques. In the past, their function has been largely clerical but now there
is a new management dimension that has been added to their responsibilities. While they are
hampered by a lack of data, training and equipment, they appear to be moving to improve their
management capability.

ANNEX 4.3
SUMMARY OF PROCUREMENT ACTIONS
A.    INTRODUCTION
1.    The following tables summarize procurement activities envisioned for the project. As
planned, approximately fifty percent of Bank loan funds will be expended on housing infrastructure
construction and supporting equipment purchases. About forty-four percent of the loan will be
allocated through the EMLOC and Construction Finance credits. The remaining six percent will
finance construction supervision, engineering and program management services with the
CPIU/LPIUs. Procurements will be consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for purchases of goods,
works and technical assistance. Applications of funding under the lines of credit will be in
accordance with commercial practices, as allowed in Bank procedures for intermediate credit
institution loans.
2.    As indicated in the tables, there are expected to be about fifty civil works contract actions
(two or three per year per region), twenty-five large and small equipment purchases and about two
dozen technical assistance contracts over the life of the project. Since equity participants have yet
to be fully defined, the number and types of equipment purchases under the EMLOC is currently
undetermined. A considerable portion of them are, however, expected to be of a size and kind
which would warrant ICB procedures. Some of these purchases might, however, be proprietary in
sourcing or otherwise require prior Bank staff review and approval. Such are not expected to cause
undue complications for project participants or generate an inordinate workload for Bank staff.
3.    The presence of procurement and construction management expertise in the CPIU and LPIUs,
staff training, and operating procedures that will detail procurement requirements and documentation
are expected to ensure satisfactory implementation. Special Bank supervision efforts will be directed
to transactions under the Construction Finance component of the loan, as well as to actions under
the Equity Matching credits, to ensure participating banks and borrowers understand and implement
agreed to procurement procedures and documentation requirements. Retaining experienced project
management consultants to advise and assist LPIU staffs in construction supervision and approvals
of disbursement authorizations will also ensure quality controls for infrastructure contracts.
4.    The following tables summarize planned procurement categories and expected implementation
schedules of major steps.

ANNEX 5.2
PROJECT ORGANIzATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.    ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT
1.    The Interministerial Group on Housing Reforms (IG) would provide policy level oversight
and guidance for the CPIU, particularly on the issues that will require interministerial coordination
and intervention. The members of the Interministerial Group would include a representative each
from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Architecture and
Construction (Minstroi), and the Government Department authorized to coordinate World Bank
projects in Russia. The IG would be headed by the Chairman of Minstroi.
2.    A Loan Policy Review Committee (LPRC) would be established with members of the
Interministerial Group to approve initial sub-loans and sub-loans above the free limit and to consider
revisions to the eligibility guidelines proposed by the CPIU. Revisions to the guidelines would also
require the agreement of the World Bank. Continuous oversight of the Project implementation by
the Interministerial Group would also provide an important input into the World Bank supervision
missions.
3.    The executive agency responsible for implementation of the Housing Project is Minstroi. The
Project will be administered by a Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU) on behalf of the IG
which would report to the Chairman of IG. The CPIU would be responsible for coordinating all the
work related to budgeting, procurement, disbursement, audit, reporting and monitoring the
implementation of Project's individual components. Most of the technical work assigned to the CPIU
would actually be carried out by a consulting firm (General Consultant).l'  General Consultant
would provide assistance to the CPIU by performing the bulk of the administrative tasks, certifying
payments and providing advice to the implementing agencies. Local Project Implementation Units
(LPIU's) would administer the land development component in each city.
B.    CPIU ORGANIATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.    General Terms of Reference. The CPIU would be responsible for the overall administration
of the Housing Project. As such, the CPIU would supervise a General Consultant in carrying out
implementation activities on behalf of the IG. The CPIU would be physically located in the Minstroi
which would provide for this purpose appropriate office facilities but CPIU's operations would not
necessarily be subject to all rules and regulations applicable to Minstroi departments. The CPIU
would have three broad categories of supervisory responsibilities: (a) project administration activities;
(b) project reporting activities; and (c) provision of technical cooperation.
1/    The Terms of Reference for the General Consultant are included in Annex 3.8.

assistance to Local Project Implementation Units on the issues of land development, auctioning,
construction, carries out inspection and certification of works to the required standard. The
Department (through the General Consultant) will follow up by on-site visits to the selected sites.

selected cities to assure that:
a.    the cities will have within an acceptable time frame an adequately staffed LPIU to
implement the proposed investment project successfully;
b.    the cities have adequate arrangements for marketing the sites upon the completion of
land development including an adequate marketing plan and the means to implement it;

for the two succeeding years with the assumptions on which such forecasts are based) show
that the investment project will be financially viable and that debt service is adequately
covered by proceeds from the sale of land.
e.   the cities have followed the procurement procedures in acquiring goods and services
from local and foreign contractors to be financed from the Housing Loan to ensure that Bank
procurement procedures have been followed.
f.    disbursement requests submitted by the cities are supported by required

timetable. For investment projects which meet the eligibility criteria, the CPIU will prepare
a draft agreements with the city (in accordance with standard legal language to be agreed
between the government and the Bank including lending terms, currency of repayment and
interest rates).
7.    Local Project Implementations Units (LPIUs) will be administratively attached to each of
the Participating Cities, they will be directly responsible for implementing the land development sub-
component. In those cides where all land development projects are within city boundaries, the LPIU
will report to the mayor. In those other cities where there are project sites in both the city and the
oblast or krai the LPIU will report to the chairman of the Local Coordinating Committee (LCC) and
provide requested information to the CPIU. LCCs have been established in each Participating City
and will be responsible for (a) approving the work plans of each LPIU, (b) recommending alterations
to the Land Development component, and (c) coordinating the various entities which will be involved
in implementing the project at the local level. The project implementation functions of the LPIUs
will include the following: (a) project management, including supervision of detailed sub-project
planning, infrastructure design, environmental analysis, construction supervision; (b) implementation
of land auctions and land marketing; (c) monitoring of implementation of regulatory action plans;
(d) coordination of local technical cooperation and training activities; (e) supervision of
disbursements from local budgets and loan funds; (f) accounting, audits and reporting. The LPIUs
will require a full-time staff.; however cities will have the flexibility to use LPIU's as implementation
units or as coordinating entities with detailed implementation carried out by the City Department
normally assigned to those functions. The General Consultant assigned to the CPIU must inspect
works and sign off on all invoices for disbursement, but the LPIU will be responsible for detailed
supervision of contracts. Hiring of a Project Director and a Procurement/Construction Advisor
should take place as soon as possible.
8.    Construction Finance. Implementation arrangements will precisely track those of the ESP,
with the addition that CPIU of the Housing Project will take on the functions performed by the
Ministry of Finance PIU in the ESP. Eligible banks to participate in the component will be limited
to those that remain accredited by the Bank Review Unit of the FIDP. The CPIU Construction
Finance Department (through the General Consultant) will (a) administer Subsidiary Loan
Agreements with the participating banks on behalf of the Government; (b) administer the
procurement and disbursement aspects of the component, which includes providing assistance and
advice to the participating banks and sub-borrowers; (c) submit to the Bank sub-loan proposals

ex post of all loans with the eligibility guidelines, (e) preparing yearly reviews and recommendations,
(f) promoting the sub-component; (g) coordinating technical cooperation and training, (h) audit,
accounting, and reporting. A Loan Policy Review Committee (LPRC) will be established with
members of the Interministerial Group to approve initial sub-loans and sub-loans above the free limit
and to consider revisions to the eligibility guidelines proposed by the CPIU. Revisions to the
guidelines will also require the agreement of the World Bank.
10.   Procurement, Accounting/Auditing and Disbursement Unit. Working mainly through the
General contractor for technical functions, the Unit would provide assistance to building materials

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RUSSLAN FEDERATION
HOUSING PROJECT
ANNEX 5.3
LOGICAL FRAMEWORK, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, HOUSING POLICY INDICATORS,
AND IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
A.   LOGICAL FRAmEWORK
1.    This Annex begins with a description of the logical framework as applied to the proposed
project. The logical framework focuses attention on the long term and intermediate results expected
from the Loan by specifying the macro-level goals and purpose that the project is intended to impact
, along with the more near term outputs and inputs under each sub-component. The proposed project
implementation schedule up to effectiveness is presented in the final section of the annex.
2.    The Logical Framework essentially defines the link between (a) a narrative summary of the
general project objectives, (b) sub-component specific objectives; (c) objectively verifiable
(measurable) indicators, and (c) the means of verification. The logical framework highlights the
objectives and indicators at both the project and sub-component levels as stated in greater detail in
the Annexes 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5.
3.    The logical framework supports effective project design and implementation in several ways -
(a) it helps communicate the project intent efficiently and effectively to the executives and other
stake holder; (b) it summarizes, in a brief and systematic format, all of the essential elements of the
project, and in so doing contributes to consensus and clarity among the various levels of Russian
Government involved in implementation of the project, as well as among the Russian Counterparts
and the World Bank Project Team, and (c) once completed the project framework provides an
efficient basis for rapid project launch and subsequent implementation. By emphasizing the results,
the framework provides the timing implementation, monitoring, supervision and evaluation. The
Logical Framework and Performance Indicators for the Project is presented in Table 1 of this Annex.
4.    There are two types of indicators for each component: project performance indicators and
policy level indicators. Performance indicator targets are fixed for the first year of the project
implementation. Thereafter they will be reviewed annually and adjusted proportionately to the
changing allocation of funds between project components. The indicators wil be calculated by
project site, city, and for the entire project. The project should be considered successful in its
demonstration effort if the practices and principles instituted by the project have resulted in market
oriented housing development outside the Project. These may be measured by an increase in (1) use
of competitive auction and tendering procedures for introducing public land into private housing
market; (2) percentage of city area properties registered in Unified Real Estate Cadastre; (3)
percentage of housing transactions to overall privately owned housing stock; (4) percentage of new
housing construction by private developers to total housing stock; (5) increase in volume of lending
to private parties from commercial banks for construction financing; and (6) increase in production
of non-traditional building materials by private building materials industries.
