XIAMEN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 3007-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Xiamen Port Project
in China for which Loan 3007-CHA for US$36 million was approved on December 13,
1988 and made effective on January 9, 1990. The loan, which was extended once for one
year, was closed on March 31, 1995. Final disbursements were made on May 5, 1995.
The loan amount was fully disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Toshiro Tsutsumi (Task Manager) and Han-
Kang Yen (Economic and Financial Analyst) of the Infrastructure Division, China and
Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by Messrs.
Richard Scurfield (Chief, EA2IN) and Yo Kimura (Project Adviser, EA2DR). The
Borrower provided comments that are included as appendices.
Preparation of this ICR was started just before the project closing date and was
based on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the ICR by evaluating
the project's execution and initial preparation.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
XIAMEN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 3007-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    When the project was identified in the mid-1980s, most Chinese ports were badly
congested and container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and
transport infrastructure (for distribution) were in short supply. In fact, it appeared that
congestion would threaten the expansion of China's foreign trade. Traffic in Xiamen Port,
which is located in Xiamen Island, Fujian Province, across the straits from Taiwan, had
become particularly heavy and even faster growth was projected: The island was declared
a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in March 1984 (one of only four in the country) with
special status to facilitate foreign investment in export-oriented industries (due to its close
proximity to Taiwan and the important opportunities this offered for economic growth).
2.    The project's main objectives were to improve operations and maintenance at the
port, increase its capacity to handle cargo flow, and help preserve the environment. To
achieve these ends, the project would: (a) implement an action plan to improve port
operation, maintenance and environmental protection; (b) incorporate environmental
protection measures in the port master plan; (c) transfer technology in areas such as long-
term planning (master planning), financial planning and control, and berth management;
(d) expand the port's capacity through construction of a container berth, two multi-
purpose berths (that could be converted to container berths), a coal berth and a barge
berth; and (e) train port operators, maintenance personnel and managers.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The project was completed satisfactorily by March 31, 1995. The closing date was
extended for one year due to a delay in implementing civil works and procuring equipment
to handle containers; the latter occurred because two multipurpose berths were modified
to handle container traffic.
4.    Despite the one-year delay, project implementation was satisfactory because all
objectives were achieved:  Physical components were constructed, equipment was
procured, and the action plan, training and a study were carried out. Training provided



extensive courses for both managers and workers and the Xiamen Port Bureau's (XPB)
operational and maintenance capacity was improved (para. 8.c). The Master Plan Study
provided a solid basis for future development (para. 8.a); implementation of an action plan
improved the port environment; port operations became more efficient (para. 8.b),
physical capacity was substantially increased with the addition of container/multipurpose
berths and a coal berth (para. 10). These achievements were partly due to the project's
relative lack of complexity and to good coordination between the XPB and the Ministry of
Communications (MOC), which has overall responsibility for the port sector.
5.    Bid evaluations, which involved a two-step process (one by the end-user and the
other by the central evaluation committee), took nine months at the start of the project.
However, the procurement period was shortened by about three months after XPB
became familiar with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
6.    The project's benefits were also achieved, including savings in (a) cargo-handling
costs, (b) ship waiting and berthing time, and (c) cargo time. The economic internal rate
of return (EIRR) was estimated at 40.1% against 31.3% in the SAR, which is considered
satisfactory (para. 30).
7.    Cost estimates at appraisal were reasonable. The final cost was estimated at about
US$82.3 million (or Y 249.3 million plus US$36.0 million) against US$90.3 million (or
Y 220.50 million plus US$36.0 million) at appraisal (para. 12).
8.    XPB's financial performance is solid. Although the operational ratio (operating
costs/operating revenues) was higher than estimated in the SAR (60% against 55%) due
to sharp domestic price increases in 1993, XPB absorbed this by increasing the amount of
container traffic it handled. Since container traffic will most likely expand further, XPB's
financial condition will remain solid.
9.    During project implementation, no environmental or resettlement problems arose.
Sustainability
10.   At completion, the project appeared sustainable.  Because port traffic will
undoubtedly grow along with rapid economic development in the Xiamen area, the port's
expanded facilities will be needed. In fact, traffic in containerized cargo has soared, and
the project's container terminals are much more efficient than the one built earlier, due to
the advanced facilities, equipment and trained staff. In addition, XPB is financially stable
and has enough resources to maintain and operate the port efficiently (para. 33). (XPB
could even raise the port's productivity further and provide services at competitive costs).
Findings and Lessons Learned
11.   The findings and lessons include the following:
(a)   XPB capably implemented the construction and procurement of equipment,
carried out studies and developed its organization. However, it could



- vi -
improve efficiency even further by introducing real competition--by
allowing more terminal companies to operate; at present, there are only
two, but private foreign companies would like to enter the market (paras.
40-4 1);
(b)   The flexible project designs included in the project for converting the
wharves were essential; they allowed authorities to respond rapidly to
changing demand (paras. 3 and 31).
(c)    When Borrowers are unfamiliar with Bank procedures, delays--as occurred
with procurement under this project -- are unavoidable. For this reason, the
Bank's project workshops are helpful. However, because local staff are
often moved to other positions, it would be useful if additional workshops
or training in procurement would be provided;
(d)   Performance indicators with regard to port operations, maintenance and
environmental quality were clearly stated in the SAR (to monitor the
project's progress) and proved quite useful;
(e)   Project design was relatively straightforward, which averted the problems
with coordination among various agencies; and
(f)    Courses offered outside the country for managers should be tailored
specifically for the staff being sent, because in some cases, those covered
by project funding were too general (para. 8.c).

XIAMEN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 3007-CHA)
PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECr OBJEcTIvEs
1.    When this project was identified in the mid-1980s, most Chinese ports were badly
congested and container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and
transport infrastructure (for distribution) were in short supply. In fact, it appeared that
congestion would threaten the expansion of China's foreign trade. In particular, traffic in
Xiamen Port, which is located in Xiamen Island, Fujian Province, across the straits from
Taiwan, expanded rapidly and an even faster growth rate was projected. The entire island
was declared a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in March 1984, one of only four in the
country (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen), and granted special status to facilitate
foreign investment in export-oriented industries. This status and close proximity to
Taiwan, with which relations had improved substantially, offered important opportunities
for the island's economic growth.
2.    The project's main objectives were to improve operations and maintenance at the
port, increase its capacity to handle cargo flow, and help preserve the environment. To
achieve these ends, the project would: (a) implement an action plan; (b) incorporate
environmental protection measures in the port master plan; (c) transfer technology in areas
such as long-term planning (master planning), financial planning and control, and berth
management; (d) expand the port's capacity; and (e) train port operators, maintenance
personnel and managers.
3.    Development under the project consisted of:
(a)   Constructing one container berth for 35,000 dwt ships, two multipurpose
berths for 25,000 dwt ships that could be converted to container berths
when needed, one coal berth for 35,000 dwt ships and a barge berth for
1,000 dwt barges.   The construction involved  (i) dredging  about
580,000 m3 of soft soil and about 27,000 m3 of rock; (ii) building about
2,800 m of revetments; (iii) reclaiming and backflilling about 2.5 million m3
of rock, sand and yard pavement; (iv) building railways, roads, warehouses
and storage yards; (v) installing water supply, sewerage and power supply
systems; (vi) providing load/unloading equipment, navigational aids,
operating equipment and boats; and (vii) erecting auxiliary buildings;



-2-
(b)   Training port managers, operators and other specialists in port operations,
supervision of maintenance and construction and methods of financial
control;
(c)   Reviewing and updating the port master plan; and
(d)   Implementing an action plan to improve port operations, maintenance and
environmental protection.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Project Implementation
4.    This was the sixth Bank-assisted port project in China, following the Three Ports
Project, Tianjin Port Project, Huangpu Port Project, Dalian Port Project, and Ningbo and
Shanghai Ports Project (Table 2). It was the first Bank project for Xiamen port.
5.    Civil Works. These included the construction of (a) a barge berth, under local
competitive bidding (LCB), (b) container and general cargo berths, under international
competitive bidding (ICB), and (c) a coal terminal (not Bank financed). Three contracts
were awarded to domestic contractors following the evaluation procedures required by the
different sources of finance. Construction of the container and multipurpose berths was
delayed for eight months because a multipurpose berth was changed to a container berth
to meet the increasing container traffic. Among other aspects, this involved extending the
crane rails, paving the stockyard and procuring added equipment for containers (one quay-
side crane and two rubber-tired gantry cranes).
6.    Two domestic consulting companies supervised the construction of barge berths
and the coal terminal, and a joint venture supervised the construction of the major work-
the container/multipurpose berths. The latter arrangement was quite successful in
familiarizing domestic consultants and the Borrower with intemational practices.
7.    Procurement of Equipment. Procurement was in three tranches. One was for
equipment needed for container, general cargo and coal handling, under ICB (the first
package); another was for the additional equipment for the containers under ICB (the
second package); and the last was for minor equipment under direct shopping. Except for
the long evaluation period (nine months) for the first package, implementation was
satisfactory. The first package contained nine bids (see Table 5C for details), which were
opened on October 7, 1991 (75 days after issuance), and the evaluation report was
submitted to the Bank for review in July 1992. Evaluation was in two stages (common in
Bank-financed port projects): one was at the regional level by the Xiamen Port Bureau
(XPB) and the other was at the central level, by the State Evaluation Committee. Seven
months were needed to finalize the regional evaluation. This rather prolonged evaluation
period was due to: (a) XPB's inexperience evaluating bids for equipment under ICB and
its need for additional time to become familiar with Bank guidelines; and (b) the many
types of equipment included in the package. The evaluation period for the second



-3 -
package lasted only three months because XPB was familiar with Bank procedures and
only two bids were involved. No particular problems occurred with procurement under
shopping.
8.    Technical Assistance (TA) and Training. This involved (a) the master plan
study, (b) an action plan for operations and environmental protection, and (c) training.
(a)   The master plan study, which was originally produced by XPB and the
Waterway Institute of the Ministry of Communications (MOC), was
successfully updated by international consultants and a local firm, along
with XPB. The aim of the study-to provide XPB with the capability to
update the master plan periodically-was achieved. After it was completed
in July 1992, XPB, with the help of the Waterway Institute, updated the
master plan twice, due to the rapid increase in traffic. The study also
provided a solid basis for the port's long-term development--including the
rapid increase of containerized cargo. XPB has prepared a 'Feasibility
Study" for the next step of development in line with the master plan;
(b)   The action plan for operations, maintenance and environmental protection--
which included eight elements to improve operations, four to improve
maintenance and seven to protect the environment--was successfully
carried out (see Table 6).
(i)    With regard to operations, the target for increasing the berth
throughput at the old terminals (see Table 6-1) was mostly
achieved; throughput at Heping berth, which was recommended to
be phased out, was decreasing quickly; and, the average berth time
of vessels (days) was significantly reduced;
(ii)    With regard to maintenance, roads were maintained and upgraded
as planned, periodic inspections were carried out, and the reform
program (which was designed to improve maintenance) was
introduced;
(iii)    With regard to the environment, equipment to prevent oil pollution
was pIocured, coal stopped being handled at Gaoqi berth (as soon
as the new coal terminal was constructed), and a drainage ditch was
provided at Dongdu District berth 3 to collect and treat fertilizer
mixed with oil and water.
(c)   XPB conducted extensive training (both in China and abroad) beyond what
was planned in the SAR (7,201 course enrollments) against 2,063 course
enrollments in the SAR, which helped improved the quality of staff (Table
5B). Domestic training, which was designed to help staff at two new
stevedoring companies operate the new berths, was carried out in three
steps: Theoretical and on-the-job training at the Hai-tian Stevedoring



-4 -
Company, training at other ports (such as Qingdao), and training in safety
at Xiamen. (Two stevedoring companies were established under XPB-the
Hai-tian Stevedoring Company and Shi-hui-shan Dock Works; about 60%
of the staff were experienced, as they were transferred from XPB's existing
terminal, and the rest were new college graduates).
Another 91 managers and 37 technicians attended courses abroad at the Singapore Port
Training Institute, Antwerp Port Training Institute and Hamburg Port Training Center.
Computer training was particularly helpful since the new container/general cargo
operations required computerized advanced technology. However, it was also felt that
some management courses were too general; thus, in the future, courses must be carefully
selected.
9.    The project closing date was extended for one year due to the delay in
construction and the procurement of equipment.
Project Results
10.   All project objectives were achieved during implementation:
(a)    XPB's operational and maintenance capabilities were improved, as the
targets in the action plan were achieved;
(b)   The port became more efficient (see Table 6) and its capacity was
substantially increased by the addition of container/general cargo and coal
berths;
(c)    The port's environmental quality was improved.
Although it is not yet possible to determine if efficiency will be increased over the long-
term, indicators are positive because the institutional goals were also substantially
achieved (through TA).
11.   The project's benefits were also achieved, including savings in (a) cargo-handling
costs, (b) ship waiting and berthing time, and (c) cargo time. The EIRR is estimated at
42.5% against the 31.3% in the SAR, which is considered satisfactory.
12.   Cost estimates at appraisal were reasonable. Final project costs are estimated at
about US$82.3 million (or Y 249.3 million plus US$36.0 million) against US$90.3 million
(or Y 220.50 million plus US$36.0 million) estimated at appraisal. The difference when
expressed in US dollars is due to the devaluation of the local currency (Y 1.0=$1/3.7 at
appraisal against Y 1.0=$1/8.50 at completion or Y 1.0=$1/5.385 overall average). The
local currency increase was due to local price hikes during implementation.
13.   No environmental or resettlement problems arose during implementation.



-5 -
Financial Performance
14.   Past Performance. The port's financial performance from 1987 to 1994 was on
the whole satisfactory. A comparison of actual performance with estimated targets at
appraisal (1994 was the last year forecast in the SAR) shows a much higher than expected
average annual growth rate of after-tax income (48.7% a year in the ICR against. 20.1% a
year forecast). Tariffs were increased each year; however, traffic grew at a lower rate
than the SAR estimates: The volume of traffic handled by the port in 1994 was 17.9%
lower than the level forecast (9.6 million tons in the SAR vs. 7.9 million tons in the ICR).
This dampened growth in operating revenues to 34.4% per year, a figure still higher than
the 22.0% per year forecast at appraisal. Actual expenditures show that operating costs
rose at a rapid rate due to rampant inflation, but tax payments were far lower than
appraisal estimates, resulting in consistently strong after-tax profits.
15.   The SAR's conservative financial forecasts were developed when the country's
policy was to control prices for almost every major commodity at the State level; as a
result, cost increases and inflation were rare. In addition, the State handled the allocation
of major resources during the previous three decades and only charged users the
'planned" prices. At the time the SAR was prepared, there was no indication that the cost
of resources or the rate of inflation would change. Therefore, the financial forecasts
assumed that: (a) real port charges would remain virtually constant; and (b) the rate of
inflation would be minor (from 6.5% a year to 8.0% a year from 1987-1994).
16.   These assumptions, although reasonable at the time, now appear conservative due
to the much higher than expected cost-push inflation that occurred throughout China. In
recent years, price controls on almost all commodities were lifted. During 1987-94,
although the port's tariff was controlled by the State, unit tariffs increased by an average
of 21.0% a year (against 6.8% a year forecast in the SAR). Still, this increase did not
match the rapid average unit price hike in operating costs of 22.1% a year (6.3% was
forecast); this was mainly due to higher fuel, materials, and wage costs and depreciation-
most of which had to be paid on the basis of market prices.
17.   Highlights of the port's income statements for selected years, as compared with
the SAR forecast, are summarized below (details are in ANNEX 1, Table 1.1).

(3)l(4)
18.   XPB's financial performance, as indicated by 1994 after-tax profit (the latest
financial year), exceeded appraisal estimates primarily due to stronger-than-expected
revenue growth related to container traffic-a highly profitable category of cargo
handling. Operating ratios, however, were only slightly higher than the appraisal targets
(60.3% in the ICR vs. 55.3% in the SAR). This was caused by tariffs that did not keep
pace with rapidly increasing costs.
19.   The rate of return on average net fixed assets (RRFA) in 1994 improved from
11.0% in 1987 to 13.4% in 1994 (10.0% forecast), largely due to the increases in before
tax profits being larger than the increase in the value of net fixed assets.
20.   In July 1993, XPB adopted new financial reporting procedures that were more
similar to Western accounting systems; thus, some traditional accounts were abolished and
replaced by new ones. Also, the new system is accelerating the commercialization and
privatization of the port by providing Westernized accounting instruments.
21.   XPB revalued its fixed assets (RFA) in March 1994. It was expected that after
this, the port's RRFA would decline further. However, it only dropped to 13.4% in 1994,
from 18.4% in 1993, because the port's RFA was too conservative: For the first time in
over 40 years, the RFA increased the fixed assets. But the figure was only by an average



- 7 -
of about 50% in book value and 38% in net value. Also, the impact of the RFA was
diluted further when the value of new fixed assets was averaged with the under-valued
fixed assets from the previous year. In addition, a 32.3% increase in before-tax profits in
1994 absorbed some of the negative impact from the RFA.
22.   It is very important for XPB to apply the correct market value on its fixed assets
because this would allow the agency to take the proper depreciation (based on the value of
fixed assets) and replace its aging facilities without jeopardizing the port's financial
capacity.
23.   Present Performance. Despite the rapid increase in operating costs, the port's
finances were still sound at the end of 1994: The current ratio of the port was 1.4, which
is lower than the SAR's original projection of 3.1 but still acceptable; the debt service
coverage was 47.3%, which was higher than the SAR forecast of 30.4%. However, the
percent of current assets in the form of cash declined slightly from 68.9% in 1987 to
64.8% in 1994 (against the 79.7% forecast), while the ratio of accounts receivable to total
current assets increased from 15.8% in 1987 to 26.4% in 1994 (vs. a forecast of 10.5%).
The rising accounts receivable ratio represents lower liquidity, which affects the
availability of cash for paying current obligations.
24.   Salient points of the port's balance sheet during these years are summarized in the
table below (see ANNEX 1, Table 1.2 for more detail):

25.   Future Performance. Despite the high increase in operating costs, the port still
enjoys a healthy range of liquidity, leverage, and profitability ratios (due to the rapid
increase in container operations, as noted earlier). Moreover, traffic trends indicate that
container traffic will continue to grow rapidly. The port's new responsibility for financing
its capital investments has not yet affected its cash flow (ANNEX 1, Table 1.3), but is
expected to weigh more heavily in the near future. In addition, XPB is planning to expand
operations with new construction, set to begin soon. Thus, it is expected there will be a
strong demand for capital inflows in the coming years.
26    In order to further strengthen the port's financial condition, the following is
recommended:
(a)    Total Tax Exemption: If the government wants the ports to be financially
independent, it should grant them tax exempt status. This is necessary
because the ports cannot set tariffs (so as to cover entire operating costs),
as these are still tightly controlled by the State. And, tariffs always favor
the users-ship and cargo owners--instead of the investors (the port
authority) because the government considers the port operation as a public
service.
(b)    Urban Construction Cost Sharing: At present, most of the costs of the
urban infrastructure needed to complement the port expansion (for the
construction of roads, railways, bridges, sewerage, electricity and water
supplies outside the port expenditures) are solely bome by the port
authority. Since the biggest beneficiary of the port's expansion is the city,
part of the costs on these items should be negotiated and shared by the city
government.
Economic Re-evaluation
27.   The economic analysis in this report was based on the re-evaluation of data on
traffic, operational performance, costs and benefits of project components.   The
methodology used was similar to that employed in the SAR and is summarized as follows:
(a)    Capital investment and maintenance costs were revised to reflect July 1995
prices and are included in the cost stream;
(b)    The benefits stream, also reflected in July 1995 prices, was included, and
consists of savings in port handling, ship port time (berth and waiting),
cargo port time (berth and waiting), and coal transport costs. Benefits
began to accrue for coal, general cargo and container berths in 1995; and
(c)    A project life of 20 years was assumed and the capital investment period
for all berths was from 1989 to 1995.
28.   During preparation, it was understood that the two Bank-financed multifaceted
berths would be converted to handle container traffic once the project was completed, to



-9-
respond to growing demand. However, because container traffic grew much more rapidly
than expected, XPB converted one of the berths during construction. This was included in
the ICR economic analysis.
29.   Two factors are responsible for improving the re-evaluated economic internal rate
of return (REIRR). These include: (a) cargo value and handling costs; and (b) much
better than expected container traffic. However, these factors were offset by the much
lower than expected handling of coal traffic (one of the port's major clients is expanding
its own coal-handling facilities), and an increase of 23.1% in the cost of capital (in
constant 1995 prices).
30.   Based on a reassessment of the revised data, the REIRR is 40.1%, which is
considerably higher than the SAR estimate of 31.3% (see Annex 2). The REIRR and SAR
estimates, in terms of net present value (NPV), are given below.

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
31.   Positive influences included:
(a)   A rapidly developing economy in the area and country that increased port
traffic (particularly container traffic);
(b)   A simple and flexible project design (for the multipurpose/container berth);
(c)   The Borrower's experience in implementing projects; and
(d)   A close working relationship between the Borrower and Bank.
32.   Negative factors included:
(a)   Price hikes during implementation that increased project costs slightly and
port operating costs significantly; and



- 10-
(b)   XPB's lack of familiarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
33.   At completion, the project appeared sustainable. Because port traffic will
undoubtedly grow, along with rapid economic development in the Xiamen area, the port's
expanded facilities will be needed. In fact, traffic in containerized cargo has soared and the
project's container terminals are much more efficient than the one built earlier, due to the
advanced facilities, equipment and trained staff. In addition, XPB is financially stable and
has enough resources to maintain and operate the port efficiently. XPB could, however,
raise the port's productivity even further and provide services at competitive costs.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
34.   The Bank identified the issues and prepared the project well and in a timely
fashion; it was identified in April 1987 and appraised in March 1988. Bank staff resources
leading to appraisal were officially zero, because the project was combined with the
Ningbo Port Project and staff-weeks up to preappraisal were charged to the latter. Bank
supervision was also efficient: The annual average input of staff resources was 7.4 staff-
weeks, which included various specialties (see Table 12). This was possible because the
supervision of six Bank-financed port projects was well coordinated. It should be noted
that the flexible approach used to convert wharves for containerization was also
successfully adopted in other port projects (in Tianjin, Ningbo and Shanghai).
35.   With regard to procurement, the Bank took a consistent position and provided
guidance, when necessary.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
36.   In general, the Borrower's performance was good and preparation and
implementation were adequate. The action plan targets were substantially met during
implementation, and as shown in Table 10, Part II, covenants were generally met, as well.
The Borrower's performance, therefore, was evaluated as satisfactory.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
37.   This project is assessed as '"atisfactory" because it achieved all major objectives
without any major shortcomings.  It was not assessed highly satisfactory, because
completion was delayed for one year.
38.   Net present value was positive, Y 2,158.2 million against Y 1,014.7 million in the
SAR (see para. 30), when flows were discounted at 12% for a major portion of the
investment.



H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
U
39.   The project provided port facilities that should be able to handle traffic until the
late 1990s. However, XPB should begin planning the next phase, since preparation and
construction require several years and future congestion could translate into serious losses
to the economy.
40.   The decentralization of port management from the central government to the
municipal level has been successful: XPB, an autonomous entity under the municipal
government, has shown it can implement projects and manage the port capably. However,
it has enjoyed a monopoly position since it was established (as with other port authorities
in China) and has therefore not lowered operating costs significantly. Thus, to improve its
operational efficiency even more, XPB could introduce the concept of competition among
its subsidiary companies that operate terminals; or, it could promote joint ventures with
experienced foreign operators.
41.   It is understood that private operators are negotiating to create a joint venture
company with XPB to operate the new container terminals. XPB also intends to develop
an additional container terminal with foreign private funds (perhaps under a Build-Own-
Transfer scheme). If these materialize, XPB's monopoly position will disappear.
42.   Because of the need to increase the port's efficiency, authorities will need to
monitor its efficiency and financial performance. To accomplish this, they will need to
evaluate: (a) ship waiting time, and (b) cargo handling volume per day per vessel (as
indicated in para. I1), and moves (load/unload) of container boxes per hour per crane.
These data will be available from the statistics provided by XPB.
I. FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
43.   The findings and key lessons from project implementation include:
(a)   XPB  capably constructed the port facilities, procured  equipment,
conducted studies and developed its organization;
(b)   Flexible project designs for wharf conversion, as were included in this
project, are essential; they allow authorities to respond rapidly to demand;
(c)   When Borrowers are unfamiliar with Bank procedures, delays--as occurred
in this project with procurement--are unavoidable. For this reason, the
Bank's project launch workshops are helpful. However, because local staff
are often moved to other positions, it could be useful if additional
workshops or training in procurement would be provided;
(d)   Performance indicators with regard to port operations, maintenance and
environmental quality were clearly stated in the SAR (to monitor the
project's progress) and proved quite useful;



- 12 -
(e)    Project designs, which were relatively straightforward, helped avoid
coordination problems among different agencies; and
(f)    Courses offered outside the country for managers should be tailored
specifically for the staff sent, because in some cases, those covered by
project funding were too general (para. 8.c).

/a  Container traffic at the existing old terminal is planned to shift to the new terminals in
1995. However, container traffic increase was higher than expected and the new
terminals were not operational in 1994; containers, therefore, were handled at No. I
berth, which was fully occupied by containers.
/b  Coal traffic was terminated.
Tc  This berth is planned to fade out.
/d  Not available--traffic was low and sample number is too small for reliable data.

TABLE 7: STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT
Master Plan Study
(a)   Purpose as defined at appraisal
The study was to update the port plan that XPB had provided for future port
expansion enabling the port to cope with the future requirements of anticipated traffic
increase. The study provided the long term development plan to the year 2005. The study
also enhanced the planning capability of XPB so that it can periodically update the master
plan in the future.
(b)   Status
Satisfactorily completed in July 1992.
(c)   Impact of study
XYB participated in updating the Master Plan together with the foreign consultants
and domestic consultants, and developed a capability in updating Master Plans when
required.

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
Section A
1.    The Second Phase Project at Dongdu Harbor District of Xiamen Port is an
important project in Xiamen, China which was implemented by Xiamen Port Bureau. The
project includes civil works, procurement of mechanical equipment and other associated
works.  It is a port construction project applying the World Bank loans through
International Competitive Bidding and introduction of construction supervision system.
The project construction was officially commenced in October 1989. Two container
berths and one general cargo berth were put into simple operation at the end of 1993. The
whole Xiamen Port Project was inspected and accepted by the State Acceptance
Committee on December 8, 1994 to begin official operation.
2.    The project design is reasonable in general layout, handling technology and quay
structure type.  The equipment parameters are reliable and economic with a higher
automation of technological process which satisfy functional requirements. In general,
project objectives are achieved and the project is a success. That greatly expands Xiamen
Port's capacity in cargo traffic.
3.    During the project implementation, many advanced techniques were adopted and
significant benefits have been achieved. For example, channel dredging applied cabin
overflow operation method, thus increasing efficiency and saving investment.  For
construction of barge berth, partial vibroflotation foundation bed was used instead of
traditional whole riprapping foundation bed. New techniques such as vibroflotation under
water, plastic drain plate driving above water and horizontal transportation of 160-ton
reinforced concrete caisson by means of water cushion, etc. were adopted. It was the first
time for Xiamen Port to apply large-sized gravity type caisson structure for its quay
construction, which has greatly accelerated construction progress, improved construction
quality, achieved better technical and economic results and increased Xiamen Port's
construction level.
4.    Construction of the following components such as container berths, general cargo
berth and coal terminal as well as associated handling equipment, harbor fire-fighting tug
boat, coal terminal central control system and telecommunication system, etc. under this
project have greatly enhanced the comprehensive capacity and function of Xiarnen Port
and facilitated the expansion of Xiamen Port's traffic. The cargo throughput of the whole
port in 1994 reached 11.40 million tons.



- 30 -                   Appendix B
5.    The method of Sino-foreign joint venture for the civil works construction
supervision was adopted which suited the Chinese situation. Construction supervision
was jointly undertaken by a joint venture of Scott Wilson Kirpartic Consulting Engineers
based in the UK in association with Zhong Bei Harbor Engineering Supervision
Corporation in China and engineers from Xiamen Harbor Construction Command.
Through the close cooperation between Chinese and foreign construction supervisors and
specialists, they learned from each other which was beneficial for them to make various
proper judgments and decisions and has ensured the satisfactory execution of the project.
Consultant service by the foreign consultants, construction supervision and local and
overseas training enable technical and management staff from Xiamen Port to widen their
view, learn and obtain some international practice, advanced technology and management
experiences which have enhanced the staffs technical and management level and ensured
the project quality.
6.    Particular attention was given to environmental protection and safety construction.
During the project implementation, environmental protection and safety facilities such as
sewage treatment plant, ventilation and dust removal as well as fire fighting were equipped
in accordance with the related regulation of the state. The inspection and assessment
made by the departments concerned of the local govemment show that the results are
satisfactory.
7.    Procurement of this project through ICB was executed by a working team which
comprised experienced technical personnel and specialists from Xiamen Port. They were
familiar with the World Bank's guidelines and FIDIC conditions, with a better ability in
English and rich project management experience. Therefore, the project was executed
satisfactorily. They also applied their experience obtained from the construction of ICB
items to LCB items. Commercial affairs in the bid document for the construction of barge
berth and revetment works through LCB which was approved by the World Bank has
become a model for bid invitation of local items in Xiamen Port.
8.    The project design was basically undertaken by the Chinese design institute, i.e.,
the Fourth Design Institute of Navigational Engineering of MOC and the Third Design
Institute of Navigational Engineering of MOC. In general, the design is a success. The
design institutes made a great effort to ensure the satisfactory execution of the project.
9.    Technical documents for marine structure, channel works and procurement of
equipment were jointly prepared by Xiamen Port Bureau and the design institutes. The
consulting service thereof was provided by the experts from SOROS Associates in
America and China International Engineering Consulting Company in China. Some
reliable and advanced techniques were incorporated in the well-knit and detailed technical
specification which fully complied with local actual situation. Practice has proven that the
tendering work was successful.
10.   Master Plan of Xiamen Port was jointly studied and prepared by Xiamen Port
Bureau and China Waterway Planning Design Institute of MOC. Han-Padron Associates
Consulting Engineers in America was engaged to provide the consulting service thereof



- 31 -                   Appendix B
The Master Plan conforms to Xiamen Port's actual condition and provides a reliable and
scientific basis for the development plan, general layout and construction of Xiamen Port.
11.   In accordance with the port master plan and the demand of increasing container
traffic, in the last project period, one quayside container crane and two rubber-tired
container gantry cranes were procured by using the Bank's loan savings-more than $6
million. No. 7 general cargo berth was converted to a container berth in due time. The
evaluation speed was quick. The result of tendering was satisfactory.
12.   The project was accepted by the state in December 1994. Berths No. 6, 7 and 8
were put into simple operation in 1993. The throughput in that year reached 1.51 mnillion
tons. The whole project began operation simply in 1994 with a throughput of 2.13 million
tons completed. Since the formal operation in 1995, and up to August 31, 1995, the
throughput amounted to 2.185 million tons. This has greatly enhanced Xiamen Port's
capabilities and promoted Xiamen City's economic development. This project is a
success.
13.   Generally the project was implemented strictly following the SAR.  Marine
structure, channel works, roads and stacking yards, handling mechanical equipment,
harbor fire-fighting tug boat, telecommunication system and central control system in coal
terminal were completed and delivered in the contracted period.
14.   When the first package of equipment was procured, it took us a long time to make
investigation and studies again and again on the bidders' qualification for quayside
container crane so that the bid evaluation was delayed for several months.
Section B
15.   The ICR drafted by the World Bank is comprehensive. It describes completely all
the major items of the project executed and analysis provided is mainly correct and
complies with the actual conditions.
16.   With respect to the data of each item in the list of ICR, we acknowledge that they
are correct and generally conform to the actual situation.
17.   With regard to the reason for one year's extension of project closing date, we
agree what is stated in the ICR, i.e., the closing date was extended once for one year due
to delay in implementing civil works and procuring additional equipment for container
handling because of the conversion of No. 7 general cargo berth to a container berth,
Section C
18.   From the project appraisal to reimbursement deadline, the World Bank was very
positive and effective. Xiamen Port Bureau appreciates all officials and experts from the
World Bank who participated in this project for their efforts and their contributions made
to the port devilment. It gave us deep impression of their strong sense of serious
responsibility, scientific way in management and spirit of job respect.



- 32 -                   Appendix B
19.   During the whole implementation period, we have been keeping a close
cooperation and mutual respect with the Technical Division, Communication Division and
Disbursement Division of the Bank. Especially with the guidance on all aspects granted by
the Bank's experts, Xiamen Port Bureau overcame various difficulties in project
implementation and completed the project satisfactorily.
20.   Each site supervision mission from the World Bank made a significant effect on the
project execution. They inspected the site situation twice a year and collected first-hand
information, resolved problems that occurred during construction to accelerate the
construction procedure by strengthening a mutual understanding and trust. The Bank's
mission gave us great support on savings application for procurement of additional
container cranes, etc. and also especially extension of closing date and reallocation of loan.
The Bank officers' instruction, understanding and quick responses to our request
facilitated the project implementation.

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. TRAFFIC
1.     As shown in Table 2.1, the overall traffic of the port is increasing steadily. Actual
total traffic performance, in 1994, was almost the same as the SAR forecast in terms of
total port traffic (about 7 percent less than the SAR's estimates). In 1994, except for
container handling, general cargo and coal traffic were lower than the SAR's estimates
and are summarized as follows.

Of which (Dongdu district):  (1)    General cargo traffic;
(2)    Container traffic;
(3)    Coal traffic;
(4)    Subtotal.
2.     The severe economic recession suffered by the port in 1990 and 1991 caused the
actual average annual traffic growth of the port during 1987-94, to increase at
11.0 percent a year, compared to an estimated 14.1 percent in the SAR. Despite the lower
than expected traffic performance in 1994, the average annual traffic growth of the port in
the last four years (1990-1994) showed a 23.0 percent increase (12.3 percent forecasted in
the SAR). The project site (Dongdu) is the only main operating district of the port. In
1987, the District alone handled one third of total port traffic. With the improvement of
facilities, in 1994, this District doubled its share to 64 percent of total XPB traffic. Based
on the economic activities of the area (a newly developed Special Economic Zone-SEZ, is



- 39 -                     ANNEX2
located adjacent to the project site), the port traffic growth figure for the next six years
(1994-2000) is estimated to be approximately 13.5 percent a year which is higher than the
SAR estimate of 10.3 percent a year.
3.    General Cargo Traffic. Traffic performance, in 1994, is lower than the SAR
estimate by 12 percent. For the last four years (1990-1994), however, the actual traffic
growth rate was 39.5 percent a year which was higher than the SAR estimate of
25.7 percent a year. The higher growth in the last four years is largely due to the very low
performance in 1990 resulting from the severe economic recession in 1990. For the long
term comparison (1987-94), the differences in average growth rate were much smaller
(13.4 percent actual vs 15.5 percent estimated in the SAR). In addition, the lower general
cargo traffic growth resulted in conversion of general cargo facilities to container
operations during this period.
4.    Coal Traffic. In 1994, all coal was domestic (from northern China) to meet local
demand, particularly for industrial and residential uses for the city. The actual traffic
performance, in 1994, was lower than the SAR's projection by 70 percent despite a
50.8 percent growth a year during 1990-1994. Based on the current projection, the traffic
would be lower in the future. The main reason is that one of the major cargo owners (the
local thermal power company) is expanding its operations by construction of its own coal
handling facilities. Taking this into consideration, coal traffic at the port for 1994-2000 is
estimated to grow at only 4.8 percent a year (12.0 percent forecast in the SAR).
5.    Container Traffic. The actual container traffic of the port in 1994 was about five
times higher than the SAR's estimate (2.18 million ton vs 0.44 million ton). The average
growth rate during 1990-1994 was 49.2 percent a year. Due to the strong demand, it is
expected that container traffic in 1995 would be increased by about 50 percent from 1994.
The growth of the container penetration ratio, however, is concentrated only on foreign
trade, particularly foreign going traffic, which increased from 34 percent in 1990 to
71 percent in 1994. For domestic cargo, the containerization ratio was nil. The actual
container penetration ratio of the port can be summarized as follows:
ACTUAL CONTAINER PENETRATION RATIO IN XIAMEN PORT (%)
1990                               1994
In      Out    Total              In       Out    Total
Foreign            34       34       34               36       71       53
Domestic            0        0        0                0        0        0
6.    The fast growth of foreign going containerized cargo represents the current cargo
handling trend for international sea transport. Today, many international ports only accept
containerized cargo, and this requirement will force the port to expedite the



- 40 -                     ANNEX2
containerization of its foreign out-going traffic. The development of domestic container
transport has fallen much behind due to the lack of adequate investment in transport
facilities for the domestic users. Since improvement of domestic container handling will
involve very large sums of capital, including the participation of many agencies (port,
road, highway, bridge, electric power, tracking industry, management information
systems, etc.), it is estimated that progress in this area will be rather slow in the
foreseeable fijture.
B. SHIP TiME ANALYSIS
7.    General Cargo Carriers. When comparing 1987 to 1994, general cargo carriers
spent an average of 5.6 days and 3.3 days, respectively, in the port, of which the ship
waiting time in the port (nonproductive time plus weather stoppage) accounted for 3.6
days and 1.7 days, respectively. During the same period, the average working time per
ship (productive time at berth) has decreased from 2.0 days to 1.6 days due to the
improvement of the handling efficiency of the port. The decrease in ship waiting time, due
to the port from 1.4 days to only 1.1 days, reflected that had the added capacity provided
by the project not taken place, the increase in ship waiting time would have been much
larger (Table 2.2).
S.    Coal Carriers. Between 1990 to 1994, the actual total average port days per ship
has increased from 6.4 days in 1990 to 9.1 days in 1994. The coal ship waiting time in the
port (nonproductive time plus weather stoppage) increased from 4.2 days in 1990 to 5.9
days in 1994. The main reason for the longer ship waiting days is due to the port
(increased from 2.2 days in 1990 to 5.2 days in 1994). The increases are resulting from
(a) the ultra low demand on coal during 1990-1991. In 1990, for example, the actual coal
handling in the port accounted only about 1O percent of the SAR's projection (0.18
million tons vs 1.5 million tons), (b) the arrival of coal volume in 1994 was five times
more than 1990 (0.93 million tons vs 0.15 million ton), and (c) the new coal terminal
financed by the Bank had not been put into operation (Table 2.2).
9.    Container Ships. Despite the number of container ships visiting the port has
increased more than two times during 1990-1994, the total average port days per ship has
dropped sharply from 4.8 days per ship in 1990 to 2.1 days per ship in 1994. With the
project, nonproductive time (due to the port) also dropped sharply from 2.6 days to 1.5
days (Table 2.2).
C. BERTH OPERATIONS
10.   The detail actual operating data used for the economic reevaluation of each project
berth are shown in Tables 2.3 and 2.8, and highlighted as follows:

D. ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS
Economic Costs
11.   All costs necessary for the completion of the facilities planned under the project
have been taken into account in the economic reevaluation of the project. All inputs and
outputs have been evaluated in constant July 1995 economic costs (Table 2.4). Financial
costs have been converted to economic costs by shadow pricing each berth's input
categories. Conversion factors for each input category are based on estimates determined
in completed Bank studies.
12.   The overall conversion factor is 0.94, of which the coal berth is 0.88, the container
berth is 0.97 and the general cargo berths are 0.91. The factors derived for the various
cost items have been applied to the annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of
project economic costs (Table 2.5).
13.   In the ICR, the overall effect of shadow pricing project costs was that economic
costs were 12.8 percent higher than the financial costs, and total economic costs of the
project are 23 percent higher than the SAR estimate at constant July 1995 prices.

Economic Benefits
14.   The economic analysis primarily focused on the benefits derived from relieving
congestion and coal transport savings in the port. Details of the traffic forecast are shown
in Table 2.1. The project will yield quantifiable benefits in the form of savings in cargo
handling coats, ship time (both waiting time and operating time), and cargo time (Table
2.6).
15.   Savings in Cargo Handling Cost. Savings, however, are relatively small, are
expected in the direct cost of cargo handling in the new facilities as compared with the



-43-                        ANNEX2
present facilities at the port. Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess
of available berth capacity would be through more costly lightening. It is estimated that
the lightening costs would be 3 to 4 times greater than normal handling costs. Detailed
estimates of handling cost savings are shown in Table 2.7. Lightening has been assumed
for cargo tonnage in excess of berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy, at a cost three
times that of normal handling. Substantial savings in handling costs are expected after the
renovation of existing berths and at the proposed berths. Savings in handling costs have
been converted to economic benefits by shadow pricing the main cost components of
normal handling and of lightening. Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1
for lightening are used, these factors were estimated in a previous Bank study.
16.   Savings in Ship Time. Savings in ship time include both reductions in ship time
waiting for berths and working at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of
savings in ship waiting time resulting from the project are shown in Table 2.8. Ship costs
used for the economic evaluation are at the low end of the ship cost model developed by
the Bank. The annualized ship resale value, plus operating costs, has been used to
calculate project benefits. The annual resale value of ships has been assumed to reflect the
present state of the shipping industry and gives a slightly lower return than the annualized
replacement value of ships.
17.   Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also apply to the interest
saved on the value of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working
capital would be loans from the People's Construction Bank of China at 10-12 percent
interest. For foreign cargo, the higher foreign exchange working capital needed would
require more foreign borrowing, and it is assumed that the long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) of foreign borrowing would be around 8.5 percent a year. Roughly 30 percent
of all cargo passing through Xiamen port concerns domestic trade. Interest savings have,
therefore, been calculated assuming an average rate of interest of 9.5 percent a year.
18.   Coal Berth. Coal traffic inbound through Xiamen port, with the project, will
primarily comprise traffic which has been diverted from rail transport to coastal shipping.
For the purpose of economic analysis it is assumed that this coal originates in Datong,
Shanxi province. Without the project, lack of adequate port facilities in Xiamen would
force this coal to be moved on already capacity constrained rail transport links. By
making the use of coastal shipping possible, the project yields a net benefit to the national
economy to the extent of the savings in the LRMC of coastal shipping over rail transport.
These savings are computed in Table 2.8 and in the net amount to approximately 99.3
Yuan per ton of coal using the coastal shipping route. A more conservative estimate of
the savings produced if rail and shipping tariffs (financial costs) are converted to economic
costs using conversion factors. The latter method (also presented in Table 2.8) produces
net savings of 45.8 Yuan per ton. Since the port started on very low demand of coal
traffic, with the project, the incremental coal handling is considered to be the generated
traffic due to the availability of the coastal shipping of the port. To evaluate the economic
rate of return for the coal berth, only half of the economic savings (or Y 49.65/ton) has
been applied.

19.   Total project benefits for the items discussed above are presented by year in Table
2.9. The major project benefit would be in ship time savings. These savings would accrue
first to ship owners and could be passed on to cargo owners. All the ships and cargo
owners of coal are Chinese own. As for general cargo and container traffic, the vast
majority of ships calling at the port are either Chinese-owned (COSCO) or
Chinese-operated; it is expected that 90 percent of the project benefits for such traffic will
also accrue to China directly.
E. OVERALL ECONOMIC REEVALUATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
20.   Table 2.10 sets out the Reevaluated Economic Internal Rate of Return (REIRR),
Net Present Value (NPV) and sensitivity calculations for the entire project. The overall
REIRR is 40.1 percent. Compared with the SAR, the sensitivity of REIRR of the project
to variations in costs and benefits are summarized as follows:

/_1: One existing container beth partially used as general cargo berth due to the lack of container Oialc.
/2: With project, one existing container beth is expected to be converted to general cargo opeation.
/_3: Figures in the table are the costs for normal berth handling~ If cargo traffic exceeds 95% bath
occupancy rate, additional cargo traffic will be handled by lightering at roughly three time
the cost for normal berth operatiorn
/4: For lightering operation, throughput capacity is taken as 50% of nornal throughput capacity.
