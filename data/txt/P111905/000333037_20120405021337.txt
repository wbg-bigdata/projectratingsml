F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The IDPL series supported the Government‟s intention to fill the widening gap in
infrastructure investment by raising the amount, quality and efficiency of public spending
on infrastructure while crowding in private participation, particularly in financing.

Specifically, the three Program Development Objectives (PDO) are as follows:

Enhanced efficiency of Government spending at the national and sub-national level,
through (i) higher budget allocations, (ii) better expenditure planning, (iii) improved
targeting of subsidies, and (iii) better financial coordination among levels of government.
(Policy Areas I and II)

Increased private investment through (i) credible and transparent legal and regulatory
framework for PPP transactions, (ii) fiscally sound risk mitigating measures, and (iii)
legally compliant and competitively awarded infrastructure transactions. (Policy Area III)



                                            vii
Improved governance in the provision of infrastructure through (i) improved legal
framework for land acquisition, (ii) strengthened environmental protection, (iii) speedier
and transparent systems of public procurement, and (iv) improved internal audit
processes. (Policy Area IV)

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.   Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. Economic Context

The priority facing successive governments in Indonesia following the East Asian Financial Crisis of
1997 has been restoring macroeconomic stability - reducing inflation, stabilizing the currency and
reducing public debt. Significant success was achieved and growth recovered steadily, returning to over
six percent in 2007 with expectations of a continued rise to around seven percent by the end of the
decade. Recognizing these substantial achievements, the World Bank supported the Government of
Indonesia‟s stabilization and growth program with annual policy loans commencing in 2004.

Despite this return to robust growth with macro-economic stability, it was apparent that widespread
deficiencies in the provision of infrastructure services were threatening to undermine medium-term
expansion and efforts at nation-wide poverty reduction. With infrastructure investment dropping to two
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2000 from seven percent prior to the Asian crisis, Indonesia
had fallen behind many comparator countries in the provision of infrastructure services with some of the
lowest rates of access to clean water, energy and sanitation services in the region.

In 2004, the World Bank published a major study of Indonesia‟s infrastructure which recommended
increased infrastructure spending of an amount equal to at least two percentage points of GDP. The report
also provided recommendations for a host of reforms which aimed at improving the quality of
infrastructure finance which aims at increased supply, improved access, and long term sustainability of
infrastructure services across key sectors for Indonesia: roads, electricity, and piped water. Based on
lessons from the Asian crisis, a key recommendation was that public sector investment in infrastructure
needed to be complemented by an improved framework for private sector investment. This was to involve
removing bottlenecks to the development of projects, but also increasing transparency, predictability and
fairness in the application of “Public-Private Partnerships? (PPP).

1.1.2. Political Context

The incoming Government, elected in September 2004, recognized the urgency of the recommendations
and established infrastructure as a major priority for the coming years. The initial policy packages in
2005-2006 sought to (i) introduce competition where public monopolies exist, (ii) eliminate barriers to
entry for the private sector, (iii) reposition government away from the role of owner-operator, (iv)
improve fiscal relations with sub-national governments, and (v) define broader governance issues in the
provision of infrastructure services. The packages emphasized PPP reforms as a high profile element of
the agendas as demonstrated by Infrastructure “Summits? in 2005 and 2006 where 100 transactions were
offered by the public sector for private participation. Of these, ten were considered model projects: so
identified based on a focus on project preparation.

The IDPL series was deployed to demonstrate support for the incoming Government at a critical juncture
in the relationship between Indonesia and its donor partners. The Bank approved a programmatic series in
November 2007 in coordination with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan International

                                                   1
Cooperation Agency (JICA), which had already initiated a multi-year loan program starting with ADB‟s
$400 million first loan in 2006 and the Government of Japan‟s $100 million loan in March 2007.

Conditions on the ground were assessed to be supportive of modest steps toward strategically important
outcomes in key policy areas. Performance targets for the development outcomes as well as the policy
actions to support them were therefore kept at relatively conservative levels by design in order to
contribute positively to a new and growing confidence in the nascent partnership between the
Government and its donor partners, and to build momentum for concrete policy accomplishments.

1.1.3. Strategic Context

Raising the level, efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure spending was anchored in the FY06-09
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Core areas of engagement included support for (i) a better
environment for private sector development, (ii) improved public sector governance, and (iii)
strengthened decentralized local governments and institutions to increase the impact of public spending.
IDPL was included in the CPS as one of the Bank‟s first policy operations in infrastructure.

A regular multi-year DPL series had already been deployed in Indonesia for a number of years prior to the
launching of the IDPL. However, the perceived need to focus specifically on the policy reform needs of
the infrastructure sector – considered “complex, technically detailed and unpredictable1? formed the basis
for a parallel operation. Having the second operation provided additional flexibility for what were
considered risky policy areas, involving many dimensions of infrastructure services.

1.2.       Original Program Development Objectives

The IDPL series supported the Government‟s intention to fill the widening gap in infrastructure
investment by raising the amount, quality and efficiency of public spending on infrastructure while
crowding in private participation, particularly in financing. Specifically, the IDPL series supported:

           Enhanced efficiency of Government spending at the national and sub-national level, through (i)
            higher budget allocations, (ii) better expenditure planning, (iii) improved targeting of subsidies,
            and (iii) better coordination among levels of government. (Policy areas I & II)

           Increased private investment through (i) credible and transparent legal and regulatory framework
            for PPP transactions, (ii) fiscally sound risk mitigating measures, and (iii) legally compliant and
            competitively awarded infrastructure transactions. (Policy area III)

           Improved governance in the provision of infrastructure through (i) an improved framework for
            land acquisition, (ii) strengthened environmental protection, (iii) speedier and transparent systems
            of public procurement, and (iv) improved internal audit processes. (Policy area IV)

At the same time, the IDPL instrument provided a convening mechanism for Government to organize
multiple infrastructure agencies around desired outcomes as well as an enhanced coordination tool for
donors involved in policy dialogue. The IDPL was jointly deployed with budget support operations by
ADB and JICA to support one common, Government developed, master policy framework.

1.3.       Revised Program Development Objectives

Overall, the PDOs remained consistent and unchanged throughout the series, focusing on increasing the
level and effectiveness of infrastructure financing in order to unlock the backlog of needed investment
across many sectors which arose in the decade following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

1.4.       Original Policy Areas

           National Spending on Infrastructure (ABPN, Power and Roads). The national budget
            (APBN) supported infrastructure spending primarily through budget allocations to the Ministry of
            Public Works (MPW) and the Ministry of Transport (MOT), along with indirect subsidies to
            consumers of power through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) payment to PLN, the national
            electricity company. At the initiation of IDPL, national spending on infrastructure had fallen from
            pre-crisis levels of 6 percent of GDP to 2 percent, budget allocations were not fully deployed and
            the PSO spending was unsustainable.

           Sub-National Spending on Infrastructure. With devolution taking place in the early part of the
            decade, regional and local governments had more responsibility for infrastructure spending,
            particularly in the area of sub-national roads, water supply and other key infrastructure services.
            But with devolution, came new responsibilities and relationships with the national government. In
            addition to supporting higher levels of sub-national spending, the IDPL program took on specific
            and difficult policy areas involved in the urban water sector.2

           Private Sector Financing through Public - Private Partnerships. Before the Asian Crisis,
            Indonesian PPP projects did not benefit from a good legal and institutional framework.
            Government guarantees were not centralized, risk management was not considered and
            transparency in contract awards was lacking. Indonesia was now returning to the PPP market with
            better governance, strengthened risk management and dedicated institutions.

           Cross Cutting Areas: Land, Environment and Fiduciary. Problems with the country‟s land
            acquisition process had been a significant bottleneck, particularly for the roads sector. The
            Government was also aware that significant rollout of infrastructure carried sustainability and
            governance risks with it which equally needed attention. Therefore, the IDPL was focused on
            improving the process and capacity for good environmental impact assessments, transparency in
            public works through electronic procurement and risk based internal audits.

1.5.       Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas remained consistent throughout the series with some expected refinement in policy
direction during the life of the series. One noteworthy adjustment in policy direction came under IDPL 2
in the electricity sector. Support for policy toward rural electrification goals along with the associated
performance target, was dropped from the program. In its place, IDPL sought improved targeting of the
PSO subsidy toward poorer classes of consumers, primarily by raising awareness through publication of
the amount and distribution of the subsidy amounts.

2
 Current estimates are that only 15 percent of the population, including 25 percent in urban areas, or about 27
million people, have access to piped water
                                                        3
1.6.     Other Significant Changes

At the time of IDPL 2, three significant changes were introduced in the program design. First, at the
request of the Government, the IDPL was restructured to include four annual operations, rather than the
planned three at 18 month intervals aligned with ADB and JICA disbursements. The disbursement
alignment with the ADB and JICA programs was broken in favor of annual disbursements to align the
budget support operations with the Government‟s fiscal year and with the Bank‟s DPL series.

Second, two significant changes in the program goals were made under the monitoring and evaluation
framework through the introduction of new performance indicators. In both, electricity and water,
original performance indicators were “outcome based,? targeting the share of the population with access
to the services. For electricity, the electrification target was dropped to focus on subsidy targeting
instead.3 With regard to the access target for water supply, the change in the indicator reflected less a
change in approach than a concern that financing needed to be made available to PDAMs to enable
investment before the increased access to piped water could be attained.4

Finally, as the IDPL was a new instrument for the Bank‟s collaborative engagement with the
Government, the ambition was initially too high in terms of the number of policy actions planned for the
program given conditions on the ground. Consequently, the set of indicative triggers was streamlined
from the 16 proposed under IDPL 1 to the 9 actions ultimately recognized under IDPL 2. Under IDPL 3
and 4, the streamlined approach was maintained with ten and eleven triggers, respectively.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.     Program Performance

Table 1 provides a list of “prior actions? achieved by the Government as the basis for approving each of
the four policy loans in the IDPL series. Achievement of the year‟s prior actions was verified at each
Board approval along with indicative triggers proposed for subsequent programs. The indicative triggers
were then converted into new prior actions for the next Board presentation, taking into account changing
conditions on the ground. The rationale for adjustments when converting indicative triggers into prior
actions was presented in each program document and considered supportive of program objectives and
country ownership of reforms.

Still, as would be expected for a program covering nine separate infrastructure areas, some parts of the
program performed better than expected (national and sub national budget allocations, land acquisition)
while others fell short (electricity, PPP). Some areas were proceeding toward outcomes and established a
set of significant and irreversible reforms (water supply, e-procurement, environmental assessments).

The complexity of a multi-sector programmatic instrument for infrastructure policy made it important for
the Bank to demonstrate flexibility in implementation due to the lead time required to show results, the
institutional nature of the reforms and the multiple agencies involved. In response, the Bank showed
considerable flexibility in recognition of the Government‟s ownership of program‟s objectives and
anticipated outcomes as well as the partnership being developed in the area of infrastructure investment.

2.2.       Major Factors Affecting Implementation

In addition to the environment of macroeconomic stability and returning growth, four specific factors
were noteworthy contributors to the moderately satisfactory performance of the IDPL program:

           Throughout the program there was strong government ownership of the infrastructure reform
            program at the senior levels of government, coupled with good capacity at operational levels to
            carry initiatives through to implementation - albeit at a slower pace than anticipated.

           Due to strong Government ownership and as anticipated by the Bank team at the outset of the
            IDPL, a dedicated, flexible sector instrument was indeed a beneficial complement to the ongoing
            DPL series as year to year adjustments across a range of activities were necessary in response to
            evolving sector developments over an active four year period.

           Strong client and partner relationships were maintained through decentralization of task team
            management, which enabled ramping up of the loans series (from 3 to 4 loans over the same
            period) while maintaining Government policy discussions and good donor coordination.

           Strong levels of technical assistance from key donors in Indonesia was instrumental in supporting
            key reforms –particularly those covering governance aspects (budget, audit and procurement),
            land acquisition, water supply, and transactions under the PPP program.

There have also been design, implementation and “force majeure? factors contributing to outcomes which
were less significant than expected, as summarized by the following four points:

           In some key areas, there has been evolving clarity on sector strategy and therefore, Government
            intentions – in the case of electricity but also for the PPP agenda. Progress was slow for PDAM
            restructuring due to rethinking within the Government on the role of market forces in funding 5

           There have been coordination issues among government agencies and some inertia in others.
            Getting Ministry of Finance (MOF) to approve PDAM restructuring plans proved difficult.
            Coordination issues among the MPW, MOF and the MOT on drafting of regulations slowed
            establishment of a Road Preservation Fund. Environmental regulations took time to develop.

           A tighter design, with fewer sectors and performance indicators, would have facilitated a more
            focused and effective monitoring system. To achieve better informed policy adjustments and
            fewer slippages, the system should have been owned and implemented by Government to monitor
            both policy outcomes and performance indicators.

           Finally, the global financial crisis which took place in the middle of the IDPL program not only
            impacted the infrastructure sector by making investors – public and private, cautious about
            investment plans, but also indirectly slowed reforms by turning the agenda of policy reformers to
            more immediate matters. In addition, the tolerance for reform proved low.
5
  In electricity, while rural electrification was the original target, over the course of the IDPL, the sector strategy
evolved toward better management and targeting of the electricity subsidy. In the case of PPP, there was perhaps
insufficient appreciation of the difficulty of simultaneously reviving transaction flow under improved governance
arrangements. In the case of PDAMs, there is some questioning of the need for such high rates of subsidization to
commercial banks for taking on PDAM commercial risk.

                                                          7
2.3.    Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

The design of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system for the IDPL series included 14 performance
indicators across the three development objectives of the program. The indicators were for the most part,
outcome based, quantitative in nature and inclusive of targets. There was also important consistency
between IDPL performance indicators and the Country Partnership Strategy‟s (CPS) results framework.
Two CPS outcome indicators and five intermediate milestones make up half of IDPL‟s results framework.

Specific observations on the design of the M&E system are provided:

       14 indicators spread across three PDOs (6 for PDO I, 3 for PDO II and 5 for PDO III) made the
        system unwieldy and contributed to confusion regarding development objectives and policy areas.
        Two or three indicators per PDO would have made for a stronger results framework.

       In contrast to the quantitative indicators for the first and second PDOs, the governance objective
        contained qualitative indicators. Therefore, for environment, land acquisition and internal audit,
        performance assessment was difficult, without baseline, target or measurement data.

       Key headline indicators were specified without the possibility of robust and timely measurement.
        In particular, the amount budgeted and spent on infrastructure at the national and sub-national level
        was difficult to determine and required significant efforts to calculate.6

       While most indicators sought to measure sector outcomes (e.g. quality of roads, investment in
        PDAMs, private sector investment, etc), some indicators were based on specific actions (e.g.
        closing toll road concessions, getting three responsive PPP bids) risking hidden conditionality.

       There was mis-specification with some indicators having little to do with the PDOs in some cases
        (e.g. decline in open dumping of solid waste) while in others, the indicators were unrelated to
        anticipated policy actions (e.g. electricity subsidies, AMDAL quality or PDAM investment).

       Modest targets for many components reflected a cautious approach to outcomes but limited their
        use in driving reforms. Targets were surpassed quickly (e.g. budget allocations and public
        spending) and by wide margins (e.g. roads, internal audits) as noted in the Borrower‟s report.

Implementation of the M&E system was challenging for three reasons: First the M&E system needed
Government ownership and management. Secondly, two indicators from the M&E framework - access to
electricity and to piped water – were replaced in the second year of the program but due to measurement
error rather than fundamental changes in project objectives. Finally, a few indicators were difficult or
impossible to measure but carried through the program anyway rather than being dropped or replaced.

From the design and implementation reasons cited above, utilization of the M&E system was not optimal
in terms of its potential to provide feedback, recalibrate policies, and even adjust strategy if deemed that
implemented policies were not achieving development objectives. Instead of incorporating a results-based
management system fostered by monitoring of sector outcomes, the utilization of the IDPL M&E system
was only in response to IDPL reporting needs.

6
  Based on the IDPL M&E challenges, the Bank emphasized measurement of the amount budgeted and spent on
infrastructure at the national and sub-national levels under an Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review (IPER).

                                                       8
2.4.    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operations

With the emphasis on growth and market access, the Government has stressed the importance of building
on IDPL program areas as a driver of „domestic connectivity‟ throughout Indonesia. The desired outcome
of the connectivity agenda would be lower costs and prices in outlying regions and nationwide
productivity increases due to improvements in national resource allocation. Domestic connectivity has
two focus areas: (i) links between regions (inter-island connections), in particular transport links like
shipping, ports and airports, and (ii) strengthening capacity within regions (intra-island connections),
such as local roads, access to electricity and water, and linking in rural areas.

Following completion of the IDPL program, the Government developed its strategic plan for economic
development (the Master Plan).7 The Master Plan covers many areas but focuses on the interaction of the
parts through the Connectivity Agenda which seeks to provide linkage among and within the various
islands of Indonesia through multi-modal methods of transportation and communication.

Therefore, building on policy areas initiated under the IDPL series, the Government is exploring a
program emphasizing “Infrastructure for Connectivity? and is considering partnership arrangements
among principal donors (ADB, JICA, Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and
the World Bank). In particular, based on the strategic importance and probability of success for each
area, the Government will deepen reforms where achievements are likely while expanding into areas
aligned with new sub-national and inter-island dimensions of the connectivity agenda.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the IDPL series were clear, specific and based on real conditions facing Indonesia.
Following the emergence from the East Asian Financial Crisis, the macro economy was stabilized but
infrastructure spending was decimated. The extent of the problem was analyzed in a major study of
Indonesia‟s infrastructure needs in 2005 where the case was made that the binding constraints included
policies and programs. In response, the Government announced an infrastructure policy program in
February 2006 (IPP-2006) which was reiterated through specific yearly programs in 2007, 2008 and 2010.
The yearly programs laid out policy and investment plans of the Government in the area of infrastructure
financing with the second of these - Inpres 6/2007 – forming the basis for the IDPL policy matrix.

The IDPL therefore incorporated objectives whose relevance not only had strong analytical support, but
also reinforced country ownership of reforms which had been developed, specified and promoted through
yearly policy announcements. Indeed, the Bank‟s original policy matrix cross referenced the specific
Government policies, sending a strong signal that the IDPL program was anchored in the Government‟s
own program. After that, the policy announcements were carried forward in various official Government
documents, including the third and fourth policy packages (Inpres 5/2008 and Inpres 1/2010) as well as
Government‟s five year plan (RPJMN 2010-2014).

The IDPL program was directly related to a “Core Areas of Engagement? in the FY09-FY12 CPS: “to
increase the level and efficiency of public and private investment in infrastructure? and as noted above,

  Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Republic of Indonesia, Master Plan, Acceleration and Expansion of

shared performance indicators with the CPS. The IDPL also supported CPS outcomes in a secondary
manner by fostering (i) a better environment for private sector development, (ii) enhanced public sector
governance, and (iii) strengthened decentralized local governments.

There was less clarity regarding the relevance of objectives for some specific areas, including the power
sector and the PPP area, discussed in more detail below. In some peripheral areas (i.e. internal audit and
solid waste) questions can be raised regarding the relevance of the activities to program objectives,
suggesting that it would have been better to avoid including them at all. In hindsight, nine program areas
were too many to enable adequate focus and attention to each one.

3.2.       Achievement of Program Development Objectives

3.2.1. Overall Achievement of Objectives

The overall outcome rating for the IDPL series is moderately unsatisfactory. The Government advanced a
broad and accelerating program of reforms. In some key areas, policy actions exceeded the program‟s
modest expectations while in others; the collection of achievements formed an irreversible and relevant
set of reforms on which progress could be built. Specifically:

           The Government reversed a tendency to limit infrastructure spending as actual spending at the
            national and sub-national levels surpassed the modest IDPL targets.

           An increased proportion of MPW‟s budget allocations is being spent more effectively based on
            performance based budgeting; internal auditing and on-line public procurement.

           Micro level reforms in budgeting and fiscal support established operating frameworks for key
            sectors (roads and piped water), which enabled a deepening and scaling up of pilot programs.

           Tangible progress has been noted in the establishment of the Guarantee Fund as one of the two
            non-bank financial institutions set up under IDPL to support private financing in PPPs.

           Significant advance was achieved in the governance of the sensitive but critical area of land
            acquisition during the drafting and submission of a new land acquisition act.8

           An improved approach to sub-national infrastructure resulted in innovative output-based fiscal
            support schemes for the water sector that may be a pilot for roads and other sectors.

           Progress in environmental regulations governing solid waste, and the strengthening of the
            environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) process has been slow but steady.

However while the performance targets show higher than expected public expenditures, infrastructure
finance as a share of GDP did not come close to the levels witnessed before the East Asian Financial
Crisis. Moreover, there were limited achievements in some key reform areas. In particular, little was
achieved in rationalizing energy subsidies, PDAM restructuring has not taken place and progress in
developing, well structured, compliant PPP transactions has been painfully slow. As a result,
improvements in subsidy targeting, investment in the water sector and private sector commitments have
not materialized at anywhere near the level expected at the outset of the program.

    A new land acquisition law was approved by Parliament in December 2011.

3.2.2. National Level Infrastructure

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Reforms in infrastructure financing at the national level focused on three dimensions: (i) dedicating more
budgetary resources to infrastructure, (ii) improving systems for spending the allocated budget in road
and highway projects with attention to maintenance and preservation, and (iii) a more equitable subsidy
strategy for electricity which includes better targeting to poor households. The first two components are
rated as satisfactory and moderately satisfactory, respectively, but the electricity component is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory, due to the absence of reform in the sector.

Rating for National Budget: Satisfactory

As a key component of the IDPL development objective was an increase in the amount of public
financing available for infrastructure, the most direct policy action toward this objective would have been
to inject higher budget allocations to the Government functions responsible for the nation‟s infrastructure
program – the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Works - the two ministries which have
overwhelmingly the highest share of infrastructure spending.

Using four consecutive yearly policy actions, the IDPL policy actions sought budget allocation targets of
30 percent higher than in 2007, in nominal terms. The budget allocated in the first year (2008) was
almost 50 percent higher than in 2007. This level was then maintained more or less at similar levels
during 2009 and 2010 before doubling in the 2011 budget (Table 3). During 2009 and 2010, fiscal affairs
were dominated by the global financial crisis; with the Government engaging in stimulus spending that
allocated a significant increase in expenditures to infrastructure during the revised budget (Chart 1).

As important as increased budget allocations is effective public spending and the IDPL supported
numerous activities aimed at more efficient spending of increased budget allocations. The difficulty in
achieving a good balance between increased budgets and better spending can be seen in Chart 1 as the gap
between APBN and actual spending widens prior to the 2009 stimulus package which emphasized
spending for stabilization purposes. The challenge now is the effective usage of the new systems in place
for better infrastructure spending given that the budget allocation for infrastructure under the 2011
preliminary budget more than doubled compared with 2010.

Rating for Electricity: Moderately Unsatisfactory

High profile outcomes (higher access and improved subsidy targeting)9 were part of the IDPL results
framework despite considerable turmoil regarding policy direction in the sector.10 The policy of
providing electricity at rates below cost recovery was in direct conflict with the need for increased supply
of and access to electricity in a time of fiscal restraint, making subsidy policy the driver of system
expansion and the Government‟s access goals.11 The conflict prevented formulation of a rational tariff
pricing, undermined the state electricity company‟s (PLN) financial viability and investment
requirements and prevented reliable power supply. Although the conflict remained unresolved politically,
the inclusion of power sector reform in the IDPL raised expectations of policy changes which ended up
not occurring, leading to performance targets which did not materialize.

The Government began to revisit the sector‟s issues in earnest with a new Electricity Law Number 30, in
September 2009 which was potentially an important enabling step for sector reform. Government
Regulations were supposed to give regional governments the ability to issue electricity regulations and the
authority to set electricity tariffs within their jurisdictions in order for different regions to develop region-
specific costing and pricing. PLN was to forego the monopoly on supplying and distributing power,
while private investors and developers would enter these markets and agree with regional governments to
supply electricity in under-served areas.12 However, implementation of the new system was prevented by
the requirement of Parliamentary approval to change below cost tariffs.

Against these challenging conditions, the IDPL originally supported reforms aimed at increasing rural
access to electricity from 55 to 60 percent over four years. However, reflecting the difficulty in achieving
reform outcomes in this sector, the IDPL‟s objective was changed in the second year of the program to
focus on a more narrow reform - a more pro-poor subsidy policy. The target specified for the share of
subsidy going to low income consumers was 70 percent (an increase from 44 percent). Still, the policy
actions to improve subsidy targeting were specified anemically as “publicizing the current and projected
PSO subsidy? and “reviewing the basic electricity tariff and subsidy.?




9
   In 2006, only 55 percent of the population received electricity while those residential consumers who were
connected at less than 900 VA received only 41 percent of the PLN PSO subsidy.
10
    The Government‟s reform objective - system expansion and household access - was first thrown into disarray in
2004 when the 2002 law aimed at restructuring the industry was declared unconstitutional.
11
   With oil‟s prominence in the fuel mix for power generation and with the removal of subsidies for petroleum fuel
in 2005, the PSO became sensitive to movements in oil prices. In 2007, the PSO amounted to IDR 37 trillion (US$
3.9 billion) or 32 percent of revenues.
12
    PLN‟s role as supplier of electricity under Article 33 of the Constitution (confirms the State as supplier of
electricity) remains unchanged. Implementing regulations have not been drafted and the leeway offered to regional
governments to set tariff has not yet been defined.

Under IDPL 4, the non-trivial adjustment in electricity tariffs achieved for the first time in almost a
decade was an achievement, breaking a long standing taboo. However, despite the tariff increase, the
final audited figures for 2010 shows that subsidy levels and targeting actually worsened (Table 4).13

Rating for Roads: Moderately Satisfactory

In addition to the electricity subsidy, the most important government activity at the national level in terms
of spending is more and better roads. Therefore, IDPL supported improved expenditure management
through the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Performance Based
Budgeting (PBB) into the budgeting process coupled with mechanisms for increasing the attention to
operation and maintenance.

In the first case, performance based budgeting was introduced under IDPL 3 and the MTEF was
implemented under IDPL 4 (2010) rather than the original expectation of adoption in 2008 under IDPL
2.14 Despite the two year delay based on an unrealistic original timetable, the result of the activity was
eventually positive. MPW, supported by AusAID technical assistance, was one of seven agencies piloting
the introduction of the MTEF and PBB that led to government wide adoption.

The second set of activities in the road sector focused on the key area of improved road maintenance. In
this area, the nature of the policy action changed over the life of the IDPL. Originally, the IDPL supported
a policy to allocate 80 percent of the necessary maintenance budget for national roads by 2010. However,
the approach to road maintenance was altered during the IDPL period with the tactic of moving instead to
the setting up a road preservation fund financed by “user charges? and applying it to both national as well
as sub-national roads where the quality was much lower. (Table 5)

   The subsidy continues to remain large and jumped to IDR 79 trillion (US$ 7.2 billion) or 48 percent of total
revenues in 2008. Lower oil prices in 2009 led the subsidy to drop to IDR 54 trillion in 2009 (US$ 5.7 billion) or 37
percent of total revenues but rose again in 2010.
14
   In addition, the original intention of including medium-term budget ceilings? was converted to budget estimates,
due to the lack of multi-year budgeting at the MOF level.
                                                              15
The outcome indictors showed results heading in the right direction subject to three caveats: (i) the focus
was on national roads, when the deficiencies were more startling at the sub-national and local levels, (ii)
the targets were highly conservative with the share of roads in good condition projected to rise to 84
percent (the Government‟s goal was 100 percent) and a 1.35 percent expansion in the road network over
four years when the outcome was 23 percent15 (Table 6), and (iii) the linkage between better budget
planning and improved road conditions remained vague.

3.2.3. Sub-National Infrastructure

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Since decentralization in 2001, the role of sub-national governments in providing infrastructure has been
enhanced, with spending on infrastructure at the sub-national level rising from one sixth of national
spending in the mid-1990s to surpass it in the mid 2000s (Chart 2). Since then sub-national spending on
infrastructure - involving water, sanitation and local roads - leveled off as there remained a need to clarify
responsibilities amongst the different levels of government.

The principal constraint in raising sub-national financing for infrastructure beyond the limited levels of
the past years has been a lack of financial discipline at the sub-national government level which left three
quarters of sub national borrowers - covering half of all sub-national loan repayments - in arrears in 2004.
Given rules against sub-national borrowing while in arrears, sub-national infrastructure has therefore been
almost fully budget financed.
15
     Most road length increase is from upgrading provincial roads to national standards (4.5-6 to 7 meter width).
                                                             16
The IDPL series supported anticipated improvements in the intergovernmental financial framework in
general and at the same time focused on the specific case of urban water supply as one the key
infrastructure activities organized at the sub-national level. The water sector was also highlighted by
Millennium Development Goal No. 7: “halving the share of the population without sustainable access to
safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015?.

The Government‟s policy program was designed around a three pronged strategy to (i) restructure debts
of sub-national governments and 165 eligible PDAMs in order to eliminate arrears and the constraint to
borrow, (ii) put in place a system of sanctions to avoid reoccurrence of arrears (through the DAU
intercept) by sub-national governments, and (iii) provide a system of positive incentives to increase the
effective use of sub national spending – first in the area of piped water services and then more generally
as part of the intergovernmental fiscal framework.

The performance indicators originally focused on the specific performance outcomes expected from the
policy program, i.e. more financing at the sub-national level (20 percent over the 2005 level) and a
reversal in the deteriorating coverage of water supply for the urban population (specified to increase from
31 to 35 percent.): a much more conservative target than the Government‟s own goal under the RPJM.16

However, while the development objective remained, the agreed upon policy actions ended up forming a
more limited program. The original design addressed both the generalized system of fiscal decentralized
as well as a focus on piped water. Starting with IDPL 2, the program for sub-national infrastructure
narrowed. The two tracks were merged, the triggers were streamlined (from five to three actions) and the
policy focus centered on the legal framework rather than actual implementation.17 The performance
indicator also changed from coverage ratio to an amount of new investment in the sector.18

In terms of outcomes, though conservative performance targets were met, the sector did not actually
achieve the goals set out under the original program. Sub-national spending on infrastructure was 150
percent of the 2005 level (compared to the 20 percent target) and the specified $300 million investment in
PDAMs was reached by the end of the IDPL program (Table 7). However, PDAM restructuring,
investment in the water sector and the introduction of performance incentives have proceeded very
slowly. Of 165 eligible PDAMs, 106 submitted restructuring plans and 68 have restructuring programs
16
   Indonesia‟s National Action Plan on Clean Water targeted an ambitious increase from 18 percent of households
having access to piped water in 2002 to 62 percent by 2015. For the urban population, the Government‟s RJPN
targeted 66 percent population coverage from 33 percent in 2002 and 31 percent in 2006.
17
    Indicative triggers specified under IDPL1 focused on implementation of (i) SNG debt restructuring, (ii)
performance incentives and (iii) debt work out of 60 PDAMs and lending to 25 PDAMs. These were transformed
into (i) MOF decrees to write off arrears, (ii) guidelines for fiscal incentives, and (iii) enactment of regulation for
financing subsidy to viable PDAMs. The performance indicator was also correspondingly adjusted from a coverage
improvement to one ensuring at least $300 million additional investment in PDAMs.
18
    The reason for the change in the performance indicator under IDPL 2 was stated as ;?the revised water sector
indicator reflects a more realistic appraisal of the likely transmission speed from sector reform through to increased
financing and eventual improvements in access to services.? (pg. 5 IDPL 2 Program Document)

approved by the MOF. Second, while some new public investment has been made in PDAMs, no PDAM
has yet taken advantage of subsidized private bank financing available under PP 29/2009. Finally, while
the output-based incentive program is piloting innovations and demonstrating success, it is only
beginning and still remains as a donor project.

3.2.4. Private Investment through Public Private Partnerships

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Given fiscal constraints, the Government anticipated that most of the additional two percent of GDP
needed to sustain high growth rates would come from the private sector. Private investment reached three
percent of GDP prior to the Asian crisis, but fell to one percent soon after. The goal at the outset of the
IDPL series was for private investment to return, but under a better governance system. In other words,
public private partnerships (PPP) needed a robust, transparent selection framework which manages public
sector risks better than under past regimes where adverse project selection, unmanageable fiscal burden
and financial leakages were the result.

The second dimension of the program‟s development objective - to increase private investment through a
fiscally sound, credible and transparent PPP framework - was to be achieved through three policy pillars:
(i) avoiding “old-style? transactions through the application of good governance rules to most PPP
transactions while enforcing transparency for non-compliant projects, (ii) creating two financial
institutions to mobilize local currency financing and manage the allocation of sovereign guarantees to
PPP projects, respectively, and (iii) preparing and piloting a series of compliant transactions aimed at
reaching financial closure in a reasonable time frame in order to test and jump start the system.

Interim outcomes measuring progress toward these goals were incorporated into the M&E system. First,
to test the will to eliminate “old-style? governance in PPPs, all pre-2007 toll-road concessions needed to
be closed or terminated. Second, to demonstrate that successful application of the new governance
framework would involve open and competitive, compliant PPP transactions, there should be at least
three bids for any PPP transaction. Finally, to gauge improvement in the environment, private
infrastructure investment as a share of GDP was included. According to these measurements, the impact
of the PPP program has been limited.

Even though attracting private sector financing, risk sharing and project management has been at the
forefront of the Government‟s strategy and a central focus of donor activity, the reality is that Indonesia
remained farther away from its medium term goals than would have been expected at the outset of the
IDPL. Authorities wrestled with pragmatic solutions to trade-offs between “strong rules? and
“transactions progress,? so far leaning toward commitment to rules of law in the case of PPP transactions,
but possibly at the expense of concluding transactions.19




19
  At the time of IDPL closing the Government was introducing more flexibility in the framework for non-compliant
toll road concession and reviewing loosening some governance requirements in the framework for PPP transactions,
by allowing less than three bids in some cases.

Even as the authorities spent considerable time and effort formulating, revising and fine tuning the
framework in 2005-2006 and again in 2010 (Chart 3), there has been a strong effort to mobilize the new
governance framework for PPP transactions. However, the real results on the ground have been less
significant and more time consuming than expected. Clarifying amendments to the original 2005-06 legal
framework were finally approved under IDPL4 in 2010 though originally expected in 2008, under
IDPL2.20 The general framework for non-compliant projects was not designed as planned and the effort to
bring to closure non-compliant projects in the toll-road sector has not yet shown results.21

The results for the other PPP policy areas were equally limited, though some results are now starting to
emerge. The Government hoped to establish two financial institutions – (i) a risk management agency to
manage and cap Government guarantees and (ii) a state-owned non bank financial institution to
intermediate private local currency financing of infrastructure projects. In both cases, the IDPL
expectation that the institutions would be operational and supportive of private investment during the life
of the project was, in hindsight, highly optimistic. In the case of the Guarantee Fund, the fund was only
legally established at the end of 2010 when Presidential Degree 78/2010 provided it operational authority.

20
   To de-bottleneck PPP projects, the Government is revising Perpres 13/2010 to accommodate among other things:
(i) clear steps involved in prioritizing and bidding of projects, (ii) unrestricted bidding conditions for foreign
companies in participating in PPP bids, (iii) Government Supports (fiscal and financial) for project preparations and
transactions, (iv) pushing up land acquisition by putting the condition of completion before bid submissions, and (v)
use of both Indonesian and English languages governing PPP contracts.
21
   Three years of negotiation and support culminated in Ministerial Degree 6/2010 which required financial close or
termination of 24 old toll road concessions by December 2010 (later extended to July 2011).
                                                                 19
The IDPL policy framework supported the establishment activities, such as regulations, procedures,
staffing and funding for both institutions but by IDPL closing, neither was operational. In the case of the
Indonesia Infrastructure Finance Facility (IIFF), the institution had difficulty attracting private funding for
its equity and was hampered by internal management issues at the outset. At the same time, pensions and
insurance regulations were too restrictive to be a source of IIFF funding. Still, given the amount of effort
and support provided to it, IIFF eventually began to operate22 while the Indonesian Guarantee Fund
developed into more of technical advisor to Government on project feasibility.

Without much movement on the PPP front, the IDPL performance indicator measuring private sector
commitments was not linked to the development objectives but driven more by external factors. The
share of private investment in GDP rose in the program‟s first year by more than the 0.5 percent of GDP
and fell back dramatically during the Globally Financial Crisis and since (Table 8).

The third activity was to pilot PPP transactions to test the system. As a litmus test of the viability of the
system23, the results have been disappointing in particular since the IDPL design picked up the 10 model
projects announced by the Government, and included them as triggers (Table 9). Participation by the
private sector has been limited and transactions have not materialized. By the closing date of the IDPL,
one project – a coal-fired power plant, advised by IFC, had been tendered.24

22
   IIFF‟s first operation was under processing – a section of the all important, Trans Java Highway.
23
   As the IDPL documentation indicated – “progress on transactions is the real test of the entire institutional
development and so it is appropriate to include this as a trigger for future operations.?
24
   Execution gives political confidence of success for a PPP project preparation and transactions in Indonesia.
                                                                            20
The slow record on transactions is certainly attributable to a cautious global market for cross-border
transactions, but more due to a lack of clear commitment and institutional leadership to push projects
through the system. The legal framework was new and rigid without much experience while lists of
projects changed often. Early attempts at project preparation were not of sufficient quality, and the system
of institutional oversight was too heavy to get started. It was also difficult to prepare transactions during a
global recession. The lack of substantive transactions from the PPP pillar is in stark contrast to the
amount of effort invested by the Government and donors.25

3.2.5. Cross Cutting Areas: Land Acquisition, Environmental Management & Fiduciary Oversight

Rating: Satisfactory

The IDPL strategy coupled its emphasis on raising the quantity of infrastructure services with a concern
for quality and sustainability through better public sector governance. Therefore a broad set of
complementary policy areas were included as part of an umbrella of policy issues supported under the
IDPL, including (i) improved environmental impact reviews and regulations for better solid waste
management, (ii) “faster and fairer? land acquisition processes, and (iii) improved financial management
in the MPW covering procurement and internal audits. While a tighter focus may have been warranted,
notable accomplishments in these difficult governance areas were highlights of the IDPL series.

Rating for Environment: Satisfactory

In the area of environment, legal amendments to the law on Environment to strengthen the process of
environmental impact assessment (EIA), or in Indonesian terms, AMDAL, was more significant as a key
element in the package of public safeguards in the provision of infrastructure. The performance indicator
was complementary to the policy action, ensuring that improvements in the quality on the ground would
complement legislative strengthening. On the other hand, the IDPL design acknowledged that not all
environmental issues being addressed by the Government are directly relevant to infrastructure provision.
Solid waste management was one of those areas, included in IDPL to recognize targets in the
Government‟s environmental management program. The IDPL recognized the new Law on Municipal
Waste but was unable to deliver implementing regulations even in draft form. In addition, the
performance indicator was ill conceived as data was not available.

Rating for Land Acquisition: Satisfactory

A major hurdle to infrastructure provision in Indonesia, as in many countries, is the sensitive area of land
acquisition, particularly for toll-road PPPs. Conflicts can arise on any one of a range of thorny issues,
including valuation, compensation, squatter rights, appeals, etc, and mostly derive from inconsistencies in
rules and application. Starting from IDPL 2 when the focus of the component narrowly focused on a
Government program to “establish a land capping scheme? directed at old PPP toll road concessions, the
component became centered on a more generalized process to develop nation-wide reforms.26 In doing so,
the Government recognized that the sensitivity of the issues involved required a law to be passed. A Land
Acquisition Act was developed and submitted to Parliament during the IDPL period and finally approved

25
    Money was mobilized to (i) build capacity and development operational procedures, (ii) make institutions
operational, and (iii) assist line ministries in preparing PPP transactions, including a $30 million fund for project
preparation by the ADB and the Government of the Netherlands.
26
   An organic process involved an inter-ministerial working group (WG) and included a wide range of additional
stakeholders. The WG developed an action plan and started implementation, recognized as good progress.
                                                         21
in December 2011. The next critical step is for the implementing regulations to be formed, in which the
key controversial issues will be addressed. The performance indicator – “data collection on delays and
levels of compensation for national roads land acquisition? – was achieved as the data was being collected
for at the national and sub-national level by the National Land Agency (BPN) and its sub-national offices.

Rating for Public Procurement / Financial Management: Satisfactory

The MPW is one of the largest ministries in terms of national budget and covers infrastructure projects
that are particularly subject to fiduciary risks involving substantial procurement of goods, works and
services. It was therefore critical for the MPW to demonstrate leadership in the introduction of Public
Financial Management reforms. As in other IDPL supported areas, reform activities in public financial
management were impressive in scope, began to move in the appropriate direction, but were slower than
expected to reach implementation goals set at the program‟s outset.

In the case of e-procurement, a gradual increase in coverage of the new system was to be achieved by
expanding to new provinces and moving into full functionality of the e-procurement system. It was
expected, even as late as IDPL 3, that all MPW national level contracts would be using “full e-
procurement? by the end of 2010. Instead, 53 percent used “semi-e procurement? and 26 percent use “e-
procurement plus? (Table 10). A key reason for the lack of full implementation is that the IDPL
supported process orientation rather than policy related constraints to scaling up - i.e. legislation
governing e-signatures. Lack of procurement management and low capacity of procurement committees
was another area of concern and the establishment of procurement teams to support procurement
committees was mandated but without notable impact. The result was the performance indicator - share of
contracts signed within 45 days of bid opening – reached only 45 percent; short of the 80 percent target.

In the case of internal audits, the pace of the reform was slow with delays in mobilizing consultants at the
outset. An action plan to address the areas of improvement was developed and its adoption specified as a
trigger for IDPL 2. Implementation of the action plan gained momentum in the second half of 2010. The
most significant progress was made on Risk Based Internal Audits (RBIA), launched in nine provinces
and marking a shift in the selection for audit coverage from the tradition of ad hoc to risk based. There
was also a strong emphasis on training of the staff of the inspectorate and most staff received training in
basic audit skills and RBIA and new manuals were prepared. The financial statements of MPW for FY
2009 for the first time received a „qualified‟ opinion from BPK as against the „disclaimer‟ that had been
received to date.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The IDPL program taken as a whole formed a strategically important, and in some cases, an irreversible
set of reforms across a broad agenda, but with notable gaps. The development objective of increased
levels and quality of infrastructure spending - as conservatively specified in the program documentation -
was achieved at national and sub-national levels. In a number of key areas, the momentum accelerated
(fiscal spending, public financial management, land acquisition, national roads and sub-national water)
with outcomes exceeding modest expectations. In other areas (PDAM reform, road preservation, e-
procurement), promising innovations are being piloted as donor projects and discussed as part of
regulation but have not yet be instituted as an integral part of the government operations.

However, in a number of key, high profile areas, notably electricity reform, urban water supply, and
public private partnerships, outcomes must be considered less than satisfactory given the strategic role in
objectives supported by the IDPL. Despite conservatism in the performance targets, achievements show a
correspondingly mixed picture with the high profile areas showing (i) no change in subsidy targeting for
electricity, (ii) no new investment in restructured PDAMs, and (iii) little to show under the PPP agenda.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.4.1. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

In general, the policy actions supported by the IDPL program were judged not to have significant adverse
poverty and social impacts. Near term impacts would be neutral as the program‟s objectives were to
increase investment plans over the next several years which in turn will require years of construction and
delivery of infrastructure services. After that, poverty and social impacts of increased infrastructure
investment would be positive through the benefits of economic growth and access to much needed
infrastructure services, such as piped water, electricity and roads.

Potential negative impacts from increased road usage, and expropriation are being mitigated through a
better land acquisition law, while electricity prices are meant to be stable for the lowest user categories
even if the improved electricity targeting did not take place. While water tariffs may also increase, the
improved capacity of PDAMs to invest and extend coverage to the poor who currently lack piped service
would be an overall benefit for the poor, as an alternative to self-supply of dubious quality and often
higher cost. Gender and social development aspects were not highlighted by the IDPL, as the provision of
infrastructure would of course be beneficial to the population as a whole, with social development
benefits that would be undeniable.

3.4.2. Institutional Strengthening

The IDPL strategy targeted not only the short term goal of raising infrastructure finance, but also a
number of reforms sought as outcomes, longer term dimensions of institutional strengthening. Aspects
related to stronger institutional governance in (i) awarding projects to the private sector, (ii) taking on
land acquisition issues, and (iii) improvement of public financial management and environmental impact
analysis. There was also a strong attention to strengthening the already new institutional dimensions of
devolution by attempting to put in place financial arrangements to institutionalize the linkages between
national and sub national governments when working together to further aligned interests.
                                                    23
3.4.3. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

There were a number of noteworthy unintended positive and negative outcomes of IDPL reforms. Most
importantly, the land acquisition law was an unintended outcome of the Land Working Group set up
under the IDPL. There were also pilot projects in the area of output-based fiscal support in the water
sector which were not originally envisioned but are now having a demonstration effect on the road sector
that is looking at the water hibah as a potential model for its own programs in road maintenance and
construction. Attention to the difficulty in tracking infrastructure spending at the national and sub-national
level has triggered efforts to improve systems for collecting such data as a part of an Infrastructure Public
Expenditure Review.

On the negative side, the difficulties in achieving progress in cost recovery in a number of infrastructure
areas will have longer term negative impacts on the environment and on the sustainability of
infrastructure services. Long term investment, as well as conservation and financial discipline, is harmed
by the high rates of user subsidies.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The assessment of low macroeconomic risk was appropriate. Indonesia pursued prudent policies
following the Asian crisis. Sound external position and strong debt sustainability helped the economy to
withstand various external and internal shocks. During the Global Financial Crisis, the economy
withstood global instability and did not draw on the Bank‟s Deferred Drawdown instrument. In recent
years the favorable macroeconomic position actually caused exchange rate appreciation against major
currencies, vindicating the low risk assessment made for macroeconomic instability made during the
IDPL program period. Still, despite fuel price deregulation in 2008, fiscal subsidies to electricity
consumption remain a source of fiscal pressure, exacerbated by fuel prices adjustments since 2008.

The high corruption risk was directed more toward country and sector than IDPL specific issues.
Traditional assessment of high corruption risks involved with infrastructure investment are difficult to
ignore in program design for Indonesia, particularly for one of the first infrastructure DPLs carried out in
the Bank. Because of this, the IDPL design included programs to mitigate both country and sector
corruption risk. IDPL prior actions supported budget accountability, including efforts toward greater
transparency and planning processes in the government and state enterprises. Significant procurement
and internal audit reforms were accomplished by the largest procuring ministry. PPP program elements
supported strong enforcement of new governance standards, including competition in PPP awards and the
closure of old, non-compliant toll road concessions.

Government capacity risk was overestimated as high as this turned out to be a limited hindrance in the
achievement of IDPL policy outcomes. The capacity risk was cited mostly as hindering Government
decision making in the area of PPP transactions and the concern that high level commitment to reform
would not be translated into practical achievements in some key areas was certainly valid as demonstrated
by the mixed results described above. As well, the review also notes that mitigation strategies proposed
and employed - realistic prior actions and mobilization of donor-provided technical programs - went far to
supplement Government capacity at the technical level. As a result of the mitigation strategies employed,
some areas achieved progress; with sustainability in question (water, roads internal audit) while others
were delayed more from issues of political and institutional will (electricity, PPP).

                                                     24
On the other hand, the risk of Government commitment to implementing reforms was underestimated,
particularly for the high priority areas, such as electricity, PPP and water. For electricity, sector laws were
passed but not implemented on two occasions – once before the IDPL and the second time during the
program. Even after the IDPL was directed away from sector reform, toward fiscal reform, the
Government was not able to make progress in improving subsidy targeting. Similarly, the amount of
calendar time, staff input, and resource investment it has taken to establish a PPP framework without a
deal flow has revealed problems with middle level commitment to further PPP transactions. Cutting off
old toll-road concessions has been more difficult than expected. The slow pace of PDAM restructuring is
also a manifestation of less than robust Government commitment to the IDPL program elements.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1. Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The IDPL was one of the first operations of its type for the Bank. The design was based on good
analytical work, Government demand for reform and focused on the principal areas impacting Indonesia‟s
infrastructure deficit. In this regard, the IDPL series was well designed and responsive as the country
evolved from macroeconomic stabilization towards longer-term infrastructure development. The reforms
that were recognized as part of the Bank‟s IDPL series were a smaller subset of the Government‟s
reforms program, focused on the Government‟s high priority areas, and where the Bank is closely
involved in dialogue. Finally, close collaboration and broad participation with the Government of
Japan/JICA, the ADB and AusAID aided in the design and helped to ensure high quality at entry.

While the quality of the operation at entry was relatively high, there were important design deficiencies.
Clearly ambition was too high as there were 12 policy areas, 14 indicative triggers and 14 performance
indicators at the design stage, leading to a complex and somewhat unwieldy results framework going
forward. As a result, considerable streamlining was needed under IDPL 2 with important reforms dropped
and two performance indicators changed. Second, in some important cases, Government strategy was out
of synchronization with the IDPL, leading to expected outcomes which were disconnected from the
policy discussions. The case of electricity, water and PPP were the most notable, but the issue also arose
with some of the governance areas. Finally, the broad based approach of including numerous sectors,
ministries and activities, limited the depth of analysis and strength of dialogue for each activity.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision of DPL operations took place principally during the preparation for the next operation in the
DPL series. Such a formalized staggered approach was complemented by a more informal day-to-day
communication between government counterparts and decentralized Bank technical teams or project
teams on mission. In some important cases, a series of roundtable discussions involving various

government and Bank stakeholders facilitated substantive and continued policy dialogue throughout the
DPL series, during which key issues and obstacles to reforms were addressed.

The Bank showed flexibility at the country operations level and willingness by sector teams to respond
favorably to the client‟s requests for adjustments in disbursement schedules, policy thrusts and
implementation timing to strengthening the Government‟s ownership of reforms. In cases of difficult
reform areas where progress did not seem to be forthcoming, Bank teams which were for the most part
stationed in the country, brought to bear knowledge to help inform policy makers, through policy notes,
informal discussions and stakeholder workshops. In some cases, there were positive results, such as in the
case of land acquisition and new program for improved water access. In others, such as the electricity
sector and PPP, little impact was made though this approach and needed a more strategic, directed
approach to achieve ground level results.

5.1.3. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The IDPL series was designed well, strategically relevant, innovative for the Bank and the Government of
Indonesia, and delivered in a timely manner. A strong dialogue was maintained with the Government
throughout the series, with the active participation of the Government of Japan/JICA and ADB, full
ownership of the program was ensured. The Bank also ensured that policy areas included were, as much
as possible, supported by good analytical work and technical assistance, funded and executed by a range
of donors, including the Bank‟s own programs.

With the strong base to work from, a committed Government and a decentralized team a more active
policy discussion between the Bank and line ministries on an on-going basis would have at the least
aligned IDPL and Government policy expectations but optimistically, could have possibly achieved more
in terms of timely implementation and ground level results. In the end, the program‟s original
expectations were quite different than achievements four years later. While such differences may have
been inevitable given the reality on the ground, attention to the implications of policy differences, if any,
or implementation delays, in discussions or at least, in program documents, would have been appropriate.

5.2. Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1. Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The IDPL series involved a range of government ministries/agencies and departments within agencies.
While the performance across counterparts varied widely in terms of overall commitment, capacity and
ownership of reforms, the general approach to IDPL implementation was relatively strong Government
wide. In many cases, Government agencies saw the IDPL as a useful tool to strategically advance reform
agendas within the bureaucracy, while others used the IDPL process for its convening power. However,
while ownership and commitment was clearly present at higher levels of Government, middle levels were
reluctant in a number of key cases to aggressively tackle bureaucratic challenges needed to implement
critical aspects. While the program did not change in fundamental ways, it was consistently weakened
                                                     26
through delayed implementation and in a couple of key cases, such as electricity and PPP transactions,
little implementation at all. A stronger effort to implement could not have come from the Bank, nor
central government offices performing coordinating functions (see next section) but from line ministries.

5.2.2. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As the central coordinating agency, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) was not the
implementing body, but rather was responsible for overall coordination and oversight of the IDPL
program and ensuring that statutory and administrative requirements were fulfilled. In this regard, the
CMEA ensured consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination, played the role of a professional
and accessible counterpart to Bank teams, and was a key to the successes of the IDPL process. The
CMEA also ensured that a comprehensive reform agenda was developed by different agencies, and with
follow-up actions taken by the responsible agency in a timely manner. Finally, the CMEA produced a
comprehensive, thorough and timely borrower‟s completion report, summarized in this report as Annex 3.

Two areas of strengthening would be relevant for future operations. First an M&E system focused on
program results should have been managed by CMEA to track actions and outcomes. Instead, CMEA
relied on Bank missions to spur data collection for administrative requirements. The opportunity was
missed to introduce performance monitoring as part of an overall government reform agenda. Second,
given that there was a lack of understanding regarding the DPL instrument at line ministry level; CMEA
could have performed an advocacy role with line ministries to encourage reform for the greater good.

5.2.3. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government was fully committed and exhibited strong ownership of the program. A key factor
contributing to the success of the program was that adequate resources and personnel were provided by
the Government to facilitate the program. Strong coordination among most of the many Government
ministries/agencies involved in the provision of infrastructure was also maintained throughout the IDPL
series, which enabled the timely undertaking of many of the critical reforms. However, actions took
much too long and were delayed in some cases by a number of years.

6. Lessons Learned

Important lessons have been learned over the course of the IDPL program. These lessons pertain to (i) the
balance of fostering Government ownership and pushing for results, (ii) lessons for program design,
including the results framework and M&E system, and (iii) the intrinsic value of multi-faceted policy
operations to reform, beyond money and actions. The following specific points are offered as lessons for
similar multi-faceted policy operations in Indonesia and elsewhere.

Government ownership and committed counterparts along with ongoing collaboration with Bank
counterparts are required for a multi-faceted program of reforms. Policy reforms are implemented and
therefore driven by the middle level government officials across the range of ministries. Reforms should
therefore incorporate the tactical and political sense of these key government counterparts when designing
the pace and scope of a program. Where consensus is uncertain, a deliberation process along with modest
                                                   27
expectations should be established up front to allow policy options to be explored and breakthroughs to
emerge. To support such a process, constant dialogue between the Government and the Bank is
fundamental and is best facilitated by a strong field presence across a wide range of sectors which views
policy discussions as a natural part of ongoing support.

Prior actions should incorporate flexibility to reflect current circumstances and the policy impact on
program objectives needs to remain clear, robust and monitored. The IDPL series was effective at
identifying and targeting key policy areas in infrastructure but less so at achieving desired outcomes.
Public sector programs at the national and sub-national level maintained strong and consistent momentum
in all areas apart from electricity. Specific objectives of some components were not well understood,
allowing the reform path to take diversions with little impact achieved. Still, the program maintained the
original objectives without adjustment in content or documentation, leaving the program actions
independent of clear sector strategy and distant from program objectives.

To ensure that program objectives remain robust, the results framework should link performance
indicators to development objectives rather than to policy areas specified to achieve the objectives. In
the IDPL, the 14 performance indicators were aligned with the 12-14 policy areas, rather than the three
development objectives. As policy actions change over the life of the program in order to further constant
and robust development objectives, if indicators focus on the policy actions, the linkage between
development objective and a specific measurable outcome is broken.

Within an appropriate and well defined strategic framework, a focused tactical design is important to
achieve the attention and intensity of reform needed to have an impact. The broad based framework of
IDPL‟s design was selected in favor of the alternative of going deeper into a few specific areas with
higher demands on outcomes and impact. The number of different policy areas (12-14) ended up perhaps
too high for the type of intensive policy implementation required to achieve concrete outcomes. A broad
based design kept the performance targets relatively conservative and therefore lacked the driver for
reform as would be the case with a higher bar on performance.

Policy based operations provide an important instrument to convene policy makers, policy
implementers, donors and others stakeholders for ongoing dialogue on sector issues. Across the board,
and particularly in the areas of PPP, the water sector, and land acquisition, the convening power of the
program was important to integrate related programs and foster peer learning among unrelated activities.
The land working group successfully brought a complex land acquisition law to Parliament through an
“action plan? developed by the inter-ministerial working group (as part of IDPL). Cross-fertilization
across sectors took place in the case of Output Based Aid (OBA). The water sector‟s success
demonstrated to the road sector how OBA could be applied to road maintenance.

Strong Government ownership of the Results Framework and the M&E system is needed. The M&E
system for IDPL lacked in places, quantitative indicators, baseline data, strong targets and a system for
monitoring and recalibration of variables. For the system to be a useful management tool for Government,
it is important for outcomes to be monitored and attributed to design and implementation issues, so that
the latter can receive attention. For this to occur, integration of the M&E framework with the Results
Framework is needed so (i) objectives are explicitly stated, (ii) associated outcomes are targeted with
numerical indicators, (iii) policy actions are specified which will credibly influence the targeted
indicators, and (iv) on-going calibration of policy changes, external changes and targeted indicators are
carried out as part of Government functions to support implementation of a multi-year, multi-sector
program of the complexity of the IDPL series.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1. Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Borrower provided two inputs: a Borrower‟s report and comments on the draft ICR. The Borrower‟s
Report (Annex 2) is of high quality, comprehensive, and represents a credible and significant input to the
ICR. Insight on lessons learned and the attention to the results framework, demonstrates sophistication
and understanding by the Government in overseeing the program‟s linkages. Other findings include

       Overall, the program exceeded modest targets as reform momentum accelerated during the
        program’s four years. Important challenges ahead cited in the report included (i) the road
        maintenance fund, (ii) legal, institutional and incentive framework for PPP transactions, and (iii)
        scope in addressing PSO issues in energy.

       The IDPL’s role was catalytic in maintaining reform momentum and helped to (i) strengthen
        institutional capacity, (ii) bring in best practices from international experience, and (iii) promote
        ownership by government through frequent interaction.

       Lessons include that (i) flexibility allows reforms to accelerate where government will is
        strongest, (ii) to attract the private sector, government must adopt performance based incentives,
        (iii) strong efforts to communicate government intentions is needed beyond upper management,
        (iv) a need for central monitoring of IDPL outcomes, and (v) specific issues on M&E systems.

       Citing issues associated with the sustainability of the IDPL supported reform program, the
        report discussed (i) the importance of reform momentum, (ii) the relevance of maintaining
        aligned policy objectives, and (iii) the need to design and ensure follow-on of future operations.
        Infrastructure master planning has been taken up to further the “Connectivity? agenda.

The comments on the ICR provided updates on the status of PPP regulation and transactions, noting that
the regulatory framework is are now being adjusted to release “bottlenecks? in PPP transactions. In
addition, the Borrower pointed out that although only one transaction has proceeded, it has given political
confidence which will enable more to follow. The Borrower also emphasized and clarified how the new
land acquisition law has gone beyond the original regulatory framework envisioned under the IDPL.

The points raised by the Borrower, both within the Borrowers Report and through the comments to the
draft ICR, are in accordance with the perspective and assessment taken by the ICR. The comments of the
Borrower have therefore been fully incorporated and the Bank has no comment on issues raised.

7.2. Co-financiers

Comments from ADB

ADB‟s comments on the ICR for the IDPL series focused on descriptive and process aspects for IIFF and
IGF dimensions of the operation. (Annex 3). Therefore, given the close partnership, the Bank‟s view is in
accordance with ADB‟s and there is no further Bank comment on issues raised by ADB.

Comments from JICA

No issues were raised by JICA.

                                     SUMMARY


I.      INTRODUCTION

1. The Government of Indonesia had long been recognizing the urgent need to build and rebuild its
economic infrastructure to support and sustain its economic growth. Indonesia started early in its
efforts to involve private sectors in its infrastructure development. In 1991, government with the
assistance of the World Bank initiated a program to enhance planning and implementation of
infrastructure development activities, including private sector participation in infrastructure provision.27

2. The involvement of the World Bank in promoting Public Private Partnership (PPP) in Indonesia
infrastructure continued with the provision of another technical assistance loan.28 In 2003, the World
Bank provided a TA Loan with the objectives in assisting government of Indonesia in developing and
implementing the policy and regulatory reforms and builds the institutional and social foundations
needed to enable, promote, and facilitate efficient and sustainable large-scale private investment in
infrastructure. The follow-up government policy actions that had been made after the loan closing,
including the infrastructure policy package, the issuance of Perpres 67/2005, and PPP networks, were
primarily derived from the loan performance indicators.

3. In an unprecedented move, government launched an Infrastructure Summit on January 17-18, 2005
in Jakarta. The Summit was considered very successful in sending strong message international
community and global investors of the will of government to accelerate infrastructure development.
Timed to coincide with the first 100 days of the new administration, the 2005 Summit was held to also
discuss strategies and policies to improve infrastructure provision and services for the public, to
prioritize reforms to facilitate infrastructure development, to demonstrate the government’s increased
commitment to create a healthy environment for public-private partnerships, to communicate the
Government’s strategy, and to launch short-term initiatives and future plans for infrastructure service
delivery. In the Summit, Indonesia officially offered private sectors to invest on US$ 22.5 billion
infrastructure projects.

4. After several initiatives to bring infrastructure to the attention of policy mainstream, on February
17, 2006, CMEA took the initiative to consolidate thoughts that had been emerged into a consolidated
policy actions called the Infrastructure Policy Package-2006 The package contains 153 policy actions to
be finished by the end of 2006, consists of 33 cross-sector actions, 83 sector actions, 5 actions related
with local governments, and 32 project transactions.

5. To attract private investment in a large scale would need changes in many fronts of infrastructure
provision. It was thought at the time of Infrastructure Policy Package -2006 initiation that infrastructure
policy reforms should at least contain three components: (i) promoting competition in infrastructure

8, 1991.

provision by eliminating public monopoly, (ii) curbing the barriers for private sector to enter into
infrastructure business; and (iii) reposition of the roles of government and separation of regulator and
operator. The three components were then transformed into four policy frameworks:

       Legal and regulatory reforms
       Sector and corporate reforms for competition and to reduce monopoly rights
       Separation of dual function between regulator and operator
       Sectors’ “independent? regulatory bodies.

6. Policy reforms continued after the Infrastructure Policy Package -2006. It started with the issuance
of MoF Decree No. 38/PMK.01/2006 on May 19, 2006. The decree set a standard procedure of risk
management of infrastructure provision by private sector. Although it took more than a year from the
Summit’s MoF speech, the decree has nevertheless remarkably changed the perception of MoF towards
government support and risk sharing of private investment in infrastructure. The decree also established
a Risk Management Unit (RMU) within MoF office. Following this, a series of legal reforms took place to
begin the implementation of the four policy frameworks described above.


II. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
2. 1. Objectives and Design

7. The series of Infrastructure Development Program Loans (IDPLs) was built on the basis of “Letter of
Development Policy? (LDP), an official letter from the GOI, to the President of the World Bank. The IDPLs
recognize the Government’s reform progress which serves as the basis for infrastructure reform
dialogue between the Bank and the Government. Since its inception the IDPLs has aimed to address the
inadequacy of Indonesia’s Infrastructure through:

       Sustained budget allocations to infrastructure-related ministries
       Improved targeting of electricity subsidies
       Improved a legal and regulatory framework for improved electricity pricing
       Better expenditure planning and management for the expansion and maintenance of road
        sector (both for national and local responsibility)
       A Restructuring program for financially unviable Public Water Utilities (PDAMs), and
        performance based support for financially viable PDAMs
       Establishment and en-activation of the regulatory and institutional framework for Public Private
        Partnership (PPP) transaction
       An Improved legal and regulatory framework for land acquisition
       Strengthened efficiency and transparency in environmental management, public procurement,
        and internal audit

8. IDPL is designed as a series of four consecutive multiyear Development Policy Loans which
constitutes IDPL I-IV since FY 2006 to FY 2010. The IDPLs policy matrix covers subset of the
Government’s broader reform agenda. Policy actions or triggers were designed to maximize: (i) reforms
that are seen as key priorities; (ii) linkage to fiscal management; (iii) potential for near term impact; and
(iv) locking-in and providing support to important reforms. In line with an overall IDPL objectives and
Policy Matrix, 13 Indicators and consequently their Outcomes were set as triggers that should be met
along the course of policy implementation 2007 to 2010 using the baseline of the year 2005/2006.


                                                      33
2. 2. Implementation and Operational Experience

9. The first phase of the World Bank’s IDPL was proposed to the government on October 31, 2007,
almost a year after the implementation of IPP-2006 was wrapped-up. Most cross-sector policy changes
and sector policy actions under the IPP-2006 had been achieved by then. IDPL-1 did not seem to use the
achievement of IPP-2006; instead Inpres 6/2007 was referred to as a basis for deriving its policy matrix.
Although efforts were done to correlate the government’s 2007 policy actions with the IDPL’s policy
matrix, there was still no apparent direct relationship between the two matrices. IDPL’s policy actions
seem to explain one or two cases of the objectives sought and did not provide an overall perspective or
achievement of the objectives. Although in theory the achievements of government’s policy actions
would have some influences on the achievement of policy actions derived in the IDPL-1, their
relationship in terms of policy enhancement leading to its implementation is rather unclear.

10. In the second and third IDPL’s objective of sub-national infrastructure, there exist some close
correlations with government policy matrix. In particularly, in the third IDPL’s objective of the
establishment of a fiscally sound, credible, and transparent PPP framework, it appears that many
triggers have been accomplished and would have been achieved in 2010. But apart from the
accomplishment and the facts that many pieces of policy initiatives and new regulations have already in
place, it is, however, necessary to recognize the anatomy why the current PPP framework has so far not
been so successful in project delivery and transaction.
2. 3. Lessons Learned

11. Changing the policy and regulation frameworks has always been a tedious and cumbersome task,
even for country like Indonesia with high consciousness of infrastructure reforms. Previously, imposing
legal and regulatory reforms as conditionalities for program loans worked reasonably well as
government was politically strong and there were no political alternatives. Under current political
circumstances it is predicted that policy and legal reforms would have to undergo a scrutiny from the
society and government has to be very smart to justify the changes.

12. Ideally a country must reform its legal and regulatory frameworks without any influence from
external sources. International institutions such as the World Bank could still play a catalytic role,
especially when it comes to increase the capacity of the institutions and to educate the bureaucracy in
such a way that they can realize the advantages of reforms and to understand the best practices of
international affairs. It is also important to enhance the ownership of reform programs in the part of
government high ranking officials. One of the most important things to do is to provide an academically
sound justification and politically smart programs for the changes, especially when it has a very strong
relationship with the daily life of the people.

III. THE OUTCOMES
3.1. National Infrastructure

    Indicator 1: In 2010 Capital Expenditure on the National Infrastructure increased by 25
    percent over 2006 level

13. Table 1 shows national capital expenditure for infrastructure sectors for fiscal years 2005-2010.

    Indicator 2: Increase from 44 to 70 percent the proportion of the PLN Public Service Obligation
    (PSO)/subsidy received by residential consumers of 900 VA or less

14. In 2006 residential consumers with connections of less than 900 VA received 41 percent of the PLN
subsidy. In 2007, 2008, and 2009 the proportion was reported at 43.6, 41.0, and 41.6 percent
respectively. However, with the introduction of the new tariff schedule (Permen ESDM No. 7/2010)
dated October 4, 2010, the Government took strong positive steps towards reducing and better
targeting of PSO subsidies to lower income households Allocations of the Government Subsidies of
2009, 2010 was decreased as plan to IDR 53,72 Trillion, and IDR 51,10 Trillion, respectively. However,
allocation subsidies for residential customers for 450 VA-900 VA of 2009 compared the allocated
subsidies of 2010 was dramatically increased (IDR 22.35 to 35.692 Trillion).

    Indicator 3: 84 percent of national roads in good/fair condition by 2010 and increase in
    national lane km a result of new road construction by 1000 lane-km between 2007-2010

15. In 2006, 81.6% of national roads were in good or fair condition, there were 76,590 national road
lane-km in 2006. For the planned 2010, 87% of national roads were in good condition with the total lane
of 93,094 km.
3.2. Sub-National Infrastructure

  Indicator 4: Increase APBD budget for infrastructure capital expenditures by 20% over 2005 level
  by 2010

16. For the 2006, APBD local and provincial budget on capital expenditure was IDR 23 trillion, and
increased by additional 130% at IDR 53 trillion in 2009. The current policies of sub national
infrastructure exceeded the original expectations at the time IDPL3 and met the prior actions of IDPL




                                                      35
  Indicator 5: US$ 300 million of new PDAM Investment since beginning 2007

17. In 2006, investment funding of PDAM was IDR 275 billions, and the investment was steadily
increased over 2007 to 2010 i.e., from IDR 579 billion to IDR 846 billions. There had been approximately
US$ 296 million in new PDAM investment.
3.3. Public Private Partnership

  Indicator 6: Public Private Partnership (PPP) transactions tendered in compliance with Perpres
  67/2005 attract at least responsive bids on average

18. No PPP transactions requiring Government Support were tendered in compliance with Perpres
67/2005 in 2006.

  Indicator 7: Financial close or termination by 2010, of all toll road concessions signed prior to
  August 17, 2007

19. In October 2007, more than 20 toll road concessions signed but not reached financial close. MOPW
issued Ministerial decree No.6/2010 on the continuation of the provision of toll road to resolve the
backlog.

  Indicator 8: Private Sector Financial commitments to private infrastructure projects increase to
  0.75 percent of GDP by 2010 (MOF)

20. In 2005 the private sector financial commitment to infrastructure project were estimated at 0.5
percent of the GDP. The Bank database indicated the financial commitment increased to 0.7% of GDP in
2006, and increased at 1.1% of the GDP in 2008. However, the figure was down-turning to 0.6% of the
GDP in 2009.
3.4. Land Acquisition, Environment, and Fiduciary Responsibilities

  Indicator 9: Collection of data on delays and level of compensation paid for land acquisition for
  all national road projects in 2009 and 2010 (MPW)

21. There was no baseline on how long delayed and how much and level of the Government spending
on land acquisition for all national road in 2006. It is acknowledge that the land acquisition has been a
main source of delays of infrastructure project even more for the PPP implementation.

  Indicator 10: Improvement in the quality of AMDALs and capacity to conduct AMDALs at
  national and local level.

22. The Ministry of Environment has been undertaking measures to improve the quality of AMDAL
review undertaken by the Local Government. In 2006 only 20 percent of total documents have been
evaluated was categorized as good document. The rest (80 percent) was identified as bad document. In
2007, Ministry of Environment attempted to revitalize AMDAL system in Indonesia due to poor
implementation mostly at local levels. In 2008, Ministry of Environment issued some Ministerial Decrees
to strengthen licensing system, AMDAL procedures, registration of consultants, and monitoring. System
improvements continued in 2010 with the issuance of several decrees.




                                                   36
   Indicator 11: Decline in the open-dump disposal of solid waste

23. Baseline data shows that only half of Indonesia is actually collected, up to fifth regularly disposed,
and only less than 2 percent is recycled and composted. About 85% of small cities and more than 50%
of medium cities dispose their waste in open dumping. By 2010, 7 (seven) Regional Landfills are now at
the stage of operation seven are in the stage of preparation for construction i.e., three are still on the
stage of planning. The Government has been revitalizing the existing landfill in 70 kabupaten and Kota
and been hand in hand with communities in 227 pilot project locations in promoting 3 R (reduce reuse
recycle) and composting the waste generated.

   Indicator 12: 80 percent of construction/works contracts funded by APBN are awarded within
   45 days of bid opening

24. Baseline in 2006 concluded that few if any construction/works contracts funded by APBN were
awarded within 45 days of bid. In 2009/2010, 45.7 percent (2,495 of 5,463) of construction/works
contracts of APBN were awarded with 45 days of bid opening. Data as of August 2, 2010, 74.7% of all
submitted contracts to the MPW for national level procurement had been done via? semi e-
procurement and semi e-procurement plus in 10 provinces.

  Indicator 13: Production by MPW Inspector General of effective internal audit reports, including
  identification of weakness in control systems, recommendations to management for
  improvement and sanctions, and timely implementation of such recommendations

25. Baseline informed that Inspectorate General Audit Report was lacking of recommendations on
systematic weaknesses in control systems, and focus instead on recording individual lapses or failures.
The launch of Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA) in 2010 by MPW in 12 provinces is considered as most
critical reform of internal audit process which is focusing to introduce a modern risk-based auditing, and
(ii) enhancing training program of auditors. The IDPL4 targeted 9 provinces implemented RBIA with a list
of training programs and names of participants, has been accepted.

IV. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
4.1. Preparation

26. As Table 2 shows, infrastructure sectors have reformed their legal and regulatory frameworks.
Infrastructure laws have changed and all new laws have actually dismantled state monopoly from the
provision of Indonesia infrastructure and mandated the creation of open market and access for
private participation. Some of the Government Regulations (GR), as the elucidation of the laws, has
been issued; some others remain in the making. Four infrastructure laws had been issued prior to
IDPLs program were introduced. Five laws were issued during the course of IDPLs implementation
period, 2007 to 2009. The IDPLs have to some extent contributed to the changes. These had paved
the way for the inclusion of private investment in the provision of Indonesia infrastructure.

27. But Government recognizes the need for further reforms in infrastructure. While legal changes
are very necessary for reforms, they are, however, not sufficient for rapid involvement of private
sectors in the development of infrastructure. Government used IDPLs’ triggers and indicators to help
accelerate some policy changes. But government’s effort went further than just policy actions
triggered by IDPLs. Until 2010 government have gained significant achievements in several lines,
including the establishment of Indonesia Guarantee Fund (IGF) and Investment Fund (PT SMI).

28. Project Preparations for the series of IDPLs were completed in 2006. The Coordinating Ministry of
Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Bappenas, Ministry of the Environment, PLN, and PDAMs had put
lots of input and efforts in monitoring and evaluating program readiness. However, government noted
that a central monitoring system at the national level for IDPL implementation should have been
established and strengthened.
4.2. Implementation

29. Chapter 3 describes the outcomes of the IDPLs which also represents the performance of the
government as the borrower. Overall, the implementation of four-year IDPL series over 2007-2010 by
the Government, has been considered satisfactory. The GOI’s infrastructure program implementation as
reflected in achievement of agreed indicators (i.e., in roads, power, water sectors, in e-procurement and
internal audit system) have resulted in a satisfactory IDPL series policy implementation. However some
policy areas have not been taken with an adequate monitoring and evaluation, such as AMDAL
improvement quality and final solid waste handling. Government also noted that implementation of PPP
project transaction and land acquisition policy change has been slow. Despite slowness in several
outcomes, progress in policy and regulation changes to date related to infrastructure PPP programs.
Although the policy and regulatory changes are not directly associated to the IDPLs, they have
nevertheless been undertaken in the same spirit.
4.3. Lessons Learned

30. The lessons learned of the IDPL series design and implementation over the past four years to GOI
have been succeed in establishing of conducive policy dialogue and collaboration with the Bank in
advancing new ideas with key policy makers to maintain a right momentum in reforming and
accelerating infrastructure programs. In support of the vital nature of the program ownership, the IDPL
series since its inception in 2006 was flexible within GOI framework, allowed reforms in accelerating the
programs as the Government more committed. On balance, the program has taken stronger than
expected steps in its final year laying the basis continued progress toward the reform outcomes for
years to come. In the end, the program exceeded the relatively modest expectations established at the
outset of IDPL series. The IDPL program has been therefore helped ensuring the GOI ownership through
strong dialogue, broad engagement, and a client driven program.

V.      BANK PERFORMANCE
5.1. Preparation

31. During the IDPL Preparation, The World Bank, the ADB, and The Government of Japan (GOJ) are all
supporting the GOI’s infrastructure development and reform programs. There was close coordination
among the three institutions. The ADB and the GOJ have separate but related policy loans, focused on
the large subset of the GOI’ reform programs. The reforms being recognized by the World Bank’s IDPL
Series, focused on areas of high priority of the Government, and where the Bank is closely involved in
dialogue. Bank Involvement in the project preparation to support GOI especially in the transport sector
and PPP scheme development was so intensive in accelerating; however, bigger role of Bank in sea
transport and shipping project preparation is needed.
5.2. Implementation

32. The Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) 3 Implementation supported by
the ADB and GOJ was coincided with the World Bank’s IDPL 4 and had created a policy dialogue with the
Government particularly in the areas of cross-sectional reforms including institutional policy framework
and mobilization of long-term finance; sector specific reforms in road, ports, airports, railways,
electricity, water supply and sanitation; and facilitation of preparation and execution of structured PPP
transaction. Constant collaboration and dialogue between the Bank and Government was important in
fostering ownership and transformational change of infrastructure development program; not limited to
IDPL, but also on other engagement programs. In general, Bank performance during preparations and
implementation is highly appreciated and satisfactory.
5.3. Lesson Learned

33. The lessons learned of the IDPL series design and implementation over the past four years to GOI
have been succeed in establishing of conducive policy dialogue and collaboration with the Bank in
advancing new ideas with key policy makers to maintain a right momentum in reforming and
accelerating infrastructure programs. In support of the vital nature of the program ownership, the IDPL
series since its inception in 2006 was flexible within GOI framework, allowed reforms in accelerating the
programs as the Government more committed. On balance, the program has taken stronger than
expected steps in its final year laying the basis continued progress toward the reform outcomes for
years to come. In the end, the program exceeded the relatively modest expectations established at the
outset of IDPL series. The IDPL program has been therefore helped ensuring the GOI ownership through
strong dialogue, broad engagement, and a client driven program.

34. Past experiences provide a solid lesson to be learned. Any organization or institution totally or
heavily run by old-fashioned bureaucracy had not shown any significant achievement. PPP and PFI in
infrastructure projects require a lot of changes in regulation, institution, financing, and speed of
execution. Such undertakings can only be undertaken by a professional and legitimate institution.

35. While the political economy in the upper structure of government seems to have been solid and
strong, the knowledge, perception, understanding, and political will in the middle managers of
government and in the execution level towards PPP skills and best practice, however, have not been
strong enough to support the big PPP undertakings. Knowledge and understanding in the private
sectors, including in the banking and financial sectors, have also been weak. To prepare and regularly
update its PPP plans and blueprints, the planning functions and capacity of line ministries and local
government officials need to be strengthened in accordance with the gradual shift in the role of the
government from service provider to policy maker, planner, coordinator, and facilitator. Therefore it is


                                                   39
very important for government to launch a massive training and education programs to advance
understanding and knowledge to those engaging in infrastructure business and transactions, whether
government official, regulator, investors, bankers, players, and fund managers.

36. The government’s perception towards government support scheme had been varied from time to
time. As a result of bad experience in the past, government had never been in favor in providing
government guarantee to infrastructure projects. It was not until January 2005 when Minister of Finance
made a speech in the Infrastructure Summit saying government will consider providing support for
infrastructure investment by private sectors, improving the atmosphere of fiscal support to
infrastructure development. The establishment of PT SMI, PT PII, and IIFF proved the significant
progress government has made in providing support schemes to PPP projects.

37. Due to the lack of skills, knowledge, and experience in PPP project management and execution,
perception of line ministries had been slow and indecisive. But that was probably also because there
were not enough incentives for them to rapidly undertake PPP projects in their own agencies. The line
ministries had no dedicated fund to develop PPP projects and the use of their structured fund from
APBN is not in the favor of doing, simply because it will disturb their regular programs and budget. To
overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary for government to introduce fiscal strategies in which a
dedicated fund could be set aside on top of the sector development budget for line ministries to better
prepare and accelerate PPP projects.


VI.     POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS IN THE SECTOR
6.1     Future Perspectives

38. Indonesia has been projected to be a developed economy in the next one or two decades. To
sustain the economic growth, the country would need an efficient and integrated infrastructure
networks and services and to engage with private sector investment in infrastructure provision. If
infrastructure business is growing because of macroeconomic and fiscal stability supported by adequate
legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks, then not only government agencies but private sectors, as well
as other economic players will have to embark on a rather massive infrastructure development,
contracts, and transactions.
6.2     The National Connectivity

39. The Government of Indonesia is now working on the an integrated national master plan of
expansion and acceleration of economic development for 2011 -2025, which is driven by three pillars of
a stronger national connectivity, development of economic corridors, and mobilization of national
research and technology potentials. The master plan will serve as the basis for creating a road map to
improve domestic connectivity directly linked to the regional and global hubs. The implementation of
master plan if supported by enabling factors as well as ideal infrastructure services, and certainly,
attracting the private investments will boost the economic growth, create a huge job opportunities and
alleviate significantly the poverty. The Bank with the other lender are potential partners of GOI to take
in a part in further detailed formulation of master plan, doing pre band full feasibility studies and
completing prioritized project preparation, detailed design and implementation, and financing as a
continuation of the next IDPL and/or IRSDP series.

Annex 3: Comments of Co-financiers

Comments from ADB

ADB provided the following specific comments to the ICR:

ADB was invited and participated in the World Bank meetings in relation to PT. Indonesia
Infrastructure Finance Facility (IIFF). The collaboration between the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) and international donors: Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mb (DEG),
IFC, ADB and the World Bank led to the establishment of the IIFF with the objective of providing
long-term local financing for PPP infrastructure projects, and also preparing a pipeline of quality
bankable PPP projects to bring into the market.

The establishment of IGF, with assistance from the World Bank, is also recognized to provide and
enhance development and implementation of PPP infrastructure projects. As a result of such
initiatives, we are currently seeing a crowding in of local banks into the project financing of PPP
infrastructure projects, which should support the GOI‟s overarching objective of enhancing
infrastructure development.
