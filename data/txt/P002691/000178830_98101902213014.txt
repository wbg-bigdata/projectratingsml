CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
USED  IN THIS REPORT
From independence in 1961 until March 1973, the exchange
rate between the Tanzania Shilling and the US dollar was retained
at $1 = TSh 7.143. This is the exchange rate used throughout the
report. Since June 30, 1973, the Tanzania Shilling has been set
at a central rate of $1 = TSh 6.9, and the country has availed
itself of the margins of up to 2-1/4 percent.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMET' CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CC?4PANY PROJECT
1.   I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent
of US$ 6.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Development
Finance Company Project. The proceeds of the credit would be relent
to the Tanzania Investment Bank at 7-1/4 percent interest per year
on the outstanding balance plus a 3/4 of 1 percent commitment charge on all
amounts not yet withdrawn.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.   The last full Economic Report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was
followed by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) which was distributed
on December 11, 1972 and which was especially prepared for the East
African Consultative Group meeting on Tanzania of January 1973. An
agriculture/rural development sector mission visited Tanzania during
September/October 1973; its report is expected to be issued about
the middle of 1974. During 1974 we shall undertake a mission to study the
industrial and mining sectors as well as a basic economic mission.
3.   Tanzania celebrated its first decade of independence in December
1971. In the past 11 years gross national product increased in real
terms by some 65 percent to the present level of about $1.5 billion.
During the same period, life expectancy at birth increased from 35
to 41 years, infant mortality declined from 250 to 160 per thousand
live births, maternal mortality declined from 4.7 to 2.7 per thousand
deliveries, and the primary school enrollment rate increased from about
28 to 37 percent of the relevant age group. While this sample of
economic and social indicators shows that significant progress has
been made, it also gives some idea of the magnitude and difficulty
of the development task facing the country. For example, while GNP
grew at 4.7 percent per annum in real tenms during these years, these
gains were to a large extent offset by the growth of population,
with the result that per capita income increased at only 2.4 percent
per annum. Tanzania is one of the 25 least developed countries.
4.   Tanzania has a one party system which is embodied in the con-
stitution. The party, TANU, is a well-organized mass party and is
actively engaged at the grass roots in the promotion of popular in-



-2 -
volvement in the national development effort, and within the party
democratic principles are being strictly adthered to. In economic policy
making, the long-term objective of social equality prevails over economic
interests of minority groups; some progress towards reducing inequality
of income distribution within the category of employed workers has
been made, but large gaps continue to exist between urban and rural
standards of living.
Economic Performance and Resource Mobilization
5.   Tanzania's economic performance in recent years has been char-
acterized by high marginal savings, relatively low returns on investment,
and rapid institutional change. Marginal national savings were around
50 percent in 1970 and 1971 which represents an excellent savings
performance. The growth of production, however, has been modest in
most sectors, especially in agriculture. The combination of moderate
production growth rates, virtually stagnating exports and a very
ambitious investment program has led to severe pressure on resources.
This pressure has been partly alleviated by steadily increasing
external capital inflows and more recently by an improvement
in the country's terms of trade. Owing to the favorable current world
market prices for several of Tanzania's principal exports as well as
growing contributions for local project costs by foreign donors,
Tanzania's external reserves are presently at a level representing
about three months' imports.
6. In terms of foreign aid disbursements, the People's Republic of
China is presently Tanzania's principal donor, supplying about 75
percent of the net capital inflow in 1971. In terms of outstanding
loans and credits, however, the Bank Group is the largest creditor
to Tanzania followed by Sweden, Norway and the Soviet Union. Including
a notional one-third share of the debt of the East African Community
Corporations, the IBRD is presently carrying 9 percent of Tanzania's
outstanding external debt and IDA 13 percent; the IBRD share is expected
to rise to about 12 percent in the next five years, and the IDA share
to 16 percent. Most capital aid to Tanzania is made available on very
favorable financial terms, although about 50 percent of the total
is tied to procurement in the donor country. Supplier credits have
been kept to the minimum. In addition to seeking as favorable a
blend as possible and the minimum of tying, the Government has attempted
to secure donors' agreement to simplify the procedures associated
with the use of cormitted aid.  For example, Swedish assistance is
now given within the terms of a frame agreement, which allows the
Government to set its own priorities in the use of SIDA funds and
allows considerable flexibility in the switching of such finance
between the various projects and programs. The overall debt service
ratio was 9.7 percent in 1972 and is not expected to exceed 10 percent



-3-
before the end of this decade. Although Tanzania's reserves are
presently at an adequate level, in view of poor long-term market
prospects of Tanzania's main export crops, it was agreed at the
last meeting on Tanzania of the Consultative Group for East Africa
held in january 1973 that it was important that aid terms be kept as con-
cessional as possible so as not to overburden the balance of payments.
7.   Tanzania's high rate of investment during the last five years
has not been reflected in high growth in production -- at least not
as yet -- partly because there was a heavy bias towards social and
economic infrastructure with long gestation periods. A substantial
proportion of total investment has been undertaken to provide a viable
alternative outlet to the sea to neighboring landlocked Zambia after
Southern Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence of 1965.
Economic and political ties between Zambia and Tansania are growing
stronger every year. As a consequence of the lower than expected
growth rate, the Government has decided to shift its investment
emphasis to more productive quick yielding investments, particularly
those which generate increased export earnings. The effects of these
new policies can already be seen in the rural sector and in the Bank
Group s own lending program.
8.   The budgetary position which has been adversely affected by
sluggish economic growth in recent years coupled with high levels
of development and recurrent expenditure, remains extremely tight.
The Government does not have many remaining possibilities to increase
revenues. In view of the already high marginal savings rate, the
scope for additional taxation is very limited. Even with an expected
decline in the rate of investment, Tanzania will still require a
continued capital inflow in excess of the foreign exchange component
of high priority projects if it is to achieve its development targets;
financing of local expenditures will therefore be justified.
9. Financial discipline in the regions, Central Government Ministries,
and many state corporations remains a problem, probably because
scarce accounting and auditing skills are now even more thinly spread.
There is a general serious shortage of many professional skills.
The situation has been aggravated by the departure of many Asians and
the Government's reluctance to recruit abroad. However, this reluctance
is now diminishing as part of an effort to accelerate project pre-
paration and implementation.
10. President Nyerere recently announced that following a review,
the Government has decided to move the capital of Tanzania from Dar
es Salaam to Dodoma. By moving the capital city to the center of the
country and so closer to the bulk of the rural population, it is the
expectation that the Government will become more responsive to the



needs of the rural sector. The Government presently plans to make
the move over a ten year period. No accurate estimates of the total
co3ts involved are yet available but in view of the scarcity of
investment resources in Tanzania, it is likely that the transfer
of the capital will take much longer than planned; in addition, the
number of Government offices moved may be fewer than is presently
envisaged.
11. The administrative structure and many of the functions of Govern-
ment were decentralized to the regions in July 1972. This was done
to make the Government more responsive to the needs of rural develop-
ment. It is still far too early to assess the success or otherwise
of the decentralization of Government in Tanzania. As expected, problems
of coordination between the center and the regions have occurred,
and the tram fer of high-ranking officials from Dar es Salaam to
the rural areas has had its inevitable, but one hopes only short-
term, effect on the smooth functioning of Central Government. Some
dislocation in project implementation has also been experienced.
In some regions the new Government structure is already showing its
potential to be more responsive and relevant to the needs of the
rural sector. Several rural development programs are now being
prepared in the regions and Bank Group finance is being sought for
some of them. It has become apparent that the severe shortage of
regional technical expertise will inhibit the ability of the new
decentralized authorities to plan and execute rural projects; progress
in regional development will, therefore, inevitably be patchy,
reflecting the local availability of the required expertise. Ways
in which the Bank Group and other donors might assist in alleviating
these constraints are currently being explored with the Government.
Expropriations
12. In April 1971 legislation (The Acquisition of Buildings Act)
was enacted empowering the President on behalf of the state to acquire
any rental or commercial property the construction cost of which
was ove- 100,000 Tanzanian Shillings ($14,000). About 3,000 properties
were acquired under the Act. About 560 claims, including less than
10 percent on behalf of foreign owners, were lodged in respect of the
actual acquisition itself or on the amrunt of compensation. These
claims, including the foreign cases, have either been settled or are
in the process of being settled in accordance with the provisions
of the Act. The Government has recently expropriated about 50 large
scale farms in the Moshi-Arusha area of northern Tanzania. The
Government is presently making an assessment of the value of these
properties and negotiations on compensation are expected to commence
soon.



PART II - BANK GROUP IENDING TO TANZANIA
1.,. Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962. Beginning with
an IDA credit for education in 1963, it has so far received 14 credits
and three Bank loans amounting to $266.1 million. In addition,
Tanzania has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totalling $229.8 million
which have been extended for the development of common services operated
on a regional basis by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their as-
sociation in the East African Community. The only IFn investments
in Tanzania to date, totalling $4.4 million, were made in the Kilombero
Sugar Company in 1960 and 1964. In 1969, IFC and other investors
sold their interest in the Company to the Government. Annex II contains
summary statements of Bank Loans, IDA Credits and IFC Investments in
Tanzania and the East African Community Organizations as of October
31, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14. Our lending program, reflecting the emphasis the Tanzanian
Government attaches to agricultural development is increasingly
focusing on directly productive activities in the rural sector.
Up to the end of FY72, 10 out of 14 loans and credits have been
made for infrastructure. All but one of the loans to the East African
Community Organizations, of which Tanzania is a beneficiary and co-
guarantor, had been extended for improvements in transportation
and communications. However, the approval by the Executive Directors
of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project (Credit No. 217 TA) in October
1970 opened a new phase in our lending for such directly productive
activities. The Smallholder Tea Development Project (Credit No. 287
TA) was approved in March 1972. A Second Livestock Project (Credit
No. 382 TA) was approved early in April 1973. A recently approved
project constitutes the beginning of a major effort to expand cotton
production. A project to expand cashew nut production and processing
and a proposed rural development project were appraised in October
1973. A sugar project was also appraised in December 1973. Preparations
of a proposed dairy project and a second rural development project
are underway.
15. Our Regional Mission in Eastern Africa was involved in the
preparation of six of the above projects. Our capacity to provide
such assistance has proved to be particularly valuable in a country
where project preparation capacity is, and for some time will be,
limited. Tanzania is developing an institutional structure, stressing
greater regionalization and development of ujamaa villages, designed
to promote and respond to development initiatives. These institutions
are still in their formative stages, and related organizational and
staffing difficulties have sometimes resulted in the project delays
referred to in Annex II. In recent months Bank Group staff have held
intensive discussions with the Government on ways in which these



implementation bottlenecks can be alleviated. As part of this exercise,
a procurement and disbursement workshop was organized in Dar es Salaam
in late August 1973 for the relevant Tanzanian staff engaged on Bank
Group projects. In addition, the Government has recently instituted
a high level monthly review for all externally aided projects. As
a result of these efforts, it is expected that project implementation
should now improve.
16. Tanzania's education and training programs are expected to
solve the manpower problem in the longer run, but meanwhile there
will continue to be a need for technical assistance in planning and
implementation iI the difficulties in executing projects are to be
overcome. We are exploring with the Government how assistance of
this kind can be strengthened and best fitted to Tanzania. Through
participation in their projects we have supported Tanzania's new
development institutions at an early stage. Our supervision of
the projects has resulted in bringing to light, earlier than might
have happened otherwise, that some of these institutions are facing
significant difficulty in executing all the projects they have under-
taken. Because of our involvement we have been able to help the
Government in its consideration of how to overcome this problem
whose solution is fundmnental to rapid development.
17. Projects outside the agricultural sector which are expected to
be ready for consideration within the next six months or so include
a highway maintenance project and an urban site-and-services project,
both of which have recently been appraised. The latter project
would, if approved, represent our first direct inrolvement in the
urban sector. The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's first
lending to Tanzania's industrial sector.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
18. The manufacturing sector in Tanzania accounts for only 10
percent of GNP but is increasing in importance. Industrial output
increased by 8 percent per year during 1968-1970, and will probably
grow more rapidly in the future because of increased investments in
the sector. Industrial investments increased from TSh 150 million
(15 percent of total investments) in 1966 to TSh 314 million (18 per-
cent of total investments) in 1970.
19. Following the Arusha Declaration in 1967, the Government national-
ized many industrial enterprises. Most industrial capacity is now in
the public sector, but the contribution of private finms remains sig-
nificant, and although precise figures are not available, rough
estimates attribute about one-third of industrial investment and output



-7-
to the private sector. Government leaders have indicated that
Tanzania plans to retain a flexible, pragmatic approach to private
investment. The Government in l965 established the National Development
Corporation (NDC) to promote and imolement public investment in
industry, agricultural processing, and tourism. After the Arusha
Declaration, nationalized industrial enterprises were regrouped in the
National Development Corporation. Subsequently, in 1970 and 1971 the
Government split several state corporations from NDC including those
dealing with agricultural processing, tourism, and woodworking
industries. These have been grouped into holding companies which
manage existing enterprises and promote new projects through equity
investments in their respective sectors. Lack of funds has increased
the dependence of these corporations on budget allocations for invest-
ment in new projects. Such budget allocations must be approved by
the ministry concerned, then by the Ministry of Finance and the
I/inistry of Development Planning and Economic Affairs, and ultimately
by the Economic Committee of the Cabinet.
20. The state corporations also need technical and managerial manpower
to appraise and manage projects, and most such enterprises depend
significantly on expatriate personnel. To reduce this dependence the
Government has strengthened efforts to train Tanzanians. A major com-
ponent to this effort has been an accelerated program at the Institute
for Finance Management to train managers. Many state corporations
have had financial difficulties. In 1971, 15 of the 33 subsidiary
and associated companies of the NDC incurred losses, and several others
had only marginal profits. Many industries suffered disruptions
in their markets or in receiving raw materials and spare parts through
import difficulties often attributed to problems within the State
Trading Corporation (STC). Recent decentralization and specialization
of the STC may improve supplies.
21. The manufacturing sector is dominated by a few large firms. In
1971, more than two-thirds of the total assets of NDC's subsidiary and
associated companies in this sector belonged to only seven firms:
a fertilizer plant, two textile factories, a tire factory, a cement
factory, a cigarette factory, and a brewery. In contrast to the smaller
firms, the large ones are quite capital intensive and profitable.
Manufacturing activity is concentrated along the northeastern sea-
board (the Dar es Salaam and Tanga regions), in the north (near Arusha
and Moshi), and on the shore of Lake Victoria, with Dar es Salaam being
the most important center. Most of the obvious import substitute
sectors have already been entered, and three-fifths of total consumer
demand for manufactured goods is met by Tanzanian production, as com-
pared with one-fifth at independence in 1961.



22. Although the Tanzanian Government's first priority is rural and
agricultural development, the industrial and agricultural sectors are
seen as being integrally related and increasing stress is being placed on
industry, especially the processing of agricultural products. The
Government is developing a more comprehensive industrial strategy. Given
the general policy to stimulate public sector investments, encouragement
to private investors is limited. There a-re, however, a number of
incentives to industrial investment, including an allowance of 120 percent
depreciation on investments, rebate of sales tax paid on exported goods,
and refunds or remission of duties on imported goods. The East African
Community's external tariff provides protection which may be supplemented
by transfer taxes on imports from the Partner States, import licensing,
and moratoria on licensing competitive production.
23. The prospects for growth in the industrial sector during the
next five to ten years are strongest in the local processing of agricultural
products for both export and domestic consumption. Substantial ad-
ditional investment is envisaged for textile and garment industries,
tanneries, a shoe factory (processing both leather and canvas), breweries,
wood processing, rope and twine factories, fish processing, and cashew
processing. An ambitious nationwide industrial extension service is
being established with a view to assisting in the planning and management
of small industries. A team of the Harvard Development Advisory
Services is now studying industries in which Tanzania would have a
comparative advantage; their work will be used in setting industrial
priorities in the next five year plan. Some possibilities appear
attractive in small scale industry and mineral extractions. We shall
know more about these sectors after an industrial mission completes
its work towards the end of FY 74.
24. Tanzania has several institutions providing finance for industry
in addition to TIB, the recipient of the proposed credit. The Tanganyika
Development Finance Company, Ltd. (TDFL) was established in 1962
and is owned in equal shares by the Government and British, German and
Dutch aid agencies. It has a capital of TSh 40 million, provides
loans and equity for projects in industry, agricultural processing
and tourism, and has recently changed its policy of financing only
private enterprise. TDFL is restricted to projects with total assets
oV less than TSh 4 million, and its operations amount to about TSh 10
million per year. Industrial investments can also be financed by the
East African Development Bank (EADB), created in 1967, which has a
loan from the World Bank. EADB's charter excludes it from financing
tourism, transportation and agricultural projects. Its operations in
Tanzania have amounted to about TSh 15 million per year.



-9-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25. A Report entitled "Appraisal of the Tanzania Investment Bank"
(No. 283-TA) is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project
Summary is provided as Annex III. The purpose of the Credit is to
assist TIB to finance specific development projects through loans
and investments for productive enterprises in Tanzania.
26. The Tanzania Investment Bank was established in November 1970
to finance industrial, agricultural processing, tourism, and trans-
portation projects in both the private and public sectors. TIB's opera-
tions have increased rapidly, and TIB is now the major medi.um and
long-term financing institution in the country.
Capital Structure and Resources
27. TIB's authorized share capital is TSh 100 million of which
TSh 50 million has been paid in. TIB's equity also includes
accumulated reserves of some TSh 3 million. The Tanzanian Govern-
ment owns 60 percent of the share capital directly, 30 percent
through the National Bank of Commerce (NBC), the only commercial
bank in the country, and 10 percent through the National Insurance
Company, the only insurance company. NBC and NIC are entirely owned
by the Government. TIB's Board is nominated by the Government and
by the two minority shareholders. The present Board includes the
Managing Director, who is also the Chairman, the Principal Secretaries
of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Development Planning and
Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the
Chairman of the National Bank of Commerce, and the General Manager
of the National Insurance Company.
28. Foreign resources consist of TSh 49.5 million untied funds from
Canada, Sweden, and the African Development Bank, TSh 87.5 million
partly-tied funds from Canada, Denmark, and Finland, and TSh 313
million tied funds from Bulgaria, China, India, the Netherlands, and
the Soviet Union. TIB's local borrowing consists exclusively of a
loan from NBC to finance the medium and long-term loan portfolio
which NBC transferred to TIB upon its inception.
Management and Organization
29. TIB is managed by a full-time Managing Director and by a General
Manager. Mr. G. Nbowe, the Managing Director, joined TIB in 1972 from
the Treasury. Mr. C. Kahangi, General Manager, is a former Rxecutive
Director of the World Bank. The General Manager and the department



heads for a loan committee which must approve loan and investment
proposals before   they are presented to the Board. TIB has a good
staff at present; however, the contracts of two expatriate department
heads will expire within the next half year, and it is important that
TIB replace them with competent personnel. At the request of TIB,
Sweden has agreed to replace the outgoing Director of Operations
who is being financed under their technical assistance program.
Operating Policies
30. TIB can make loans, provide guarantees, and invest in equity
provided it does not take a controlling interest in a client. The
Government's policy has been to accord state corporations the primary
role of promoting and managing investments through equity financing while
TIB is expected to provide an independent check on these investments
through loan financing. TIB's activities consist of "ordinary"
operations on which it carries the credit risk and "special" operations
administered on behalf of the Government. All TIB financed projects
must be economically sound, technically feasible, and if financed at
TIB's own risk, financially viable. TIB has agreed that total commit-
ment in any single project or enterprise shall not normally exceed
20 percent of its net worth. TIB can, at its own risk, provide no
more than 75 percent of an enterprise's total long-term financing and
will normally not provide more than 60 percent. The maximum term of a
loan or guarantee is 15 years. Under the TIB Act as it stands, TIB
can invest no more in equities than 10 percent of its net worth, but
in order to increase its influence on the investment decisions of its
borrowers, the Government and TIB intend to raise substantially the
existing ceiling on equity investments. TIB is required to follow a
prudent policy in debt acquisition and will not incur debt in excess
of three times its net worth. TIB has agreed to apply a miniimum
lending rate at 9 percent for its ordinary operations.
31. TIB's Act requires that TIB be audited by the Tanzania Audit
Corporation (TAC), which is owned by the Government and has suffered
fram inadequate staff strength. TAC can sub-contract audits and will
be asked to do so for TIB if the 1973 audit does not meet normal
Bank standards. TIB's standard loan agreement with its clients is
satisfactory. TIB requires international tendering for all items
above TSh 100,000 (about $14,000); international tendering is waived
in a small number of cases if suitable goods and services are avail-
able locally. Disbursement procedures are adequate.



Operations and Portfolio
32. As of June 30, 1973 TIB had approved 33 loans and five equity
investments in 31 projects.  Loan approvals amount to TSh 95 million,
of which TSh 32 million is for local expenditure and TSh 63 million
(67 percent) for imports. These have included loans for the
processing of agricultural and other primary commodities, transporta-
tion, manufacturing and tourism. Loan size has averaged about TSh 2.8
million and about 80 percent of total lending has been made to the
public sector. As of June 30, 1973, TIB had committed TSh 50 million
and disbursed TSh 19 million. Only three loans had reached the
repayment stage, and none was in arrears. The five approved equity
investments amounted to TSh 4.6 million, of which TIB had committed
TSh 2.7 million and disbursed TSh 1.8 million. TIB's assets further
include a medium and long-term loan portfolio which was transferred
from NBC at TIBTs inception. The portfolio is entirely guaranteed
by NBC. As of March 31, 1973, the portfolio's value was TSh 73
million. TIB's profits after taxes (about 40 percent of taxable
income) amounted to 2.4 percent of net worth during FY 72 and 2.2
percent during FY 73. At June 30, 1973, accumulated reserves amounted
to about TSh 3 million. Profits as a percentage of average net worth
are projected to increase gradually to 5.1 percent after taxes (8.6
percent before taxes) in 1978. Total assets are forecast to grow at
30 percent per annum until FY 77 and at 15 percent per annum thereafter.
The debt/equity ratio will remain between 2.0 and 2.6 throughout the
1973/78 period. TIB's debt service capacity will be adequate; interest
and principal coverage wlll increase from 1.2 in 1974 to 3.2 in 1978.
Projected Operations and Resources Requirements
33. TIB anticipates that loan approvals will amount to TSh 50 million
during FY 74 and TSh 60 million per year thereafter. TIB expects that
about 70 percent of its new loans will be for imports, and that it
will finance 70 percent of the import component from untied credits.
TIB's present untied funds will cover commitments only until June 1974
and additional funds totalling TSh 63 million (US$9 million) will be
required to cover the import component of its commitments through
June 1976. TIB expects to obtain TSh 21 million untied funds from
bilateral sources. A $6 million (TSh 42 million) IDA credit is
recommended to cover TIB's remaining foreign resource requirements
until June 1976.
Terms of Proposed Credit
34. The proposed IDA credit would be onlent to TIB through a
subsidiary loan agreement on the normal terms and conditions for



- 12 -
lines of credit to development finance companies. TIB would pay the
Government 7-1/4 percent interest on the outstanding balance and a 3/4
of 1 percent commitment fee on amounts not withdrawn from the credit
account. TIB would repay the Government within 15 years according to
the composite of repayment schedules of its borrowers. TIB will pass
on the foreign exchange risk to its sub-borrowers. The Association
would require TIB to submit for prior approval each project using
$100,000 or more of the proposed credit and TIB could not use more
than $1 million in total without such prior approval.
PART V - LEGAL INbTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35. The draft Development Credit Agreement between the United Republic

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 2/
(As of December 31, 1973)
There are currently ten projects under execution.
AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Credit No. 132 TA - Beef Ranching Development Project: $1.3 Million
Credit of October 31, 1968; Closing Date December 31, 1973
Initial management difficulties were overcome by replacing
managers with more experienced staff. Drought ccnditions brought
high cattle mortality on one ranch. A problem of low fixed meat
prices was alleviated by substantial increases in 1972 and 1973.
The Project was almost completely disbursed by the Closing Date.
This Project demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an efficient
beef industry in Tanzania.
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Project: $9.0 Million Credit of October
9, 1970; Closing Date September 30, 1976
Project implementation remains disappointing.  There have been
some recent changes in the official attitude towards collective
production, and farmer recruitment should improve now that farmers
can cultivate tobacco on an individual as well as a collective basis.
Although the Tobacco Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture have
generally executed their project management responsibilities well,
a lack in nommunications between the Regions and the Central Government
Ministries had led to serious delays in implementation especially
in water development and research. The Project has been rephased and
the Authority is now expected to be responsible for all development
actions and not reliant on other agencies; consequently, coordination
should improve. The Project is being kept under careful review.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 Million Credit
of March 3, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1976
This Project has experienced a number of delays. Farmer re-
cruitment has been behind target partly because farmers are reluctant
to plant tea on a collective basis. The Tea Authority (TTA) is
planning to engage in some field development itself in order to absorb
the excess planting material. Meanwhile a full-scale review of the
Project, including the rephasing of the planting program, began in
mid-December 1973.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to
report any problems which are being encountered, and the actions
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense,
and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6
On both the Tobacco and Tea Projects, and to a lesser extent
some projects in other sectors, a lack of understanding of IDA procure-
ment and disbursement procedures by the various Project agencies
concerned has been the cause of considerable delays. A workshop on
procurement and disbursement procedures was held in Dar es Salaam
in late August 1973. Bank Group staff explained and discussed the
relevant procedures with the Tanzanian officials concerned. It is,
expected that procurement and disbursement difficulties in Tanzania
will now become less acute.
Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Development Project: $18.5
Million Credit of May 23, 1973; Closing Date December 31, 1979
The Credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973. The
Government has made good progress in recruiting the necessary staff
to implement this Project. Plans for the first phase of procurement
are presently being finalized. Implementation is on schedule.
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 715 TA - Kidatu Hydroelectric Project: $30.0 Million Loan
of December 14, 1970; Closing Date June 30, 1976
This Project has encountered major cost overruns. Original foreign
cost estimates were US $42.0 million to be financed under a Joint Financing
Agreement: a Bank Loan of US $30.0 million equivalent and a SIDA credit
of US $12.0 million. The latest total Project cost estimates exceed the
original (US $59.0 million) by about one-half. The two main factors
responsible for the overruns were (i) the unexpectedly high cost escalations
inside and outside Tanzania since appraisal in April 1970 and (ii) the
unexpected bad rock conditions encountered during excavation of the under-
ground facilities which make up the major part of the main civil engineering
works. CIDA of Canada has provided Canadian $13.0 million to cover the
major portion of the overruns, and discussions are currently taking place
between the Bank, the Government and SIDA with a view to covering the
residual (about $10.0 million). In spite of these cost overruns, the
Project still remains the most attractive alternative to other possible
development, including thermal, in the power sector. A timely supplementary
loan would be necessary to ensure the completion of the Project as
originally scheduled.
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Loan No. 586 TA - Second Highway Project: $7.0 Million Loan of
February 24i, 1969; Original Closing Date December 31, 1972; Revised
Closing Date June 30, 1974
Construction work on this Project has been completed, but outstanding
claims by contractors are substantial. The Government and the contractors
have been negotiating these various claims, and it is likely that the
remaining issues can still be resolved by the revised Closing Date.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6
Credit No. 265 TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 Million Credit
oj August 6, 1971; Closing Date December 31, 1974
After protracted delays, tenders for the improvement of the
Mtwara-Masasi Road have now been received, and the contract for
supervision of construction of this Road has been signed with con-
sultants. Consulting contracts have also recently been signed for
the supervision and management of work of two betterment units to
be established for the improvement of about 475 km of agricultural
feeder roads in the Geita district and Mara region; consultants'
proposals for the preinvestment studies to be financed under the
Project are now being evaluated and negotiations are in progress.
As a result of these developments, a rapid improvement in the pace
of project implementation is now anticipated. However, extension of
the Closing Date of the Credit will be necessary.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149 TA - Second Education ProJect: $5.0 Million Credit
on May 29, 1969; Original Closing Date December 31, 1973; Revised
Closing DaLe December 31, 1975
The Project is about 12-18 months behind its original schedule.
Delays in project implementation were in part attributed to shortages
of counterpart funds in FY72, lack of interest on the part of con-
tractors, and some shortcomings in project management. Progress
has improved recently. Most contracts have now been awarded, and
although it is not expected that lost time can be made up, all elements
of the Project should be completed in good order before the revised
Closing Date.
Credit No. 232 TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 Million Credit
of February 5, 1971; Closing Date June 30, 1975
Initial delays in the establishment of the Project Unit, in
defining building design procedures, and the more recent need for re-
tendering for civil works, have delayed the Project by 12-18 months.
Bids for the construction of all 13 Project institutions were received
in May 1973 resulting in the contract award for four institutions;
after high quotations and poor response, the remaining nine were re-
tendered. Although the new tenders were still higher than anticipated,
12 of the 13 contracts have now been awarded. Recruitment of educa-
tional specialists has not been successful and bilateral sources
are now being explored. It is likely that a 12-month extension of
the June 30, 1975 Closing Date will be required.



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 6
Credit No. 371 TA - Fourth Education Project: $10.3 Million Credit
of April 13, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Credit was declared effective July 2, 1973. The Project
Coordinator has been appointed, and technical assistance specialists
to assist in project implementation, provic&ed by the Danish Inter-
national Development Agency, are being recruited. The team is now
expected to arrive early in 1974., and some delays in designing project
components will inevitably result. Meanwhile, to mirimize delays
before the arrival of the specialists, the Government has agreed to
use other available specialists to design the community education
centers.
