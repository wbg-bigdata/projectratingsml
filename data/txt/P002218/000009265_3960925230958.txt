Sub-Sector                Roads
2.    Sector l)meloom    Obii. Ihe Government of Rwanda considered transport as an
impor    factor to economic growth. Its objectives were to: (a) improve interational transport
connectons; (b) upgrade the ma road network to facilitate the country's economic development and
its social and amin ive integration; (c) improve the road network In general through better
mainteance of existing roads; and (d) Improve transport services and lower transport rates i nural
arem.
3.    Policy contexL Among the above sectoral objectives, the Govemment had long emphasized
the paving of ntereglmal roads. However, it acknowledged that more aention needed to be given
to making optmal use of the existag road network and achieving the right balance between the
upgradig of main roads and that of district and feeder roads and, more generally, between upgrading
and maintenance
4.    Lnka  between proiect. sector and mo   olicy oblectives. Rwanda's road network had
reached a stage where its lengti was no longer a serious impediment to the county's economic and
social development However, the economy of a land-locked country like Rwanda depends heavily
on the trsportation costs of its imports and exports as well as on the reliability of sevea  access
coidors though neighboring countries. It was therefore critical to maintin the itaional road
axes though Rwanda, and especially the Northern axe to Uganda which atracted about 80% of the
inteaonl trffic. Loering   ort costs was also ciical in rural areas to foster agricultural

prduction.  Therefore, the Gov rent and IDA agreed to concentat their effrts on the
mainnce of the count's exsting road network.
S.    Pxiect Oeves.    he8 objectives of the Bank Group's inolvement in the highway sector
were to: (i) improve public expenditure policies in the highway sector by assisting Governm  to
develop appropriate road maintenan  and constuction pgrm; (ii) strengthen donor coordinaion
in the sector to ensure that high priority item  receive approprate extena  assistance; (iI) impro
road mnintenance and construction planning; (lv) strengthen the capcity of the Road Directorate (RD)
to admser the cnty's road network; and (v) improve road manteace operatios and thereby
reduce road transport costs.
6.                  e      The proJect consisted of the following component:
(a)    Routine maint ce of earth and paved roads and regaveiling of earth roads as part
of the mantenance progrm  by force account;
(b)   Manpower development as pat of the taining program;
(c)    Reconstruction of the Kigali-Gana Road, first and second sections (50 kin); this
road is part of the Norther access corridor and li    Kigali wilth theborder wlh
Uganda.
(d)   Improvement of the Soils Laboratory's capability;
(e)    Consulting Services for (i) the design and supervision of woks on the Kigall-Gatima
road (80 km)); (i) the preparation of specificadons and biddng documents for the
repair and rurfag    of the Cyangugu-Bugarama road (40 kn) and for the
reglling of the Rubengera-Ntendezi road (131 kin) and the Circult des Lacs (87
kn); and (-di) technicad aistce (TA) to help cary out the force account pr m
implement the trining program and strengthen the Sois Laboratory; and
(f)    Studies to prepare comple     sector actions on the following subjects: ()
maintenace of co     l roads;  ) traffic safety; and (iI) etrsport plang.
Projet 12esiga and OrgogA
7. Des2ln of the nroiect. The project had a clear conceptual foundation. It built on the
expeience gained through the five highway projects that IDA had previouly fianced in Rwada.
Tbose projects put the emphasis either on capacity building and maitenac or on recoucdon and
rehabilitation.  Tds one was a combination of those two approaches.  I  ca yuilding
component, mainenance componet. and reconstructionlrehabilcomponent ceary suppoted
ail Its objectives (see para. 5) except for the strengthening of donor cooordinatio How this latter
objective was to be met was not explained in the Staff Apprasal Report (SAR).
8.    The project was d6igned aong studard lines. The fi  g of theontctiof gthe
Kigali-Gatua road was shmxed among various donors: IDA financed the wods on section It of the



4
road whilo the works on section I were coflnanced by the Arab Fund for Economic Development in
Africa (BADEA) and IDA (Fifth Highway Project); the European Development Fund (EDF) took
over section m. Maintenance activities were catTied out by force account. TA services wer made
available to implement a training program and to help operate the force account activides.
9.    'ne SAR acknowledged that the RD's capability was probably too limited to successfWlly
organize the mantence by force account of Its whole road network. This problem could be
addressed either by raising the RD's capability through the financing of a heavy TA to help run the
force account brigades, or by easing the demand on RD's human resources tbrough the involvement
by the domestic private sector in road maintenance. The first solution was chosen rather thae 
second one. In retospect, the second solution may have yielded more susainable results.
10.          of _ the    The scope of the project was large given its objective of mainta_nn
the existng network. It was later assessed, at the time a subsequent project (Transport Sector
Project) was appraied and a Road Fund was established, that the equivalent of about half the
fancing provided by the project was necessary to fiane   maintnce of the network throuogh
prceeds from the Road Fund. The Government share In the finacing of the overall program,
Including other donor fcing, was 23%S (SAR).
11.   lE=Athd of         de g . The project was well prepared as regards recostruction of die
Kigal-Gatuna road. Since previous contuctionpjects In Rwanda had suffered from cost overrm,
much care was given to the economic evaluation of the Kigali-Gatuna road. A sensitivity analysis
was carried out for two critical variables: construction costs and inteaonal taffic. Ibis sensitiv
analysis, however, could not foresee that a civil war would flare up and divert all internaional traffic
from the road to two other main access corridors through Tanzania.
12.   Concerning force account activities, the SAR spelled out ovedy detailed perfonnac
Indicators which did not prove useful during Implementation because the RD was unable to provide
accurate management information to substantiate these indicators. The SAR should bave provided
for a few broad but realisdc indicators to assess force account performance through the project's
implementation.
13.   Consultants' services. Detailed Terms of Reference (TORs) for the sectoral studies on
communa roads and transport planning were included in the SAR. Detailed TORs for the traing
program were also included in the SAR, including usefil quantified targets. On the contay, TORs
for suppot to force account actities were not detailed enough, which may have  dto poor
capacity building. They failed to define adequately the roles and responsibilities of the TA team on
the one hand, and of the Adminisa    on the other. No specific provisions were made for the
taning of countrparts to the expate experts.
14.   Ya=ancsiimglemnenado. There were no significant variances between the desip of the
ptoject and its implementaton except for some reallocation of the credit proceeds.  First,
disbursement for civil works (section n of the Kigali-Gatta road) inceased by 15% (compared to
the Ii    amoun in SDR allocated to this category of disbursement) due to technical requireme_ n
(to lay an asphaltic layer instead of a double surface treatmen to provide for a longer life for the road
under the taffic conditions of that time) and to the paving of additional 8 km Cbretele de  ).

An amndment to Credit Agreement 1641-RW was signed on August 24, 1990, in order to add to
the financing of ivil works already provided by credit A8-RW. The share of redt 1641-RW
resources allocated to the financing of force account activities was decreased Accordingly. Second,
the disburements for consnltants' servi.es were increased by 136%, due to flnancial bids being
higher than expected and due to the conclusion of several amendments to the TA contas dring
poject imple aion (four to each of the two TA contracts). lhis increase of disbursements X*
consultants' services consumed 90% of the unallocated resources, although they were initly to
cover physical and price contingencies mainly for the civil works on the Kigali-Gatuna road and dhe
mainance activities by force account. lbird, an undisbursed amount of SDR 400,O DR va
allocated to the purchase of equipment to support maintenance activities tinder the subsequeat pject,
the Transport Sectr Project (see pars. 15).
15. 'he project took seven years for completion instead of the programmed five. Half of the
extension schedule was needed for the procurement of road mainan  equipments to be jointy
fianced by the project undisbursed balance and by proceeds from the subsequent project (Franspt
Sector Ptoject). The project disbursement performance was satisfictory overall.
16.   ELak. Two rsks were identifled in the SAR. First, maintece activities by force accout
could be hampered by managerial weaknesses and shortages of imported fuel and parts. This risk
was partly addressed by IDA's financing of TA services and imports of fuel and parts Te SAR
mentioned that contracting out periodic maitenance works would help to addes the issue of dto
limited capability of the RD. But it did not propose that IDA finance small maintenance wors by
private coators (SMEs). lI retrospect, it appeas that this risk was under-estimated Despite de
support from the TA team, the RD could not carry out the amount of work ially planned uud
dsbursements for force account acdvities tumed out to be less than expected (see para 14). A
second risk was the potntial    ruption of works on the road Kigali-Gatuna and cost overu
asociated with shortages of materias and fuel, as occurrd during prvious construction project in
Rwanda following disturbances in neighboring countries. This issue was addressed In the SAR by
allowing for larger stocks of materials and fuel in contract documents. Yet, the works suffered from
cost overruns which made it necessary to amend the credit agreement (see psa. 14).
17.   'Te SAR mentioned that there were difficulties in meeting the accouing and audtg
requirenents during implementation of the preceding Fifth Highway Project. Yet, this was not
considered as a risk for the project following the creation of an accounting unit within the RD, which
would be supported by a foreign expert financed by the project However, given the size of force
account activities to be financed by IDA and the required analytical accounting to follow-up on such
activities, this issue should have been addrsed more carefully. In fact, as several audit reports ler
demonstated, the RD did not keep accoun  for the IDA-financed opeations separated from ose
of other RD activities. As a result, compliance with finacial covenan was poor (see Part I, table
6).
18.                 _.                             The Credit Agreement 1641-RW was
amended to realocate funds from force account acdvWies to civil works on the Kigali-Gatuna road
(see para 14). Four amendments to each of the two technical assistanc con     were  oved by
the Bank in an effort to meet the capacity building objectves of the projecL The SAR  io that
periodic maintenance wors by contractors would be financed by the Kuwait Fund for Afica
Economic Development (KFAED). After the KFAED's wihdrawal of the proJect in 1981 (no
explanation for this withdrawal can be found in the flles), and given the mportane the Governmet



6
saw in these works, IDA provided the ncessary financing trough a new Agreent (cr. AS-IRlW)
amending the African Facility Credit A8-RW.
Prioec Ruht
19.    oi csty.  The project objectives did not change during impletion. The project
maiy failed to improve the RD's capacity to progru and manage maitenance of the road network.
No sustainable capacity was built at the managerial level despite extensive technical asistce. Me
RD's capacity In accounting did not improve as audit reports pointed to serious regularities and the
Bank's missions reptedly doubted the reliability of the cost accounting system managed by the rA
experts. lbis poor perfonmance stems from both poor TA and uereceptive Adminiaon (see par
32 and 36). However, at the lower levels of the administrWtlon (among the 'catomieW, site
supervisors and truck drivess), capacity was built through the successful Implementaton of the
manpower training program for which all quantified targets were met.
20.   The physical targets of the project were achieved substantially as planned. Sections I and 1X
of tha Kigall-Gatuna road (respectively, cofinanced by IDA and BADEA, and fhnanced by IDA) were
well contucted and are still now in excellent condition. This demotaes that the technical
difficulties along marshes were successfully addressed and that adequate manenance has been carried
out since then. In sectdon m (flnanced by the EDF), the crossing of a marsh at PK 68 was notgiven
appropriate tratment during the stage of constuction although the Jdifficulty was identified In toe
SAR. When hostilities flared up, it became impossible to reach tis spot safely. It has not been
properly reloaded with earth since then, has slowly sunk in the marsh and is now almost tmpassal
As regards to maintenance of the road network, quantified routine mintenan  objecti  wer
achieved (see Part m, table 5). With respect to periodic maintece, costs of force account
activities were estimated to be higher than expected and disbursements were lower than inity
planned. It can therefore be assumed that the quantified objectives were not fully met (see Part  ,
table 5).
21.     ecit FM.  It is not possible at this stage to recalculate with canty the ERR on the
Kigali-Gatuna road. The civil war that broke out in 1990 dramatically affected the underlying
assumptions on which the traffic estimates were based, and updated data are not available to
recalculate the ERR. The border with Uganda was closed and the international traffic was divertet
from the road Kigali-Gatuna to two other access corridors through Tanania. Menwhie, military
vehicle traffic has increased but no precise data are available on this subject A new pattem of
international traffic may emerge after peace is restored because of enhanced competition bet he
various access corridors. ERR estimates (SAR) for sections 1, 1U and m of the Kigall-Gatuna road
were respectively 43% and 16% and 12%. When peace is rstored, ERR on setonI should remain
high and close to the SAR estmate because there was no significant overrnu in construction -Osts,
and becaue most traffic on this secticn stems from economic ties between Kigali and Its immediate
surondings. On the contrary, ERR on section ! will be lower than the SAR esdmate becaus of
higher construction costs and a decline in international traffic. Tentative asumpions on the decrease
in traffic during wardme (1990-1993) are presented in Part m  (see Part m, table 5 B). SAR
estimates for vehicle operating costs, mainmtan  costs and tic count in 1988 (and after 1988,
in time of peace) being unchanged, these assumptions indicate that the ERR for Section I would not
be significantly changed as a result of the war: it would decrease from 43% to 40%. On the other
hand, the ERR for Section I would decrease from 16% to about 10%. These resuts, however,
provide only limited insights on whether or not the decision to fiance the wors was economically



7
ise insofar as the war could not be foreseen at the time of appraisal. Concening section Il, it is
not possible at this stage to assess the future value of the ERR because the problem of crossing the
marshes at PK 68 has not yet been addressed and the final construction cost Is therefore unkown.
22.   With regrd to maintenance activities, the data nmade available by the RD were not consistent
arid supervision missions repeatedly raised doubts on their validity. It can be assumed that force
account costs were higher than expected and that the ERR for periodic maintenance by force account
was lower than the ERR assessed at appraisal time.
23.   EmM  of Sies. IDA flnced a study on communal roads. Ihe study was well recelved
by the Borrower and the donors and it proved instrumental in designing a rural road component
during appraisa and Implementation of the subsequent project (Transport Sector Project). Studies
on  asport policy, coflnanced with UNDP (RWA/861005), provided a comprehensive view of the
transport sector in Rwanda and were instrumental in appraising the subsequent project (Transport
Sector Project).
24.   ImymOfte ULnos  g y. IDA ftinanced the purchase of equipment while French
COOPeation provided a technical assistant. No evaluation per se of this compont can be found in
the files. No Performce indicators were definet in the SAR. However, the files menton
shortcomings in the management of the Soils Laboratory. The efforts made did not meet the
objectives since further equipment and training were providtA through a subsequent African Facility
gra  ](Belgium Gran).
25.   As read the capacity building objective of the project, sustinablity is low. Six moths
after the departure of the TA for manpower development, the training center ceased to funmction and
its equipment and furniure were reallocated to other departments. Although the expatriate accountant
had st up a cost accountng system, the RD did not undertake any cost accounting exercises and
barely kept its books of accounts between his departure and the arrival in the field of another
expatiate acounta  with the subsequent Transport Sector Project one year later.
26.   Sections I and II of the Kigali-Gatuna road have been well maintained and are ready for the
return of international trafflc once peace is restored. With regard to the road routine maintenance
objective, sustainability can also be deemed satisfactory: routine maintenance is still carried out on
most of the national network, and in particular on the paved roads, by 'Cwonde' paid through
the Road Fund established under the subsequent Transport Sector Project. With regard to periodic
maintence activities, the RD's brigades probably carry out a lesser amount of work since project
completion and since the war stared. The RD does not have the capacity, given its scarce hulm
resorces, to maintain the entre road network by force account. The contracting out of maintenance
works is a necessity for the fiutre. Arrangements must be made to lease the equipment of the RD
to private contors.
27.   Bak staff contributed to projectimplementation through professional advice. However, some
shortcomings wene evident, as oudined further below.

28.     Us mix of skills among supevision mission membr was not always appropriat  For
stc uperviion missons staffed with fincal analysts, identfied seious shortcomig In the
accountng of the RD and made specific recommeon as early as October 1987. However, no
flnai  analyst went on mission to foillow-up on tho recommendations before October 1989.
Moreover, supvision was apparently affected by the changes that occurd In 1989 In the Bank staff
assigned to the project. Oily one mission visited Kigali in 1989. The number of man-days-per-year
In the field drlrng supervision missions increased considerably in 1991 and 1M  (see Part i, table
7 B).
29.   Ihe Bank approved, although with reluctancy, the signature of sevetra amendments to the two
TA contS (4 amendments for each of them) following repeated requests from the Govemment.
Ihe Bank should eithe have reviewed more carefully the draft TORs included in the SAR and the
fia TORI tiat were used for the consultation, or have discouraged this practice of signing seve
amendments. Ile conslting company thatbeld TA responsibilities in the RD, and whose leader was
the Minister's close counselor, was awarded ser contracts for feasibiity studies. In retrospect,
it seems that the overall quality of consultants' services would likely have been enhanced by hatg
more consulting companies opeang and compedng in the road sector (see para. 37).  ho Bank
should have fostered more compedtion among consulting companies by insisting that the couting
company holding TA responsibilities not be short-listed for works to be awarded by the entity in
which it was working as counselor.
30.   The Bank should have been more forcef in demanding that a reliable cost accountng system
be set up to measure the peformance of force account brigades and thereby bet  monitor th use
of proceeds from the Bank credit (see pam. 17). Furtheore, the Bank should have put more
emphasi on the capacity building objectives of the project by insistng on the transfer of mnwledge
betwe  epate experts and L elr countpars. The Bank should bave applied remedies when
audit reports were delayed and when serious accounting problems were ideified.
Borjrower Perfomae
31.   The Borrower proved dedicated to routine maintenance and financed more 'camonnies' than
what was planned in the SAR. The Borrower also supported the periodic maintenance program fr
works carried out by mechanized brigades, but its performance is difficult to assess because of poor
analytical accounting. It provided several activity reports but the data were often inconsistent.
32.   In general, the RD showed poor commitment to capacity building. It considered TA as a
mangment resource rather ta a moam to transfer knowledge to local managers. In general, the
top magement in the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and in the RD did not encourge a
participatory attide among their staff thus preventing them for building a fruitful relationship with
the technial assistants and learning from them. This attitude exacerbated the constns already
created by the scarcity of human resources within the RD. In part II of the PCR the Goverment
puts the blame on TA for poor results. If it is indeed their perception, they should not have
repeatedly asked the Bank to approve extensions of the TA contract.
33.   Compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants was low especialy with regard to the
financial covenas (see Part m, table 6). Audit reports were delayed uptD two years after the due
date and pointed to Irrelarities. Records and accounts in respect of expenditu  for the project
were not kept separate. Audits for 1990 and 1991 resulted In adverse opinions.



9
34.   'Me Bank and the RD's management failed to establish sound working relatioships. in
particular, supervision missions could barely discuss technical matters with RD's engineen becase
only a few top officials within the MPW were allowed to express their views and to take initiatives.
lhis situation improved slighdy towa*ds the end of the prject's implementaton after chges
occurred within the MPW's top management.
35.   The SAR stated strengthened donor coordination in the road secor as one of the prject
objecdves. However, it did not explain how this objective was to be achieved. Donor cootion
trned out to be pcor with respect to policy definidon in the road sector.  However, the
reconstrucon of the Kigali-Gatuna road was successfully financed by three separate donors (BADEA,
IDA and EDF). In particular, a quesdon arose du!ing implementation as to whether the contacts
for the three sections of the road could be awarded to a single conactor if ftis could lower the
oveail1 constructions cost. Eventually, the contracts for section I and II (with IMA fnacing) were
awarded to one contractor and the contract for section m (DF financing) to another contract. The
German Coperaidon-financed and the IDA-financed TA teams were eventually able to coopa
satisfactorily to make the manpower development component successful. The Bank and the UNDP
were in close coordination concerning transport planning and studies on the transport sector.
Conmiting Service
36.   37% of IDA resources were spent for consultant's services though the iitial allocation (in
the credit agreements) was 15% (see Part III, table 4 A). Yet, this sharp icrea  (136%) yielded
mixed results as far as capacity building is concerned (see pars. 19). TA to the RD consisted of two
teams from two differem consulting companies. Ihe one responsible for implemenidg the manpower
program performed well while in the field but failed to develop a sustainable system. On the other
hand, the one responsible for implementing the maintenance program by force account and keeping
the RD's bools of accounts performed poorly. First, it failed to train counterparts and Rwandese
RD's managers; this failure can be partly explained by the atide of top _manges in the MPW and
the RD (see para. 32). Secondly, it failed to establish a sound and sustnable accounting system for
the RD; this latter shortcoming may stem from both a lack of commitment by the RD and a lack of
qualification of the accountant-expert. This overall poor performance is all the more unortnmate as
four amendments to the consultant's contract were approved to provide the consultant with the means
to carry out the work.
37. The consultant responsible for the supervision of the works on section U of the Kigali-Gatuna
road was not able to prevent construction cost overruns. In the future, as part of the Consultant's
TORs, it should be specified that they have to find technical solutions to avoid cost overruns. Some
feasibility studies were not well done and had to be reviewed by the consultan in charge of the
supervision of thte works just before the works began.
EMIMmmlonlft nDO
.38.   The legal documents did not provide for a clear breakdown of project financing between the
two IDA credits involved (cr. 1641-RW and A8-RW). There was one SAR for two credit agrents
with the same sched0fit 2 (description of the project) and similar categories of disbursement in



10
schedules . In the case of two credits financing a single project, it is important that the Credit
Agreemes iiates which componen  of the project ptn to which credi!.
39.   Project reporting requirements were presented in the SAR. A better follow-up on compliance
with project repoing requirements during implementation could have provided a usefl Indicator of
the Borrowee's pefrmance.
40.   Most of the data relevnt to the preparation of the PCR was rdily available in the division
flles, Additional data could be retieved from the Africa Information Center. However, it was not
posible to update the detailed costs table presented in the SAR from the data found in the fies.
41.   The following lessons may be relevant to other Ba-fianced projects:
(a)    I retrospect, the decision to build up the capacty ofthe RD to maitainthenetwork
by force account through a large technical assistance program was unsound.
Contrag out a larger part of the works would have led to more sus8aib  esults.
--e low managerial capacity of the RD and the econmic objective of prvate sector
development both suggest contcting out of a large share of maitnc opraton
while down-scaling force account actvities in fuure project.
(b)   The defnition of efficiency indicators (in the SAR) aimed at meauring force account
works performance should take into account the RD's low capability to provide
accurate and meanful data Those indicators should be simple and reaic so that
(i) the implemetng agency can provide reliable figures for these indicator, and (ii)
the indicators can be traced throughout the project's implemenation
(c)   The TA was not adequately designed and supervised to help build local capacity.
Capacity building should be considered as a major objective (and a means to achieve
sustainability) to train local managers. The transfer of klowledge and of operatnal
responsibilities from the TA team to its counterparts should be monitored accrding
to a detailed schedule fnized with the Borrower and the TA team at the onset of
the project implemnaIon. Moreover, draft TORs for TA included in the SAR
should be deailed enough that it is not necesary during project implemn   to
conclude seral amedments to the TA conact. Fihally, the Bank should be more
forceful ia insisting on good performance by consultants, terminag contracts if
ncsary.
(d)    Consultants' TORs for the supervision of road works should include provision for
mainining the costs of works within the parameters specified in the works contract.
Thus, it should be the consultant's responsibility dufing the works implementation
to make any technical proposal necessary to remain within the available financial
package.
(e)    The Bank should be more forcefud in demanding compliance with financial covnas
with respect to accounting and auditing of Bank-finaced projects. It should exercise
remedies soon after problems are idendfied.



(t)   If donor coordination is considered as one of the project objectives, specific
procedures to enforce such coordination should be defioed durng appraisal. For
instance, it could be agreed upon to carry out joint supervision missions on a regular
basis throughout project implementation.
(g)   A detailed financing plan should be designed, based on the SAR and Credit
Agreement, aid updated on a regular basis during implementaion and during every
supervision mission, to follow-up closely on the parties' financial commitments and
to facilitate the drafting of a PCR when the project is completed.

(ii)     Preparation of procedures for the establishmet of an inteal control
system.
(iii)    General accounting of IDA-financed project, which must be audited
each year by auditors accepted by the Adminition and the World
Bank.
(iv)     Cost accounting of all the expenditures and operations related to road
maintenance activities managed by the Road Directorate.
(v)     Establishment of annual and monthly fnacial statements (alance
sheets and expenditure accounts).
(vi)     Professional training to the staff of the Road Diecorate.
(d)    A large training program at all levels for agents and mamgers of the Road
Administration, including:
(i)     Training and proficiency courses for agen  in various fields such as:
- civil engineering
- heavy vehicle drivers
. adminstration
- management of human resources.
(Ii)     Overseas advanced training for managers of Row Diecto.
In order to meet these objectives, the Administraton recruited consutants and expers in
n ri, management, accounting and professional taing, whos qualicatios and
eperience were sa ry to the Administron and the World BanL
Acoording to their Teams of Reference, the consultants were to render their services in a
promptly, efficiendy and practical manner, to meet the program objectives for the road
maintenanc.
But above all, the consltants were to request and Imist on the actve participation of
counterparts and local staff aiming to the practical training of the staff.
Also, the comultants were to keep the Administation informed on all the irreguarities and
discrepancies noticed after obtaining results.
3.       lemnaon gpoec and results
Even though the consultants tried to cover the overall program as inidally planned, there were some
sigaificant shortcomings in their work:
-      Concerning the project accounting, the consultant hein Ruhr Ingenleurs (RR)
performed quite poorly. As a matter of fact, the organzation of the accountig unit
was flawed. Audits for 1989, 1990 and 1991 showed us that the book of acowu
kept by RRI were incomplete and even, as far as some paricular projects are
concerned, they did not exist



15
At the levd of trang for local staff and for counterpa, we also noticed that the
counterparts traned by RRI were not able to take over and ensure continuity aft
the consultant's deparure. We charge this serious mistake to consultant RRI, wbo
did not lkow how to transmit the necessary knowledge to counterpa, and aboe
all, be did not even informed the adinistration about these deficieies before his
depar.
Concenig the execution of mtenance works, seen from the techical aspect, th
objectves were achieved. In fact, manten  brigades wero operdon  both on
the paved roads and on the earth roads. Traning of local staff left some site
supervisors who were able to contie the works after the experts' departr.
Concerning the mnagement of spare part stores, training and rotato  of local
counerparts was successful.
-      About the  tg    itself and the proficiency courses for the managers and the aga
of Direction Gendrale des Ponts et Chases, the objecvs were metL Consultant
ORT greatly contributed to this success. A good example of this is the continuity
of the training-rotation of the drivers, due to the efficiency of the local counterpar
lb conclusion, despite some shotcomings and sometimes the consult's in ence, specwiy at
he accounting unk level, some good results, at both the technical and training levels, were achieved.
