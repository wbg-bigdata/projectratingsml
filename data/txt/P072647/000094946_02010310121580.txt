A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
1.1    Background
The first education project financed by TFET, the Emergency School Readiness Project, ESRP
(June 2000-December 2001), rehabilitates school buildings, provides textbooks, teaching
materials, furniture and school equipment, and supports community participation. Ten months into
implementation, 40 % of the classrooms have been rebuilt and 40% of furniture and 87% of
textbooks have been delivered. Enrollment in the school year 2000/01 has reached the pre-1999
level in primary education (grades 1-6) but is still below that level in junior secondary education
(grades 7-9) and in senior secondary education (grades 10-12). This calls for the continuing
support from TFET through a second-phase project.
1.2    Development objectives of this project
The Fundamental School Quality Project as the second phase of TFET continues to focus on basic
education, with attention to junior secondary education. The specific development objectives of this
follow-on project are the following:
(a)   To support UJNTAET to maintain the existing level of primary education enrollment
(185,000 students, at estimated 95% gross enrollment ratio) and to restore junior secondary
enrollment to the pre-1999 level (,30,000 students, at estimated 60% gross enrollment ratio),
with the possibility of increase due to return of refugees and growth of school-age
population.
(b)   To continue to recover quality of primary and junior secondary education by rehabilitating
physical facilities and by providing textbooks and instructional materials.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex I)
2.1 Performance indicators
Access: (i) Construction under way at more than 5 district sites of combined primary and junior
secondary schools by project midterm, and completed in at least 13 sites by project completion; (ii)
More than 30 primary schools upgraded to fundamental quality by midterm, and more than 60 at
completion; (iii) Enrolment at junior secondary level increased by 1,300 students by midterm, and
by 2,600 by completion (as compared to enrollment in 2000);
Management: (iv) School councils organized and operational in more than 40 schools at midterm,
and in more than 78 schools at completion; (v) At least 2 project policy studies completed at
midterm, and at least 4 by the time of project completion;
Quality: (vi) Language learning books in active use in 40% of primary schools at project midterm,
and 80% by project completion.

2.2 Monitoring indicators
Impact and outcome indicators, which can be derived from statistical data, are listed in Annex 1
(Project Design Summary) for each development objective. The indicators can be drawn from
admninistrative data of schools, district offices and the Project Management Unit (PMU), and from
the school mapping supported under the ongoing Emergency School Readiness Project (ESRP).
The gross and net enrollment ratios by gender and by quintile, and by district and subdistrict can be
obtained from an analysis of the living standard measurement survey (LSMS) to be conducted later
in 2001.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: Report No.21 184-TP      Date of latest CAS discussion: November 28, 2000
A fornal Country Assistance Strategy for East Timor is yet to be formulated. However, the region
has presented the Memorandum of the President to the Executive Directors on a Transitional
Support Strategy of the World Bank Group for East Timor (November 3, 2000). The strategy lists
five key objectives, three of which are supported by this project, as follows: in the short term, focus
of basics, including the provision of health and education (first objective of the strategy); build
local ownership of the development process (third objective); and foster effective donor
coordination (fourth objective).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
2.1    Main sector issues
The post-referendum destruction in 1999 has made reconstruction of the education system the
primary issde over the short term, involving the rehabilitation of physical assets (buildings and
books) and the recruitment and reorganization of human resources (teachers and admninistrators) of
the system. The size and scope of the above reconstitution mask the underlying inadequacies of the
system, which if left unattended for too long, will erode the gains now being made in
reconstruction: limited access to and low attainment in education. Even in pre-referendum times,
those inadequacies were being felt, owing to public under-investment in education, which placed
the burden of high education costs on parents, many of whom are poor. Post-referendurn times
have added new burdens, heaviest of which are a new language of instruction (Portuguese) and an
obsolescent and overcrowded curriculum (Indonesian).
2.2    Govenmment strategy
Entrusted with TFET, the World Bank formulated in 2000 a phased School System Revitalization
Program (SSRP). The initial operation of that program - the Emergency School Readiness Project
(ESRP) - has become UNTAET's strategic response to the crisis. This proposed Fundamental
School Quality Project is the follow-on operation under SSRP. A third operation is envisioned,
aimed at providing guidance and assistance to the education sector as East Timor transits to full
independence in 2003.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project addresses the main sector issue, the reconstitution of the education system by financing
the construction and rehabilitation of schools. However, the project does not address the other
dimension of the sector reconstruction, human resource development, because the client (Recipient
of the Trust Fund for East Timor, TFET) and the intemational donor community, many of whom
are contributors to TFET, have asked the Bank as administrator of TFET to oversee the larger,
costlier, physical facilities reconstruction where the Bank is seen to have comparative advantage.
Moreover, the Bank is the recognized leader among donors in policy development and sector
management. By agreement and largely through the Bank's leadership, multilateral and bilateral
donors coordinate the provision of assistance to other parts of the system (see table).
The project also addresses under-investment in the sector, the issue underlying limited access to
and low attainment in education. In addit:ion to financing the cost of buildings and furniture, the
project finances the cost of textbooks and other learning materials (see table). Although, the project
does not address the new issues of language and curriculum, the project invests in policy
development which will lead to the confrontation of those qualitative issues in the future.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
As part of the Bank's rapid response to the East Timor emergency, this project is focused more on
immediate reconstruction and less on policy and institutional reforms, which can be attended to as the
crisis eases. Nonetheless, benefiting from the earlier ESRP investment, the following project activities
will have policy and institutional reform effects:
(a)   Restoration of educational facilities to the level of fundamental quality will return children
to school, restore access, and strenigthen the Government's policy conmmitment to the global
movement of providing basic education for all; and
(b)   School mapping will provide the bases for making demographically informed policy
decisions on school location, investment in educational infrastructure, teacher deployrnent,
and directions for system growth, thus rationalizing the sector into local districts consisting
of primary schools as feeders ofjunior secondary schools.
3. Benefits and target population:
The principal benefit from the project is the restoration of educational service. The direct beneficiary of
the project is the primnary and secondary school-age population currently in school or entering school in
the near future. The most important stakeholders are teachers, community and parent organizations,
and other clients and providers of education.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Division of Education, Culture, Youth & Sports
(DECYS) of UNTAET will continue to serve as the principal implementing agency for the project.
PMU will be responsible for overall project administration and coordination, implementation, and
quality control, including the administration of project funds, project procurement, and technical
coordination on education with other units of DECYS and with the district offices. The PMU will
provide school fuirniture, textbooks, and other teaching-learning materials and will be responsible for
construction. The PMU will also continue to implement the social mobilization campaigns and contract
policy development studies with qualified individuals and groups.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
This operation is the second in a series of projects under the School System Revitalization Program,
justified to and approved by Bank management during the review of the program's initial operation, the
Emergency School Readiness Project - ESR1' - (Report No. 20528-TP, June 21, 2000). As no
substantial changes have occurred in the sector to necessitate a change in project objective,
components, or activities, no further alternatives to the approved project design were considered in the
preparation of this project.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Effectiveness delays plagued the start-up of ESRP. This follow-on project requires that: (i) key project
managers - project director, project manager, chief architect, head of procurement, and head of
financial management - are appointed on full-time basis; (ii) land documentation for construction sites
is obtained before Grant effectiveness.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The process by which the actions to be financed by the project were decided was highly consultative,
which usually results in high ownership and commitment on the part of the Goverunent. However,
with high-level officials leaving their posts to run for election in August 2001, the degree of ownership
is indeterminate.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has become a credible leader in the donor comrmunity, entrusted with managing TFET donor
resources and in coordinating assistance to the education sector. In parallel, the Bank contemplates
undertaking sector work in FY02-03, to advance policy assistance to the incoming govenmment of the
newly independent state.

The justification for public investment in education is never limited to economic retums because basic
education is a human right. Further, education has important extemalities, such as better health
outcomes, reduced number of children, and improved inter-generational social mobility. Nonetheless,
because education develops cognitive skills that would enhance productivity and increase lifetime
eamings, it is also an effective instrument to alleviate poverty, promote economic growth, and increase
a nation's competitiveness in a global economy. In East Timor, education is critical for the country's

reconstruction and development.
The economic assessment undertaken for this project involved three steps: (i) establishing the broad
relationship between education and earnings, to identify policy implications; (ii) estimating the social
returns to public investment in education; and (iii) estimating the internal rate of return of the project
through the rebuilding of the physical infrastructure in order to expand access to primary and junior
secondary education.
The relationship between education and earnings
After the referendum of 1999, there has been no labor force survey or household survey in East Timor
to provide data on education and earnings. Therefore, this analysis drew on the historical data from the
Indonesia labor force survey (Sakernas) of 1998 which contained the latest data on education and
earnings from all provinces, including East l'imor, to estimate the benefits of education and to compare
those with the rest of Indonesia.Unfortunately, the data quality is less than satisfactory, and the number
of East Timor observations with complete information is very small (only 214). Hence, the findings can
only be viewed as suggestive.
A regression analysis found that the average monthly wages in East Timor were lower than those in
Indonesia, after holding experience constant (Figure E-1). However, the relationship between education
and earnings was much stronger in East Timor than in Indonesia: education explains 62% of the
differences in earnings in East Timor, but only 38% in Indonesia. Adding the occupation variables did
not change the picture in East Timor. The strong relationship between education and earnings was
likely due to a scarcity of skills in East Timor, putting a much higher premium on tertiary education.
Workers with a primary education earned about 20% more, on average, over those with no education.
This is not a very large percentage, reflecting poor quality and low completion rates (Figure E-2).
However, workers with a junior secondary education earned on average 57% more than workers
without education. Workers with a senior secondary education earned on average 72% more than
workers without education. Workers with a technical senior education earned almost as much (107%
over those without education) as workers with some university education (114%), indicating a strong
demand for the technician level of skills in East Timor. Male workers earned, on average, over 37%
more than females. Public sector workers eamed, on average, over 55% more than private sector
workers.
The following analyses did not use the public sector wage premium in calculating the eamings differentials.
Although newly created employment after the referendum concentrates mainly in the public sector as well as
in construction and services, given the size of the fiscal deficit, the public sector should not be the main
employer. (See IMF Statement at the Canberra Donors' Meeting, June 14-15, 2001.)

These findings have important implications for education policy. Because education was an important
channel for improving earnings, it was a key instrument for poverty alleviation. However, the low
private returns to primary education indicate that continuing to provide a poor quality primary
education is inadequate to alleviate poverty. The policy objective, after the meeting the immediate goal
of recovering enrollment to pre- 1999 levels, should aim at improving quality in primary education and
extending access to junior secondary education, as well as promoting girls education.
Returns to donorfinancing of education

Costs and benefits ofproviding physical injrastructure to expand access to education
The largest component of the project (80% of the cost) is to upgrade 65 primary schools which will
benefit 15,600 primary school students, and to build 14 demonstration schools, escolas basicas, that
will be shared by 3,360 primary school students and 5,040 junior secondary school students. The
beneficiaries total 18,960 primary school students and 5,040 junior secondary school students who
would not have had access without the project.
The costs include (i) those of school rehabilitation and new construction; (ii) the incremental recurrent
costs of salaries for additional teachers, maintenance of the buildings, and instructional materials; (iii)
household expenditure on education; and (iv) the foregone earnings due to staying in school rather than
working. The benefits are increased lifetime earnings.
The assessment constructed two scenarios: (1) All students would progress through the school system
on time, with no repetition and dropout, and all graduates from each cycle would be employed
throughout their work life; and (2) The promotion rate would be 90%, repetition, 8%, and dropout, 2%
in each grade, except in Grades 6 where only 50% of graduates would enter the work force and in
Grade 9 where 60% of graduates would enter the labor market. Table E-2 summarizes the internal
rates of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) of the investment. These two scenarios illustrate
that improvement in internal and external efficiency is critical to having higher rates of return to
investment in education.
Conclusion
In all three analyses, it was found that not only was the investment in education profitable to the
individuals and society, but also for the project. After the post-referendum devastation of the country,
rebuilding the human resource base is one the most pressing needs and should be accorded the top
priority by the Government and multilateral and bilateral agencies.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
The year 2000 marked the rebuilding of the sector by the East Timorese with external technical and
financial assistance. Multilateral and bilateral financial support came through three channels:
(a)    Consolidated Fund for East Timor (CFET) which finances the operating costs of various
programs in education (over 80% wages and salaries of teachers and administrators, 14 %
goods and services, and 6% capital expenditure);
(b)    Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET) administered through a World Bank-managed project
and used to rehabilitate schools and supply furniture and textbooks, to enable the
education sector to return to operational level; and
(c)    Bilateral and multilateral grants which mainly finance technical assistance, capacity
building, overseas scholarships, and some rehabilitation of buildings.
Table E-3 shows the amount and percentage share of these three funding sources over two fiscal years:

Note: The TFET amount only reflects the projected disbursement figure during the fiscal year; it does not represent the total
TFET available for education. Percentages do not total 100 due to rounding.
Table E-4 shows that CFET and TFET concentrate on primary and junior secondary education, and
bilateral and multilateral grants on tertiary education. These three sources of funding are highly
complementary. They target specific categories of expenditure, emphasize different levels of education,
and serve different purposes.

The CFET budget of 2000/01 amounts to about 5% of the estimated GDP, much higher than the level
of public spending under the Indonesian administration and is on par with OECD education
expenditure levels. The request for 2001/02, if approved, would increase spending to 5.9% of the
estimated GDP. The CFET objectives are: (i) to restore enrollment in primary, junior and senior
secondary, and technical and vocational education to pre-1999 levels, with the possibility of increasing
student intake due to the growth of school-age population, improvement in retention and graduation
rates at the lower levels, and the return of refiugees; and (ii) to improve quality by reducing
student-teacher ratios, establishing the position of principals, provision of replacement teachers to those
on maternity and prolonged sick leave, and provision of inservice training.
CFET covers the operating cost of the school system, while TFET and bilateral and multilateral
donations support the rehabilitation and reconstruction as well as capacity building through technical
assistance and training. Although TFET for 2001/02 represents an additional 3% of GDP while
bilateral and multilateral, another 7.8% of GD)P, the funds represent one-time financing infusions for
rebuilding what had been destroyed and will not recur.

3. Technical:
Prior to the 1999 referendum for independence
Education in East Timor has evolved through three distinct periods: Portuguese colonial rule
(1511-1975), Indonesian occupation (1975-September 1999), and United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) leading to the election for a constituent assembly to prepare
for independence (October 1999-present).
- 12-



The Portuguese introduced Western curriculum, language, and the Catholic Church, and has continued
to be a source of support to East Timor. However, mass public education was not the policy of the
colonial administration. At the end of the Portuguese rule in 1975, illiteracy rate was about 90%.
Indonesia vastly expanded public primary education. Even so, by 1999, East Timor not only was
behind the Indonesian enrollment average, but also was far from meeting its own national requirement
of 9 years of compulsory basic education for children between the ages 7 and 15. Figure E-3 shows the
rapid growth of primary education enrollment since 1976/77. The graph also reveals the low enrollment
level in junior and senior secondary education. This very low stock of educated people in East Timor
has proven to be a major constraint in reconstruction and development of the country.

Figure E-3: Enrollment in primary and secondary education, 1976-2000
An analysis of the Susenas household survey of 1999 for this project found that gross enrollment in
East Timor was 95% in primary education, 64% in junior secondary education, and 39% in senior
secondary education. Net enrollment, which indicates schooling of children of appropriate age for the
grade, was only 74% in primary education, 36% in junior secondary education, and 20% in senior
secondary education. Figure E-4a shows that the differences in enrollment and retention between the
richest quintile and the poorest of the consumption distribution and that between urban and rural areas
were pronounced, and increased with the level of education. Among youths from the poorest
consumption quintile, 71% attained Grade 1 but only 25% reached Grade 9. Even among the richest
quintile, only 89% attained Grade 1 and 61%, Grade 9. Rural youths were distinctively at a
disadvantage' while 80% of them had attained Grade 1, only 38% made it to Grade 9, while 94% of
urban youth were in Grade 1 and 65 % in Grade 9. Figure E-4b shows that girls of the poorest 20% of
the consumption distribution had the least access to basic education.
The low educational attainment was in part due to the relatively low level of public expenditure on
education during Indonesian administration (estimated to be 2.9% of GDP of East Timor in 1999).
This resulted in poor quality and high repetition and low retention rates. The inability of households to
bear the cost of education was another reason for low attainment. Even though public primary
education was free, households had to pay for books, school supplies, uniform, transport, and lunches;
public secondary schools charged annual and monthly fees as well. An analysis of the 1999 Indonesian
household survey (Susenas) by Pradhan and Sparrow (2000) which covers all provinces found that per
student spending on primary education by households in "other islands" represents 13% of per capita
consumption of each quintile. For junior secondary education, the costs of education represented 41%
of per capita consumption for the poorest student, but only 30% for the richest student. Per student
spending on senior secondary education was as high as 80% of per capita consumption among the
poorest quintile, but it represented only 41% of per capita consumption of the top quintile. As the level
of required household expenditure escalated with higher levels of education, few families could afford
to spend 40 to 80% of their child's per capita consumption on education alone. This explains why

enrollment in junior secondary and, particularly, senior secondary education remained low.

Since the 1999 referendum for independence
After the referendum in August 1999, pro-Indonesia militia destroyed about 95% of the schools in the
country, necessitating to the intervention of the United Nations to restore peace and order and civil
administration. The departure of the Indonesians also triggered an emigration of non-Timorese
teachers who comprised 20% of the teaching force in primary education and 80% in secondary
education. The destruction of schools and the departure of non-Timorese teachers led to the collapse of
the education sector.

4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The project will be executed by the Division of Education, Culture, Youth & Sports (DECYS) of the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
4.2 Project management:
The Project Management Unit (PMU) established at the DECYS will continue to receive project
financing for project administration and execution. However, there is a need to streamline the
organization, as: (i) the new operation would not have community-level basic operational rehabilitation
as ESRP; it will have more contracts with builders and construction supervision companies in the
private sector; and (ii) a strategy will be needed for integrating project staff with the regular
governmental structure of independent East Timor.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Procurement implementation in ESRP requires close coordination among the Bank, PMU and the
Government's central procurement agency, to ensure consistency in compliance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines and UNTAET procurement rules and regulations. Frequent consultations at the
highest level, the mutual adoption of an activity matrix to map the procurement coordination desired by
both sides, and the appointment of a procurement specialist for the PMU are some of the measures
being taken to minimize conflicting interpretations of rules or their inconsistent application which in
ESRP has led to delays project contracting and implementation.
4.4 Financial management issues:
Performance under ESRP
IJNTAET had appointed an expatriate Finance Manager and four East Timorese staff to the PMU's
Financial Management Unit (FMU). The unit discharged the minimum functions related to recording of
project expenditures, managing the Special Account, and submitting periodic withdrawal applications.
Unfortunately, adequate and fully operational accounting systems, intemal procedures, and controls
were not established, and the training of East Timorese staff in financial management was
unsatisfactory. The Finance Manager left the project in December 2000, exacerbating the situation.
A consultant hired three months later restored financial management to acceptable levels. Missing or
incomplete accounting records have been reconstituted; intemal controls and procedures in key areas
are being clearly defined and established, the East Timorese staff are being trained and given increasing
responsibilities.
Financial management assessment update
As required under Bank's procedures, in late April 2001, an assessment for financial management
under the proposed project was undertaken. The principal findings are the following:
(a)    Financial Management Officer: Unfortunately, the contract with the financial management
consultant also ended in June 2001. His replacement is required in time for the
effectiveness of the new project. Having the Financial Management Officer in place is a
condition of effectiveness of this proposed follow-on project.
(b)    Action plan: The critical actions to be taken to strengthen overall financial management of
the ESRP as the next project comes onstream were discussed at appraisal and are listed in
- 15-



Annex 6. The appraisal noted that several of the tasks listed in the action plan had already
been initiated by FMUJ under the direction of the consultant. The agreed action plan for
financial management was confirmed at negotiations.
(c)    Annual external audits: The first audit of ESRP as of June 30, 2001 will need to be
undertaken by independent auditors and the audit report submitted to the Bank by
December 2001, in accordance with World Bank requirements. The audit of two other
TFET-financed projects (CEP and SEP) as of December 31, 2000, are ongoing, the audit
reports expected before their due date of June 30, 2001. The audit of ESRP is essential for
the assessment of the fmnancial rnanagement under the proposed project, inasmuch as both
education projects will be managed by the same unit. UNTAET is considering retaining the
same audit firm for the audit of three other projects in East Timor, in education, health,
and agriculture, an arrangement acceptable to the Bank.
5. Environmental:                  Environ,mental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
An environmental safeguards mission visited Dili in February 2000 to assess the environmental
impacts of Bank projects and safeguards in place to mitigate potential hazardous effects. With
UNTAET officials, the mission discussed environmental issues and measures to be taken to mitigate
potentially negative impacts of Bank-administered TFET projects. The mission observed that "no Bank
operation appears to have had significant adverse environmental or social impacts." With the
Emergency School Readiness Project (ESRFP) as a case in point for the education sector, the mission
reported that: (i) the possibility of encountering asbestos was not recognized in the project design (on
the other hand, the mission noted that project implementation staff had been provided training on the
Government's guidelines for the safe handling of asbestos); and (ii) waste-burning is occurring, and
scavengers are risking health and safety for lack of operational plans for and supervision of waste
disposal. The mission recommended that project supervision should see to the compliance with the
provisions of the asbestos guidelines and that future education projects should be classified as Category
B for environmental assessment.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
During project preparation, an action framework was developed and agreed, to mitigate the potentially
harmful effects of building debris removal and toilet waste disposal. The framework (see Annex 2,
Component 5, "Action Framework for Protecting the Environment"):
(a)    Confirms that of the project's five components, only the first (Rebuilding School
Infrastructure) will be concemecl with risks to the environment, from negligible to
moderately serious levels.
(b)    Describes measures that would be taken in that component to mitigate the possible
negative enviromnental impacts of project activities.
(c)    Identifies specific actions, responsible units and individuals, and resources to be deployed
from the project's third component (Social Mobilization and Communications) and fifth
component (Support to Project Management) for effectively addressing the issues of
demolition materials and toilet sewage disposal.

5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
(Not applicable)
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
Construction monitoring (in Component 1 of the project) and training for the community on monitoring
(in Component 3) are specific and monitorable actions.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
ESRP identified three social factors that may influence the project negatively, i.e., may still deter
people from taking advantage of the newly rehabilitated and equipped schools: (i) overcrowding in the
rehabilitated schools; (ii) discouragement among parents at their children's having lost a full school
year's attendance owing to the disturbances; and (iii) continuing instability and lack of trained teachers.
By March 2001, overcrowding was apparent at many rehabilitated schools. Double-shift classroom
occupancy, an emergency recourse in many other countries where student places are scarce, was
neither fully understood nor accepted by East Timorese parents, teachers, and children. It is practiced
in some schools in Dili and other urban areas but difficult to implement in rural schools to which
children walk great distances. Parental discouragement has been difficult to gauge because ESRP has
not yet fully organized its monitoring system. Teacher shortages are apparent everywhere. ESRP's
social mobilization and communications has not focused on those issues relating to civil society, and
the project's resources have not as yet been brought to bear effectively on the issues.
In this follow-on project, it is expected that the reconstruction of school buildings would be on existing
school sites, i.e., where the original buildings stood. However, in the aftermath of the 1999
dislocations, long-forgotten land claims may reemerge as land acquisition and resettlement issues for
the project.

6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
Beneficiary consultations took place during the preparation and are taking place during the
implementation of ESRP, the first education project. Harnessing community labor in rehabilitating
mostly primary schools to basic operational level and contracting community workshops to fabricate
school furniture provided ample community participation in that project. The latter activity continues in
this follow-on Fundamental School Quality Project, with about the sarne level of engagement with
students, teachers, and parents.
Primary stakeholder consultations have been undertaken for the proposed project. The Bank team was
in country in March-April 2001 identifying the components of the project, with the PMU as
counterpart organization. The discussions on project components were conducted in accordance with
an agenda agreed with multilateral and bilateral donors during a Joint Donor Education Sector
Mission. That mission delineated the scope of the project and assessed the relative weights of each
component. Donor programs and pledges of support were confirmed: (i) for areas to be covered by the
project in which donors were also active (e.g., school rehabilitation and construction), coordination was
established; (ii) for other areas identified as gaps this TFET operation could not cover for insufficiency
of resources (e.g., teacher training and support), donor assistance was identified. Nongovemmental
organizations (NGOs) were consulted least, owing to the Recipient's reluctance to use the resource
more extensively.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
Project management has been organized so that the Education Coordinator works directly with the
Project Director and the highest levels of management in the education sector (see PMU organization
chart in Annex 2). The Education Coordinator's group has the specific responsibility for facilitating the
participation of school councils and NGOs on matters of school maintenance and safety. The project
will support training for those purposes.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The monitoring mechanism being established by the Emergency School Readiness Project will continue
under this project and will be undertaken by the Education Coordinator's group. Regular Bank
supervision will oversee project monitoring, including monitoring of social outcomes included as one of
the project's performance indicators (see Section A.2, above).

7. Safeguard Policies:
7.1 Do any of the following safeguard policies apply to the project?
Policy                                     Applicability

Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)*          0 Yes 0 No
7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
Criteria for selecting sites for project construction were developed collaboratively with the Bank
mission, to avoid displacing squatters who may have settled in abandoned school buildings or grounds.
The PMU has prepared a ranked list of sites, so that the project would construct or rehabilitate
educational facilities, following that rank order. As a condition of effectiveness of this project, the
Government will adopt a land acquisition and resettlement policy framework acceptable to the Bank.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Through the project's social mobilization and communications activities, consultations with the
community and engagement of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as partners of the project on
matters of school security and preventive maintenance will increase the likelihood, but will not
guarantee, that the physical assets the project will be sustained over the long term. With cormmunities
still re-forming, and the nation in the process of political transition to an independent state, the chances
of sustaining more than the physical contributions of the project are low.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Under the policy support component of the project, research could reveal teachers' difficulty in learning
Portuguese well enough to teach in that language or children's learning difficulties traceable to the new
language of instruction. Findings like this on such emotionally sensitive topics invariably lead to
political controversy. To miniimize the occasions for counterproductive interpersonal or intergroup
conflict, project management will be advised to promote such research in a university setting or other
neutral venue where honest questioning and rigorous, dispassionate investigation usually lead to the
advancement of knowledge. Wider consultation on the issue with civil society can then be attempted.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
EAST TIMOR: FUNDAMENTAL SCHOOL QUALITY PROJECT
By Component:
Project Component 1 - US$10.90 million
Rebuilding School Physical Infrastructure
2.1.1  The specific objectives of this component are to (i) provide about 2,600 new student places in
junior secondary education (grades 7-9), to facilitate the restoration ofjunior secondary school enrolment,
from 29,600 (in 2000/1) to the pre-referendum level of 32,200 (in 1998/99); (ii) pilot at the district level
about 14 integrated schools operating at the fundamental quality level; and (iii) upgrade about 65 selected
primary schools from basic operational to fundamental quality.
2.1.2  In terms of physical facilities, fundamental quality means: (i) replacing with new buildings those
destroyed beyond repair or upgrading existing buildings to the same standard as those newly constructed;
and (ii) providing the school with water service, sanitary facilities, appropriate furniture and fixtures, and
basic teaching equipment.
2.1.3  Escola basica. The project would pilot the concept of escola basica, an integrated primary and
junior secondary school, grades 1-6 and grades 7-9, respectively, of the basic education system. The
integrated school would function as a mother school (escola mae), the education center at the district level.
It would provide facilities for one primary stream and three junior secondary streams. As mother school,
the escola basica would receive grade 6 completers from near by primary schools. The school would have
the quality resources which a typical district or school may not have: library, laboratory, toilets, and
multipurpose room for training, community meetings, and cultural presentations.
2.1.4 The escola basica would save on construction, a major capital expenditure. By programming the
school day in morning and aftemoon sessions, upper primary grades 4-6 can use the rooms of junior
secondary grade 7. An integrated school also provides education planners the flexibility of configuring the
education system or elements thereof as may be appropriate to East Timor: number of levels and grades in
basic education, curriculum and instructional materials, teacher recruitment and deployment, supervision
and maintenance. These would lead the way to decentralizing education and identifying policy and
investment options over the long term. (To assist with the latter, the project would support policy
development, in Component 4.)
2.1.5  Site selection. The criteria for finding suitable locations for escolas basicas, agreed at appraisal,
include the following: (i) no squatters resident on site; (ii) Land and Property Commission documentatien
and certification by the District Administrator and the District Education Authority that no claim is pending
on the land; (iii) previous school on site was completely destroyed and structurally beyond repair; (iv) in
the subdistrict, no prototype junior secondary school will be constructed under ESRP or any other project
or no school will be upgraded to escola basica; (v) site has sufficient area for construction and circulation;
(vi) site is at a distance from the public market; and (vii) site has access to water.
2.1.6  Construction of escolas basicas. The architectural concept of the escola basica, in terms of
standardized building units and room dimensions, was agreed at appraisal. The facilities for primary
education would consist of the following:
(a)    One 3-classroom building for grades 1-3. (The school day would be organized in two
- 25 -



sessions, to enable primary grades 4-6 to share classrooms with junior secondary grade
7.);
(b)    Office for the primary school principal or equivalent school official in the administration
building (below); and
(c)    4 toilets for boys, 4 toilets for girls.
2.1.7  The facilities for junior secondary education would consist of the following:
(a)    Nine general classrooms - one 3-classroom primary school building, three 3-classroom
junior secondary school buildings. (Two classrooms in one of the buildings would have
moveable partitions that may be opened up to form one large space for staging plays,
community meetings, cultural exhibits and dances.);
(b)    Laboratory (mostly for science demonstrations and group work), library, and multipurpose
rooms;
(c)    Administration and teachers' offices, storerooms; and
(d)    4 toilets for boys, 4 toilets for girls.
2.1.8 The escola basica would be provided with timber furniture and with basic school and office
equipment. Safe water supply would be provided, usually in the form of a covered well. To avert extreme
heat, the buildings would be oriented north-south, although layouts may vary owing to site conditions.
Construction will be carried out by local or international contractors and supervised by civil works
consultants.
2.1.9  Upgrading schools to escolas basicas. The accommodation to be provided to schools selected for
upgrading to escolas basicas will conform to the above architectural standards (paras. 2.1.6-7), and
furnishing and equipping will conform to the standards of new construction (para. 2.1.8). Depending on the
findings and recommendations of the school mapping conducted under ESRP as well as on the condition of
the buildings, surplus structures would be assigned for other purposes or demolished. Classrooms to be
retained will receive new windows and doors, new floors if necessary, new ceilings, pin boards and
chalkboards. All classrooms will be provided with new timber furniture, and all schools will be provided
with new toilets and a safe water supply, probably in the form of a covered well.
2.1.10 Upgrading primary schools to fundamental quality level. The criteria for selecting schools to be
upgraded from basic operational to fundamental quality level include: (i) degree of overcrowding in existing
primary school buildings; (ii) accessibility of the school to communities in surrounding areas; and (iii)
favorable recommendation of school mapping study.
2.1.11 The architectural standards of the fundamental quality level primary school agreed at appraisal, in
terms of design, room dimension, and construction plans of standardized building units, are those of the
prototype primary school adopted under ESRP, as modified during the appraisal mission as follows: (i) two
3-classroom buildings (classroom floor area: 173 sq.m., veranda area 57 sq.m.); and (ii) toilet block (toilet
floor area: 40 sq.m., veranda area: 13 sq.m.). The school would be provided with timber furniture and with
basic school and office equipment. Safe water supply would be provided, usually in the form of a covered
well. The upgrading of schools would be managed by using the PMU and its technical staff to manage and
supervise the work of local contractors.
2.1.12 School maintenance. If school buildings are to retain their value and provide their pupils and staff
with an adequate environment for learning time, maintenance must be effective and regular. An annual
maintenance budget of around 2% of the initial cost of the building is recommended. As the rehabilitation
- 26 -



under ESRP was managed through the school community, the maintenance of primary schools would also
be the responsibility of the school community. This will involve training in maintenance (and fund raising
for maintenance) for school staff and members of the community. In collaboration with NGOs, the PMU
would develop maintenance handbooks for primary school facilities for the use of the school and the
community, together with a simple monitoring and reporting procedures. At escolas basicas, maintenance
would be managed by the school principal who would use local artisans and small contractors. The
maintenance training, use of handbooks, fund raising, and the actual maintenance process through the
school and community will be supported by the project in the escolas basicas and in about 13 upgraded
primary schools as a pilot project at the district level on the maintenance of school buildings in general.
Implementation responsibility would be with Social Mobilization and Communications (Component 3) of
the project.
Project Component 2 - US$1.50 million
Provision of Teaching-Learning Materials
2.2.1  Through this component, textbooks and teachers guides as well as other teaching and learning
materials will be provided to schools.
2.2.2 The Government's DECYS has embarked on the introduction of Portuguese as a foreign language
in schools. At this policy level, the project will assist the Government in developing an appropriate policy
on language of instruction by supporting studies on teachers' and students' level of competence in the
language and identifying effective measures to improve the acquisition of language skills (see Component
4, below).
2.2.3   Textbooks, workbooks, and teachers guides for leaming Portuguese as a foreign language had
been selected through a process involving East Timorese and Portuguese teachers as well as education
leaders; the selected materials were provided for the initial grades by the Government of Portugal and by
ESRP. To supplement the supply of Portuguese language materials in schools, language textbooks and
workbooks will be provided to primary and secondary schools at the ratio of about 1 book for 4 students.
Under the current Government's plan, about 10,000 copies will be provided to grade 1 students under
ESRP, 320,000 copies will be provided to grades 2-6 students under this project (grade 7 students were
provided books in 2000/1 under ESRP), and 8,000 copies will be provided to grades 8-12 students, also
under ESRP. The books will be delivered to schools through the district education offices.
2.2.4  The project would also provide demonstration kits in science and mathematics to the project
schools as well as other instructional materials (references and reading books), including minor equipment
(typewriters, computers and peripherals, media). These off-shelf items would be selected by East Timorese
educators with the help of education consultants of the PMU.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.30 million
Social Mobilization and Communications
2.3.1  Through this component, the project will inform and interact with civil society, influence attitudes,
encourage participation and disseminate the reasons for and results of project interventions. Stakeholders
consisting of the community (district residents, local and international nongovernmental organizations -
NGOs - including churches) and the official community (other governmental agencies, international
donors) will be informed of significant developments of the School System Revitalization Program (ESRP
and FSQP).
- 27 -



2.3.2  Infornation will be disseminated through printed materials and press releases, audiovisual
campaigns (promotional radio and television interviews and other programs), information workshops in the
districts. The campaigns will include encouraging the community to collaborate with NGOs in monitoring
for compliance of environmental protection regulations during construction (especially the safe removal and
disposal of hazardous materials like asbestos), assisting in promoting health and hygiene in school (regular
cleaning of classrooms and toilets), undertaking simple preventive maintenance measures, and volunteering
for assignments to maintain security in school building and grounds.
2.3.3  The project will support the provision of technical assistance by communications consultants for
the design and execution of social mobilization programs. These will include production of materials,
delivery of messages, organization of meetings, and campaigns, and evaluation of the effectiveness of
project communications.
Project Component 4 - US$0.30 million
Support for Policy Development
2.4.1  To identify policy and operational issues and options for education over the medium term as the
country undergoes transition to independence, the project would support studies, including technical
assistance, short-term study visits, data gathering and dissemination (through electronic and other media),
discussion forums, workshops, publications, and. related activities. Implementation responsibility would be
with the education policy support group under the leadership of the Education Coordinator, PMU.
2.4.2  Policy implications of escola basica. Even as construction of pilot escolas basicas is under way
during the project period, the following issues derived from international experience with the concept of
integrated schooling would be identified and analyzed: preservice teacher training curriculum, teacher
career pathing and compensation schemes, school leadership in an integrated primary-junior secondary
school, optimum size and catchment area of the integrated school, age-appropriate furniture,
age-appropriate care and supervision, school programming to meet contact hours and student time-on-task
requirements, extending coverage to nonformal education.
2.4.3  Financing of education. This study would expand the education sector needs and resources study
prepared by the Bank for TFET in 2001: (i) status of education before and after 1999, projection of
population, the extent of recovery, and progress on rehabilitation; (ii) public and private expenditure on
education; and (iii) indicators or equity, quality, efficiency, and links to the labor market. The study would
be conducted by an East Timorese investigator, from the education, national planning, finance, or
university sectors, in collaboration with World B3ank sector specialists. At a workshop in Dili in, the
findings of the study would be discussed with the international donor community, national leadership, and
civil society and thereafter stored in an appropriate repository, preferably at the university, to be made
available in print or electronic form as the initia.l issue of an occasional papers series on education research
in East Timor. The workshop would foster public consultation on education policy, especially on support
to vocational and technical education and employment.
2.4.4  Curriculum, language of instruction, teacher and school leadership. These studies would
identify the curriculum or program of study responsive to education requirements and appropriate to the
East Timor culture. The language study would identify gaps between government policy and language
abilities of teachers and students, evaluate and estimate the investment cost and educational benefits of key
alternatives for narrowing the gaps, and prepare policy recommendations for discussion with education and
community leaders and the international donor community. Training needs analyses in teacher and
administrator development would be conducted, and terms of reference for priority programs would be
- 28 -



written, for investment and implementation in future years. The studies would also involve study visits in
the region, to establish professional friendships among educators interested in those study areas, and local
workshops among national, district and subdistrict educators. For the latter, a workshop manual would be
developed. The studies would complement the baseline study in mathematics and science achievement being
conducted with AusAID support.
2.4.5  The proposed project will support (i) intemational technical assistance for an Education Policy
Advisor at the PMU; (ii) the education finance study; (iii) study tours for senior education officials to
review comparative educational systems; and (iv) other studies, including the development of operational
policies and procedural guidelines, identification of options for textbooks, teaching-leaming materials and
school buildings, building and furniture maintenance.
Project Component 5 - US$1.10 million
Management and Implementation Support
2.5.1  Project management. The major focus of the first project (ESRP) is to respond to the widespread
destruction of school infrastructure and rehabilitate primary schools to a basic operational level at a time
when national capacity to respond was very low. Consequently, an elaborate PMU structure with a large
staff evolved. A Construction Management Unit (CMU) assessed rehabilitation needs; it purchased, stored,
and distributed building materials to schools; it supervised rehabilitation work carried out under subgrants
provided to schools. The objective of rehabilitating about 2,100 primary classrooms to basic operational
level has been achieved and exceeded.
2.5.2 This follow-on Fundamental School Quality Project (FSQP) focuses on providing physical
facilities to improve learning conditions at selected primary schools and to restore and expand enrollment
at the junior secondary level. Because ESRP will continue to be under implementation even as FSQP
becomes effective, the existing Project Management Unit (PMU) will assume project management
responsibilities of the new project. Nontheless, maintaining key managers is a condition of effectiveness of
FSQP.
2.5.3  Upon completion of ESRP, the PMU management structure will be streamlined, and staff will be
redeployed following a staff development plan to be developed under FSQP. (See organization structure,
below.)
2.5.4 The Project Director will be an East Timorese or a UN official and will have responsibility for
overall project management and coordination. He or she will report to the highest education official
(currently the Head of DECYS). Day-to-day operation of the PMU will be the responsibility of a Project
Manager, an East Timorese or UN official.
2.5.5  An Education Coordinator, an East Timorese or a UN specialist, will: (i) coordinate monitoring
and reporting of project implementation and provide a link to, and derive information from, District
Education Offices; (ii) provide education advice on the procurement of books and other learning materials
(Component 2); manage the social mobilization and communications activities of the project (Component
3); and (iii) supervise the development of the design and execution of policy studies (Component 4) that
will provide policy options for the Government.
2.5.6  The Project Architect will be responsible for the construction program over all. He or she will see
to the completeness, appropriateness and cost-efficiency of designs for escolas basicas, monitor the
supervision of the construction and upgrade programs, and train a small group of architects and engineers

Technical Staff of the PMU
Organization chart of the Project Management Unit
2.5.7  The Procurement Officer will: (i) review and update the project's procurement plan; (ii) prepare
requests for proposals and bidding documents for the purchase of goods, works, and services under the
proposed project, in close cooperation with the CPU; (iii) maintain coordination among PMU,UNTAET
Central Procurement Unit and Contracts Review Committee, and the Bank on all matters relating to project
procurement; and (iv) see to contractor compliance with the Govemment and the Bank's procurement
guidelines and contract enforcement.
2.5.8  The Financial Management Oficer will maintain accounting records for the project, effect
transactions from the Special Account and replenishment requests, prepare financial reports and assist
support formulating, and revising project budgets., financial plans, and disbursement projections and
reports.
2.5.9  Maintaining the above management positions is a condition of effectiveness, as the project is
scheduled for implementation at a time of transition for East Timor, from UN administration to full
independence. The transition is expected to be under way at about project start-up: elections for the
constituent national assembly are scheduled for late August 2001, followed by the drafting of a national
constitution which will provide guidance to the political forms and processes of the new country.
2.5.10 Technical assistance. The above politica.l process may take longer than expected, and it is not
clear if the current administration or the new Government can fully staff the PMU. In order to maximize
assistance to the education sector during this period of uncertainty, the project has adopted a strategy of
- 30 -



supporting through this component the provision of technical assistance in the following key areas: (i)
project management; (ii) education policy development; (iii) architectural design and management; (iv)
project procurement; and (v) project financial management. Should the Government appoint civil servants
to those positions and support them through regular budgetary appropriations, then the project would shift
its technical assistance from direct management to capacity development and advisory service.
(a)    An experienced Project Management Advisor will be mentor to both the Project Director
and the Project Manager, coordinate the activities of the other consultants, and develop and
carry out specific plans for capacity building in the area of project leadership.
(b)    The Education Policy Advisor, an international educator with experience in national
leadership, will provide guidance and training to the official and technical personnel
assigned to the educational materials, social communications, and policy research activities
of the project.
(c)    An Architect-Construction Advisor will provide expert advice on design, materials
list-building, construction costing, evaluating bids for works, construction supervision, and
staff development.
(d)    The Procurement Officer, an ESRP consultant whose qualifications and experience were
accepted by the Bank, will be expected to continue service for this proposed project.
(e)    A Financial Management Advisor will provide support and advice to the East Timorese
officials and staff of the Sub-Division of Finance of DECYS.
(f)    In addition, on the basis of lessons learned from ESRP (especially on the unreliable
distribution service for education and construction materials and the inadequate capacity
for logistics planning at DECYS), short-term consultants for logistics will be appointed, to
plan and oversee the distribution of school books, furniture and teaching and learning
materials. The technical assistance programs will also support other short-term consulting
assignments (e.g., education research and social mobilization), comparative education
study tours, workshops, seminars and short-term training, and some operational costs of
the PMU for local travel, communications, minor office equipment and supplies related to
capacity development in education management.
Action Framework for Protecting the Environment
2.5.11 Background. In a meeting in June 2001 on the application of OP 4.01 (environmental assessment)
to this follow-on project, the Environmental Safeguards Committee advised that: (i) the extent of school
building demolition that would be undertaken in the project be clarified and measures be adopted for the
safe handling and disposal of hazardous demolition materials, including asbestos; and, as the project
includes the provision of school toilets, (ii) measures be adopted to mitigate the potential harmful impacts
of sewage disposal on the environment.
2.5.12 The school mapping exercise supported by ESRP is expected to disseminate findings and
recommendations in September 2001. The project would then make an accurate deternination of the extent
of demolition to be undertaken under this follow-on project. On the basis of a list compiled by the Division
of Education, Culture, Youth & Sports, the project will undertake an inspection and selection of sites
suitable for construction by the project. This will also confirm which schools would be retained as part of
- 31 -



the new feeder school system at the district level and which buildings among the selected school would need
replacement.
2.5.13 Action framework. During project preparation, an action framework (see chart below) for the safe
handling of demolition materials and toilet sewage was developed and agreed. Implementing the mitigation
measures would be the responsibility governmental units in collaboration with the school community and
other groups in civil society, including NGOs:
(a)    At the project level, the PMU's Project Architect would ensure that bidding documents
contain the required provisions for disposal of debris, including the government's asbestos
guidelines (which forms part of the standard bidding documents). The project architects
and engineers would ensure compliance during construction when sites are visited as part
of supervision of works.
(b)    The PMU's coordinator for social mobilization and communications would be responsible
for developing short programs for training local education officials on school hygiene and
toilet maintenance, safe disposal of school garbage, and monitoring school construction
contractors' removal and disposal of demolition materials.
(c)    Officials of the District Education Authority, school principals, and teachers would be
included in the above project training programs. Cooperating NGOs would also be
provided training.
(d)    School officials and NGOs would collaborate in extending training to school committees
and the community at large.

Annex 4: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
EAST TIMOR: FUNDAMENTAL SCHOOL QUALITY PROJECT
Summary of Benefits and Costs:
4.1    The economic assessment undertaken for this project involved three steps: (i) establishing the
relationship between education and earnings, to assess policy implications, (ii) estimating the social returns
to public investment in education, and (iii) estimating the intemal rate of return of the project which seeks
to expand access to primary and junior secondary education largely through the improvement of the
physical infrastructure of schools.
The Relationship between Education and Earnings
4.2    The usual economic assessment methodology relies on a labor force survey to provide data on
wages, levels of education, and occupations to determine private rates of return to education, usually
according to a log-linear equation estimated by OLS or some other procedure. This generates a private
income stream that can then be combined with costs of education to estimate the internal rates of return. In
East Timor, after the referendum of 1999, no labor force survey or household survey has been undertaken
that would provide the data for that usual economic analysis. For this reason, historical data from the
Indonesia labor force survey (Sakernas) of 1998 which contained data from all provinces, including East
Timor, was used to estimate the private rates of return to schooling.
4.3    Table I presents the estimates of the earnings differentials by various levels and types of education
in East Timor, in comparison with those in Indonesia in 1998.2 Controlling for experience, the average
monthly wages in East Timor were lower than those in Indonesia. However, the relationship between
education and earnings was much stronger in East Timor (R-square statistics = 0.62 in the basic model)
than that in Indonesia (R-square statistics = 0.38). Adding the occupation variables did not improve the
explanatory power of the basic model in East Timor (R-square statistics = 0.63). This was likely to be due
to a scarcity of skills in East Timor, leading to a much higher premium at the tertiary level.
4.4    The return to primary education, versus no education, was small (about 20%) and statistically
insignificant, reflecting poor quality and low completion rates. However, the retums to junior secondary
education, versus no education, was high (57%), and those to senior secondary education, also versus no
education, was 72%. Returns to technical senior education (107%) was almost as high as that to university
(114%), indicating a strong demand for the technician level of skills in East Timor. Male workers earned,
on average, over 37% more than females. Public sector workers earned, on average, over 55% more than
private sector workers.
4.5    These findings have important implications for education policy. Because education is an important
channel for improving earnings, it is instrumental for poverty alleviation. Since the low return to primary
education indicates that continuing to provide a poor quality primary education is inadequate to alleviate
poverty, the policy objective in the medium term should be improving quality in primary education and
extending access to junior secondary education, as well as promoting girls education.
The Mincerian approach estimates the rates of returns of education to individuals (i.e., private, rather than social, or returns to society). The equation
of the Ordinary Least Square regression analysis of the main model is as follows:
log of monthly wage = age + age-squared + education level (zero for no education) + male (zero for female) + uroan (zero for rural) + govemrnent (zero for
non-government).

Returns to Donor Financing of Education
4.6    The mission used (i) the wage data from the Indonesian Labor Force Survey (Sakemas 1998) to
calculate the benefits of education and to construct the foregone earnings (opportunity costs) of attending
school; (ii) the household consumption data from the Indonesian Household Survey (Susenas, 1999) to
estimate the private costs of education (on school fees, books, transport, uniforms, and lunch); and (iii) the
CFET expenditure on education of 2000 to construct the public costs. The summary table was presented in
the text of the PAD and will not be repeated here.
Cost-benefit Analysis
4.7    The largest component of the project is to upgrade 65 primary schools, which will benefit 15,600
primary school students, and to build 14 integrated demonstration schools, escolas basicas, that will be
shared by 3,360 primary school students and 5,040 junior secondary school students. The total
beneficiaries are 18,960 primary school students and 5,040 junior secondary school students who would
not have had access to education without the project.
4.8    The costs of school rehabilitation and new construction would be about US$11 million. The
- 36 -



incremental recurrent costs would include (i) additional 379 primary school teachers at US$559,699 per
annum, (ii) 126 junior secondary school teachers at US$234,360 per annum, (iii) maintenance of the
buildings at about 2% of the construction cost at US$222,000 per year, and (iv) instructional materials at
US$164,160 per year (at US$6 per primary pupil and US$ 10 per junior secondary pupil).
4.9    The benefits would be increased lifetime earnings. Workers with a primary education earned on
average about US$41 more than those without any education per annum for 50 years, but they incurred an
average of US$4 of private cost (tuition fees, books, transports, etc.) and US$16 in foregone earnings
annually for six years while in primary school.' Similarly, workers with ajunior secondary education
earned on average US$70 more than primary educated workers per annum for 50 years, and also incurred
an average of US$13 in private cost and US$76 in foregone earnings for spending three years in junior
secondary schools.
4.10   The internal rates of return to the project is affected by three major factors: (i) the rates of student
repetition, promotion, dropout and transition from one cycle to the next (internal efficiency), which
determines how many graduates will enter the labor market and how soon; (ii) the demand for labor which
affects the employment rates and wage rates of the graduates; and (iii) an improvement in the quality of
education that has led to an enhancement in productivity. This analysis did not address the quality issue
because the necessary data (such as test scores) needed as a basis to estimate the benefits of higher quality
are not yet available. It mainly assessed how internal efficiency and employment rates affect the IRR and
NPV.
4.11   The base case assumed the following: (i) wages would remain at the 1998 level (that is, before the
referendum); (ii) all students who entered the system would finish school on time, with no repetition or
dropout; and (iii) all graduates from each cycle entered the labor market and were employed throughout
their life time. In this case, the internal rates of return would be about 9% and the net present value of the
net benefit would be US$41 million at a discount rate of 4% and US$3.4 million at 8%. However, this is
the ideal world. Closer to reality is a system with some wastage, unemployment, and certain portion of the
graduates continuing on the next cycle.
The number of additional teachers needed is based on an estimated students-to-teacher ratio of 50:1 in primary
schools and 40:1 in junior secondary schools. This is below the ratio desired by the country. However, given the
plan of expansion has been incorporated into the budget request for 2001/02, these new teachers will be additional
to the "new teachers" already requested.
The cost-benefit analysis purposefully did not add the public sector wage premium when calculating the earnings
differentials between workers with different levels of education. Although newly created employment after the
referendum concentrates mainly in the public sector, as well as in construction and services, given the size of the
fiscal deficit, the public sector cannot be expected to absorb more workers in the future (see IMF Statement in the
Canberra Donors' Meeting, June 14-15, 2001).
The costs of household spending on education was drawn by inference from those in "other islands" of Indonesia
in the Susenas Household Survey of 1999. The mission did not analyze the dataset but took the number from
Pradhan, Menno and Robert Sparrow. 2000. Basic education outcomes during crisis: An analysis using the 1995,
1997, 1998 and 1999 SUSENAS. World Bank paper.

4.12      A more realistic analysis presents a different scenario (Table 2). The promotion rate would be
90%, repetition, 8%, and dropout, 2% in each grade, except at the end of each cycle. In Grade 6, due to
high unemployment rates of primary graduates andlor an increase in supply of places in junior secondary
education, only 50% of students would enter the labor market while the rest would continue with their
education or become idle. After Grade 9, only 60%/o would enter the labor market. Although it is highly
positive if more young people have higher levels of educational attainment, further expansion of the
education system would entail additional capital and recurrent costs, which is beyond the scope of this
analysis.
4.13      This scenario found that the internal rates of return to be just under 4%, and the net present value
to be US$845,706 discounted at 4%, and a negative US$3 million discounted at 8%. This illustrates that
improvement in intemal and external efficiency is critical to having a higher rates of return to investment in
education. Table 3 illustrates how the repetition, promotion and dropout rates would affect the internal and
external efficiency. To improve efficiency, it is necessary to invest in quality enhancing inputs, most
notably textbooks and instructional materials and teacher pre-service and in-service training.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
EAST TIMOR: FUNDAMENTAL SCHOOL QUALITY PROJECT
Procurement
6.1   Procurement of works and goods will follow the Bank's Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and September 1997 and
January 1999 - the Guidelines). Standard bidding documents will be used for all Bank-financed
procurement; where standard documents are not available, documents acceptable to the Bank will be used.
The Bank's Standard Bid Evaluation Form: Procurement of Goods or Works (April 1996) and Sample
Form of Evaluation Report: Selection of Consultznts (October 1999) will be used for submission of
evaluation reports to the Bank.
6.2    Selection of consultant services will be based on the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999 - the
Guidelines). The Bank's Standard Request for Proposals: Selection of Consultants (includes Standard
Forms Contract) - (July 1997, revised April 1998 and July 1999) will be used for selection.
6.3    The Procurement Plan for the proposed project (July 2001-January 2003), providing a timeline for
each step of the procurement process, is in the Project Implementation Plan. The plan will be updated by
the Project Management Unit (PMU) on a quarterly basis and reviewed by the Bank.
Procurement Capacity Assessment
6.4    As part of project appraisal, assessments of procurement and financial management capacity were
conducted in May 2001. These included analyses of legal bases, project management, organization and
functions, staffing, support and control systems, record-keeping, the general procurement environment, and
project risks.
6.5    The capacity assessment found that UNTAET governmental regulations are, in general, acceptable
to the Bank. (UNTAET/REG/2000/10, On Public Procurementfor Civil Administration in East Timor -
the Regulations - were prepared with the assistance of World Bank funded consultants.) The Regulations
are supported by the Public Procurement Manual for Civil Administration in East Timor. The
Regulations (sec. 29) and the manual (sec. 10) contain conflict of interest clauses. The Regulations require
advertisement in the Official Gazette of East Timor for all invitations to bid for goods, works and services
to be procured either nationally or intemationally (sec. 9; see also para. 6.8 (c), below); public bid opening
on the date and time of bid submission (sec. 17); all bids to be evaluated based only on the criteria set forth
in the bidding documents (sec. 18); contract award to be made to the bidder with the lowest price meeting
the criteria stated in the bidding documents (sec. 20). The manual provides for all procurement to be
conducted through an open tendering process and for all bidders to be given a minimum of 30 calendar
days to respond to an invitation to bid. The manual also contains a gratuity clause in addition to the conflict
of interest clause (sec. 10, "Procurement Methods"). All public procurement is bound by the above.
6.6    There are, however, aspects of the Regulations which are not compliant with the Bank's
Guidelines: (i) Sec. 4 restricts payment to US dollars, whereas the Bank allows bids and payments in the
currency of any member country; (ii) Sec. 8, "Contents of Invitation," does not include a completion
schedule, the draft contract, or the bid evaluation criteria; (iii) Sec. 9.1 requires invitations to be published
only in the Official Gazette of East Timor and does not specify the minimum duration to close of bids; (iv)
- 42 -



Secs. 10- 13 do not clearly specify prequalification requirements; (v) Sec. 16 does not provide guidance on
the amount of bid security; and (vi) Sec. 25.2 does not require the inclusion of the draft contract form in
requests for proposals for consulting services. In addition, national laws and regulations on the
establishment of corporations and their operation (e.g., bankruptcy provisions) are yet to be promulgated.
The latter contributes to generally higher risks in the procurement environment. Some of the needed laws
and regulations have been drafted, but their passage is not expected until after the August 2001 elections.
6.7    Nonetheless, the Regulations provide that for Bank- or donor-funded procurement, the relevant
Bank or donor procurement guidelines have precedence in case of discrepancy (sec. 2.2). Thus procurement
procedures will be those set out in the Bank's Guidelines.
6.8    For national competitive bidding (NCB), the procurement procedures shall be those set forth in the
Regulations, with the following clarifications for compliance with the provisions of para. 3.3 of the Bank's
Guidelines.
(a) Procurement will be in accordance with sec. 5.1 of the Regulations, but the exceptions
provided in sec. 5 shall not be valid for NCB.
(b) Sec. 9.1 shall be modified to provide advertisement in the national press, and bidders will have
a minimum of 30 days from the date of advertisement, or availability of bidding documents,
whichever is later, to prepare bids.
(c) Sec. 14.3 (g) shall be modified to read: "the criteria to be used in evaluating proposals and
their relative weight, shall be expressed in monetary terms."
(d) Sec. 15.6 shall be revised to clarify that the procuring entity may request extension of the bid
validity period, but suppliers shall not be required to extend the validity date after bids have
been submitted.
(e) Sec. 16 shall be revised to clarify that the bid security shall be set in such a way as not to
unduly deter the participation of bidders.
(f) Sec. 18.4, on domestic preference, will not apply.
The above clarifications are reflected in the Annex to the Procurement Schedule of the Grant Agreement.
6.9    The Regulations provide the PMU Project Director with delegated authority to US$100,000
equivalent for project procurement. For procurement actions (for works, goods or consultant services)
greater than US$100,000, a Contracts Review Committee (CRC) established by UNTAET reviews
technical specifications or terms of reference; ascertains that the tender process complied with regulations
for the duration of calls for expressions of interest or for proposals; ascertains that the evaluation criteria
were appropriate and applied as called for in the request or bidding document; verifies the bid evaluation
report and availability and sufficiency of funds. After CRC clearance, the Central Procurement Unit
(CPU), also established by UNTAET, awards a contract, employing the appropriate Bank standard format.
The CRC review process does not replace the Bank's prior review of procurement actions with estimated
expenditures above the prior review thresholds summarized in Table B (below).
6.10   In the first education project, the Emergency School Readiness Project (ESRP), PMU procurement
capacity in the half-year from effectiveness was weak, even though an international firm which formed the
Construction Management Unit had been contracted to undertake procurement for the project. In November
- 43 -



2000, a Bank post review of procurement under Statements of Expenditures (SOE) identified
noncompliance with intemational shopping procedures, including incomplete and inappropriately filed
documentation, instances where three quotations were not available for cost comparisons, and non-use of
standard bidding documentation. In January 2001, an intemational consultant was recruited, who managed
project procurement as the project's Procurement Officer. In May 2001, the capacity assessment found the
following: evidence that the recommendations of the earlier SOE review had been acted on; improved
documentation procedures; solicitation of at least three written quotes for cost comparison; and use of
IBRD standard bidding documents. Further, communication between the procurement and finance units of
the PMU had improved, and an East Timorese coumterpart to the procurement officer was being trained
specifically in World Bank procurement procedures. The reappointment of the Procurement Officer, or the
appointment of a consultant with similar knowledge and experience, is a condition of effectiveness for this
second project.
Institutional Arrangements
6.11   The PMU of the Division of Education, C'ulture, Youth & Sports (DECYS) is staffed by East
Timorese nationals and intemational staff appointed and funded by the Government (UNTAET) as well as
consultants funded by ESRP. Currently, ESRP-fuwded consultants fill the following PMU posts: Project
Manager, Procurement Officer, Financial Management Officer, and Social Mobilization and
Communications Officer.
6.12   As conditions of effectiveness, the Government is required to maintain during the life of this
proposed follow-on project the PMU with the following key staff- Project Director, Project Manager,
Project Architect, Procurement Officer, and Financial Management Officer. To support project
management, the project will fund technical assistance consultants in the following key areas - project
management, policy development, architectural design, procurement, and financial management. The
consultants will be appointed only after Bank review and no-objection to their qualifications, experience,
terms of reference, and terms of employment.
6.13   The Procurement Officer will be directly responsible for preparing all procurement documents.
Contracts for works, goods or consultant services greater than US$100,000 or equivalent will be awarded
by UNTAET's Central Procurement Unit (CPU) after review and clearance of the bidding or selection
process by the CRC. Both types of contract - those above the threshold of US$ 100,000-equivalent
awarded by the CPU and those below this threshold awarded by the PMU - will employ appropriate
standard Bank contract formats.
6.14   The Financial Management Officer, in close coordination with the Procurement Officer, will
prepare all purchase orders. In all cases, the Financial Management Officer will ensure that funds are
available. The Project Director will countersign the purchase order before procurement commences. The
Financial Management Officer will oversee disbursement and accounting for all procurement actions and
will prepare replenishment requests for the Special Account in accordance with standard operating
procedures agreed by the Bank and detailed in the Operations Manual prepared for ESRP and revised and
updated for this project.
Procurement of Works (US$9.0 million)
6.15   International competitive bidding (ICB),, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. II of the
Guidelines, will be used for all new construction contracts which are estimated to cost US$500,000
equivalent or greater. About five prototype escolas basicas, combined primary and junior secondary
- 44 -



schools, will be constructed at an estimated aggregate cost of about US$2.8 million. Bidders will be
prequalified. The bid package will offer the opportunity to bid on one or more of five "slices" in accordance
with sec. 2.4 of the Guidelines. Bank standard bidding documentation and contracts will be used.
6.16   National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used for works estimated to cost less than
US$500,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount no to exceed US$5.9 million equivalent for
(i) upgrading at least nine junior secondary schools to the escola basica standard of the project and (ii)
upgrading about 65 primary schools to the standard of fundamental quality of the project. There will be
about nine individual packages for the escola basica upgrades, with an estimated aggregate cost of
approximately US$3.6 million. Contracts for the 65 fundamental quality upgrades will be packaged on a
district basis, the expected 13 contracts totaling US$2.3 million.
6.17   Procurement of small works (PSW). Works estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per
contract up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$300,000 equivalent may be procured under
lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of written quotations obtained from at least three
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed
description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of
agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the
contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work and has the experience and resources
to complete the contract successfully. There will be about 20 packages for minor rehabilitation of schools
in remote areas.
Procurement of Goods and Related Services (US$2.3 million)
6.18   International competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with the provisions of Sec. II of the
Guidelines, will be used to procure, under a single contract, about 320,000 copies of books for learning
Portuguese as a second language, with an estimated value of US$900,000.
6.19   National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used for an estimated four contracts to procuie
school furniture estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount
not to exceed US$700,000 equivalent. NCB procedures will not discriminate against foreign bidders and
will incorporate revisions to the Regulations where there is inconsistency between national procurement
procedures and the Guidelines as detailed in the Annex to the Procurement Schedule of the Grant
Agreement.
6.20   International shopping (IS) will be used for approximately 20 contracts estimated to cost less
than US$30,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$400,000 equivalent,
to procure school equipment and other teaching and learning materials, including science demonstration
kits, minor classroom and office equipment (typewriters, computers and peripherals, electronic media) in
accordance with Sec. 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines. Contracts will be awarded after solicitation and
evaluations of at least three written quotations from eligible qualified suppliers; the quotations must be
received from bidders in at least two different countries.
6.21   National shopping (NS) will be used for approximately 30 contracts estimated to cost less than
US$10,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$300,000 equivalent, to
procure school equipment and teaching and learning materials and services for the distribution of books and
furniture to schools. Contracts will be awarded after solicitation and evaluation of at least three written
price quotations from eligible qualified domestic suppliers.
- 45 -



Consultants' Services (US$2.5 million)
6.22   Quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) will be used for contracts in amounts greater than
USS 100,000 equivalent per contract. Under the project a single contract with a consulting firm for the
design and supervision of school construction and rehabilitation, to an estimated value of US$ 1.1 million
will be awarded.
6.23   Least cost selection (LCS) in accordance with Sec. 3.7 of the Guidelines will be used for
contracting annual project audits up to an estimated aggregate of US$40,000.
6.24   Selection of individual consultants (SIC), in accordance with Sec. V of the Guidelines, will be
used for contracting approximately 26 qualified individuals under contracts estimated to cost less than
US$50,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1.3 million equivalent for
policy studies, community mobilization campaigns, and management support to the PMU.
Operating Costs (US$0.3 million)
6.25   The project will finance reasonable expenditures by the PMU for bank charges and project auditing
costs, and PMU staff travel, per diems, communications and consumables (but excluding staff salaries) to
an aggregate of US$300,000.
Procurement Review
6.26   All contracts for works estimated to cost US$50,000 or more and all contracts for goods estimated
to cost US$30,000 or more will be subject to prior review by the Bank. This implies that prior review by
the Bank of works and goods will include all international competitive bidding (ICB), and all contracts
awarded on the basis of national competitive bidding (NCB). In addition, the first contract for goods using
international shopping (IS), the first contract for goods using national shopping (NS), and the first contract
for the procurement of small works (PSW) will also be subject to prior review by the Bank. The rest of the
procurement of works and goods will be subject lto ex-post review, with a target of 20% of contracts by
number and 50% by value to be reviewed.
6.27   Prior review by the Bank of consultant services will include all terms of reference, regardless of the
contract value, contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more for consultant services provided
by firms, and individual consultant contracts estimnated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or more. The rest of
the procurement of consultant services will be subject to quarterly ex-post review, with a target of 20% of
contracts by number and 50% by value to be reviewed.
6.28   The total value of contracts subject to prior review under the above arrangements is estimated at
US$ 11.5 million or 83% of total project cost. The very high percentage of contracts subject to prior review
reflects the high percentage of project expenditure on major ICB and NCB civil works contracts. Overall
procurement risk assessment:

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
6.30   Disbursements for contracts for works at or above US$50,000 and for goods at or above
US$20,000, and contracts for services at or above US$100,000 for consulting firms, and at or above
US$50,000 for individual consultants would be fully documented. Disbursements for all other
expenditures, would be against statements of expenditure, whereby supporting documentation is to be
retained by the implementing agencies and made available to the Bank for review during supervision.
Special account:
6.31   To facilitate timely project implementation UNTAET will establish a Special Account
denominated in US dollars under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank with a commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation for the Special Account will be US$2.0 million. The
replenishment applications should be submitted by PMU and/or UNTAET/CFA on a monthly basis or
when the balance of the Special Account is 20% of the initial amount, whichever occurs earlier. The
Special Account will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Financial Management
Financial Management Assessment
6.32   At the national level, the UNTAET Financial Office in Dili is responsible for all accounting and
reporting activities. There is a proposal to establish a Central Fiscal Authority (CFA) to assume financial
management responsibilities of UNTAET. The fi nancial management functions of the CFA are being
established and staff are being recruited. The basic institutional framework is therefore being built, upon
which to establish sound intemal control procedures and accounting and reporting arrangements. In late
March 2001, a Senior Disbursement Officer of the Bank conducted a training seminar on Bank
disbursement procedures for UNTAET staff in Dili. However, as most of the CFA staff had not yet been
recruited at the time, further training would be needed, as various projects become effective.
- 50 -



6.33   At the project level, the Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Emergency School Readiness
Project (ESRP) will assume the management responsibilities of this follow-on project. UNTAET will
maintain a Project Director, the focal point for all management and financial matters between IJNTAET
and the PMU and also between the Bank and UNTAET, and a Financial Management Officer, specifically
responsible for financial management of the project. These appointments are conditions of effectiveness of
this project.
6.34   However, to ensure operational effectiveness in implementation during a period of political
transition, the project will provide supportive technical assistance, to enable the PMU to contract selected
services to management consulting firms or qualified individuals during these extraordinary circumstances.
This management flexibility will be useful, as the new government may as yet be unable to fully staff its
management positions. The services may include procurement, contract management, management of cash
flow of the project, operation of the Special Account, maintenance of all accounting of project
expenditures, retention of all receipts, vouchers and justifications, periodic reporting to UNTAET and the
Bank, preparation of annual financial statements of the project, recruitment of extemal auditors and
submission of annual report to UNTAET and the Bank.
6.35   For adequate financial management for the project, the responsibilities of the PMI will be clearly
specified in the project Operational Manual:
(a) Establishment of an adequate accounting and intemal control systems to ensure that grant
finds flow for all components of the project in a timely fashion;
(b) Management of Special Account to be established under the Project, including requesting
replenishments into the SA in accordance with Bank procedures;
(c) Maintenance of adequate accounting records for all project expenditures and its components;
(d) Preparation of quarterly project monitoring reports, with contents and formats agreed with the
Bank;
(e) Safekeeping of all vouchers, receipts, evidence of payments to substantiate project
expenditures;
(f) Contracting of external auditors for biannual audits; and
(g) Preparation of biannual financial statements for the project, for audit and submit the biannual
audit report not later than three months after the middle and end of the project year.
Accounting, Reporting, Auditing
6.36   The primary responsibility for maintaining accounting records for the project will be with the
PMU's Financial Management Officer who will establish appropriate accounting and intemal control
procedures for authorizing payments, recording of all project related expenditures, periodic financial
reporting and preparation of annual financial statements for extemal audit. The accounting system should
be designed to maintain separate project accounts for World Bank-funded activities in accordance with the
Trust Fund Grant Agreement. The Financial Management Officer will ensure that quarterly and annual
financial reports comparing budgeted and actual expenditures are prepared for the project. The draft
- 51 -



formats of the reports will be agreed at negotiations. The financial reports shall be prepared and submitted
to the Bank no later than 60 days following the end of the quarter.
6.37   UNTAET will carry out internal auditing of project activities. The PMU will prepare biannual
financial statements of the project and have them audited by an independent external auditor acceptable to
the Bank. The auditor will be required to provide an opinion on the financial statements, the operation of
the Special Account, and the withdrawals from the grant based on statements of expenditures (SOEs.) The
independent auditor will appointed on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
