I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of the design of this project in 2006 Southern Sudan was part of Sudan,
the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa by land area. It is relatively resource rich, despite
desertification in some parts of the country, but it has been affected severely by conflicts for
five of the six decades since independence in 1956. Southern Sudan comprised 25% of the
country’s land area. Within its borders lies the best and most productive land of the Sudan,
and also most of the oil resources. However until the signing of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) on January 9, 2005 none of these resource endowments were contributing
to improving the social and economic indicators of Southern Sudan. The agricultural
potential was largely unutilized due to the civil war and poor rural infrastructure. The oil
produced in Southern Sudan was transported to the north and contributed significantly to the
revenues of the Republic of Sudan but there was little evidence of government revenues
financing development or public service delivery in the South. MDG indicators in south were
inadequately monitored and where available showed a significant and near universal under-
achievement in comparison to the achievements in the North, clearly illustrating the effects of
marginalization.

2.      South Sudan suffered from over five decades of marginalization. The British viewed
it primarily as a barrier between the Islamic North and Christian East Africa and
consequently encouraged its tribal and under developed character as a buffer area.
Independence in 1956 merely replaced Western colonialists with North Sudan “Arab? elites.
Barring a brief period of a decade from 1972, post the Addis Ababa Accord (under which the
South was given regional autonomy which was also de facto withdrawn and sharia law re-
imposed from 1983) the south has always been under Northern domination. Over four
decades of war had completed destroyed even the scant infrastructure existing from the 1970s.
With the Sudan People’s Liberation Army occupying an ever expanding segment of the rural
areas the forces of the Republic of Sudan were wedged into three garrison towns, two of
which Wau and Malakal are close to the northern border and could be supplied from
Khartoum by road while Juba was supplied by river and air transport from Khartoum.
Decades of war had reduced agriculture to subsistence farming with the bulk of the
population relying on relief and food aid to survive. Public services were in short supply and
public administration minimal and of grossly inadequate quality.

3.     Some of the key events are set out chronologically below.

       2003: In the run-up to the signing of the Comprehensive Pease Agreement (See
       below) the Bank prepared a Country Re-engagement Note (CRN). The CRN outlined
       the Bank’s strategy and programs in support of the consolidation of peace and the
       post-conflict transition to recovery and development in Sudan.

       2004/05: The Bank and UN co-led a Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) of Sudan’s
       recovery, reconstruction, and development needs, culminating in the Oslo Donor
       Conference in March 2005.      The report of the Joint Assessment Mission (JAM)
       entitled “Framework for Sustained Peace, Development and Poverty Eradication?
       (March 2005) was prepared jointly by the Government of Sudan, the SPLM, the
       United Nations and the World Bank. It provided the only framework for support at the


                                               1
time the project was designed in 2006. The JAM report developed a Poverty
Eradication Strategy concept note committing stakeholders to the articulation of a
development program addressing the achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals and reconstruction following years of conflict. The overarching objective was
to build a foundation for sustained broad-based development. Some of the actions
were: (i) to build a decentralized, multi-layered governance structure spanning GoSS,
State and appropriate local levels, that is characterized            by transparency,
accountability and equitable resource allocations; (ii) to implement comprehensive
capacity building and institutional strengthening programs at all levels; and (iii) to
create an enabling environment for private sector promotion, with a special emphasis
on rural development and small and medium enterprises, including access to credit on
reasonable terms.

2005: The CPA signed between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement (SPLM) marked the end of 21 years of civil war and heralded a
new era of peace, reconstruction and development for Sudan. It also established the
Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan under which the Government of Southern
Sudan (GoSS) was established as a semi-autonomous entity. It also included special
provisions for the Three Areas, for improved decentralization within the Northern
States, and for national elections in 2009. It also provided for a referendum to be held
on January 9, 2011 on whether Southern Sudan should separate and form a new
country at the end of the CPA period. GoSS was established in October 2005, and its
constitution was adopted in December 2005. Its civil service incorporated members
of the SPLM, southern Sudanese who were working with the erstwhile Coordination
Council for Southern Sudan, and fresh appointees. GoSS’s physical infrastructure
was being rehabilitated and institutional structures still being developed. Whilst
GoSS was still in the process of evolving an organized structure, defining the
processes and systems for governance and recruiting and training the civil service to
deliver results, its public service was already overstaffed, due to employment of large
numbers of unskilled or inadequately qualified personnel. At the same time there was
a severe shortage of qualified, professional staff, especially for the delivery of basic
services. Employment in the public service risked becoming an expensive and
inefficient substitute for social security schemes for integrating the war affected,
widows, orphans, the disabled and the disadvantaged. From 2006 onwards salaries
consumed a very large share of the GoSS annual budget. The crowding out of basic
service delivery funding needs by salary costs was even greater at the state level.

2006: As part of the Wealth Sharing Protocol in the Wealth Sharing Agreement of the
CPA, two Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) to finance reconstruction and
rehabilitation programs were established under the administration of the World Bank.
The core rationale for the MDTFs was as a facility that could rapidly provide financial
resources from pooled donor contributions for the most urgent development programs
and projects to reconstruct and rehabilitate conflict affected areas, leading to the
generation of increased employment, incomes and reductions in poverty. The World
Bank was invited to administer the two MDTFs. The Bank prepared an Interim
Strategy Note in December. The key focus of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) in the
South was to help build a responsive and viable government based on good
governance, rule of law, and transparency, whilst promoting efforts to empower and
decentralize service delivery to the states, counties, and communities. Another key
objective was to help Southern Sudan transform it into a well-integrated, self-reliant,


                                       2
       and viable economic unit that would begin to harness its vast and rich natural
       resources for the welfare of its people. It was envisaged that substantial financial
       support through the MDTFs and advisor support of the Bank would be mobilized to
       meet these objectives. It also noted that a number of medium-term actions were
       needed to improve the quality of the civil service in Southern Sudan. These would
       include an extensive training plan to build civil service ethos, common skill standards
       within a grade/job type and common operating standards and procedures, and
       development of a medium-term framework for the civil service. The latter would
       define goals and objectives, operational standards, optimal organizational structures,
       job descriptions, minimum qualifications, workforce requirements for different
       functions, structure of regulations and incentives. GoSS’s institutional capacity
       constraints were assessed as being much greater, and the size of the challenge
       multiplied by the ongoing process of establishing a functioning government from
       scratch in a war-devastated region.

4.      Southern Sudan had considerable support from Development Partners (DPs) even
before the formal commencement of the government’s functioning. The Capacity Building
Trust Fund (CBTF), United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNDP) were providing significant
support in the governance area. The core areas of formulation of a public service law and
regulations was supported by USAID, payroll development was taken up by the CBTF,
support for the GoSS revenue and tax was provided by USAID, TA support for Public
Financial Management (PFM) was similarly being provided by the USAID. UNDP had been
providing support in the area of Local Government and Technical Assistance (TA) support
for the Presidency. A Low Income Countries under Stress (LICUS) supported grant provided
TA and equipment support for PFM and Public Service Reform. CBTF and the LICUS grant
jointly funded the first HR audit of the GoSS.

5.     In the context of extensive, though splintered and opportunistic Development Partners
(DP) support, especially in view of the inadequate capacity within government to coordinate
and manage DP support, the Capacity Building, Institutional and Human Resource
Development (CABIHRD) was primarily used by government as a gap filling measure in the
broad area of public service reform, institutional and capacity building.

6.     Against this context, the Capacity Building, Institutional and Human Resource
Development (CABIHRD) project was designed in 2006 as part of the portfolio of the Multi-
Donor Trust Fund for Southern Sudan. It was conceived as a capacity building intervention
implemented by the GoSS to help it discharge its core public service, human resource
development and capacity building functions.
        
7.     In 2006 there was a real sense of optimism amongst both international partners and
GoSS about what could be achieved during the CPA period. However, earlier expectations of
a capable government quickly emerging from the CPA process were not met, largely because
they were bases on the impressions given by a small sample of SPLM leaders based in
Nairobi at the time of the peace negotiations. These people were quickly dissipated across the
large number of leadership positions that subsequently opened up in GoSS, the Government
of National Unity in Khartoum, the legislatures, and sub national governments.

                                              3
The Project Development Objectives were two fold, namely:

8.     To provide the foundation for effective, efficient and transparent functioning of the
GoSS by: (i) strengthening the capacity of key ministries; (ii), improving the management of
information within government; and, (iii) enhancing the government’s capacity for internal
and external communications.

9.     To increase access to labor market, welfare and vocational training services by
developing the government’s capacity for regulating the labor market and designing and
implementing labor market and vocational training programs.

12.     The Final Project Proposal (FPP) identifies the key beneficiaries as GoSS and the
state governments, officials of these governments through the capacity development program,
the Ministries of Labour, Public Service and Human Resource Development (HRD);
Information and Broadcasting; Telecommunications and Postal Service and Cabinet Affairs
and the SSCSC, through specific capacity development interventions; the citizens of Juba and
the general public in Southern Sudan and abroad and external stakeholders who have access
to the internet; employers and the workforce, including women in Juba, Wau, Malakal and
Rumbek where the four VTCs are based.

1.5 Original Components

There were four components approved in the Project Proposal Document, namely:

Component 1: Strengthening of the Public Service (US$ 4.64 million)

o Subcomponent 1A: Regulatory Framework. To establish and implement a robust
  regulatory framework for the Public Service through finalization, approval, dissemination
  and implementation of a Human Resources Manual and Public Sector Act and
  Regulations and a model State Public Service Act and Regulations to be framed through a
  consultative process for adoption by the states.

o Development of a medium term framework for administrative decentralization and the
  management of the civil service including: clarification of functions between GoSS, State
  and County; a policy/legislative framework for development/management of the public
  service to meet medium term needs; HR interventions to build the overall capability of
  the public service to deliver the strategic objectives and plans of the GoSS; and creating
  capacity for management and functional reviews.

o Subcomponent 1B: Support to the Southern Sudan Civil Service Commission, including
  assistance for framing its Policy Statement and Agenda for Action; advice for the
  constitution of similar commissions in the states and for improving the draft Act &
  Regulations, provision of office equipment and vehicles, and training of members and
  staff, study tours and institutional twinning.

o Subcomponent 1C: Public Service Training. Training of 2845 officials at the professional
  level in GoSS and the states.

Component 2: Labour Market and Vocational Training Capacity Building (US$ 5.53
million)




                                             7
o Subcomponent 2A: Policy and Capacity to Regulate the Labour Market., involving the
  rehabilitation of 3 existing Labour Offices (with the ILO), the provision of equipment and
  staff training.

o Subcomponent 2B: Policy and Vocational Training. Activities were proposed to improve
  access to and relevance of Vocational Training by financing the renovation and equipping
  of the three regional vocational training centers at Juba, Malakal, Wau and the
  establishment of the center in Aluakluak and the development of the Southern Sudan
  Vocational Training Policy (SSVTP) and training of the existing staff in these three VTCs.

Component 3: Communications and Information Services (US$ 2.49 million)

13.     To strengthen the infrastructure and capacity of internal and external communications
and availability of information to the public, it was proposed to fill key gaps in internal GoSS
and GoSS-State government connectivity, information technology, and public information.
To this end, the following six sub-components were proposed:

o Subcomponent 3A: Video-conferencing between GoSS and States: The VSAT and GoSS
  network servers, under the existing Rapid Impact Emergency Project (RIEP), were
  proposed to be upgraded to enable them to carry VC services between the ten states and
  two GoSS sites in Juba, shared by the ministries together with a comprehensive training
  of the technical staff responsible for the operation of the service. A Pilot to test an initial
  system of facilities connecting one site in Juba and one site in a State capital and building
  capacity for technical staff by using these two sites as training centers would be carried
  out. This would be followed by a scale-up subject to successful testing, piloting, and
  robust network maintenance this phase would be upgraded to provide video-conferencing
  services in all the ten State capitals.

o Subcomponent 3B: Government Internal and External Website Development and
  Information Management. The sub-component was designed to provide for equipment
  and software, and training to staff. Its implementation would be phased with the first
  phase focusing on development of the external website, training of staff and
  establishment of systems and processes within GoSS to manage web content generation
  and hosting. Once this phase was successfully completed the web site would be made
  more dynamic with complex facilities like interactivity and the GoSS Intranet would be
  developed.

o Subcomponent 3C: Email: An analysis of requirements, software, and installation of an
  internal email system in the GoSS, and training to technical administrators and users was
  proposed in ministries which had been connected to the GoSS communication system.

o Subcomponent 3D: Electronic Records and Document Management (EDRM). This was
  proposed as a pilot in the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs as a secure repository of documents
  and records connected with the work of the Cabinet through the provision of equipment,
  software, and training for staff. Subject to successful piloting of the system, it was
  proposed to be scaled up to other ministries. The FPP also recognized that for effective
  implementation of the above four subcomponents, GoSS would need to make
  arrangements to ensure that adequate IT staff is in place reporting to the MOTPS. To this
  end the GoSS will make investments to provide ministries with IT services.

o Subcomponent 3E: Public Information. It was proposed to set up a pilot Public
  Information Center and service in Juba and training of selected staff of key ministries and
  the communications and public information team in MoI&B on public information.

o Subcomponent 3F: Technical Assistance to Ministry of Telecommunication and Postal
  Services (MoT&PS) and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoI&B) to for
  supporting the MoT&PS on telecommunication and information technology policies,
  activities and programs, including the on-going projects, and to support the MoIB on
  information and broadcasting policies, activities and programs.

Component 4: Project Management (US$ 0.61 million including allowance for
contingencies)

14.    The project was proposed to be managed by a project team led by the Ministry of
Labour and Public Service (MoLPS&HRD) and with sub-components managed by teams in
the MoTPS, MoIB and the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs (MoCA). To mitigate the risk of
delays in project implementation as a result of limited project management capacity, the
project would support training of officials from the MoLPS&HRD, MoTPS, MoCA and
MoIB to enable them to oversee and manage procurement and project implementation.
Accountants from MoLPS&HRD and MoTPS were to be trained in financial management.
The Team Leaders and the Project Director were to be trained in project management. This
was expected to build on a round of basic training provided to project staff during project
preparation through resources available in the LICUS project. This component also proposed
consultancies in procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation to
provide support to the project management team which was mainstreamed into the
government structures, study tours, office equipment (including for the PIC), and selected
operational expenses on an exceptional basis.

1.6 Revised Components

15.     The project was restructured in February 2009. The following changes were made to
project components:

Addition to Component 1: Strengthening of the Public Service

16.      In October 2008 the President of GoSS formally launched the Public Service Reforms
Program. In response to an urgent request from the government for reprioritization of
activities the project began a program of consultation, dissemination and sensitization
workshops in support of this in all the ten state government capitals. A Reforms Secretariat
was also set up in the GoSS to coordinate the reforms programs and ensure that public service
systems remain efficient and effective. TA for advising on a short term plan for
operationalising the Pension payment system was also provided. These additions were
financed from the unutilized amounts originally allocated for dissemination of public service
regulation which were never formalized. The work plan was accordingly modified without
any significant change in the component outputs or the Key Performance Indicators. Support
for implementation of the Public Service Reforms.

Scaling up of Component 2A: Policy and Capacity to Regulate the Labour Market.




                                             9
17.     The scope of this component was enlarged to scale up the training in labor
administration and employment services and appropriate equipping of staff with office
equipment and vehicles from three state level Labour Offices to seven Labour Offices. In
addition a draft Labour Act was to be formulated. The additional financing was provided
from the surplus in the original allocation for Component 2B: Policy and Vocational Training.
The surplus arose because the Ministry of Finance went ahead and directly provided
financing for building the Aluakluak VTC even before the project could firm up an
agreement with the Norwegian People’s Aid, who were the implementers. Accordingly the
project restricted financing to the residual amount required to build the VTC.

18.      These additions did not necessitate any change to the PDOs.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.     Whilst no revisions were made to PDOs or key indicators, the project undertook three
discrete exercises at reprioritizing activities and the source and volume of financing.

20.      The project was restructured in February, 2009. Along with some changes in project
components described above, as requested by the recipient, an extension of the project was
approved from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, in order to complete the
implementation of the project and allow it to further work towards the fulfillment of its
developmental objectives. The restructuring memorandum to the Country Director noted that
at that time “achievement against the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) has been uneven and
can be related to the speed with which procurement actions could be completed against each
sub component?. The extension had three key objectives, namely to:

      a) Enable the signing of the pending contract for training of the civil service which had a
         one year implementation period which extends beyond the existing closing date;
      b) Enable scaling up of the good work done by the ILO in the labor market sub
         component and implementation of the vocational training policy, to be financed from
         savings within the component; and
      c) Enable implementation of the three lagging sub components: (a) dissemination of the
         Public Service Act and Regulations and development of generic regulations for the
         states; (b) GoSS email and (c) video conferencing facilities between the states.

21.    The Grant Agreement was amended on September 15, 2009 to reduce the contribution
of the GoSS from the original US$ 5.53 to US$ 1.57 in recognition of the fiscal stress that
GoSS was under due to the collapse of oil prices at that time. The share of the MDTF was
increased from US$ 8.2 million to US$ 12.16 million so as to retain the total project amount
at US$ 13.7 million.

22.   A further no-cost extension from 31 December 2010 to 31 May 2011 was approved
on December 14, 2010 to allow for completion of ongoing activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.    The final project proposal for CABIHRD was prepared by the government in close
collaboration with the Development Partners active in the area. Overall project design was


                                                10
undertaken under the jurisdiction of the Oversight Committee (OC) of the MDTF-SS, co-
chaired by GoSS and on which the ministers of the beneficiary agencies served. The OC
passed an interim project proposal (IPP) in February 2006, and subsequently the Final Project
Proposal in November 2006.

24.     An issue facing the government at the time of project design in 2006 was that there
was very little data and experience in terms of past interventions or analysis upon which to
design a program. Southern Sudan was a new entity (not even a fully autonomous state).
Critical to the strategic management of assistance to this fledgling state was the Joint
Assessment Mission report (JAM), resulting from a joint mission of the UN, World Bank, the
Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), published in
March 2005. This was regarded as a definitive framework to translate peace into sustainable
development. Its vision was to deliver peace dividends by building infrastructure,
strengthening institutions and improving the policy environment in the post-conflict setting of
Sudan. The Joint Staff Assessment report of 2008, marking the end of the first interim phase
of the comprehensive peace agreement noted that stakeholders had responded well to the
challenge, but that what had already been achieved paled into insignificance compared to
what remained to be done. Whilst institutions of government had been set up virtually from
scratch in Southern Sudan, the JSAR noted that “…for the development interventions to be
effective and responsive to the needs of the poor and marginalized populations, the capability,
responsiveness, and accountability … GOSS will require improvement?.

25.    The FPP was realistic about what it had to work with, and work upon. It noted that
“…weak and often outdated systems, inadequate regulatory experience and capacity, an
under-trained workforce, poor infrastructure and an almost complete lack of internal
communications capability, severely limit the capacity of the government to deliver the
expected public services and the benefits of peace?.
        

26.    In recognizing this, and in taking into account the work of other development partners
(USAID, the Capacity Building trust Fund, DFID, a World Bank LICUS project, UNDP and
sector specific interventions through the MDTF) the project set out to address a highly
relevant first PDO (To provide the foundation for effective, efficient and transparent
functioning of the GoSS) highly relevant to the JAM framework and the challenges that
remained in 2008. It also set out to address labor market issues, the FPP correctly noting that
“during the JAM the area was neglected…?.

27.      The design of the project does recognize the inherent weaknesses of the public service
in Southern Sudan, but herein lies a paradox. At the heart of MDTF-SS projects is the
principle that government is the executing authority (and the World Bank the managing agent
in this process). With the benefit of hindsight these projects have suffered from poor capacity
within GoSS, particularly to manage procurement and planning. Whilst the project design in
part recognized the risks that this poses by establishing a team of project staff to manage
activities, it was also complex in its design. Its interventions spanned six GoSS entities
(Ministry of Labour and Public Service, Ministry of Human resource Development, Ministry
of Cabinet Affairs, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of
Telecommunication and Postal Services and the Southern Sudan Civil Service Commission).
The activities, too, were ambitious given the context. For example:




                                              11
o The sub-component to introduce video-conferencing across the country seems an
  enormous undertaking though this was to be implemented in two phases with a pilot
  phase preceding the full scale up and subject to successful completion of the pilot. The
  benefits of such an intervention are clear, and indeed neighboring countries such as
  Ethiopia have a track-record of some success in this regard. But such interventions are
  complex, both in terms of the technology and the procurement of relatively sophisticated
  equipment.

o Supporting the establishment of the Southern Sudan Civil Service Commission was
  laudable, but whether the institution was actually ready to benefit from a twinning
  arrangement with a more developed regional counterpart, even before a regulatory
  framework had been approved for it was uncertain.

28.    However, the project was successful in addressing context when it came to identifying
and using implementing partners. In the absence of strong counterpart/client structures, the
use of JICA, National Plan for Action (NPA), United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) and International Labour Organization (ILO) bore significant fruit.

29.    What is clear is that, at the time of project design, there was huge optimism amongst
all stakeholders, including government, the international community and development
partners, about what could be achieved in Southern Sudan. Whilst all acknowledged the
severe operational constraints facing GoSS, this recognition was not always reflected in the
formulation of realistic expectations. This project design too seems to have suffered from the
same sense of optimism.

30.      Nevertheless, the fact remains that as the CPA period unfolded, the reality was that
there was a multitude of things to be done, most of which were classified as being of urgent
priority. It is hardly surprising that in the competition for government attention, some of the
initiatives that, given support, would have further contributed to the effectiveness of
CABIHRD did not get the desired level of support from the leadership.

31.     The assessment of risk surrounding the project was nevertheless robust. The project
was classified as a high risk operation for generic (i.e. non-project specific) reasons,
reflecting the newness of governmental institutions, potential volatility, and high fiduciary
risks. Fiduciary risk was addressed as part of the overall design of the MDTF-SS, where
procurement and financial management agents operated core fiduciary systems of the project.
In terms of the project specific risks and their mitigation, the risk mitigation table from the
FPP is reproduced in Annex 10, together with a column giving an assessment of the risk and
its mitigation. Some of the highlights are reproduced here:
        
      Unclear functional responsibilities for IT. The mitigation strategy was to leverage a
       decision about focal points, and to develop coordination fora between the various
       ministries. This risk was mitigated, as the PMG assisted the Ministry of
       Telecommunications & Postal Services in a process where Cabinet nominated it as a
       nodal ministry for ICY across GoSS.
      Low Capacity for Project Management. The mitigation strategy was to train staff, use
       GoSS procurement agents, and if necessary contract in other staff. Mitigation
       strategies were by and large effective in this area. Project management, Procurement,
       FM and M&E specialists were engaged. Project staff in the beneficiary ministries
       remained committed and engaged. Procurement remained an issue, particularly in the


                                              12
          early stages of the project, and was not helped by the very technical nature of some of
          the goods being procured in many instances.
         Weak coordination mechanisms (particularly between ministries and state
          governments). The mitigation strategy allowed for coordination mechanisms at four
          levels. These arrangements were put in place and were successful.
         Inability to absorb technology across GoSS. The mitigation strategy included training
          and skills transfer to ensure sustainability. There have been some successes here.
          There is clearly a network of technically competent staff in the PIC and at the
          MoT&PS left as a legacy of the project, and the website continues to operate
          effectively. The extent to which ministries as a whole understand the potential for
          ICT, and their responsibilities in response to popular demand is mixed. It is unclear
          how effective dissemination has been to the states. It is clear that a technology gap
          between GoSS and the states continues to exist. This mitigation strategy has therefore
          been only partially successful.

2.2 Implementation

32.    The Project was approved by the Oversight Committee (OC) of the Multi Donor Trust
Fund-Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS) on November 7, 2006 for a grant amount of US$ 8.24
million. The Grant Agreement was signed on December 22, 2006 and the project quickly
became effective on February 22, 2007. Project implementation was slow in FY 2008 the first
substantive year of project functioning principally because the expected level of support from
the Procurement Agent of the government did not materialize since they took much longer to
mobilize than was expected. Even appointment of key project management consultants got
delayed for this reason and the preparation of TORs and RFPs for the appointment of
consultants suffered. However project implementation improved from FY 2009 as the
Procurement Agent of the government mobilized fully and the project management
consultants came on board.

Component 1: Strengthening the Public Service

o Subcomponent 1A: Regulatory Framework.

33.     The Human Resources Manual and Public Sector Act and Regulations were drafted
by a USAID funded project but were only passed into law through a Presidential Decree in
January 2011, and are now subject to revision post-independence. Hence the issue of
dissemination and harmonization of state level regulations never reached fruition. Funds were
eventually reallocated away from this component to public service reform oriented state level
workshops and the setting up of an interim Reforms Secretariat. In terms of dissemination,
Adam Smith International wove the underlying principles of the draft regulations into the
training programs and reforms sensitization workshops convened by them in GoSS and the
states. In the absence of legislation individual government agencies have used the draft
legislation to develop their HR practices. The project has therefore been instrumental in
raising awareness of the content of the new act and legislation, in effect rendering them living
documents,

34.     Unfortunately the delay in passing this legislation is not an isolated incident. A
number of critical instruments (including those related to procurement and PFM) were also
delayed. It was difficult for the World Bank or other DPs to exercise any leverage over this
state of affairs, as the nature of the delays were often due to aspects of South Sudan’s


                                                13
complex political economy. Nevertheless, the lack of a formal legislative and regulatory
framework in this and other areas has not proved a major barrier to ensuring the day-to-day
functionality of the public service. As is often the case in fragile and post-conflict
environments, there is often little reliance on formal legislation, with pragmatism (an in this
case frequent reference to the post-colonial regulatory framework of Sudan) being the order
of the day.

35.    With regard to the development of a strategic plan for the future growth and
development of the public service, Functional management reviews were conducted which
formed the basis of a strategic plan. However, the plan has not been yet been submitted to the
Council of Ministers for ratification and implementation across the Public Service.

o Subcomponent 1B: Support to the Southern Sudan Civil Service Commission

36.     The project facilitated the twinning of the Commission with that of the Public Service
Commission of the Republic of South Africa (PSCRSA) as it is set up on similar lines, being
an oversight body rather than one which is directly involved in the appointment processes for
public servants. The chair and board members of the SSCSC visited Cape Town in 2008, and
attended a parliamentary session where the RSA Commission’s report was tabled. A follow-
up event was held in 2009, where the PSCRSA was invited to Juba for a workshop to discuss
issues of how CSCs might operate. However, a MoU signed between the two commissions
lapsed in 2009 once project support finished. The SSCSC also visited each of the 10 States
between October and November 2009 with a view to monitoring the performance and
constitution of CSCs at state level. This exercise revealed that apart from Central Equatoria
none of the states had SCSs (or equivalent bodies). Many irregularities were uncovered with
a view to the maintenance or otherwise of nominal rolls, appointment processes, etcetera, and
a report was submitted to the MoLPS&HRD, GoSS. The report received no response from
the government. An audit of the promotions effected from 2005 till 2010 was also undertaken
and the report submitted to the MoLPS&HRD. In 2008-2009 the SSCSC conducted a
recruitment audit covering the period 2005 to 2008. A report was produced in January 2009.
The report contained substantial findings, inter alia regarding anomalies between pay sheets
and nominal rolls and delays in recruitment, which were being followed up by GoSS as the
project closed. The SSCSC also submitted its first annual report, for the year of 2008, to the
Office of the Vice President in 2009. Subsequently, however, annual reports have not been
produced.

37.     No guidelines were issued during the lifetime of the project regarding civil service
policy and management issues because the SSCSC was not empowered through approval of
its Act or Regulations in time. Nevertheless, the legislative framework for the SSCSC was
approved in January 2011; , the new Provisional Order clarifies the Commission’s role as a
body of oversight (which is not directly involved in day-to-day recruitment issues). By the
time of the ICR the Commission was fully operational. By the middle of 2011 it was giving
concrete advice to Government relating to the integration of returnees from Government of
National Unity to the Ross.

o Subcomponent 1C: Public Service Training.

38.     The Southern Sudan Public Service Training Program (PSTP) delivered training to a
total of 1,220 public servants during the life of the project, 545 of whom were from central
government and 675 from the states. Adam Smith International and Skills for Southern Sudan


                                              14
were the service providers. The emphasis of training was on how senior civil servants (Grade
1-6) could more effectively deliver on their roles as managers in a reforming environment.
Overall some 27% of trainees were women, catered for under the Senior Women in
Management (SWIM) initiative. Classroom training was supplemented by on-the-job training
sessions and workplace interviews conducted on a one-to-one basis by mentors. ASI and
Skills for Southern Sudan conducted an impact assessment. As part of this review a number
of trainees were also interviewed. Whilst an under-estimate of costs restricted the number of
civil servants trained, the intervention nevertheless stuck to the original plan of training staff
at both national and sub-national level (in fact covering all states), in being gender responsive
and in retaining the mentoring aspects. Interviews with staff that benefited from the scheme
point to the creation of a constituency of awareness and change, and there is evidence of the
lessons learnt from the training being cascaded down in some organizations.

o Subcomponent 1D: Public Sector Reform Secretariat

This component, added as part of a reengineering of the project in 2009 comprises supporting
actions to operationalize a PSR Secretariat in the Ministry of Public Service. Support
included the recruitment of four national PSR consultants for a period of 8 months (1st
September 2009 to 30th April 2010), the funding of sensitization workshops for senior
officials, and the provision of supporting equipment. Once the existing contracts of the South
Sudanese consultants came to an end in 30th April 2010 they were not renewed due to GoSS
budget constraints. However, the secretariat still functions with support from the Government
of Kenya and the IGAD appointees within government. This intervention was instrumental in
raising awareness about the extent of public waste due to nepotism and the appointment of
unqualified persons to the public service, the fraud being perpetrated though paying “ghost
workers? and the need to reform. This campaign built a constituency for reform in the states,
in the regional media and amongst the youth.

Component 2: Labour Market and Vocational Training Capacity Building

Subcomponent 2A: Policy and Capacity to Regulate the Labour Market.

39.     ILO was the implementing agent for this sub-component. Regarding the drafting and
implementation of Labour legislation, there have been extensive consultation processes,
resulting in a number of revisions to working drafts. A final draft of the Southern Sudan
Labour Bill has now been submitted to the Ministry of Constitutional Development and Legal
Affairs. ILO also renovated three state labor offices in Juba, Wau and Malakal and
reactivated 7 state labor offices in Yambio, Torit, Bor, Bentiu, Wau, Juba and Malakal.
Buildings were renovated, basic infrastructure (including vehicles, generators and laptops)
were provided and 53 staff was trained on labor administration to allow the offices to become
functional. There were some delays in the distribution of vehicles to the seven sites since
there were disagreements on where the vehicles should be allotted. However, this was sorted
out eventually. All seven offices eventually set up Emergency Labour Employment Centers.
Databases were put in place in each office to register job seekers. However, in the case of one
office, that of Juba, the continuing operation of this database was compromised by the fact
that the generator had been stolen. As the office was not on mains electricity this meant that it
could not operate to full potential.

40.     What became clear at the time of the ICR was that, even although the draft Labour
legislation had not been passed into law, it was, in effect, guiding the day-to-day work of


                                               15
labor offices across the country. It has been the basis of the training provided and
consequently served as s the reference point in the regulation of the labor market. This is a
priority for the government since the bulk of formal employment is with foreign employers
and the government feels compelled to ensure the welfare of the South Sudanese working
three and needs to regulate the massive influx of expatriate workers who are crowding out
South Sudanese from the limited labor market due to higher skills, knowledge of English and
familiarity with working in an organized environment.

o Subcomponent 2B: Policy and Training for Vocational Training

41.   This sub-component provided for the renovation of vocational training centers
(VTCs) in Juba, Wau and Malakal, and the construction of a new centre in Aluakluak.

      Rehabilitation of the Malakal site was completed by UNIDO. This included the
       construction of sanitary blocks and provision of machine shop equipment. Members
       of the staff were also trained, and 70 students enrolled in training (59 of whom
       completed high level skills programs). However, at the time of the review, the centre
       was experiencing a few problems, It had been receiving some support from Sudan,
       and some instructors, who are from North Sudan, had departed when it became clear
       that the North and South were to separate. Although provisions had been made in
       GoSS budgets for running costs, the funds had not been received recently by the
       centre, and it was only able to continue to operate by ‘borrowing’ materials from local
       suppliers.

      Rehabilitation of the Wau site was also completed by UNIDO. This included the
       provision of a generator, the digging of boreholes, the supply of pumps and the
       provision of tools and training equipment. Some 283 students have now been trained
       through the centre, and instructors also given capacity building. It has intermittently
       faced problems with IDPs squatting in the facilities and causing some damage.

      JICA was contracted to undertake the rehabilitation of the Juba MTC. This activity
       consisted of the renovation and equipment of the automotive workshop and guest
       house, and equipping and building the capacity of management to deliver vocational
       training. Staff development took the form of assistance with the development of four
       specialized courses in metal fabrication and welding, catering/hospitality, automotive
       repair and secretarial training. Staff also undertook study tours to Kenya to learn
       about the VT sector there. Equipment and tools (including computers and a generator)
       and a vehicle were also supplied, and civil works completed on the mechanical
       engineering workshop and staff house completed. Due to ongoing security issues a
       boundary wall was also constructed. As a result of the renovation some 658 students
       were trained in the third quarter of 2009. A further 80 students graduated from an auto
       mechanics course without direct technical support of expatriate service providers. In
       common with other centers, the Juba facility now faces issues relating to running
       costs. However, both JICA and GIZ have ongoing interventions with the center, very
       much building on the interventions provided under this project.

      Aluakluak VTC was build from scratch, with Norwegian People’s Aid (NPA)
       contracted for the construction with GoSS budgetary resources financing the bulk of
       the civil construction. The center is intended to be a vocational training centre for
       women. There were some delays in the completion of works, mainly due to logistical


                                             16
       challenges. Generators, solar power equipment, computer equipment, water and
       sanitation infrastructure, laptops and furniture was supplied by the project. However,
       staff housing has not been included, which presents some challenges given the
       remoteness of the site. Although the facility was officially opened on 28th April 2011
       it was not, to all intents and purposes, operational during the life of the project. Only
       skeleton staff is in place, with no trainers hired, largely, it would seem, as a result of
       GoSS budget constraints.

      Where training has taken place across the four VTCs, a harmonized curriculum has
       been used (put in place via the project through the assistance of Norwegian People’s
       Aid). This is linked to the draft Vocational Training Policy (see below).

      Although provisions had been made in budgets for running costs for all of the VTCs,
       funds had not been received recently by the centers since early 2011. Malakal VTC is
       only continuing to operate by ‘borrowing’ materials from local suppliers. Wau has in
       effect been rendered unoperational because of its dependence on generated power on-
       site and the high cost of fuel. Aluakluak has never been fully operational, constrained
       by an inability to meet running costs (including staffing). Juba MTC faces similar
       issues (although other donor interventions have meant that the centre as a whole
       continues to operate). There have been significant issues regarding staffing, an issue
       recognized in a project ISR dated 31 December, which states that ‘… In a number of
       cases, less than adequate Government support in the provision of operational costs
       and inadequate staffing within Government is hampering project outcomes. The non
       availability of qualified teachers and managers within the VTCs is one example.’

42.     A final draft of The Southern Sudan Vocational Training Policy was completed by
ILO in December 2008 following an extensive consultative process. This was transmitted to
the Ministry of Constitutional Development and Legal Affairs in January 2009. However, it
has still not been ratified. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the draft policy is still
influencing vocational training operations and planning, and to all intents and purposes it is a
‘live’ document. It has guided curriculum development and pedagogy across the VTCs, it is
used by the Ministry and by non government training providers.

Component 3: Communications and Information Services

o Subcomponent 3A: Video-conferencing between GoSS and States

43.     This subcomponent has only been partially completed. The Final Project Proposal
Document envisages a pilot video-conferencing connection between the MoT&PS, followed
by a full scale-up to all of the 10 states. However, during the life of the project only the pilot
was completed. The difficulties of meeting the indicators in relation to this subcomponent
were recognized early. An ISR dated June 2009 stated that “… It seems unlikely that the VC
component will be able to progress beyond the pilot stage…?. The realignment of
expectations was in part necessary due to a technical difficulty which caused considerable
delays to implementation. The FPP states that ‘The VSAT and GoSS network servers, under
the existing Rapid Impact Emergency (RIEP) Project, will provide the link capacity for the
ten states and two sites in Juba, shared by the ministries’. It was envisaged at design that the
basic infrastructure was already in place as was informed by UNOPS the component
implementer under the RIEP project and only bandwidth allocations needed to be modified,
and some equipment and facilities upgraded. However, this assumption proved to be flawed,


                                               17
and it subsequently came to light that it was not technically possible for the existing
communications infrastructure to host video-conferencing. A Video Conferencing consultant
was provided by the project and, as a result of the technical difficulties of integrating with the
infrastructure provided under RIEP, a techno-economic feasibility study was conducted to
look at options. This protracted process then concluded with a specification of what was
needed to secure VC facilitates between Juba and the pilot site in Wau. Equipment was then
procured and installed (including a 7 meter high dish at the MoT&PS). However,
procurement became a protracted process. This was mainly due to the challenges of
supplying IT equipment (supplied on the international market) to a country embargoed by the
international community. Nevertheless, a VC room was constructed in Wau, and before the
end of the project the connection was piloted successfully using complimentary bandwidth
provided by the suppliers of the hub equipment. However, the facility was not ordinarily up-
and-running at the end of the project. Government has not prioritized the provision of
bandwidth, and as a consequence the system became dormant after it had been successfully
tested. Nevertheless, as a pilot this intervention has been a success. The constraints on it are
by and large external to the project, and once the issue of government bandwidth is resolved
the pilot will serve as a demonstration of what can be achieved, and a platform on which to
build further extension of the network.

   Subcomponent 3B: Government Internal and External Website Development and
    Information Management.

44.     An external website for the Government of Southern Sudan (www.goss.org) became
operational during 2010 after a trial period. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
coordinates the collection of information. The website has proved immensely popular, with
19,250 hits recorded in December 2010 (7,426 of these being ‘unique’ visits). At project
close there over 455 gigabytes of downloadable documents, including budget information and
ministerial reports. There have been some issues relating to the collection of information
across government although by the time of the project closed processes around this seemed
both orderly and comprehensive. There were also early issues relating to system stability,
although this has improved markedly with the relocation of the website uploading and
maintenance function to the Public Information Centre (PIC). No progress was however
made with regard to the development of an internal website, as an intranet was never
operationalised across government as was envisaged with GoSS budget resources.

45.    Nevertheless, functioning of external website is a huge achievement on two fronts. It
has imposed discipline with regard to information management and document flows within
government (witnessed at the time of the ICR). It has also put information in the public
domain in a context where ordinarily information is not widely shared. Improved
transparency of government immeasurably, and serves as a positive example of what can be
achieved.

o Subcomponent 3C: Email:

46.    Techno-economic feasibility studies for the provision of email services across
government were completed in October 2009 by technical assistance provided by the project,
presenting a number of technical options. The same technical assistance then oversaw
procurement and implementation of the system. Implementation has included the set-up of
MS Exchange 2010 on appropriate hardware at the MoT&PS Data Centre and the Legislative
Assembly. The activity faced a number of challenges, some technical and some external to


                                               18
the project.. Firstly, some of the underlying technical assumptions made at project design
(before the techno-economic feasibility studies) appear flawed. Original costing of the
activity proved vastly inadequate (some $100k budgeted against a final outturn of $700k, an
overrun accommodated by a reallocation of funds, some of which came from the video-
conferencing subcomponent), indicating some of the capacity constraints faced by the
MoT&PS. Secondly, there were issues with the internet domain name. Government naturally
wanted the Country Code Top level Domain of ‘SS’ (standing for South or Southern Sudan).
However, this could not be ratified until clarity emerged regarding South Sudan’s separation
from Sudan. The domain was nevertheless provisionally secured before the end of the project.
The third challenge facing the activity has been the provision of bandwidth; as has already
been noted, funding bandwidth has not been given priority in Government’s budget, and the
email system cannot be deemed to be fully operational until this situation changes. Fourthly,
to ensure sustainability of this initiative, IT staff is needed in the Ministry. Whilst the
establishment provides for this, budget constraints have delayed recruitment.

47.    Nevertheless the fact remains that by the project close the technical infrastructure for
cross- government email had been put in place by the project, and a modest injection of
resources from government for purchasing bandwidth (which is ongoing) will render the
system fully operational.

o Subcomponent 3D: Electronic Records and Document Management (EDRM).

48.     This sub-component was implemented by EDRM Solutions USA. The planned output
was the putting in place and then use of a planned turnkey electronic archiving system in the
Ministry of Cabinet Affairs, where documents are uploaded and then accessible electronically.
Servers, software and a heavy-duty scanner were provided, and staff members were trained.
As of May 31 2011 some 4,288 documents had been uploaded into the database (including
cabinet agendas, resolutions, minutes, memos and meeting attendance sheets). However, two
problems in implementation have emerged, and the system was, by the end of the project,
only functional in regards of accessing documents already archived (as opposed to those
needed for current business). This is because the scanner had developed a problem and was
sent to Kenya for repair. No stand-in equipment had been identified to fill its place; and the
system needs bandwidth to upload new documents. As with other interventions within this
overall component, the lack of GoSS bandwidth has seriously restricted functionality.

49.    These particular problems notwithstanding, the intervention has had positive
outcomes. Firstly, the system is used to retrieve the considerable body of historical data it
contains in respect of past cabinet business. Secondly, the system is now to be used by an
intervention spearheaded by JICA to roll out electronic records and document management
across government.

o Subcomponent 3E: Public Information Center

50.    The project provided for the construction of a Public Information Centre in Juba
measuring 314 M², plus an ablution block and boundary wall. As at the end of the project the
center was functional (and open to the public) and staffed, but had not been formally
inaugurated. As a result, the PIC had not received publicity. It was looking to have a formal
opening in mid-October, although there were no funds to do this.




                                              19
51.     There had been some significant delays in the PIC being built and becoming
operational. There had been initial delays in the design of the building prior to construction.
The Ministry of Housing had been charged with this, but the specification and design process
had been overly long. ISRs for the project also noted the inordinately long time and complex
processes employed by the Ministry of Legal Affairs in the authentication of each and every
contract (resulting in some bidders pulling out of procurement processes). Once the building
was complete staff had not been appointed until the end of 2010 due to GoSS budget
constraints. Nevertheless, despite the delays, PIC is now open for business and attracts 200
visitors monthly. This is another positive example of government’s growing commitment to
transparency.

o Subcomponent 3F: Technical Assistance to MoT&PS and MoI&B to provide technical
  assistance to advise the MoT&PS on telecommunication and information technology
  policies, activities and programs, including the on-going projects, and to advise the
  MoI&B on information and broadcasting policies, Ministry’s activities and programs.

52.     This subcomponent was achieved by provision of TA to the MoT&PS in respect of
the VC and email sub-components while TA was also deployed to help set up the PIC and
establish the website.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

53.     M&E design: At the time of the project approval only a basic set of Performance
Indicators was available for monitoring project outcomes. In reality these were more in the
nature of Output Indicators rather than Outcome Indicators. In September 2007 a more
detailed Results Framework was proposed by the Bank in consultation with the recipient
which separately identified PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome or Output Indicators.
This RF was based on the best practice principles and was fairly complex. At the Activity
Level annual work plans were prepared along with Annual Procurement Plans and the
completion of individual activities was monitored based on the Annual Work Plans at
monthly meetings of the PTC.

54.    M&E implementation: In practice the detailed RF prepared in September 2007 was
never implemented because the government found it too complex and could not support its
information requirements with systems on the ground for collecting and reporting data in the
required format. This demonstrated that the RF was somewhat out of kilter with project
developments, as most of the PDO indicators either demonstrated only partial completion or
had no data. From January 2009 the project also hired a Monitoring Specialist to assist the
Project Management Group. The monitoring specialist used the twelve Performance
Indicators to monitor project progress and report to the PMG on a monthly basis. M&E
support was also provided by the Monitoring Agent of the MDTF who did field inspections
and submitted quarterly monitoring reports.

55.     M&E utilization: The PMG used the monthly monitoring reports of the monitoring
specialist extensively to review project progress, discuss implementation challenges and
devise coping strategies. This proved to be a very useful tool for project management.
However, during this period the government made no attempt to devise its own monitoring
system for managing its own activities on a sustainable basis. This remained a low priority
for the government. The concept of monitoring “results? or impacts instead of monitoring the
use of “inputs? and the completion of activities never really took root in the government


                                              20
agencies and to a large part this is because Performance Budgeting is still nascent in Southern
Sudan. Under the circumstances, there was rarely any interest in monitoring anything other
than the utilization of finances and the completing of activities in the work plan.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management:

56.     Financial Management (FM) was provided by Project Financial Management Unit
(PFMU) which is responsible for the FM of all MET projects. In addition, the project
engaged a Financial Management Specialist who had the responsibilities of carrying out the
basic accounting arrangements of the projects including payments processing for contracts
and maintaining the impress account. She also liaises with the PFMU for disbursements and
processing the Withdrawal Application. All Audit reports and Interim Financial Reports
were promptly prepared during the project period. The audited financial statements for the
year ended 2010 was qualified. This is in respect of non receipt of audit reports from some
Agencies that supported the project in implementation. These Agencies are Norwegian
People’s Aid ($630,000) and International Labour Organization ($183,905). In addition, IL0
has not refunded unutilized fund balance of $28,503 to the project. Also the 2009 audited
financial statement was qualified due to similar reasons in respect of ILO ($633,524);
UNIDO Wau ($309,569); and UNIDO Malakal ($303,750). The agreement between
Government and each of these Agencies requires the Agencies to audit the expenditure
incurred by them on behalf of the implementing ministries as part of their own agency audit.
The report is expected to be submitted and relied on by the Audit Chamber who carries out
the audit of the project. The government and Bank have followed up on this severally
including a letter to the Deputy Special Representative to the Secretary General of the UN.
Non receipt of these reports would imply that the auditors could not ascertain that about 26%
of the project expenditure in 2010 and has been properly used for project purpose. Apart from
the outstanding audit reports from ILO, UNIDO and NPA, there is also an ineligible
expenditure of $2,911 that has not been refunded. The project performance is satisfactory.
The estimated project cost is US$ 13.73 million of which GOSS was originally to contribute
US$ 5.49 million and the MDTF to contribute US$ 8.24 million. After the amendment dated
September 15, 2009, GOSS contributed US$ 1.57 million and the MDTF contributed
US$ 12.16 million. The project is fully disbursed and all donor funds fully expended. As of
project closure in May 31, 2011, an amount of US$ 20,690 was not expended out of the
counterpart funds (includes an interest income of $6,255).

Procurement:

58.     The Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) identified procurement as one of the major
constraints the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) would be exposed to in the
implementation of the projects financed by the Muti Donor Trust Fund. As recommended by
the JAM, GoSS put in place a centralized procurement where key activities were carried out
by the Ministry of Finance with the support of consulting firm as Procurement Agent.
However, the proposed arrangement did not work as expected for the following reasons: (i)
instead of providing hands on support to procuring entities the Procurement Agent (PA) acted
more as a supervisor, as a result the PA had to spend time and effort in reviewing
inadequately drafted documents instead of helping those drafting the documents on-the-job;
(ii) when the procurement plans and the bidding documents were finally adopted they did not
always take into account the local environment; (iii) The execution of the signed contracts
turned out to be challenging as suppliers experienced various difficulties including obstacles
related to the sanctions affecting Sudan. In May 2008, the Project Management Group
established within the Ministry of Labor, Public Service and Human Resource Development,
appointed a procurement specialist to assist the Project Director. Subsequently procurement
actions picked up significantly; by December 2008 the procurement activities for sixteen out
of the thirty seven procurement packages were completed. An additional thirteen
procurement packages were completed by June 2009. The remaining six packages relating to
GoSS email and video conferencing procurement experienced technical issues. The project
recruited two consultants who assisted to tackle these problems and finally this procurement
was completed by December 2010. The two last packages concern the consultant contract for
drafting a Public Service Act was dropped and a work contract for a vocational training
center was completed in first quarter of 2010. Overall apart from some delays during the first
years the project’s procurement went rather well an Independent Procurement Review
conducted in 2011 found the overall procurement performance satisfactory

Environmental and social safeguards:

59.     No significant environmental or social safeguards issues were anticipated in the
project since major civil construction was never envisaged at the time of the project approval
and only rehabilitation of existing buildings was envisaged. However, subsequently it was
decided by government that due to security reasons a boundary wall around the Juba VTC
was essential which resulted in a possible disruption of access for the hotels which came up
subsequently beyond the VTC and started informally using the premises of the VTC as a
thoroughfare. Proposed rehabilitation of the dormitory block of the VTC also met the
problem of possible eviction of the squatters who had occupied the dormitories in the


                                             22
extended interim between project effectiveness and the commencement of project activities.
The displacement of the squatters would have triggered World Bank’s OP 4.12 Involuntary
Resettlement, in order to exercise extreme caution with respect to adherence to the World
Bank social safeguard policy (in the absence of standards of the government) and the
Government of Central Equatoria’s sensitivity towards resettling the squatters, it was agreed
with the government that the rehabilitation of the dormitories of the Juba VTC would be
dropped so as not to adversely affect the squatters occupying them. Secondly, it was agreed
with government that an alternative path for the hotels behind the Juba VTC would be
delineated, in coordination with the Government of Central Equatoria. Pending the
construction of this alternative access path, gates would be provided in the boundary wall
such that access to the hotels remains undisturbed. At the time of the ICR mission in
September 2011 four months after the close of the project the Bank team verified that though
the alternative path had still not been constructed gates in the boundary wall remained open
allowing free access to the hotels behind the Juba VTC.

60.    The Government of Southern Sudan was required, under the Grant Agreement, to
develop an Environmental and Social Safeguard Policy and Regulations. However, this was
never completed, despite frequent discussion on the matter. There were no other
environmental or social safeguard issues which arose in the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

61.     The MDTF is in the final stages of its existence with operations expected to be
completed by June 2012. Hence no follow operation is expected from MDTF resources.
However individual interventions from the project have been picked up by other donors.
Further support on continuing the reforms agenda is being provided by the Government of
Kenya. The Capacity Building Trust Fund is financing further work on formulating a
Pensions Act. GIZ is providing support to the Southern Sudan Civil Service Commission.
Training of civil servants is being carried on by a number of donor agencies including the
CBTF. JICA is continuing to support vocational training in Juba and is expected to expand
support to Wau and Malakal also. ILO has continued TA support for vocational training.
USAID complemented the communications segment by providing VC facilities to the
Presidency. JICA is considering building upon the EDRM located in the Cabinet Office with
the intention of introducing e-government in that office. With independence on July 9, 2011
South Sudan is expected to soon become members of the IMF and the World Bank. After
membership has been achieved follow on support for public service capacity development
will be discussed with the government both at the level of the government of the Republic of
South Sudan and in the ten states and related local governments. A follow on project for
enhancing telecommunications and the use of ICT in government will also be discussed with
the government at the time a CAS/ISM is prepared.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

62.    The Project Development Objectives were highly relevant to Southern Sudan, both in
terms of design and implementation.

63.    At the design stage:



                                             23
      The first PDO, relating to the provision of a foundation for effective, efficient and
       transparent functioning of the GoSS by: (i) strengthening the capacity of key
       ministries; (ii), improving the management of information within government; and,
       (iii) enhancing the government’s capacity for internal and external communications,
       not only speaks to the state-building agenda so necessary at the time of CPA
       implementation but also reflects core cross-cutting capacity building needs identified
       by the Joint Assessment Mission (which, in the absence of a CAS, was the most
       important strategic document at the time of project approval).

      In the case of the second PDO, relating to increasing access to labor market, welfare
       and vocational training services by developing the government’s capacity for
       regulating the labor market and designing and implementing labor market and
       vocational training programs, this is also relevant to the capacity building agenda
       identified by the JAM. Whilst it was not specifically picked up by either the
       Institutional Development and Capacity Building cluster or by the Basic Social
       Services Cluster of the JAM, it is an essential element of harnessing human capacity,
       in turn to build the nation.

64.    In the case of both PDOs, relevance needs to be assessed against the extent to which
the project filled gaps that were apparent in the assistance being provided by other donor
partners. The MDTF was the last institution to mobilize on the ground in South Sudan;
USAID, UNDP and DFID had long established their footprints through project interventions
in the PSR area. Under these circumstances the MDTF intervention can be seen as filling
important gaps in an emerging reform agenda dominated on the donor side by other partners.

65.     One of the project’s particular strengths has been the way that it took up skills
development in a systematic manner at an early. At the time of the ICR donor partners
confirmed that this had indeed been a priority that others were not addressing (and, indeed,
that to a lesser extent, inculcating a systematic approach across all DP activity remains a
priority). Its relevance to the broader state-building agenda and the need to provide jobs, and
the contextual synergies to the DDR agenda is evident.

66.     At the same time, it was important for the project to be realistic about what it could
achieve and on what it should focus, particularly in respect of Public Sector Reform, where
potential demand was overwhelming. A LICUS fund had co-funded a survey of civil servants
in 2006 established that there were around 60,000 officials. These numbers swelled rapidly
over the next two years until the (admittedly unverified) numbers approached 300,000.
Accordingly the PSR components were kept modest with a view to adding strategic value in a
much larger emerging agenda. This explains the focus of strengthening oversight through the
South Sudan Civil Service Commission, preparing a road map for civil service development
and training civil servants in the GoSS and states. Taken together the net impact of these
interventions to establish a regulatory structure and building some strategic capacity at more
senior levels in the civil service.

67.     Other interventions were similarly nuanced at providing strategic support to the
broader governance agenda. Interventions supported the access of citizens to information
(PIC and the development of a GoSS website) and the management of records through
electronic archiving at the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs. To improve secure communications
the VC and the email components were implemented, interventions of significant importance
in a country as vast and ill-served by transport infrastructure as South Sudan.


                                              24
68.     In terms of implementation, the project remained relevant to the government’s policy
objectives throughout its life, although this was a challenge; government priorities changed,
and the project had to ensure that it was both cognizant of this agenda and responsive to it.
But there are clear examples where the project was able to demonstrate the level of
engagement it had with Government, and the flexibility to tailor and refocus support. For
example:

      A particular change in focus in the public sector reform agenda occurred in October
       2008, when the President launched a Public Service Reform and an anti-corruption
       campaign. There was a request from the government to change the project
       interventions to support this campaign which required two GoSS ministers to co-chair
       public meetings with State Governors where the basics of PSR were to be
       disseminated and discussed. A Reforms Secretariat was proposed at the center to
       coordinate government-wide reform processes. To tackle the growing resentment
       against Pensions not being distributed the government constituted a special committee
       to come up with short term options and needed technical support; and
      In terms of the labor markets, during the life of the project Government recognized a
       need to better regulate the growing numbers of foreign employers and employees.

69.     The project responded to these requests and adjusted these requirements into its
ongoing interventions. In respect of PSR adjustments were made to ensure that it provided
just-in -time support. In the case of the labor issue the project responded by scaling up
Labour Office support from three to seven offices.

70.    Both the PSR and labor elements of the project fell under the purview of the same
ministry (the Ministry of Labour and Public Service). This has positive implications for
project implementation, as there were some synergies to be exploited and advantages to
addressing both work streams with a single Ministry. Remaining in dialogue with and
responding to a single ministerial focal point ensured that the project retained its relevance to
the GoSS agenda.

71.      Throughout the life of the project dialogue with government was maintained at the
highest levels. The project was extended twice at GoSS request. The first also involved a
restructuring as requested by Government. The one year extension was to enable in order to
complete the implementation of the project and allow it to further work towards the
fulfillment of its developmental objectives, including civil service training, scaling up labor
market support and allowing more time for the completion of activities which were lagging,
mainly because of procurement and technical challenges. A further no-cost extension of five
months was requested by GoSS and approved to from allow for completion of ongoing
activities. The focus of achieving the PDOs was retained throughout.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.    The analysis of outputs and outcomes of the project against the twelve Performance
Indicators specified in the FPP presents a mixed picture.




                                               25
Out of the twelve indicators one indicator was not met, four indicators were partially met and
seven indicators were met.

73.       The following indicator has been assessed as not met:

         Indicator 1, in respect of the standardization of civil service regulations. Due to delays
          in passing and promulgating regulatory framework this target was not achieved.
          Given that funds were diverted from this sub-component it is perhaps curious that this
          remained a PDO through a project restructuring

74.       The following five indicators have been assessed as partially met:

         Indicator 4: The email equipment has been installed, the protocols for allocation of
          addresses have been finalized and the system has been tested. However, it has not
          been rolled out because of a delay in implementation until February 2011. A further
          decision was made government that roll out should be deferred until after
          independence on July 9, 2011 when the government domain name would eventually
          became available. At project completion, pending resolution of the domain name
          issue, there is an email system that can be rolled out. However, Government will also
          need to invest in the relevant bandwidth, which is a marginal cost. Procurement
          arrangements are underway. This intervention will enable the government to enter the
          first stage of e-governance since it facilitates e-sharing of information, online
          consultations across the government and e-decision making.

         Indicator 8: The pilot video conferencing link between Juba and Wau had been
          completed and tested but was not operational at project close since the VSAT
          communication service was unavailable due to the contract still being negotiated by
          government. However government had planned to get the bandwidth contracted by
          November 2011. Because of technological and procurement challenges
          implementation never got beyond the pilot. Given that in an ISR dated June 2009
          stated that “… It seems unlikely that the VC component will be able to progress
          beyond the pilot stage…?. Once bandwidth has been acquired by the government
          this intervention will provide the base for linking all the ten states of South Sudan for
          distance learning, consultations, monitoring and decision making.

         Indicator 9: Labour Offices had been rehabilitated in three states; staff in seven states
          had been equipped with office equipment and vehicles and trained in labor
          administration and employment services. Whilst the Southern Sudan Labour Bill has
          still not been approved the principles are being used by Labor Offices to guide their
          work practices, process of arbitration and management of labor welfare.

         Indicator 10: the Vocational Training Policy was drafted and presented to
          government. It has not been formally approved so far. However since it was crafted
          through wide participation it is commonly accepted by practitioners as a guide for
          implementation and activities are being harmonized on the basis of its
          recommendations across training providers.

         Indicator 11: The target of training 1,000 persons per year in the VTCs was never
          reached consistently. At peak operations the number being trained was around 1,000
          but this has dropped sharply as Wau was given over by the state government for


                                                 26
          accommodating IDPs and Juba went for large scale remodeling with JICA support.
          All but one the VTCs renovated has been operational during the life of the project.
          Training Needs Analysis has been undertaken in Wau, Juba and Malakal MTCs. 59
          people were trained in ‘high level skills’ in Malakal during the life of the project.
          1,024 overall were trained in basic skills (automotive maintenance, carpentry,
          catering, metal fabrication) through 3 of the VTCs (Juba, Malakal and Wau). A high
          proportion of these were women. A tracer Study undertaken by JICA illustrates that
          80% of all trainees completing courses in Juba VTC went on to find work. At project
          close only Juba and Malakal out of four VTC were operational and that too at
          minimal levels due to shortage of recurrent budgets.
75.       The remaining (and following) six indicators were met:

         Indicator 2: Training of civil servants was completed with 1,220 officials drawn from
          GoSS and the states trained. The number trained was lower than the number targeted
          (2,845) due to budget underestimates and the subsequent unavailability of additional
          funds. Special training programs for women in management were run which
          developed a network of women in administration. Overall, 27% of trainees trained
          were women, through the Senior Women in Management (SWIM) initiative. 432 staff
          in the senior management cadres was trained. 150 civil servants were trained in HRM.
          Despite the fact that numerically the target was not achieved, the integrity basic of the
          structure and design of the training was retained. Staff from both GoSS and the states
          were trained. Training was followed by mentoring and beneficiary responses indicate
          that the learning from that training is highly valued.

         Indicator 3: The Southern Sudan Civil Service Commission, although suffering from a
          period of uncertainty as a result of non-approval by Government of its Act and
          Regulations, is now fully functional. It met the target of producing its first annual
          report in 2008 to the President.. It has conducted a staff audit of staff recruited
          between 2005 to 2008 and monitored the status of the civil service in the states. It is
          currently supporting the government in integrating the returnees from the Government
          of National Unity into the RoSS.

         Indicator 5: The EDRM has been functioning effectively in the cabinet office, with
          some 4,288 documents had been uploaded into the database and officials trained in its
          use. However at the time of ICR mission it was not fully functional since the
          bandwidth contract was still being finalized by the government. The system is now to
          be used as a platform for further support provided by JICA.

         Indicator 6: The Government website has been operational since the end of 2009. It
          has around 455 GB of documents uploaded on it and gets between 10,000 to 15,000
          hits per month of which around 7,000 are unique visitors.

         Indicator 7: The Public Information Center has been constructed and equipped and
          partially staffed. Though it has still not been officially inaugurated and advertised as
          being open, it nevertheless attracts 200 visitors a month and has initiated expectations
          that government will become more open and enhance access to public information..

         Indicator 12: From 2009 onwards procurement plans have been implemented
          substantially on time.


                                                 27
76.      The performance could have been improved had care been taken at the time of the
Mid Term Review in August 2009 to change the PDO and the indicators to reflect the
realities on the ground. This is particularly true in the case of the Indicator 8 for Video
Conferencing. At the time of project restructuring in February 2009 it should been assessed
that only the basic work related to only the pilot link between Juba and Wau would be
feasible in the time remaining. However, it is recognized that this may have been difficult
since the entrenched interests of project component leaders, from different ministries, had to
be taken into account which resulted in the status quo being maintained, barring reallocation
across components, where possible, to accommodate changing priorities.

77.     The above analysis speaks in the main to the achievement of outputs, but to further
assess overall efficacy of the project it is important to get a clearer view of outcomes secured
against the PDOs.

78.    In respect of the PDO to provide the foundation for effective, efficient and transparent
functioning of the GoSS, the following outcomes have been secured through the project:

      The operalization of a completely new institution (South Sudan Civil Service
       Commission). Without support from the project it is unlikely that this would have
       been achieved. The Commission has now overcome the legal uncertainties it suffered
       during much of the life of the project (which were politically motivated), and is now
       fully functional and up-and-running, with new leadership and renewed energy. It has
       now embarked on advising the government about the latest post-independence
       challenge of integrating returnees from the Government of National Unity (i.e. North
       Sudan) into the Public Service. It is also having a significant input into processes
       around restructuring the civil service, Using the findings of the SSCSC’s previous
       audits of appointments and the promotions audits (2007-9) the Minister took a paper
       to Cabinet suggesting how engage the issue of under-qualification of government
       employees to hold their (estimated at 60%). On the Cabinet opposing the proposal due
       to the likely political fall-out the Minister resigned in July 2011. No new Minister has
       yet been appointed.
      The Cabinet approved a proposal from Ministry of Telecommunications to make it the
       nodal agency for ICT thereby ending a regulatory vacuum. This has resulted from the
       role the Ministry has played in pushing the ICT agenda through the interventions
       funded under the project (including VC innovations and the development of
       government email). The new Minister, interviewed during the ICT mission, has a
       clear vision of how her Ministry can make ICT an effective tool across government,
       and how her agency can serve as a point of strategic focus for this. Also arising from
       the project, the capacity of engineers within the Ministry on ICT management has
       been enhanced, enhancing the capacity of the institution to take forward its mandate.
      As a result of the project’s interventions in respect of the PIC and government official
       website the system for integrating the flow of information on policies, legislation,
       regulations, job vacancies, tenders, work plans, budgets, key appointments and key
       events from the line Ministries are now formalized and institutionalized. One
       manifestation of this is the availability of 455 GB of data on the government official
       website. It is clear that ministries are now fully aware of the need for citizens to have
       access to public information, and the PIC and Website which have been created using
       project support are now the key portals for this information, palpably enhancing



                                              28
       transparency and access to information. Given the context, this is a noteworthy
       achievement.
      Arising from the public service capacity building programs of the project, several
       positive outcomes have been realized. Amongst participants three is a greater
       awareness of modern management techniques, and evidence (garnered through
       interviewing participants) that these lessons are being used in the workplace and
       further disseminated in the institutions in which they work, therefore impacting
       institutional performance. As a result of these programs a cadre of “young leaders?
       has been developed which is now operational and can be fast-tracked in the future. . A
       network of “Senior Women in Management? has also been developed and role models
       identified in East Africa as a basis of network twinning arrangements.
      The project was able to provide ‘just in time’ support, including interim support for
       the Reforms Secretariat and Technical Assistance to devise short term options for kick
       starting payment of Public Service Pensions.
      Almost as a bi-product of the project, there now exists capacity in five ministries and
       agencies (through 30 employees) in (Project Management, Monitoring and
       Evaluation, developed through formal training and learning on the job.

79.     In respect of the PDO to increase access to labor market, welfare and vocational training
services by developing the government’s capacity for regulating the labor market and designing and
implementing labor market and vocational training programs:

      The Labour Law now exists in draft due to ILO assistance provided by the project. It
       reflects current international standards and will be an excellent basis for Labour
       regulation moving forward. Unfortunately, however, a feature of South Sudan has
       been significant delays in the approval of new legislation across sectors. It is now in
       the long line of legislations awaiting approval.
      The Vocational Training Policy was formulated by the ILO. It is yet to be sent to
       Cabinet, but it is nevertheless a living document. Government uses it as the
       framework document for training providers today.
      Enhanced capacity to delivers vocational training now exists across the VTCs
       supported by the project, and one VTC has been created which will focus on women’s
       empowerment. This forms a platform upon which Government can build once it has
       resolved recurrent budgeting issues.
      As a result of the project Labour Offices in seven states are now operational, and
       enhancing the access people to labor markets, and investors to potential employees.
       Given the squeeze on State budgets it is unlikely that this would have happened without
       project assistance.

80.    The project experience provides important general lessons for the design and
implementation of governance and public sector projects in fragile states These are set out in
the box below.
        

       Lessons Learned from Project Engagement in a Fragile and Conflict Affected State

       The experience of CABIHRD highlights important lessons and constraints to implementation of
       state capacity building in a post-conflict country. Recognition of the difficult political and social
       context is important to a proper evaluation of the achievements and shortfalls of such a project.
       Whereas the importance of establishing key state functions in a post-conflict setting often results in
       ambitious objective-setting, pragmatism in design and opportunism in implementation are key to



                                                     29
achieving impact in a weak capacity context. Yet it is precisely these qualities that are often
blocked by ideological commitments and political conflicts of interest.

Political versus Development priorities: Expectations around what can reasonably be achieved
need to be informed by robust ex ante political economy analysis. CABIHRD sought to strengthen
the capacity of key ministries to function effectively but faced political resistance to this
technocratic objective. South Sudan is an oil revenue based state with considerable income of its
own and the leadership faced political pressure to create jobs and could do so most easily in the
public sector. In such circumstances an attempt to build an optimally sized, professional public
service was likely to fail unless private sector growth or social protection programs provided gainful
employment to people outside the public sector. Therefore the public service law was politically
inconvenient since it would have constrained discretion. The political leadership failed to make the
case for supporting the development objective and to build a reform coalition within cabinet and
hence was not able to generate a wide enough support base for such reforms. While this political
economy posed a constraint to the project, it nevertheless did influence a number of important
public sector practices in government and contributed to improved functionality in key ministries.
In 2009 the government constituted an inter ministry committee for reviewing all proposals for
appointments, received from ministries and agencies, prior to their formalization on the payroll;
adherence to minimum qualifications and fair selection are the criteria for this review. This has
significantly controlled irregular appointments since the time the committee became operational.

Sensible time-frames for Public Sector Reform operations: Reflecting the sense of political
urgency in the early years of statehood, GoSS wanted a project period of only two years since
“quick impact? was a major concern. This project, as a result, had only a 3 year timeframe. While
the WDR 2011 identifies that the sort of institutional reform needed to make public sector reform
stick necessitates being in for the long-haul, the experience of CABIHRD suggests that there is a
place for shorter interventions such as this, especially if it is complemented by other partner
initiatives. There is also a case to be made for opportunistic project design: this explains why the
project tackled the apparently disparate areas of labor market management and public sector reform.
Many of the project outputs whilst not specifically used immediately have built the capacity of
GoSS for the future. One example is the Medium Term Strategy for Development of the Public
Service which has fed into the subsequent Medium Term Capacity Building Plan of the Ross 2011.
While too small in scale to develop skills on the scale required to meet the demand for skilled
workers currently being met by overseas workers in South Sudan and thereby relieve the pressure
to create jobs in the public sector, the vocational training infrastructure created provides a base for
utilization in future DDR programs and as focal points for the development of Technical Institutes.
A tracer study done by JICA showed graduates of the VTCs are immediately absorbed into the
labor market

Use of ICT: While infrastructure constraints in a post-conflict setting may suggest avoiding
technological leapfrogging, this project gives concrete examples of where use of ICT has resulted in
positive impacts and had an influence in changing behaviors in government. The cabinet office
which previously was primarily engaged with manually archiving cabinet papers now focuses on
the follow up of decisions and can produce prior decisions of the cabinet to link current decisions
with previous decisions for sustained monitoring of results. Similarly the GoSS website has become
a key instrument for government to share information and for citizens to access government
publications, the budget and policy documents. This is a significant development especially since
there is no convenient way of buying or getting hard copies of these documents

Ideology versus Pragmatism: Pragmatism in a low capacity context would have argued for the
new state to have adopted existing Sudanese legislation and phase in changes over a longer period
of time. However, GoSS was committed to rejecting all legislation from the Republic of Sudan and
creating new institutions and legislation. This was an ideological commitment. The result was that
in the period 2007 to 2011 around 40 laws were passed and a similar number are still waiting in
line. In the absence of a legislative framework, developing good work practices was left to the
judgment of individual ministries and agencies of the government. The resultant ill defined
regulatory environment simultaneously facilitated malpractices, fraud and corruption and made it
difficult to bring the guilty to justice in a court of law.




                                               30
       Policy support and translation into the budget: This project has illustrated that a policy which
       has political support may not necessarily receive support from the budget since translating policy
       priorities into budget allocations is a weak link in many governments. This is partly because
       government is fragmented, and support of one minister may not be enough to ensure budget
       allocations in the recurrent budget. But it is also due to weaknesses of budget processes in fragile
       states. Whilst upstream budget processes may appear from the outside to be reasonably robust they
       are not properly connected to the priorities and policies of government. There is a disconnect
       between what those in government want to do and what is reflected in the budget. Whilst the
       impacts of this in respect of this project were relatively minor in the broader scheme of things (e.g.
       by not providing adequate running expenses for facilities provided under the project) it is easy to
       envisage how, in other circumstances, this could have severe impacts. Attention must be given to
       building capacities in prioritization and linking priorities to budget processes.

       Selectivity in defining the institutional development load: GoSS committed itself to a highly
       complex administrative and legislative structure spanning more than 200 new institutions across
       GoSS, states and Local Governments. The consequential burden on legislation, capacity
       development and physical infrastructure was so extreme that it distracted the leadership from
       focusing on the key institutions for ensuring stability, absorbed fiscal capacity and enhanced the
       capacity development requirements to unmanageable proportions. The complex structure created
       jobs for facilitating inclusion and getting buy in from tribes and clans but it also created vested
       interests in the continuance of this unsustainable super structure of the State.



3.3 Efficiency

81.    No cost-benefit analysis and financial analysis was done at Appraisal because of the
operational difficulties in putting a value to capacity and institutional development.

82.     The project was however particularly vigilant and conscious about the need for
efficiency and “value for money?. This is evidenced, inter alia, by the fact that no financing
of salaries and recurrent expenditure beyond $170,626 for meeting the operating costs of the
Project Management Group consisting of Technical Assistance embedded into the
implementing ministries.

83.     Throughout the project there was emphasis on rehabilitating and expanding existing
assets rather than building new ones. For example, VTCs in Juba, Wau and Malakal were
renovated rather than new facilities constructed. There were only two green field civil works,
namely: (i) Construction and establishment of a VTC focused on developing livelihood skills
in women in which the MDTF shared only 30% of the cost (the rest being contributed by the
GoSS); and (ii) Building a basic room in Wau for the VC.

84.     Least cost options were always pursued by the project, whilst not sacrificing quality
or correctness of approach. For example, in the case of the civil service training initiatives, it
became clear that the original budget would not accommodate the original numbers
envisaged. Costs of consulting services to be provided in South Sudan had been
underestimated; actual costs were near double those originally envisaged. The decision was
taken to stick to the original principles of the training, viz. target staff from all states as well
as GoSS, target women, augment training with on-the-job mentoring and to train fewer staff.
This has paid off, as the outcomes associated with the training would not have been achieved
without this approach. Training was supported by subsequent on-the-job mentoring to
enhance impact in the workplace. There was a deliberate attempt to make training less
theoretical and more practical in nature.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


                                                     31
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     The project has been judged relevant to South Sudan. At design stage it served as a
useful gap-filling intervention, addressing issues relating to skills development and public
sector reform, the management of information and attempting to raise capacity in the area of
labor market regulation and vocational training. These were all areas that were priorities for
the Government of Southern Sudan, but were at the same time not covered by other DP
interventions. During the life of the project Government priorities changed, but the project
was response to this, and was able to refocus some activities (e.g. by supporting the PSR
Secretariat in the Ministry of Labour and Public Service).

86.    There have been significant achievements for the project, both in terms of
achievements against the key performance indicators, and in terms of longer term outcomes.
These achievements need to be viewed against the context of South Sudan, where the CPA
period was characterized by over-optimism in what could be achieved but poor government
capacity to deliver, huge political and fiscal uncertainty and competing policy priorities.

87.    The first part of the PDO targeted strengthening civil service capacity, better
management of information and enhanced capacity for communications. The following has
been achieved:

      Against the strengthening of civil service capacity objective significant gains were
       achieved by the project, in terms of the numbers of civil servants trained in core skills
       needed for a modern public service, the preparation of a draft Labour legislation, the
       creation of a nodal ministry for ICT, the initiation of a fledgling Reforms Secretariat,
       the drafting of a Medium Term Strategy, and the drafting of a strategy for
       operationalizing Pensions Payments. It is clear that the training initiatives have
       created a network of civil servants committed to modernizing the way in which they
       work, and there is some evidence of the training’s main messages being cascaded
       down through the civil service. The project also provided support to the
       operationalization of a new oversight institution, the South Sudan Civil Service
       Commission, which is now fully operational and established in law. This commission
       is already made significant inputs into the process of restructuring the civil service.
       Almost as a bi-product of the project, there now exists capacity in five ministries and
       agencies (through 30 employees) in Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation,
       developed through formal training and learning on the job.

      In terms of enhanced management of information there are now institutionalized
       document flows within government and publication of key government documents on
       the website and the Public Information Centre. This, in an environment where
       information had not been shared in the public domain is a significant achievement.
       They have the potential to underpin a host if initiatives regarding access to
       information and the enhancement of government accountability. The archives of the
       Cabinet Office are also better organized, and information retrievable. These
       interventions have taken root and are bound to grow in scope and significance; they
       are very important platforms moving forward.
        




                                              32
      In terms of enhanced capacity for communication, the installation of the GoSS email
       is expected to be the first step in securing and facilitating government electronic
       communications. Similarly establishment of the pilot VC link between Juba and Wau
       is expected to be the first step in the wider application of VC technology for
       enhancing the capacity to monitor, hold virtual inter governmental meetings and
       substitute for the high costs and difficulties of physical travel.

88.     The second part of the PDO related to developing the capacity of the government for
regulating the labor market and implementing vocational training programs. The
achievements here are also significant in providing the basic ground work for these objectives.
At project close:

      The GoSS had a draft Vocational Training Policy which aims at harmonization of
       standards and market orientation of the training program. Although only a draft
       document, this policy is in use on a day-to-day basis;
      The GoSS had a draft Labour Act. This has now joined a long list of draft legislative
       instruments waiting to be passed into law;
      Labour officers across Southern Sudan were trained and equipped to improve labor
       administration and employment services
      Staff in Labour Offices had been trained, and had raised awareness of basic concepts
       of Labour Administration, Emergency Employment Mechanisms, and Tripartite
       Arrangements;
      Four VTCs were equipped and three of these were partially functional. Once recurrent
       budget difficulties are resolved these will be resources that can become fully
       operational; and
      Staff in VTCs had been trained and made aware of the need to orient the supply of
       training to the demand of the market, and the need to consider “value for money?
       while considering skills training. For the first time a Tracer Study was done in 2009 of
       the graduates from the Juba VTC which showed that 50% of the graduates secured
       jobs with the bulk of the graduates from the hospitality & catering training programs
       securing jobs. Evidence of the market oriented nature of the training. 44% of the
       graduates obtained a salary increase after the training in Juba VTC. Considering the
       realities on the ground these are significant achievements. The capacity of the staff in
       VTC was also enhanced through management training.

89.     The assessment of the project could have been enhanced if more proactivity had been
exercised at the time of the Mid Term Review by fine tuning the Performance Indicators to
the existing realities. Whilst this would certainly have assisted in a higher assessment of the
project it cannot take away from the very real and substantive achievements of the project in
circumstances which are acknowledged as being unparalleled in the World.

90.     In terms of efficiency, the project was particularly vigilant and conscious about the
need for value for money, evidenced by a restriction on funding of salaries and a focus on
refurbishment over new construction.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                              33
91.     South Sudan still does not have a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy.
Nevertheless, the project was designed to have an important role in poverty alleviation. The
project was responsive to filling the gaps left by sector project interventions by developing
particular capacities across the board for the public service. This recognizes that some core
public sector capacities need to be developed to allow the foundations to be laid for an
administration charged with responsive pro-poor service delivery. Due care was taken in
project design and implementation to make the interventions gender responsive. In particular:

      An exclusive program for developing the capacity of women in GoSS and the states
       titled “Senior Women in Management? was implemented to develop a network of
       women administrators and facilitate better contact between role models and potential
       mentors and their junior colleagues.

      The greenfield Aluakluak VTC is focused on the vocational training of women and
       with time it is expected to develop into a focal point for women-centric interventions
       in income enhancing activities.

92.     The project has also taken into account capacity development needed to enhance
domestic growth. The enhancement in Vocational Training capacity was directly targeted at
the reducing the skills gap, as a result of which the bulk of semi skilled jobs being created in
Southern Sudan are occupied by expatriate workers. These VTC will over time provide the
base for development into institutions of high levels of technical education thereby providing
a sustainable intervention for enhancement of the national income.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

93.     The project was an agent for institutional change across a number of fronts. In
particular:

      The project enabled the Ministry of Labour and Public Service and HRD, GoSS to
       convene workshops in each of the ten states where the principle of “common
       objectives but differentiated functions (across levels of government)? in public service
       delivery were firmly established and accepted by all ten states, in conformity with the
       provisions of the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan.

      The project was instrumental in formalizing the institutional arrangements for the
       management of ICT in Southern Sudan. Prior to the Ministry of Telecommunications
       and Postal Service being formally designated as the nodal point for ICT, this role was
       being performed by the Ministry of Finance, which was inappropriate.

      The project also enabled the establishment of a division of the Ministry of
       Information and Broadcasting to be dedicated to the area of access of public
       information to citizens through the establishment of the PIC. Until then, the MoIB had
       focused primarily on managing the public radio and TV network and press relations.
      The project also assisted in developing the capacity of the fledgling Southern Sudan
       Civil Service Commission which was established in 2005 under the Interim
       Constitution as an advisory and oversight body. The project also enabled the GoSS to
       reestablish its management and operational control over the three existing VTCs
       which, had been eroded during the war years and had been taken over by the state
       governments, in which these are situated. Such centralization was considered


                                              34
       necessary to preserve the technical integrity of the services being provided at these
       institutions.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

94.     A workshop was held with a random sample of eight civil servants who were trained
by ASI and Skills for Southern Sudan as part of the project. Participants were given a
questionnaire to complete, and a very participative discussion followed. In summary, it can
be concluded that the training was relevant and useful, although too hurried. The outreach of
the mentoring had been disappointing; those who benefited found it very useful but too short.
In detail, in terms of the questionnaires:

      Participants were asked how much they remembered of the training. 1 respondent
       indicated that he remembered very much of it, 5 responded that they remembered
       quite a lot, and 2 responded that they could remember basics only. None responded
       that they remembered wither very little or nothing.

      5 of the eight participants felt that the training had been very useful to their jobs, with
       3 indicating that it was moderately useful. None felt it was of little use or no use at all.
       Half of respondents noted that they referred to the training materials distributed as
       part of the course quite often. Not one had ever referred to the materials.

      In terms of the mentoring, it transpired that two of the eight participants had not
       benefited from this at all. This was something of a disappointing revelation. Of those
       who received it, 2 felt had been very useful indeed, and 3 felt it had been moderately
       useful. One felt it has been of very little use. 5 respondents felt that the mentoring had
       been too short in terms of time.

      Participants were able to demonstrate that they had retained some key messages
       around the training (particularly around strategic planning, decision making,
       teamwork, staff appraisal, time management) and most were able to give credible
       examples of where the training needs had been useful in real-life work situations.
95.      In the discussions that followed, those that had benefited from the mentoring scheme
felt it a good idea which had the chance of making the class-room learning more concrete.
But it had not been appropriately followed up. Of the class-room learning all felt that it had
been too hurried, with three key topics being covered daily. But the follow-up workshops,
attended by some, had been very useful to participants.

96.    At the conclusion of the discussion participants gave some valuable insights into
challenges currently facing the civil service. The lack of induction training was bemoaned.
Most felt that the educational standards shown by young entrants to the service were far from
acceptable, meaning that relatively senior members of staff were left to do more menial tasks.
The lack English language skills were also seen as a particular problem, with most young
people being more proficient in Arabic.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High



                                               35
97.     There are significant risks to the development outcome of the project, many arising as
a result of the context. There are technical risks which relate to the sophisticated IT systems
which need to be maintained. This has already proved a problem in respect of the document
retrieval system (EDRM) in the Cabinet Office where a scanner break-down has caused long-
term interruption to the system. There is broad commitment to embracing the potential of IT,
and there is even emerging a broader understanding of the strategic issues of ITC at the
Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services. Establishments have been expanded to
accommodate the need for technical staff with the skills needed to effect IT management and
maintenance, but there has often been an issue with funding these establishments. For
example in 2011 the MoT&PS had advertised for IT engineers, and had identified 40 suitably
qualified candidates. However, due to budget constraints recruitment had not gone forward.
This has also proved the case in the States. The gains that ITC can secure are fragile,
particularly in a context such as South Sudan. Without the necessary skills sustainability
becomes a major issue.

98.      The main driver of the issue of technical sustainability has been the inability or
unwillingness of Government to deliver on some of its financial commitments. There are
significant issues of funding beyond the life of the project which have a huge impact on the
risks to the development outcomes. The VTCs, whilst equipped by the project, have not been
given appropriate budgets (in terms of recruiting staff and maintaining an appropriate
establishment, or meeting running costs such as the provision of generator fuel) and as a
result of this some are barely functional. The Public Sector Reform unit in the Ministry of
HRD has suffered a similar fate. Its establishment fully funded by the project, the unit was
then effectively disbanded as a result of Government not budgeting for its running costs.
Similar fates have been suffered across the IT interventions of the project (Email, VC
facilitates, the EDRM) where the bandwidth needed to sustain these systems has not been
paid for by Government. What is clear is that Government faces a whole host of competing
priorities – everything is urgent – without the resources to pay them all. At the same time,
prioritization seems to be a problem issue. As things stand it is perhaps fair to say that in the
parts of Government that make prioritization and related funding decisions public sector
reform is not accorded the importance that it might be given.

99.    Ongoing issues of security also present risks to the achievement of development
outcomes. Theft has been a significant issue to one of the labor offices visited. IDPs have also
been an issue in two of the VTCs. Finally, there is one overarching risk that threatens all
development activities in South Sudan, namely the potential for a return to conflict. Whilst it
is never easy to determine the exact extent of this risk, many feel it to be real. There is
constant low-level conflict in the border areas with Sudan, and instability in parts of the
country due to ethnic conflict.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

100. The Bank team worked closely with Development Partners and the few counterparts
from the GoSS who were available to provide a coherent project vision taking into account


                                               36
the context issues as they were understood at the time. Whilst this project vision proved to be
overly optimistic, it does not differ significantly from the prevailing view of the context at the
time.

101. The Bank fielded three missions in 2006 after the GoSS submitted its Initial Project
Proposal in March 2006. The first was in August 2006 (for project preparation), the second in
September 2006 (for pre appraisal) and the last in November 2006 (just prior to the meeting
of the Oversight Committee for approval of the Final Project Proposal).Considerable efforts
were made to ensure that the project interventions did not overlap with existing interventions
which were underway in 2006. This was important since there was no formal process for
coordination of donors at the time within GoSS and uncoordinated and entrepreneurial action
by individual donors was the order of the day.

102. The Bank convened a Reference Group chaired by the Minister of Labour, Public
Service and HRD and consisting of all the donor partners (UNDP, USAID, DFID, Norway)
to discuss the project interventions prior to submitting the proposal. The recommendations
received were reflected in the project design. A detailed risk assessment and risk mitigation
analysis was done on a format which was at the time still being evolved for the Region and
action steps in this direction identified, which is appended to the Final Project Proposal. The
Final project Proposal only identified 12 indicators for the purposes of monitoring the grant.
However the Bank also prepared a Results Framework in September 2007, despite there
being no baselines for most of the indicators, after approval of the proposal and subsequent to
the grant becoming effective as an additional management tool for monitoring the project
progress. Whilst the Results Framework proved to be too complex and ambitious to monitor
for a nascent government especially in view of the inter governmental (GoSS-States)
structure of the project in the case of Labour, Vocational Training, Training and the VSAT
network, nevertheless it did provide some milestones against which to chart project progress.

103. The arrangements formulated for ensuring fiduciary safeguard worked well with no
reported cases of fraud or corruption and 100% disbursement of the grant amount. Similarly
the Project Management arrangements conceived in the face of less than adequate existing
arrangements for coordination across ministries and states worked reasonable well with
regular meeting of the PICs and the PMG and less frequent meetings of the PTC on a “need
to meet? basis though the GOM ceased functioning once the Minister present at the time of
project conception changed designation.

104. The Final Project Proposal included a list of Prior Actions to ensure quality at entry
and a Readiness Checklist detailing the list of actions to be completed and the time line of
completion. The project also went through review by the Regional Oversight Committee and
the comments received during the review were carefully incorporated into the project design.
All efforts were made to apply the best practice guidelines for ensuring project quality at
entry in the context of a government which was being formed even as the project was being
prepared.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

105. The project became effective on January 22, 2007 within one month of the signing of
the Grant on December 22, 2006. Until August 2008 the project was supervised by an offsite


                                               37
TTL but from October 2007 he had the support of a Senior Public Sector Specialist on the
ground in Juba. Project Supervision was formally conducted during this period through
missions in February 2007, July 2007 and July 2008. ISRs were filed for the July 2007 and
July 2008 missions. Over the period December 2008 to June 2011, ISRs have been regularly
filed in December 2008, June 2009, December 2009, June 2010 and March 2011. A total of 8
ISRs were filed over the life of the project.

106. From October 2007 there was real-time Bank staff support for the project on the
ground in Juba. This certainly helped the quality of supervision, and had an impact on
disbursement, demonstrated by the expenditure profile of the project reproduced below:

 Annual Expenditure*
                2007         2008       2009        2010        2011          Total
 US$ million 0.51            1.89       6.51        3.06        1.75          13.72**
 % of total     4%           14%        47%         22%         13%           100%
* The financial accounts of the GoSS and the MDTF are kept on a calendar year basis
** The total grant amount (GoSS and MDTF combined) was US$ 13.72 million against
which US$ 28,503/- were paid to ILO but not used by it and US$ 2911/- were ineligible
expenditure.

107. There was intensive support from the Bank team including fiduciary specialists
(Financial Management and Procurement) in training the Project Management Team of GoSS
in Bank procedures and processes of which GoSS had no experience. On Procurement
especially the expected support from the “contracted in? Procurement Agent of the GoSS
remained weak and sporadic until mid 2008. This increased the load on Bank staff on the
ground to guide the PMG and there was a considerable amount of day to day assistance
which was required. Despite this, and as the expenditure data shows the project did not gather
momentum until the end of 2008 by when the bulk of the procurement actions had been
commenced.

108. The project was extended by one year from a closing date of December 31, 2009 to
December 31, 2010 to allow sufficient time for the ongoing activities to be completed and for
a realignment of the project with the changing requirements of the government. Specific
provision was made for the Public Service Reform Program of the government which had
been inaugurated in October 2008 and which required support for dissemination of the
government’s reforms strategy throughout the ten states of Southern Sudan. From December
2009 onwards the TTL supervising relocated off-site with no support on the ground. However,
by this time all the required actions related to procurement had been completed and
construction activity had been largely completed. The project had to be extended a second
time in December 2010 for another five months until May 31, 2011 to allow the completion
of installation of the GoSS Video Conferencing facilities and the GoSS email system and
completion of a boundary wall around the Juba VTC which had been stopped since mid-2009
due to potential concerns with adherence to social safeguards standards.

109. There was considerable support from the CMU in maintaining the dialogue at the
highest levels from June 2008 onwards which also ensured the quality of supervision. For
example, various ISRs include, in the comments of the Country manager, follow-up actions
taken by him with interlocutors in GoSS, often as State minister or Minister level.




                                             38
110. The Bank however missed an opportunity to make a more realistic assessment of the
potential risk that the PDOs were unlikely to be satisfactorily met during the Medium Term
Review of the project in August 2009. Had the risk analysis been conducted more accurately
at that stage, the project PDOs could have been restructured in line with the realities on the
ground and hence permitted the project rating to be improved by project close. Given that a
number of the issues that eventually resulted in the non-achievement of some of the PDO
indicators were routinely reported in ISRs this does indeed constitute a lost opportunity.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

111. Given the satisfactory rating for quality at entry and the moderately satisfactory rating
for supervision, ICR guidance requires overall Bank performance to conform with the
outcome rating which is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

112. The commitment of Government through the life of the project was mixed. There was
high commitment at the commencement of the project at the highest levels. The Group of
Ministers comprising four ministers representing the implementing agencies in the project
met twice in 2007. However with a change in the cabinet portfolios in mid 2007 the sense of
ownership of the program at the highest levels was diluted.

113. The original contribution of the GoSS to the project was agreed at US$ 5.49 million
but only US$ 1.56 million was contributed on account of the fiscal crisis resulting from the
fall in oil prices in 2009. The MDTF agreed to enhance its own contribution to make up the
deficit in project financing.

114. The fiscal crisis was not the only challenge that GoSS faced during the project period.
Indeed, the CPA period was marked by a continuous series of challenges around first
elections in May 2009, the Referendum in January 2011 and Independence in July 2011,
along with the rigors of meeting obligations under the CPA. These political challenges have
undoubtedly distracted the government from the nuts and bolts of public sector institutional
and capacity development.

115. There are numerous examples which illustrate the inefficiency of coordination and
dispute resolution mechanisms within government and reversals of decisions and policy
alterations resulting from change in ministerial portfolio which adversely affected project
implementation. These include:

      Inordinate delays in the passing of legal instruments. There were no Public Service
       Act and Regulations until January 2011 when it was approved by Presidential Decree.
       There are still no Public Financial Management or Procurement Acts;




                                              39
      The impasse imposed by the Ministry of Constitutional Development and Legal
       Affairs refusing the accept the standard Bank formats for contracts and insisting on
       changing these standard formats set back contracting by around six months in 2008.
       The imposition of a fee by the same ministry for vetting contracts while the Ministry
       of Finance refused to provide a budget for such expense resulted in an ineligible
       expense of US$ 2911which had not been resolved at project close; and

      The decision to part finance the NPA from project funds, for construction of the
       Aluakluak VTC was taken after a delay of more than two years in 2009 end at the
       ministerial level even though the government had identified the NPA as the preferred
       Implementing Agency in the Final Project Proposal.
116. These are a few examples which illustrate the inefficiency of coordination and dispute
resolution mechanisms within government and reversals of decisions and policy changes with
change in ministerial portfolio which adversely affected project implementation.

117. As we have seen in discussion of risks to project development outcomes, the project
also often suffered from a poor financial environment. Whilst elements needed in terms of
recurrent government funding were often reflected in the budget, there was often
considerable uncertainty as to whether these funds would actually be delivered. In some cases
they have not.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

118. At the operational level of Under Secretaries there was significant commitment and
the Project Technical Committee met several times to discharge its oversight responsibilities.
At the level of the Project Director and the Team Leaders there was very high commitment
but the issues confronting them being systemic in nature they found it difficult to deal with
implementation impediment. The GoSS also kept the PMG adequately staffed with specialists
“contracted in? for project management, procurement, accounting and monitoring which
contributed significantly to improvements in project implementation seen from 2009 onwards.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

119. The performance of the Government was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory and the
performance of the Implementing Agency as Satisfactory. Accordingly the overall
performance of the government is assessed at Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

120. There are a number of lessons to be learnt from this project which are specific to the
project itself. These are set out below.

121. Project outputs should not be linked to the outputs of other projects since non
completion or delay in the linked projects can adversely affect project outputs. This is
particularly true in fragile environments where there is a frequent change in the priorities of
government, the administrative processes are not institutionalized and the regulatory


                                              40
framework is unclear. This is illustrated by the poor performance against Performance
Indicator 1 relating to standardization of the key HR aspects in GoSS and states. The project
interventions initially related to the dissemination of the Act (available then in draft) and the
framing of state level Acts based on the GoSS Act. However the Act did not get approved
until early 2011 by which time the project was closing. Delay in the passing and
promulgation of draft legislation has been an ongoing issue in South Sudan, in all probability
due to a complex political economy where the imperative to be transparent and accountable is
tempered by competing vested interests.

122. ‘High tech’ interventions in fragile states such as ICT need to have a sustained
program of support spanning at least five to seven years with adequate “contracting in? of
capacity provided for in the project itself. Qualified human resources to support the
intervention are not easily attracted to work in the public sector even if they are available.
The project relied on the confidence of the government that they would be in a position to
recruit and appoint qualified staff to manage the interstate telecommunication links, the
Video Conferencing infrastructure and the GoSS email. This was based on the relatively good
fiscal position of the GoSS due to oil revenues and their insistence on managing these
technologies themselves instead of “contracting out? or “contracting in?. This resulted in
significant delays in implementation of interventions and the less than adequate assessments
in Performance Indicators 4 and 8 related to management of information, access to
information and improved communications through ICT.

123. Significant thought needs to be given to engagements which require ‘counterpart’
funding of running costs over the short to medium term. A number of interventions have
suffered due to basic running costs, intended to be met by government not eventually being
provided for in budget disbursements. Whilst it might be feasible to solicit covenants from
governments relating to these at the outset of the project, it is clear that in a fragile
environment it is difficult to make these binding. In the case of South Sudan an additional
challenge which has impacted on this has been the volatility of a budget reliant so heavily on
oil (as the fiscal crisis of 2009 will attest).

124. Project interventions and resultant outputs and outcomes must be imbedded in policy
documents, legislation or regulations of the recipient if they are to be implemented in a short
project period of three years. Project interventions which are not well grounded in this
framework should be avoided in fragile situations where the regulatory framework is
dynamic and frequent changes in priorities are to be expected. The public service related
interventions and the transparency and communication related interventions were adversely
affected since they were not grounded in a firm commitment of the government towards
achieving these outcomes.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

125. Government has contested ratings for the project (at ‘moderately satisfactory’) and its
own performance (at ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.

126. It is accepted that the project has achieved much in a fragile environment.
Nevertheless, a key indicator relating to management of key aspects of the public service in a
standardized manner could not be met because of a failure to pass legislation that


                                               41
underpinned these processes. Whilst this example is not necessarily being used to
demonstrate a lack of commitment from GoSS – it is accepted that there were political
dimensions to this – it nevertheless represents a significant underachievement of the project.
6 of the 12 key performance indicators have been met, and whilst this is something of an
achievement given the context it does not warrant a ‘satisfactory’ rating, which implies that
there have been no significant issues with project implementation.
        

127. In terms of government’s own performance, it is accepted that a number of skills
needed to be mastered quickly for the management and implementation of the project. This
has been acknowledged at several points in the document. However, there were real issues
with regard to coordinating certain activities across government, around apparent changes in
policy and priorities, and around maintaining a sustained commitment to some aspects of the
project (e.g. through the provision of recurrent budgets for the VTCs, or for bandwidth).

(b) Co financiers/Donors

128. Consultations were held with a number of donors, including UNDP (particularly
active in capacity building and institutional development at sub-national level) and the Joint
Donor Team (managers of the capacity Building Trust Fund).

129. Overall, there was agreement that the project had been a modest success. There was a
feeling that the project had been overly ambitious, but that the optimism that had driven this
had also driven optimism in their own interventions. There was particular recognition for the
project’s engagement with labor regulation and vocational training. This was not an area
which had initially been tackled by other donors, but there was a growing recognition that
this was an important area, and it was hoped that the potential benefits of CABIHRD’s
intervention would be realized.

130. In respect of broader engagements with Civil Service Reform, there was a distinct
frustration. GoSS’s failure to sustain a public sector reform unit with its own resources
resonated, and taken as an indication that there had not been an understanding within
Government of the need to strategically manage civil service reform across government from
one focal point, afforded appropriate political support. Donors recognized that this had
resulted in a piecemeal approach to reform, but it was also recognized that in part they
themselves had contributed to that. Donor coordination, both in respect of public sector
reform and more widely, had not been all it could have been.

131. There was a shared frustration in respect of the strategic environment in Southern
Sudan. There had been a distinct lack of continuity, with Government changing the agenda,
and donors apparently willing to allow this. For example, it was noted that the Juba Compact,
effectively a MoU between GoSS and donors resulting from the fiscal crisis, had been the
focal point of discussion for a while, but that despite its potential (not least through the
indicators of progress that GoSS had signed up to) it had been allowed to wither on the vine,
and replaced by the ‘Core Functions’ framework. This in turn had given way to the South
Sudan Development Plan. This lack of continuity had been detrimental, and had actually
impacted on CABIHRD. For example, it was noted that the medium term Strategy for CSR
drafted by the project had been superseded by the SSDP, when it may have been more
appropriate for donors to have collectively urged GoSS to focus on what it already had – and
operationalised it!



                                             42
132. Donors were appreciative of the capacity building and training provided by the project.
UNDP noted that all too often inappropriate capacity building had been provided by donors –
often too complex, not relevant and not appropriately appreciative of the context. But it was
felt that the targeted nature of CABIHRD’s training, with its emphasis on on-the-job training
and mentoring, delivered by Adam Smith International who had a keen appreciation of
context and who had tried to position the training within a broader strategic framework had
avoided the common South Sudan pitfalls. In respect of these pitfalls, and future avoidance of
them, UNDP confided that it was working on some capacity development protocols with the
Ministry of Labour, detailing approaches to the provision of technical assistance and
minimum standards to be observed with respect to capacity building.

133. Donors noted that, with the benefit of hindsight, no-one had engaged appropriately
with the demand side of governance, and with the building of capacity of CSOs.

Public Service Training

A random sample was taken of attendees of the Management Development Training Program held in
2009. Although over 20 trainees were identified and contacted, including a number of women, only
eight trainees eventually turned up to a workshop event held to gain feedback on the training program.

All the trainees were male, and all based in Juba. They came from the Ministries of Education, Public
Service, Information, Petroleum and Commerce from GoSS, and the Ministries of Information and
Commerce for Equatorial State. All participants were at Director or Director General level. Attendees
are listed below:

             Name                            Designation                      Organization

 Daniel Comboni                   Deputy Director, Information     Ministry of Information, Central
                                                                   Equatoria State

 Paul Riak                        Acting DG, Admin and Finance     Ministry of Commerce

 Martin Awad                      Director General, Survey         Central Equatorial State

Participants were given a questionnaire to complete. The following results emerged:

       Participants were asked how much they remembered of the training. 1 respondent
        indicated that he remembered very much of it, 5 responded that they remembered
        quite a lot, and 2 responded that they could remember basics only. None responded
        that they remembered either very little or nothing. This is considered satisfactory.

       5 of the eight participants felt that the training had been very useful to their jobs, with
        3 indicating that it was moderately useful. None felt it was of little use or no use at all.
        Half of respondents noted that they referred to the training materials distributed as
        part of the course quite often. Not one had ever referred to the materials. This is
        considered satisfactory.

       In terms of the mentoring, it transpired that two of the eight participants had not
        benefited from this at all. This was something of a disappointing revelation. Of those
        who received it, 2 felt had been very useful indeed, and 3 felt it had been moderately
        useful. One felt it has been of very little use. 5 respondents felt that the mentoring had
        been too short in terms of time. Overall, this is considered moderately satisfactory.

       Participants were able to demonstrate that they had retained some key messages
        around the training (particularly around strategic planning, decision making,
        teamwork, staff appraisal, time management) and most were able to give credible
        examples of where the training needs had been useful in real-life work situations. This
        is considered satisfactory.
In the discussions that followed, those that had benefited from the mentoring scheme felt it a
good idea which had the chance of making the class-room learning more concrete. But it had
not been appropriately followed up.



                                                 52
Of the class-room learning all felt that it had been too hurried, with three key topics being
covered daily. But the follow-up workshops, attended by some, had been very useful to
participants.

As the language of training had been English, participants were asked how they perceived
their skills. All rated their skill at reading and speaking English as excellent or good, whilst
with writing all but one rated similarly (with one participant rating himself average).

At the conclusion of the discussion participants gave some valuable insights into challenges
currently facing the civil service. The lack of induction training was noted as a lacuna for the
civil service. Most felt that the educational standards shown by young entrants to the service
were far from acceptable, meaning that relatively senior members of staff were left to do
more menial tasks. The lack English language skills were also seen as a particular problem,
with most young people being more proficient in Arabic.

        Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The overall assessment of ‘moderately satisfactory’ is contested by Government, which feels
that although the project faced a number of challenges, it delivered on the ground in a fragile
context. It therefore feels that, in view of the successes of the project, the overall assessment
should be changed to ‘satisfactory’.

There is also disagreement with the assessment of government performance as ‘moderately
satisfactory’. The point is made that it was difficult for a nascent government to have
internalized the complicated and confusing World Bank processes. A change to ‘satisfactory’
is recommended in the light of this. In particular the following points have been made:

      The impact of the change in leadership at cabinet level is disputed. Changes in
       leadership have not impacted on the development agenda of government, which is
       based on development plans;
      Whilst it is accepted that GoSS commitments to contribute to the project could not be
       met, this was due to externalities (the fiscal crisis of 2009 which was triggered by the
       falling price of oil); citing this as a lack of commitment to the project is unjustified.;
      In respect of the failure to pass the Public Service Act, it is argued that this is due to
       the intensely political nature of civil service reform; and
      The issue about MoCDLA imposing a fee is a reflection of the evolution of
       institutions in a new state. The issue was resolved quickly.


The assessment of the project at quality of entry as ‘satisfactory’, when then during the life of
the project things appeared, per the ICR assessment, to deteriorate is noteworthy. The project
was designed according to the advice received from the World Bank. If there were problems
in implementation an organization such as the World Bank should have anticipated them and
taken measures to overcome them.

Overall, the assessment reflects an impractical expectation of institutional perfection from a
new state and ignores the fragile context in which South Sudan operates.
