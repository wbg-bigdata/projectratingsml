MbEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE 1DA TO THE EXECUTIVE DItECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA FOR
A TE NICAL EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAIN1NG SUPPORT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for SDR 8.9 million, the
equivalent of US$12.5 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance
a technical education and vocational training support project. The Government will contribute
US$1.7 million equivalent. The French Government (FAC) will contribute 12 million FF (US$2.2
million equivalenf.
2.           Counta Economie BRXognd  Virtually all of Mauritania's 1.1 million square
kilometers is desert, providing a llm1ted resource base for about 2.0 million inhabitants (up from 1.3
million in 1977). lacome per capita is US$500 (1991), placing Mauritania among the low-income
economies. Its population is growing at about 2.9% per year. The majority of the population has
extremely low standards of living: life expectancy at birt is 45 years, under-five mortality is about
200 per thousand, and less than 30% of the population is literate in either Arabic or French. Forty
four percent of the population is under the age of 15. Periodic drought and worsening economic
conditions have accelerated a sedentarization process: the nomadic population fell from 73% in 1965
to 12% in 1988, and urban areas now represent nearly 50% of the population, the highest level of
urbanization in the Sahel. Key industrial sectors are fishing and mining. Agriculture remas the
largest employer (53% of the employed work-force), while the informal sector, growing at about 7%
a year, absorbs the largest number of new entrants to the labor market.
3.           At the start of the 1990s, Mauritania experienced external and internal shocks,
including a decline in world iron ore prices and a severe drought which increased the precariousness
of its economic development. Deteriorating relations with Senegal led to an influx of repatriated
Mauritanians (180,000) and a significant outflow of skilled foreign (mainly Senegalese) workers.
This upheaval exacerbated urban problems, especially unemployment, and caused an imbalance in
the labor market. Foreign aid was reduced because of Mauritania's political stance during the 1992
Gulf war. These external factors were aggravated by institutional deficiencies in the agricultural and
fishing sectors that reduced GNP growth to -1.9% in 1990 and an average of 0.4% in the following
two years. In an attempt to enhance competitiveness and expand the country's export base, the
Govermment devalued the Ouguiya by 27% in terms of US dollars in October 1992. This exchange
rate adjusutent is being supported by restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. The IMF and IDA
have, as a result, proceeded with strucural adjustment support.
4.           Economic growth continues to be constrained by an inelastic revenue base, a heavy
debt service burden, continued vulnerability to exogenous factors (commodity prices and drought),
a fragile natural resource environment and a 1imited human capital resource base. However, the
Government is committed to pursuing its adjustment program. This will involve coninued focus on
strengthening public resource management, restructuring the fisheries sector strategy, providing an
enabling environment for private sector Investment and growth, and accelerating the development of
humat resources. The Government will seek to promote key social programs such as those targeted
at the promotion of women or prevention of AIDS, and continue to inroduce emvironmental action
programs. Despite its susceptibilityto external shocks, the economy is expectedto grow at about3%
per annum, with agriculture, fisheries, construction and the informal sector the most likely
contributors to growth.

5.           Sector.Band    Mauritania's education sector stae  has evolved under a
structural adjusment program underway since 1986, and an ongoing education sector restructuring
project (Cr.1943-MAU, US$18.2 million, 1988), co-financed with AfDB (US$17.4 million). The
Government his succossfly implemented several restructuring measures over the past four years,
particulaly in primary education where the enrollment ratio has increased from 48% (1988) to 57%
(1992).
6.           The technical education and vocational training (rEV'!) system consists of: (a) gm
_ 1g3             educal  provided by the Ministry of Nadonal Education, which operates two
lower- and two upper-secondary schools and one tertiary level instituton. Total enrollment is about
1,180 (1991-92), and annual output about 500; (b) sillaajgmg provided by the Miistry of Civil
Service and Labor, which operat one national ocational training center with a potential throughput
of 700, and four regional centers, to open in 1993; and (c)    fic tai*, both pre
employment and sklls upgrading, provided by technical ministries (such as the Ministry of Fisheries
which operates a maritime training school), and public entprises (miling, public utDities). Private
sector training operations are small and focused mainly on trining for the tertiary sector.
Responsibility for planning and implemendng technical education and vocational training is shared
among severa entities; there is no national coordinating body.
7.           During the 1980s, labor supply increased at n average rate of 5% p.a., with women
increasingly eerngthe labormarket. In 1991, thetotal activepopulationwas estmated at590,000.
The primary sector employed approximately 240,000 (of which 9,000 in fisheries). The secondary
sector employed 30,000 (of which 17,000 in manufting ;m  mining), and the tertary sector
employed 190,000 (of which 17,500 in Government administration); in these two sectors, 150,000
(or about one-third) are in informal activities. Ihe remainder, 130,000 or 22%, are unemployed;
about 95% of the unemployed have never worked before; 43% of the unemployed are women.
Graduates from the training system have difficulty finding employment.
8.           For the next five years (1993-1998), the Government's priorities for technical
education and vocational training are spelled out in a 'Letter of Sector Development Policy-
tanmitted tlDA in May 1993. For                  , the strategy aims to firther stegthen
knowledge of the labor market and follow-up of graduates, Improve the qity and relevance of
training programs at all levels, promote private sector contributions to raining, improve efficiency
and control costs, and provide more effective quality control and more efficient management. For
vocational traib=, fthe Government intends to restore the quality of training, improve the system's
responsiveness to labor market demand, develop trainig support for the informal sector, and develop
more efioctive ways to promote private sector participation in operating and financing vocational
training programs. For mantime eriWng, the focus would be on qualitative improvements tO training
programs and facilities, and on private sector financing and monitoring of all maritme training
programs.
9.           .oed                Thjectives  'Me proposed project would assist the Government in
implementing its long-term development strategy for establishing a coheren TEVT system, staffd
largely by national instructors, efficient and of good quality, and responsive to labor market demands.
The project would be a specific investment credk, operating within an agreed policy framework
established in the Policy Letter md designed to (a) establish a common mamgement sucture for the
TEVT sysem; (b) increase the financW and optional autonomy of TEVT instions; and (c)
promote the participon of employers in opetg and fiancing technical and vocational training.
Progress in achieving the project's objectives would be assessed against monitoring indicators,



-3-
developed and agreed upon with the Goverment, which include teacher recruitment and dvployment,
staff/student ratios, unit costs, placement raes, and programs targeted at micro-entrepreneurs.
10.          Prjec   Don. The project would finance investments designed to: (a) maintain
the qualit and improve the efficiency of technical education by: (i) creating a resource centAir for
technical education and vocational training to provide professional s;^pport to training instiutions and
staff, (ii) establishing a capacity for technical teacher training to fi1l curremnt vacancies and teplace
depating foreigners, (iii) setting up an institutional support fund to finance training activities
developed and implemented by training institutions, and (iv) constructing a workshop for agricultural
mechanics training; @) revitiz yocational trainig by: () implemning a restructuring progr
for the national vocationai training center, and (i) establishing a training support fund to finance
training activities initiated by and for mico-enterprises, informal sector workers and apprentices; (c)
sul7Smaitimesetor trainngby: (i) constructing nw facilities for the National Maridme Training
School, and (ii) supporting program development and staff training for the maritime sector; and (d)
strenAen secr planning and management by: (i) strengthening the planning and programming
capacities of the ministries responsible for technical and vocational trainig, and (ii) supporting
project management and coordination. Total project costs are estimated at US$16.4 million. Ihe
cost estimates and disbursement plans are shown in Schedules A and B, respectively.
11.         I'Wect 1"lmUda. Day-to-day management and implementation of each
project component would be the responsibility of the concerned ministries, as follows: The technical
educati nsonmonS would be managed bv the Department of Technical Education of the Ministry
of Education; the vocational training    a     would be managed by the Department of Vocational
Training of the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, Youth and Sports; and the maritime
gMnt would be under the DeparUen  of Maritime Training of the Ministry of Maritlme
Economy and Fishing. A small, high-level g, representing key ministries and
employers' unions responsible for training and manpower development, would guide the development
of the sector and oversee the implementation of the project's policy measures. A technical
~mmmftee attached to the policy committee, would oversee the implementation of work programs
and projects approved by the policy committee, approve annual operating and investment budgets of
training institutions, supervise the operations of the resource cener, and approve expenditues from
th training support fund. The ietCoodinating Unit (PCU), an integral part of the Ministry of
Plan, would be responsible for day-to-day coordination of project activities, administrative and
financial matters, monitoring project implementation and outcomes, and inter-agency coordination.
In addition, the PCU would provide monitoring fimctions with respect to the policy measures. Ihe
project is expected to be completed over a four-year period; the IDA Credit would be disbursed over
5 years.
12.          Projec Susinabil. The project would enhance the long-tem  sustainability of
the TEVT system by improving the quality and relevance of the training programs, and the ability
of training instiions to respond to changes in labor market demands. Ihis will be Mauritania's first
effort to address the pressing training needs of the informal sector. Furthermore, financial
sustainabiity would be enhanced by securing operational and financial support from employers
benefitting from professional training facilities. To that end, each training institution will be
governed by a unique statute governing its internal operations and exernal relations, with employers
sitting on its governing board. A statute will also define the responsibilities, functions, career
strcture and remuneration of technical teachers and vocational trainers.
13.           t. The Bank Group has been lnvolved in the education and training
sectors in Maurtia since 1975. The first two projects (Credits 459-MAU and 1214-MAU, both



-4 -
completed), supported vocational training, teacher training, training for the fisheries sector, and
manpower studies. The ongoing education project supports the first phase of a long-term
restructring program, focusing on basic education. The project also supports key restructuring
measures In tedcnical education and vocational taning and is the first IDA operation to include
policy measures to improve resource use and stimulate private financing of education. During its
implementation, the Bank continued 'ts dialogue on educaion policies and programs with the
Government and worked closely with other donors to coordinate activities. These efforts led to the
decision to prepare a separate operation in support of the TEVT system.
14.          From an operational perspective, the project completion report (PCR) for the first
education project reports serious implementatou delays as a result of weak project management and
shortcomings in project preparation which led to major revisions, and the dropping of several
components. The PCR for the second project reports significant improvements in project
management, although one major component - the maritime training school - was dropped for lack
of donor financing (it was to be finaced by the European Development Fund). Inplementation of
the ongoing education project is satisfactory, with an efficient projczt management team, and
generally good adherence to the sector adjustment program. In particular, restructuring measures in
technical education have been successfully implemented due to strong commitment from the Teuhnical
Education Department. However, because of poor management of the national vocational training
center, insufficient Bank supervision and limited cooperation with employers, the project's objectives
to strengthen Mauritania's capacity to upgrade the vocational skills of its labor force have nc  been
taned. Te manaement siuation at the center has improved with the recent appointment of a new
management team, and contacts with employers are slowly being re-eslished. Discussions on the
role of the private sector in the management and fincing of maritime training also began under the
ongoing project but have yet to be consolidated and implemented.
15.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy (discussed in
February 1993 in conjunction with the presentation of the Construction Capacity and Employment
Project) recognizes that human resource development and, especially, the type of technical and
vocational training supported through the proposed project, is a pre-requisite for achieving
Mauriania's economic development objectives. The strategy amphasizes the importance of the
fisheries sector and the need to build a solid human resource base. The Bank's policy work in the
vocational and education training sector provides usefil guidance for developing training systems
responsive to difficult economic and social conditions such as those prevafling in Mauritania, whilst
IDA's long-standing support for education and training in Mauritania places the Association in a good
position to promote cooperation between ministries, public and private sectors, and the donor
commuity.
16.          Az.ed Actions As conditngof credit fficxem, the Government would: (a)
adopt the legal instruments establishing the policy committee and the technical committee, and appoint
their members; (b) adopt the legal instruments establishing the resource and monitoring center; (c)
appoint the project manager and the administator for the PCU, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA, and have them in post; and (d) appoint an independent auditor on a muti-year
contract acceptable to IDA. The effectiveness of an agreement with FAC to assist in financing a part
of the project would be an additional conditon of effectiveness. As a ditionof di    for
the vocational training center, the Government would adopt the restuctring plar for the center and
begin to implement a staffing plan acceptable to IDA. As a condio of dimnt for the training
support fud, the Government would establish the fund and adopt a procedural manal for its
operation, satisfactory to IDA, and appoint a technical auditor for the fimd. As a conditiof
disusment for the maritime training school, the Government would (a) conclude an areement wih



-5 -
the federation of shipowners stipulating the cotibution of the private sector to the operatng cost
of the school; (b) amend and adopt the school's institutional statute providing for representation of
tfie federation of shipowners on the goveraning board; and (c) adopt a restructring plan and begin to
implement a staff assignment plan acceptable to IDA.
17.                                Thnirou l Aspcs  Ibis is a Category C project, without any direct impact
on the environment. The major constructions (the Maritime Training School in Nouadhibou and a
workshop for training agriculturil mechanics in Boghe) would respect national environmental laws,
would be built on Government land and would not displace anyone.
18.         Pojedt Objectiv  Categorlgs.  The project responds to the human resource
development and anti-poverty objectives of the Government. Providing better opportunities and
increased access to vocational training, in particular for the informal sector, and involving employers
in the training process, are key steps toward ataining these objectives.
19.          Poect Beneft. Improvements In the quality and relevance of technical education
and vocational training are expected from the creation of the resource center and the two support
funds which w%,uld benefit all training institutions country-wide. Other mutually reinforcing quality
improvement measures, in the form of well-trained instructors, good pedagogical back-stopping,
adequate training facilities, and improved management would enhance internal efficiency and reduce
wastage. The impact of these measures would be felt in: (a) increased relevance of training programs
to labor market demand, as training would shift from a supply-driven to a more flexible, demand-
driven system where employers increasingly participate in the development, operation and finsacing
of the training programs; (b) improved labor productivity as students would receive better-quaity,
more relevant training; and (c) enhanced financial sustainabiity of the training systm by transferring
responsibility for co-financing the cost of vocational and mariime training to the private sector,
resuting in (i) an increase of its share of TEVT recurrent cost financing from 9% in 1992 to 25%
in 1997, and (Hi) a 13-percent increase in real terms in recufrent expenditure financing for TEVT on
general fiscal revenues over the same period.
20.          froiect Blab. There are two main risks. Eirs, the economy may not be able to
generate enough employment to absorb all graduates from the training system. This risk would be
addressed by: (a) increasing managerial and financial autonomy of training institutions allowing them
to better integrate training with employment and hence encouraging the placement of graduates in
jobs; and (b) establishing an employment monitoring system, that would allow continual and careful
adjustment of the development and output of the training system to estimated labor market demands.
Sg=, the training system may not be able to respond adequately to labor demands. This risk
would be reduced by increasing the participation of employers in the design, development, delivery
and financing of training programs, through employer representation on the governing boards of
training institutions.
21.          Recommend. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
