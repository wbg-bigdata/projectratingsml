VI1-H NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGIHWAY No. I BEIIWEEN VINFI AND DONG HA
ENlVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
EXECUIrIVE SUMMARY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.  The main components of the project that might have an environmental impact are
the rehabilitation of 293 km of existing road, the construction of new bridges and
the location of quarries, borrow pits, asphalt plant, worker camps and dumps.
2.  The road will follow the existing alignment (except for the 2 major bridges at
Chanh Hoa, Km 650.40 and Quan Hau, Km 671.05). This will reduce land acqui-
sition, encroachment on residential, commercial and agricultural activities and will
minimize environmental impacts.
3.  Resettlement constitutes the major adverse issue for this project. 2,116 households
(8,350 persons) will be affected through structure acquisition. Most of the house-
holds (1,412) are already reorganized (without compensation), on the same location,
as a result of the implementation of Decree 36/CP on traffic safety. 312 households
have been relocated outside the project corridor and 392 are still located in the
project corridor. Resettlement is treated, in detail, in the Resettlement Action Plan.
4.  The rehabilitation of Highway No. I could have a major negative impact on traffic
safety. Presently, this road is very dangerous because of its mixture of slow and fast-
moving traffic and because very few regulations are actually enforced. Increased
vehicle speed on the road could lead to an increase in the number of accidents.
Moreover, urban growth along the road will add to this situation.
For these reasons the Government of Viet Nam should improve policies, regula-
tions, training, and education. Also, to reduce the risk of accidents and traffic
disturbance, the proposed design of the road suggests the creation of paved shoul-
ders along the road for slower traffic; these shoulders will contribute to the sepa-
ration of slow from fast moving traffic and to the improvement of safety for every
road user. Sidewalks will be built in urban and densely populated areas to ensure
pedestrian safety.
5.  Widening the roadway and shoulders, and improving their surfaces, will reduce air
and noise pollution and thereby improve the quality of life of people living along
the road. The presence of a clear area will also contribute to this improvement.

Vll.I NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BEIWEEN VINHI AND DONG I A
I NVIRONMENrAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
According to the option chosen the road will be usable throughout the whole year.
The population and the economy of the study area will benefit from this situation.
6.  Construction work will significantly affect the environment and disturb activities
along the road with noise and dust, but it is a short-term impact and would be
partially offset by mitigating measures taken during this phase.
7.  The location of borrow pits, asphalt plants, worker camps and dumps will be an
important environmental issue which may create more important negative impacts
than the rehabilitation of this section of Highway No.1. Location of such sites must,
in particular, avoid sensitive areas (coastal areas, flooded areas, natural sensitive
areas, inhabited areas). Special attention will be paid to the effects on the water
table. Existing roads must be used to reach these sites to the maximum extent
possible.
8.  The road between Vinh and Dong Ha crosses mostly rural areas which are domi-
nated by rice production and therefore need an important irrigation system. The
road will affect 162 of these channels. Due to the importance of irrigation networks
for farmers, the interruption of water flow must be avoided. If water stream inter-
r-uption proves impossible, consultation with farmers and local authorities must be
carried out to find a solution satisfactory to both parties.
9.  Historic sites such as temples, memorials and bunkers located in the project corri-
dor will be removed or protected. Impact on these sites will be minor. Parking and
rest areas will be designed near sites with good touristic potential (Ngang Pass, Ben
Hai River). This will create positive impact for traffic and tourism.
10. The road crosses 125 km of flooded areas. Due to the hazards linked to flooding,
and especially to unexpected flash floods, specific measures to ensure the safety to
workers (e.g. emergency plans) and to avoid contaminant spillage (e.g. material and
equipment which may result in contaminant spillage must be kept out form these
zones during the rainy season; emergency plan in case of contaminant spillage must
be prepared) are proposed. Impacts will be minor. The installation of guardrails
along flooded areas to identify road alignment will improve user safety during
flooding.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
11. Fifty-one bridges need to be replaced or rehabilitated, generally on the existing
alignment except for two major bridges at Chanh Hoa (Km 650.40) and Quan Hau
(Km 671.05). To minimize environmental impacts, specific measures need to be
implemented such as: (i) minimize work in the river; (ii) use temporary bridge if
needed (to ford river will be forbidden); (iii) protect susceptible surfaces; (iv)
movement of equipment in the river must be avoided or minimized; (v) control
river bank erosion with structures (gabion, rip-rap); (vi) return the beds of the river
and its banks to their natural state after construction. With the implementation of
these measures, impacts will be minor.
12. The road crosses about 40 km of sand dune areas between Km 675 and 715.
Plantations along the road and on active dune fields are present to fix soil and to
prevent erosion. Replacement of vegetation destroyed must be carried out to stop
the wind erosion process.
13. A monitoring program has been developed. The purpose of the monitoring program
is: (i) to supervise the implementation of the mitigation measures; (ii) to identify
environmental problems and issues; iii) to recommend solutions; Main indicators
to be monitored have been identified. The creation of an environmental depart-
ment, in PMU.1, in charge of monitoring, is proposed.
14. The following tables present a summary of environmental impacts according to the
location. Descriptions of environmental impacts and specific mitigation measure
which will apply are also presented.
15. A list of more general mitigation measures is also presented following the tables.
This list presents the proposed addition to the Chapter on Safety, Security and the
Protection of the Environment, to be included in General Conditions of Contract.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
1.0  INTRODUCUON
The Ministry of Transport of Viet Nam (MOT) has identified a project to
rehabilitate Highway No. 1 between Vinh and Dong Ha, in the coastal plain
of central Viet Nam. This Project, named Second Highway Rehabilitation
Project (HRP-2), promotes the objectives of the Government of Viet Nam
(GOV) to improve national road infrastructure and, in particular, the main
transportation route, Highway No. 1. The GOV has placed a high priority on
the rehabilitation of the entire 2,000 km length of National Highway No. 1.
This Project follows the First Highway Rehabilitation Project located between
Hanoi and Vinh, which started in 1993. For this first project, the construction
procurement process is now well advanced and contractor selection has been
completed. Construction is scheduled to start during 1996.
The Project consists of the rehabilitation of 293 km of road to an international
standard in order to allow for safe and efficient road transportation of persons
and goods. The rehabilitation of the road will be carried out on the existing
alignment but some sections will need to be widened and or raised.
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Second Highway Reha-
bilitation Project in Viet Nam was carried out between November 1994 and
December 1995. This EIA has been prepared by the Dessau-Experco consor-
tium in accordance with the Terms of Reference (TORs), Phase 1, Comple-
mentary Feasibility Study. The main objectives of the EIA is to identify poten-
tial environmental repercussions of road rehabilitation, to propose mitigating
measures to reduce these impacts, and to ensure that the Project is environ-
mentally acceptable.
The EIA study has been prepared in accordance with the World Bank Oper-
ational Directives 4.00 and 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. According to
these OD's, Environmental Assessment must ensure that any environmental
consequences are recognized early in the project cycle and taken into account
in the project design. The EIA has to identify ways of improving the project
environmentally, and minimizing, mitigating and compensating for adverse
impacts. Therefore, the World Bank recommends a close integration of EIA
with other aspects of project preparation to ensure that environmental con-
siderations are given due weight in project selection, siting, and design deci-
sions and that carrying out EIA's does not unduly delay the start of the project.

2.0   DESCRIPTION OF TME PROJECT
2.1    LOCATION
The road spans 293 km between Vinh and Dong Ha, in the centre of Viet Nam
(figure 2.1). Starting at Vinh (Km 463.6), in Nghe An Province, the highway
crosses into Ha Tinh Province at Km 468.4, into Quang Binh Province at Km
596, and into Quang Tri Province at Km 717. The end of the project is in Dong
Ha, at Km 756.
The highway is located in a narrow strip of deltaic land running along the coast
line, in a region characterized by sand dunes and estuaries. It crosses mainly
rural areas dominated by rice production. The road also runs through several
villages and residential rural areas. The urban centres located along this section
of the road are mainly district towns and provincial capitals. The principal,
large urban centres are, from north to south, Vinh (175 000 inhabitants), Ha
Tinh (48 000), Dong Hoi (97 000) and Dong Ha (68 000).
The Vinh-Dong Ha section of Highway No. 1 passes through 4 provinces, 13
districts, 5 towns and 97 communes. The road section for the project starts at
Vinh, in Nghe An Province, but only the first 4.5 km are located in the prov-
ince. It crosses Ha Tinh and Quang Binh Provinces over distances of 121 km
and 131 km, respectively. The final 40 km of this section, leading to Dong Ha,
are located in Quang Tri Province. Figure 2.1 presents the administrative
divisions for each province.
2.2    CONDITIONS OF THE EXISTING HIGHWAY No. 1
The 293 kmn section of Viet Nam's Highway No. 1, between the cities of Vinh
and Dong Ha, consists of a two-lane undivided road generally in a rather poor
condition with low embankments and a high water table along many sections.
In the rainy season, many sections are subject to flooding and washouts due to
the mountains nearby. The bridges are weak and many of them are too small
for the projected traffic. Travel time is approximately seven to eight hours to
traverse the 293 km portion of the road. This poor condition is mainly due to
bad construction methods. As well, land use in the rural areas has changed to
intensive irrigated rice cropping since the original construction. Consequently,

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
there is evidence that the effect of higher sustained paddy water levels on sub-
grade performance has adversely impacted the original highway ditch drainage
system.
Detailed field surveys, data collection and subsequent analysis have provided
substantial information on the actual condition of the highway and its environ-
ment. This information is presented in detail in section 2 and Appendices B
through G of the Rehabilitation Improvement Options Report. Figure 2.2, at
the end of this section, provides a graphical summary of road characteristics.
2.3     DESIGN ALTERNATIVES AND CRITERIA
The first alternative was the rehabilitation in the existing Right-of-Way (ROW)
of the highway. During the feasibility study, however, three alternate routes
were suggested by the local authorities.
Two of the alternate routes, within the Vinh and Dong Hoi city limits, were
considered by the project team and PMU.1 representatives as being more
justifiable from urban planning considerations than from a pavement rehabilita-
tion stand point. For this reason, they were not held back for the detailed
design.
The other suggested alternate route is located south of Vinh, between Km
469.1 and Km 485.7. This new route, 16.9 km long, would follow a former army
road along the eastern foothills of the mountain chain of Nam Ban, Yen Xu,
Uy Vien, Thien Tuong and Mong Ga. Fundamentally, this alternative was put
forward to by-pass a difficult section where the existing Highway No. 1 is
subject to frequent flooding: the overflowing of the Ca River overtops the road
up to 1.7 m with rainfalls of 10-year recurrence (1.2 m with 5-year recurrence).
To overcome this situation, the existing embankment should be raised up above
very soft alluvial soils, requiring special techniques to accelerate consolidation
(surcharges, stage construction, berm, wick drains, etc.).
Based on the various rehabilitation requirements and other improvement
suggestions, five options were established and compared in order to identify the
most suitable improvement options. Four of these options consist of different
specific design criteria strategies or packages on the existing alignment of the

road and the last one is a sub-option with the construction of the 17 km by-pass
south of Vinh. The recommended option identified in the Rehabilitation /
Improvement Options Report (revised) was based on the consideration of the
economic evaluation, possible social benefits and potential environmental
impacts.
According to the main rehabilitation requirements, the above design criteria
were retained (see figure 2.3):
. Alignmnent
The rehabilitation of the road will be carried out on the existing alignment.
This will reduce encroachment on land, land acquisition and resettlement.
* Roadway
Different solutions to improve pavement structure will be proposed as
required by various conditions encountered along the road. The roadway will
be enlarged to a total width of 7 m, comprised of two undivided lanes.
* Shoulders
Shoulders of 1.5 m or 2.5 m will be provided on each side of the road to
accommodate the very high volume of pedestrians, bicycles and other very
slow moving vehicles. The shoulders will create additional capacity in the
traffic lanes, and they will increase safety for all users as well as the effi-
ciency of commercial activities in urbanized areas.
* Sidewalks
In inhabited areas, sidewalks will be built to ensure safety to pedestrians.
* Project corridor
A project corridor has been established which varies from 18.5 m in district
towns to 30 m in flooded rural areas. This corridor includes a clear area of
2 to 5 m on each side of the road in urban areas and 2 to 7 m in rural areas.
The purpose of the clear area is to improve the safety of the population resi-

ding along the road and to permit the possible installation of underground
infrastructures (sewers, water supply lines, communication lines, etc.).
Protection Against Flooding
The elevation of the road will also be raised in flood areas to reduce flood-
ing and flood damage. The road elevation may be raised by as much as 2.0
m in these areas. This will create large embankments, widening the ROW of
the road and encroaching on land, often agricultural land. In flooded areas,
the enlargement of the ROW will average 4 m on each side of the road or
2.5 m in urban areas.
Sections where the road elevation will be raised by more than 0.6 m are
presented below:
- Ha Tinh Province
Nghi Xuan District:   Km 470.400 to 480.250
Can Loc District:    Km 488.500 to 493.500
Ha Tinh Town :       Km 508.100 to 510.600
Cam Xuyen District:  Km 527.000 to 536.800
Ky Anh District:     Km 590.050 to 590.750
- Quang Binh Province
Quang Trach District: Km 610.700 to 612.600
Bo Trach District:    Km 640.000 to 643.250
Dong Hoi Town:       Km 658.700 to 660.300
Quang Ninh District:  Km 671.400 to 674.600
Km 676.500 to 682,800

Bridges
Major bridges will be built to replace the two ferries at Gianh River (Km
625.5) and Quan Hau River (Km 670.8). One other major bridge will also be
built at Chanch Hoa River (Km 650.2) to replace the existing bridge which
is shared with the railway. Other bridges will be replaced or repaired, but on
the existing alignment. We have to note that Gianh River bridge (Km 625,5)
is not part of the Project.
Depending on the alignment alternative chosen for the Quan Hau bridge,
one of which passes through the urban area of Luong Ninh, the scope of
resettlement may be important. However, the new alignment for the bridges
at Chanh Hoa and Gianh rivers will have minor impacts on land acquisition
and, thus, will reduce resettlement.
2.4    SCHEDULING
In accordance with the global planning of the Second WB Rehabilitation
Project and discussions with PMU.1 and the World Bank representatives, the
project should be split into four (4) separate construction contracts.
The time frame is proposed as follows
* mid 1996: call for tenders (international bidding);
* mid 1997: start of construction;
* late 1999 : end of construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
3.0  POLICY LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
This section presents the institutional framework, the plans, the regulations and
the principal agencies and authorities involved in the environmental issues of
the project. Regulations on land acquisition, land management and land com-
pensation are described in the Resettlement Action Plan Report.
3.1    VIET  NAM   NATIONAL  PLAN  FOR  ENVIRONMENTAL  AND
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 1991 - 2000
The Government of Viet Nam (GOV) gave the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) the responsibility to elaborate a National Environmental
Action Plan in 1989. On June 12th 1991, the National Plan for Environment
and Sustainable Development was approved by the Chairman of the Council
of Ministers. This decision is reflected in Document No. 187/CT. The Chair-
man of the State Committee for Sciences has been entrusted with the responsi-
bility for all activities pertaining to the implementation of the Plan.
This document constitutes the first important reflection on the environment
and leads to the adoption of the Law on Environmental Protection. The
objectives of this plan are to:
1) provide for the .gradual development of a comprehensive framework for
national and sub-national enviromnental planning and managing; and
2) lead to specific actions that are required in the short term to address priority
problems at their very root.
Priorities and an agenda have been identified for two five-year periods: 1990 -
1995 and 1996-2000.
For 1990 - 1995, high priority items included several management components,
with highest priority being given to: the establishment of a single environmental
authority; the development of programs in population control; watershed
management programs, which include reforestation, control of soil erosion,
management of problem soils, and stabilisation of shifting agriculture; agricul-
tural pollution control; and estuary protection.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BEIWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
From 1996 to 2000, population control and watershed management should
continue to be top priorities, along with the protection of reefs, wetland, and
inland waters.
Sustainable and equitable development is the major theme of this Environ-
mental Action Plan upon which the plan's goals and objectives are formulated.
The goals are:
* to satisfy the basic material, spiritual and cultural needs of all the people of
Viet Nam, both present and future generations, through the wise manage-
ment of natural resources;
* to define and establish policies, action plans, and institutional structures to
ensure that the sustainability of natural resource use will be fully integrated
into all aspects of Viet Nam's social and economic development process.
The specific objectives of the Plan are to:
* maintain essential ecological processes and life support systems upon which
human welfare in Viet Nam is dependent;
* maintain Viet Nam's wealth of genetic diversity of both domesticated and
wild species of current and potential benefit;
* maintain overall environmental quality, necessary for the well being of
human existence;
* achieve a population level and distribution rate that is in balance with
natural sustainable productivity at a dignified standard of living.
This document also provides strategies and recommendations to be promoted
more actively. One of these strategies concerns Environmental Standards and
Impact Assessment. The recommendations are:
* the establishment of Environmental Standards should be initiated immedi-
ately;

VIEr NAIM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BEIWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
* a policy and set of procedures, including Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) regulations, should then be developed on an urgent basis to screen
and evaluate all public and private sector investment projects;
* ELA should be undertaken during the planning phase;
* EIA should be incorporated into regional development planning;
* EIA centres should be established in universities for the development of
national expertise in Viet Nam;
* immediate priority areas to undergo EIA are water reservoirs and dams, oil
refineries, and plantations.
Given that the development of a workable framework for ELA in Viet Nam
will likely take some time, the country should immediately institute a require-
ment that all proposed foreign assistance projects be subject to an environ-
mental screening, and if warranted, to an ELA. The EIA will be conducted (or
sponsored) by the donor organization, but would require the involvement of
local trainees, in order to help develop Viet Nam's capability in EIA.
3.2     LAW ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 93/12/30
This law results from the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable Deve-
lopment presented previously. This plan recommends the development of an
environmental policy and legislation.
The law provides for the protection of the environment aiming at the protec-
tion of the health of the people, serving the cause of sustainable development
of the country and contributing to the protection of the regional and global
environment. It covers prevention, combat and remediation of environmental
degradation, environmental pollution and environmental accidents. This law
indicates the role of the state in the management of environmental protection.
According to the article 18, all foreign investment projects must submit EIA

basis for competent authorities to approve the project or authorize their imple-
mentation.
In a recent decree, Circular No. 715/Mtg on "Providing Guidelines for Prepara-
tion and Evaluation of Environment Assessment Reports of Foreign Direct
Investments Projects" issued by the Ministry of Science Technology and Envi-
ronment (MOSTE) on April 3, 1995, projects requiring an Environmental
Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) are listed. This circular features provisions
on the contents of the ELAR, the documents needed for submittal, the names
of the authorities in charge of the evaluation of the ELAR and the environ-
mental standards.
Circular 715 establishes that all foreign investment projects are subject to
regulations of environmental protection contained therein and that the eva-
luation of the relevant EIAR will be the basis of approval and granting of
licenses for foreign investment projects.
Road projects of grade 1, 2 and 3 with a length of more than 50 km are
required to submit EIAR to MOSTE. Circular 715 establishes that until such
time as the official Environmental Standards are stipulated, the ELAR must be
prepared on the basis of temporary standards by MOSTE in the book entitled
"Some Temporary Environmental Standards" published by the Sciences and
Technology Publishing House in 1993.
3.3     MINISTRY OF SCIENCE. TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
This Ministry was created in 1992. The Ministry of Science, Technology and
Environment is responsible to the GOV for exercising the function of State
management of enviromnental protection. This Ministry is present in every
province. According to the law, all ministries, ministry-level agencies and other
Government bodies shall, within the scope of their respective functions, power
and responsibilities, cooperate with the Ministry of Science, Technology and
Environment in carrying out enviromnental protection within their sectors and
in establishments under their direct supervision.
This Ministry is located in each province crossed by the road.

3.4    ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
The Project is carried out for the GOV through the Ministry of Transport
(MOT). This Ministry is in charge of Road, Maritime, Inland Waterway, Civil
Aviation and Railway Administrations. For the purpose of highway construc-
tion, the MOT has created the Project Management Unit 1 (PMU.1). This
organization supervises highway design and implementation. Figures 3.1 and 3.2
at the end of this section present organization charts of MOT and PMU. 1.
At this time, no department in PMU. 1 is in charge of environment. For the
implementation and the monitoring of the project, a new unit should be estab-
lished to ensure that the mitigation measures are applied.
3.5     THE WORLD BANK POLICY ON ENVIRONMENT
OD's 4.00 and 4.01 identify World Bank policies and guidelines on environ-
ment. In particular, the World Bank promotes conservation of endangered
plant and animal species, critical habitats and protected areas, protection of
archaeological sites, historic monuments and historic settlements. The promo-
tion of health and safety, the appropriate treatment of involuntary resettlement,
and the review of land settlements are also part of World Bank requirements.
For every significant project, like a Highway rehabilitation, funded by the
World Bank, an environmental assessment (EA) is necessary. An EA should
normally cover existing environmental baseline conditions, potential environ-
mental impacts (direct and indirect), comparison of alternatives, preventive,
mitigatory and compensatory measures and environmental training, managing,
and monitoring.
The World Bank also provides special guidelines(l) for road and Highway
rehabilitation projects. According to the World Bank, the impacts of rehabilita-
tion projects, though they are usually more limited than those of new Highways,
can still be significant, not only on natural resources and systems but also on
the social and cultural environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
Impacts from construction (loss of vegetative cover, modification of natural
drainage patterns, changes in groundwater elevation, erosion, interference with
movements of livestock, wildlife and local residents, etc.), maintenance (soil
and water pollution, etc.) and traffic use (safety, increased air pollution, noise,
health risks, etc.) must be studied.
Special issues linked to a road project such as induced development, loss of
agricultural land, deterioration or loss of ecologically sensitive areas and
interference with customary local transportation methods must be taken into
account.
Management systems and training are necessary in the maintenance area.
Inadequate maintenance or improper practices may directly lead to environ-
mental impact.
Monitoring of construction impacts and of the timely and correct implementa-
tion of needed mitigating measures should be carried out. For the World Bank,
in general, the most critical project elements to be monitored are the imple-
mentation and effectiveness of erosion and sedimentation control measures,
disposal of debris and wastes, and management and reclamation of borrow pits.

4.0  DESCRIWON OF THE ENVIRONMENT
4.1     STUDY AREA AND METHODOLOGY
The study area covers the three provinces(2) crossed by the road between
Vinh and Dong Ha (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri). The description of
the environment will be done for this study area. An accurate inventory of the
surroundings will cover a 0.5 km corridor on each side of the present align-
ment. Environmental impacts will be assessed on this corridor. However, this
strip could be enlarged according to the context.
Inventory of the environment in the study area was carried out with available
documentation, meetings with Provincial, District and Commune People Com-
mittee's, meetings with other government agencies (Ministry of Construction,
Ministry of Transport, Road Management Unit, Ministry of Science, Techno-
logy, and Environment, Department of Land Administration, and Ministry of
Culture), meetings with foreign organizations (World Bank, UNDP, FAO,...),
surveys aimed at the local population, utilization of aerial photographs (1978
to 1980 and 1995) and surveys in the field. Social organizations like Women's
Unions and Peasants Unions were also met. Existing reports and documents,
like the Viet Nam Living Standards Survey, were also used as well as statistical
data from various agencies.
4.2     PHYSICAL RESOURCES
4.2.1   Topography
The study area is located in North Trung Bo, a geographical subdivision of Viet
Nam's land area that comprises the land between the South China Sea and
Laos and begins north of the city of Vinh and finishes south of Hue. In this
area, three main types of relief are present: hills and mountains, with medium
to steep slopes and maximum elevations of more than 1,000 m; low hills and
terraces, with gentle to medium slopes and elevations varying from 10 to 30 m;
and generally very flat plains with elevations less than 10 m.
(2)   Nghe An province (Vinh Town) is only crossed through 4 km. Only Vinh Town will be considered in the
study area.

VIEr NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENrAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
Except for two short mountainous sections and some small low hill areas with
gentle slopes. Highway No. 1 from Vinh to Dong Ha goes through large flat
plains and across meandering rivers which are subject to high floods many
times a year following heavy rains and fierce typhoons.
From Vinh. the road follows the Ca River plain, in between the river and some
small mountains on the east side. The plain altitude is 1 to 3 m above sea level
(ASL) but the altitude of the embankment is 3.5 to 5 m ASL. After the town
of Hong Linh (Km 486), the road reaches the Thanh Nghe Tinh plain, a very
large alluvial plain occupied by numerous small and isolated mountains. The
altitude of this plain is generally 1 to 2 m ASL but sometimes reaches 4 m.
South of the town of Ky Anh (Km 569), the road now follows low hills with
gently sloping areas on the counterfort of the Hoanh Son Range which is
advancing to the sea. In this area, the road elevations range between 4 and 19
m ASL. Then, for the next 5 km, the road crosses the mountain range through
the Ngang pass (Km 596, elevation 134 m), where the slopes are steep and the
road makes hairpin curves.
South of the Ngang pass, Highway No. 1 reaches the Binh Tri Thien plain and
generally follows the seashore, mostly between a sandy coastal dune field and
an alluvial plain, as far as Dong Ha. After the Ngang pass, for the next 40 km
the road crosses two large coalescent alluvial plains connected to the Ron and
Giang Rivers, (altitude 1-3 m ASL), and then goes through the Ly Hoa pass at
Km 636 (elevation 32 m). After the pass, the road crosses a sandy coastal plain
in between the littoral dunes and the hilly countryside to the west before
reaching the Kien Giang River plain. The altitude of this plain varies from 2
to 4 m ASL. At Km 705, and for the next 25 km, the road stretches through a
large area of low lying sandy hills with gentle slopes (elevation from 10 to
25 m). This whole area is especially sensitive to the erosion process. Then, the
road crosses the Ben Hai River plain (altitude 3-4 m) and the last and small
low hills area before it reaches the city of Dong Ha on the riverside of Mieu
Giang River.
The road elevations (top of embankment) range between 4 m (lower plains)
and 134 m (mountains area). In flat country, the average vertical alignment
gradient of the road is most of the time between 0 and 1 % and never greater
than 1.5 to 2 %, whereas in rolling terrain they sometimes reach 3 to 4 % for

short lengths. In hilly sections, it is never greater than 5 %c; at the most im-
portant pass (Km 592 to 595), a slope of 4.8 % is sustained along a 2.7 km
stretch, which is the worst condition of the project.
4.2.2    Regional Geology and Geomorpholozv
In North Trung Bo, the stratigraphic formations are from almost all geological
periods ranging from Cambrian-Lower Ordovician to Holocene. Rock types can
be intrusive or stratified.
Along the road and it's surroundings the main intrusive rock formations are,
from the oldest to the youngest period:
- Early to Middle Paleozoic: Biotite granite;
- Late Paleozoic - Early Mesozoic: Biotite granite;
- Late Paleozoic - Early Mesozoic: Granite, granophyre, granodiorite.
From the stratified rock formations, we found, from the oldest to the youngest:
- Ordovician-Silurian : Limestone, basalt, andesite;
- Upper Silurian-Lower Devonian: Sandstone, shale, limestone, rhyolite, chert;
- Lower-Middle Devonian : Conglomerate, sandstone, shale, limestone;
- Middle Triassic: .Conglomerate, sandstone, shale, limestone, rhyolite;
- Upper Neogene-Quaternary : Basalt;
- Quaternary : Basalt;
- Quaternary : Alluvium, proluvium with marine deposits in coastal areas.
Most of the rock outcrops are laterized, usually to depths of 2 to 5 m, someti-
mes more. Usually, the thickness of the lateritic soil varies according to rock
type and especially to the outcrop slope : the steeper the slope, the thinner the
lateritic soil.
Quaternary sediments are widespread in the coastal area, just below the
counterfort of mountains, and in the major valleys. These sediments play a
great role in the formation of coastal and valley plains. They mainly consist of
fluvial or littoral sediments with, on the surface, a large predominance of
fluvial sediments, except on the coast where littoral sands rehandled by the
DESSAU-EXPERCO                     MARCH 1996                             Page 22

eolian process largely prevail. Intercalation of marine and continental facies in
depressions and coastal plains clearly reveal different periods of transgression
and regression. The quaternary sediments in North Trong 3Bo can be as thick
as 100 m.
At least four quaternary units are found in the study area. From the oldest to
the youngest they are:
- Upper Pleistocene : Danang Yellow Sand Strata;
- Lower-Middle Holocene Camranh White Sand Strata;
- Middle-Upper Holocene White yellow sand;
- Upper Holocene sediments : Alluvial flood plains.
The Danang Yellow Sand Strata consists of brownish yellow mainly fine-
grained sand. In some places it consists of medium to coarse-grained sand or
grits and pebbles poor in fossil. These yellow sand strata are distributed, in the
study area, south of Quang Binh province or lying under the white sands of the
Lower-Middle Holocene period, forming low hills. Large exposures of these
sands are particularly visible along the cut and fill profile of Highway No. 1
between Km 713.2 and Km 724.6, and elsewhere in the area.
The Camranh White Sand Strata is mainly composed of relatively pure quartz
of fine to medium-grained size. Developed along the coastline south of Quang
Binh province, these sands are commonly rehandled by the eolian process and
appear as active dune fields.
The white yellow sand of fine to coarse grain size is widely spread along the
coastline in the form of sand dunes. These dunes of marine or marine-eolian
origin are attributed to the Middle-Upper Holocene period and are still active,
appearing as active dune fields that can be very long and, sometimes, 5 km
wide.
The alluvial flood plains are mainly composed of silt and silty clay of low to
medium plasticity. In some parts, especially in the riverbed, they consist instead
of silt, sand, grit, and pebbles. These last sediments are commonly used as
concrete aggregate.

4.2.3    Soils
There is a wide range of soils in the study area, varying according to local
conditions of geology, topography and climate. Six main groups of soils have
been identified, in decreasing importance, as
- Alluvial soils, generally made of silts and silty clay. These fluvisols present
low permeability and are usually fertile and potentially good for rice cultiva-
tion, subsidiary crops, fruit-trees, oil seeds and so on;
- Sandy marine and coastal soils, mainly derived from littoral sands rehandled
by eolian process in large fields of littoral dunes. These soils are very mobile
and very sensitive to erosion when not fixed by vegetation. Their potential
value for agriculture is very low;
- Lateritic red and yellow soils, derived from various types of rock. These soils
are often very deep, varying easily from 10 to 20 m in depth, and are pres-
ent mostly on low to middle undulating land. According to the rock type
from which they originate, these soils can be sandy to clayey. Their potential
value for agriculture depends on rock types and local conditions, but they
usually show some limitations due to lateritic process and low fertility;
- Grey infertile soils, formed on ancient alluvial land. On these soils, erosion
is severe, causing soil impoverishment and low fertility;
- Acid sulphate soils, developed only from the estuarine or deltaic sediments
of the coastal plain. They present some infertility constraints for agriculture;
- Thin soils of steep sloping mountainous areas, frequently subject to intensive
erosion when natural vegetation is absent or removed.
Natural soils found under the road and near the foot of the embankment are
of many origins, depending on the sections. Along rivers and in large flat
plains, the soils are mainly alluvium composed of intermixed fine soils: sand,
silty sand, clay and thin organic layers. In alluvial plains, soils are mainly silts
and high plastic clays. Near the surface, sand or a hard crust is often found,
but, under that stiffer layer, the soil ranges from very soft to firm. The compo-
sition of the alluvium layer is typically more sandy south of Km 600. These soils

dominate the profile, representing almost 66 % of the road length, as can be
seen in Table 4.1.
In hilly country, the soil cover is thin. Rock is either outcropping in the highest
cuts or found under a thin layer of soil. Sandstones, siltstone and limestones
are the most common types of rock found along the road. Gravelly soils are
found near the outcropping zones.
In between, along long stretches where the road passes over the littoral dune
and similar geomorphological features, the natural soil is either sandy or of
lateritic type. In these sections, high ground is mainly formed by lateritic or
sandy soils while alluvium can be found in the low lying areas.

4.2.4    Climate
Viet Nam has a wide variety of climates. This is due to the variety of the relief,
ranging from high mountains (more than 1 000 m ASL) to low coastal plains
and deltas, and to the difference in latitude extending 3 000 km from North to
South.

VIEr NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
Zonal influences of the Pacific Ocean and the highlands of China, Laos and
Cambodia make possible the existence of three main types of tropical, humid
climates in the Northern, Central and Southern parts of Viet Nam.
The type of climate also varies according to the location. Generally, the tem-
peratures decrease with altitude and from south to north, while precipitation
varies according to the influence of the monsoon.
The study area is located in North Trung Bo, between the 17th and 19th paral-
lels, where the climate is tropical monsoon, influenced by an ocean climate.
This area corresponds to a buffer zone between two distinct climatic zones.
The zone north of the 18th parallel (corresponding to the Cong and Ngang
passes) has two contrasting seasons, cold and hot, but with tropical humidity all
the time. South of the 18th parallel, the climate is hot all year-round with two
seasons: dry and humid. The average temperature varies between 18 to 20
degrees in winter and 29 to 30 degrees in summer. The mean daily air tem-
perature amplitude is only 6.1 degrees at Vinh and the absolute highest tem-
perature measured at this station was 42.1 degrees in June 1912.
Most of the country receives about 2 000 mm of rain per year with over
3 000 mm in some areas of central Viet Nam. Yearly precipitation in Northern
Central Viet Nam varies between 1 400 mm and 3 600 mm, and the annual
average is approximately 2 180 mm. In the study area, Vinh, at the northern
limit of the study area, receives 1 891 mm, Ky Anh, in the central part receives
2 929 mm and Hue, near the southern limit, receives 2 868 mm. Rainfall is
affected by three main monsoons. The winter northeast monsoon is rather cold,
the southeast and southwest monsoons blow in the summer months bringing
rainfall from the sea.
In the coastal area of Northern Central Viet Nam, the rainy season begins
when the southwest monsoon deteriorates and the northeast monsoon enters
its active phase. The rainy season is from August to December in the northern
part of the study area but begins and finishes one month later in the southern
part. This rainy season represents 70-80 percent of the 2 900 mm yearly rainfall
(see table 4.2). The highest monthly rainfall (700-800 mm) occurs in September
and October. The highest daily rainfalls recorded in coastal Central Viet Nam
is 200-500 mm.

VIEI NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
4.2.5   Surface Water
In the study area, most of the rivers are short (between 10 to 100 km in length)
and originate in the mountains at the border with Laos. All the rivers are steep
in their mountainous reach and meandering in the coastal plain. The hydrology
of the rivers is characterized by a short time of concentration in upstream
watersheds, mainly due to the slope. This results in high peaks in the
hydrographs and frequent flooding of the lower lands. Two rivers are an excep-
tion, the Ca and Gianh Rivers. These rivers are longer and are mainly oriented
North-West - South-East.
Generally, the rivers in Viet Nam start to rise following the onset of the mon-
soon in May or June and reach their maximum level in September or October.
The water level falls quite rapidly until December and then recedes slowly,
during the dry period of the year, to reach its lowest level before the onset of
the monsoon.
In the central part of Viet Nam the floods are very important, occurring many
times a year and causing loss of life, human misery and loss of property. Flash
floods are often seen in small, steep catchments. As the name suggests, flash
floods are events of short time lag between the start of the flood and the peak
discharge and are particularly dangerous because of their speed and sudden
arrival.
The hills and mountains behind the floodplain shed a large proportion of the
rainfall, and during storms, heavy rains can accumulate rapidly as floodwater
flow in the steep gorges, and flood waves can travel quickly to the unsuspecting
inhabitants below.
Flash flooding on the many small and steep catchments in the Central regions
and in the headwaters of the major rivers arrive in the floodplain between 6
and 12 hours after the storm has passed over the catchment in different parts
of Viet Nam.
In the Project, Highway No. I crosses 14 major rivers. The principal ones are
the Ca River (Km 466), Ron River (Km 606), Gianh River (Km 625) Ly HOa
River (Km 640), Chanh Hoa River (Km 650.5), Dai River (664.1), Kien Giang
River (Km 671.8), Ben Hai River (Km 734.5) and Mieu Giang River (Km 756).

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
Most of them are crossed on the estuarine part and very close to the sea, and
are subject to flash floods many times a year.
The rivers are not provided with dikes and there is regular annual flooding.
Floods can affect the cultivated land (only 1 crop/year) and also the existing
road. It is noted that many parts of the road are regularly over-topped during
floods. From the hydraulic study realized for the Project, it can be noted that
some 67 km (23 %) of the existing road are subject to some overtopping on a
5-year recurrence period, whereas 86 km (30 %) are so affected on a 10-year
recurrence period. Table 4.3 presents historical flood records for the main
rivers of the study area.
In Central Viet Nam flood season almost coincides with the rainy season. The
months of September, October and November present a high risk of flooding
and, during these months, construction works in alluvial floodplain may be
hazardous for people, equipment and materials and, consequently, for the
environment.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
As the road follows the coastal line, rivers which are crossed are influenced bv
the Pacific tide. Tides in Viet Nam are a mix type of semi-diurnal tides and
tidal variation is minimal in the central part of Viet Nam. On average, the
maximum amplitude of tides is 2 m in the central coastline. During the wet
season, the tide increases the probability of floods and affects the drainage.
In the dry season (Jan.-Aug.) all the rivers have water shortages and low levels.
During this period the drainage is improved but sea water intrudes into river
channels, especially when the tide is rising. When the water is used for irriga-
tion, there are constraints on its use to irrigate some crops such as rice.
4.2.6    Ground Water
Based on the results of a survey and estimation for the Viet Nam
hydrogeological branch, the ground water potential is rather rich with total
natural reserves equalling 1 513 m3/s, approximately 15 % of the total surface
water. Ground water is distributed extremely unevenly throughout the different
hydrogeological regions. The highest ratio of reserves is found in the intrusive
rock formations, metamorphic rock formations, complex rock formations and
carbonate and basalt rock.
Ground water is present in all the geological formations up to the top soil. The
levels of the water table vary from ground level to different depths, according
to climatic seasons, presence of rivers or lakes, or vicinity of the sea. The water
table is also influenced by human activities, such as irrigation or drainage.
It is obvious in large flat plains and in many valleys crossed by the road, that
the presence of ground water is permanent at no more than 1 m depth. The
natural drainage condition is good in the sloped areas (mountains and nid-
lands) and in higher coastal zones. In the plain, the natural drainage is poor
and could be improved only by extensive drainage works.
The quality of the ground water depends on the depth and the mineral compo-
nents of the bearing layers. In general, the ground water in upper layers is less
suitable for domestic use due to the high content of coliform and could poss-
ible salinity during the dry season. As a source of water for living conditions,
ground water is good in all regions of Viet Nam (Environmental Protection and

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENI REPORT
Sustainable Development, Hanoi, 1993). In the study area, wells are the most
prevalent source of water for domestic use.
In the vicinity of the sea, the salinity of the ground water also increases during
the dry season. During the wet season, flooding helps desalinate the soils and
consequently the ground water, but this factor depends on the topography, the
vegetation cover and the amount of rainfall. Normally, the ground water in
high lying areas is less saline and is more saline in lower or rice cultivated
areas.
4.3     ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES
4.3.1    Terrestrial Vegetation
Viet Nam has a wide range of natural vegetation types. In some cases these
have been transformed almost completely by human activities. These vegetation
types includes mangrove forest, melaceucia forests, freshwater swamp forests,
monsoon forests, lowland evergreen/semi-evergreen broadleaf forests, forests
on limestone and mountain coniferous forests.
* Biogeographical Units
Tlhe country can be conveniently divided into a number of different terrestrial
biogeographical units (biounits) on the basis of differences in species composi-
tion and the limits of distribution of indicative forms. All of the study area is
located in the same biounit called North Annam.
In the North Annam biounit, the most prevalent vegetation types are fresh
water swamp forests, lowland semi-evergreen forests and semi-evergreen hill
forests. Fresh water swamp forests are periodically flooded forests in low lying
areas. Lowland semi-evergreen forests are subtropical characterized by broad
leaves forming a large canopy. We note that few areas remain in their original
condition.
The main Annamite Mountain chain or (Truong Son range) acts as a barrier
between the generally wetter forests on the east and the drier forests to the
west which fall into the Mekong Basin biounit.

VIET NAM - REHABILrrATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
Two natural surroundings present some ecological and tourist interest: the Con
and Ngang pass (Km 589 to Km 597) and Ly Hoa pass (Km 636 to Km 638).
These areas are located in areas where mountains fall off into the sea.
* Vegetation Against Erosion
Vegetation is very important to protect the land against erosion. In some sec-
tions along the Highway, from Km 672 to 701, the road serves as protection,
and constitutes the limit between sand dune areas and farmlands. In this area,
strong winds, often over 3 m/s in velocity have resulted in the frequent move-
ment of sand dunes toward the main land at 0.3-0.5 m/year (sometimes 2-3
m/year). Also, moving sand can be blown away far over the alluvial plain, thus
modifying the soil characteristics. This results in a loss of rice land, and a loss
of productivity. Land can still be used for other crops (sweet potatoes) but
these crops have a very low efficiency and constitute a loss of income for
farmers. The alignment of trees on both sides of the road serves to protect the
area against wind-blown sand. This is a particular problem in the coastal
regions of central Viet Nam and especially in the study area where major
reforestation must be continued in order to prevent sand from destroying
agricultural areas. The planted trees are mostly pines (Phi Lao).
* Vegetation Along the Road
Apart from trees to protect against erosion, other trees are also planted along
the road as protection against the sun. The principal species are eucalyptus
(Bach Dan) and bamboos. These trees are very comrnmon and have a low value.
Along the coastal area, a lot of plantation has been done. These plantations
are principally eucalyptus (Bach Dan) and pines (Phy Lao).
* Fruit Trees
Other fruit trees are cultivated by the population in the study area. The most
common are banana and papaya; these trees have a low value. Other fruit trees
such as jackfruit, guava and grapefruit are less prevalent in the study area but
have a higher value.

VIEr NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
We have to note that following the implementation of Decree 36/CP on road
safety, a lot of trees have been cut along the road. The extent of the losses are
not known at this time.
4.3.2    Aquatic Biology
Freshwater habitats have been classified into a number of distinct
biogeographical units. There are two major sub-regions. These are (i) the South
China sub-region, which includes all the rivers of northern Viet Nam as far
South as Hue; and (ii) the Indochina or Mekong sub-region, which includes the
Mekong delta. The study area is included in a sub-unit of the South China sub-
region called the Northern Estuaries.
The river mouths in the study area are estuary-type and Highway No. 1 often
crosses the rivers near the estuaries. Estuaries are characterized by sedimen-
tation rates below the rate of seafloor submergence and are strongly affected
by tides. Hence, erosion is a common phenomenon at estuaries. As tidal
marshes are eroded away and more tidal channels filled with mud, tidal effects
and salt penetration upland becomes more significant.
In estuarine tidal marshes, mangroves, dominated by Rhizophoracae, develop
well. Estuaries also support an important aquatic biology. Algae, seagrass,
invertebrates, plankton, shrimp and larvae in particular are abundant. In
addition to being important reservoirs of aquatic resources, estuaries also
support important waterway traffic.
Highway No. 1 crosses more than 14 important rivers. Little information on
flow discharge and suspended matter is available. According to visual observa-
tions during a field visit, most of these rivers present a high level of flow dis-
charge (suspended matter) in the water and important human activities (naviga-
tion, labour activities, borrow pits, dredging, etc.) which are not related to good
development of aquatic life. Otherwise, most of the small streams seem to have
good water quality and could support a good fish habitat.

4.3.3   Fauna
Viet Nam is rich in almost all animals examined. It is estimated that there are
about 275 species of mammals, over 800 species of birds, 180 species of reptiles
and 80 species of amphibians in addition to hundreds of species of fish and
thousands of invertebrates. A higher proportion of species are regionally or
nationally endemic, than in any other country in Indochina.
Wildlife along the road is very limited due to the omnipresence of human
activity and any observation of wildlife was noted during the survey of the field.
4.3.4    Endangered Species
According to the Red Data Book of Viet Nam (1992) which sunmmarizes the
status of threatened species in the country, eleven (11) endangered species
could be present in the study area of the Project. Table 4.4 list these species,
from which four of them are mammals and seven are birds. No detailed infor-
mation is available to know precisely which species are located specifically
along the road. As the Project stays on the existing alignment, and does not
result in large encroachment on natural land, we do not expect these species
to be affected by the Project, except eventually for the new borrow areas where
specific habitat could be affected. Since the location of these borrow areas are
not yet known, some investigation will be necessary before the beginning of the
exploitation of the new borrow pits in natural land.

4.4     SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS
4.4.1    Administrative Structure
After reunification in 1975, the country was reorganised administratively into
40 provinces. Several reorganizations were also done afterwards in 1987, 1989
and 1992. At the beginning of 1992, a new administrative reorganization cre-
ated 53 administrative units, consisting of 50 provinces and the three centrally-
controlled cities of Hanoi, Hai Phong and Ho Chi Minh City. Each province
is divided into districts, which, in turn, are divided into commnunes. Urban areas
within each province are divided into towns and townships: major towns and
their surrounding areas are self-administrative; small towns belong to the admi-
nistrative authority of the district they lie in. Major towns are also further
divided into neighborhoods or precincts.
From North to South, the Highway runs through 4 provinces, 12 districts,
5 towns and 97 communes.
T'he People's Cornmitee constitutes the main administrative organization. It is
present at each level (province, district, town, commune). The different minis-
tries are present in each capital of the province: Vinh (Nghe An), Ha Tinh
(Ha Tinh), Dong Hoi (Quang Binh) and Dong Ha (Quang Tri).
4.4.2   Population
The study area represents 2.83 % of the area of Viet Nam and 2.78 % of its
population. The population is mainly concentrated on the plains along the sea
where Highway No. 1 is located. A large part of the area of these provinces is
a hilly region along the Laos border. The population is quite unevenly distri-
buted in the study area. The population density in these provinces varies from
211.5 inhabitants per km2 (Ha Tinh), to 160.0 (Nghe An), 114.2 (Quang Tri)
and 94.0 (Quang Binh).
Table 4.5 lists each district, town, and province with its population, area, and
density.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
* Population Changes 1991-1993
The population growth is quite different from one province to another. The
rates of increase from 1991 to 1993 are, respectively, 3.0 %o for Ha Tinh, 5.5 %o
for Quang Binh, and 6.3 % for Quang Tri. During the 1990-1992 period, the
growth rate in Viet Nam was 4.6 Y.
* Rural and Urban Population
Although Viet Nam is a densely populated country, it is not a highly urbanized
one. In the study area only 10 % of the population lives in cities. Even for Viet
Nam, this is a low urbanization rate. This rural character is due to the pre-
dominance of wet rice production. Even though rural population prevails
throughout the study area, the level of rural population is quite different from
one province to another. The provinces of Nghe An (1991), Ha Tinh (1993)
and Quang Binh (1993) have very high rates of rural population (92.0 %,
93.1 % and 89.7 % in 1993). These rural population rates are among the
highest in Viet Nam. The rural population rate for the province of Quang Tri,
though high for Viet Nam, is lower (82.9 %). The main urban centres are the
capital of each province: Vinh (175 000 hab.), Ha Tinh (50,000 hab.), Dong
Hoi (93,000 hab.) and Dong Ha (68,000 hab.).
* Ethnic Groups
The Viet-Muong are the largest ethnic group in the country. They account for
87.2 % of the population across the country. It is the only ethnic group found
throughout the country. In the study area, they represent somewhere between
84.5 % and 99 % of the population (Atlas of Viet Nam, p. 111). The only
ethnic minority present in the study area is the Mon-Khmer. They represent
somewhere between 1 % and 8 % of the population. They are concentrated in
the mountain area.

4.4.3    Land Use
The road between Vinh and Dong Ha is located in a narrow strip of deltaic
land stretching along the coast line, sand dunes and estuaries. It crosses mainly
rural areas dominated by rice production. The road also crosses a lot of villages
or small towns distributed along the road. Urban centres are also present along
the road. They mostly correspond to district towns and provincial capitals.
(Table 4.7 presents land use along the road).

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BEIWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENr REPORT
4.4.4   Economv of the Study Area
The 6th Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1986 decided to turn
away from centralized planning embodied in the socialist model and to move
towards increasing liberalization, leaving it increasingly to the market to regu-
late the economy. Priority was no longer given to heavy industry but to agricul-
ture and the production of consumer goods for the domestic market and for
export. Rights and powers equivalent to those enjoyed by the cooperatives and
the state were given to the private sector. This new policy, called "doi moi"
(renovation), has had a profound effect on the Vietnamese economy. Peasant
households have been given the right to use land and the freedom to manage
and sell their products. State enterprise reforms have led to greater efficiency
in this sector. The non-state sector is rapidly increasing its production.
* Economic Agents
Three economic agents in the economy can be set apart: state, collective, and
private. Since the "economic revival" (do moi) the state sector is losing impor-
tance to the advantage of the private sector. Due to the predominance of
agriculture, the collective sector (cooperatives) is always the most important
sector in the economy in terms of population employed. In the study area, the
collective sector employs somewhere between 55.5 % and 90.5 % of the popu-
lation (Atlas of Viet Nam, p. 127).
* Characteristics of the Labour Force
The pattern of employment by major economic sectors clearly shows the over-
whelming importance of the primary sector (almost exclusively agriculture) in
the study area. This predominance is more pronounced in the study area than
in the rest of Viet Nam.

Data non available for Nghe An province
* Expenditures
The average household expenditure in Viet Nam is 6,095.1 thousand dongs. In
rural areas the average is 5,175 thousand dongs, and 9,775 in urban areas. In
the North Central Region(3), the total household average expenditure is
4,156.3; this is the lowest level in Viet Nam. (Viet Nam Living Standards, p.
180).
If we consider the annual average per capita expenditure, the North Central
Region also has the lowest level in Viet Nam: 873.3 thousand dongs compared
to 1,227.3 for Viet Nam. (Viet Nam Living Standards, p. 187).
The overall food consumption expenditure per capita per year accounts for
60.9 % of total expenditures. In the North Central Region, this rate climbs to
66.7 %. Therefore, although the food consumption to total expenditure ratio
in urban areas is lower than in rural areas, food expenditure is almost twice as
high in absolute values in urban areas compared to rural areas (Viet Nam
Living Standards, p. 191).
(3)   This region (used in the Viet Nam Living Standards Survey) includes the four provinces affected by the
project with the addition of the provinces of Thanh Hoa in the North and Thua Thien Hue in the South.

* Sources of Income
The incomes reported through the Viet Nam Living Standard Survey is lower
than the expenditures reported. This difference shows the importance of infor-
mal income sources.
The average annual income per capita is 1,105 thousand dong. In urban areas
this figure is 1,815 thousand dong, almost twice as high as in rural areas. In the
North Central Region, the average is 762.9, the lowest level in Viet Nam.
In rural areas, although the main source of revenue still comes from agricul-
tural activities, income derived from other sources is also significant: income
derived from non-farm self-employment makes up 28.14 % and 16.59 % of the
total revenue from wage earning activities. In the North Central Region, which
is mainly rural, income from agriculture makes up 46.9 % and non-farm self-
employment makes up 34.1 % of total revenue.
In urban areas, the main source of revenue comes from non-farm self employ-
ment activities which make up 54.75 % of total revenue, followed by wages and
salaries at 32.44 %.

ENVIRONMENrAL IMPACr ASSESSMENr REPORT
4.4.5    Transportation
In contrast with the other socialist countries a characteristic feature of
Viet Nam's internal transport system is the low level of traffic. Freight only
represents 175 t/km per capita compared, for example, to 350 - 700 t/km in
the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe. The Vietnamese travel, on
average, less than 200 km a year by public transport, compared to 4,000 -
8,000 km in Eastern Europe.
Viet Nam's rail system, which is organized into three regional divisions, dete-
riorated because of insufficient investment and the low tariffs imposed by the
State. Coastal shipping, which took over part of the goods traffic lost by the rail
system, carried more freight than the railways in 1989 (4 metric tons (m.t.)
against 2.4 m.t.). Road traffic (25 m.t. in 1989), like the railways, is hampered
by the poor state of the network and the fact that the infrastructure is out-
dated, and the numerous bridges and ferries impose a limit on the load carried
by trucks. These are consequently used mostly on local and regional routes.
* Network
* Road Network
The road network is essentially of a north-south orientation in the study
area due to its central position in the country and the orientation of the
coastal plain. Highway No. 1 is the main highway in the country and in the
study area. It is a national and international road. Road 15 is a national and
regional road. It is parallel to Highway No.1 but is located in the interior of
the country. It follows the Gianh River valley from the province of Thanh
Hoa and joins Highway No. 1 after the Gianh river.
Two main roads, roads 8 and 9, of an east-west orientation are also present.
They link the study area to the Laos border. Road 8 begins at Highway
No. 1 between Vinh and Ha Tinh (Km 481.0) and road 9 begins at Dong Ha
(Km 753).

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
Railway Network
The railway network from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh crosses the study area. In
the province of Ha Tinh, the railway follows the Gianh River valley, similar
to road 15. In the province of Quang Binh, at Chanh Hoa(4), the railway
joins Highway No. 1 and goes through the costal plains all the way to Dong
Ha (Km 650.2).
. Waterways
Shipping was the earliest communication route to be used in Viet Nam. The
coastal character of the study area means an important coastal shipping
traffic. However, no important seaport is present in the study area. The Ca
River, which is the northern border of the study area, is the only inland
waterway.
* Traffic
Road traffic is hampered by the poor state of the network and the fact that the
infrastructure is outdated; moreover, the numerous bridges and ferries impose
a 10 t limit on the load carried by trucks. Consequently, trucks are mostly used
on local and regional routes (Atlas of Viet Nam, p. 271).
In the study area, due to the poor state of the railway and the road network,
coastal transportation of goods is more important than road and rail trans-
portation in the provinces of Ha Tinh and Quang Tri (between 40.1 % and
75.5 %). In the province of Quang Binh road transportation is more important
(between 41.0 % and 77.0 %), (Atlas of Viet Nam, p. 279).
For passenger traffic, rail is more important than road. Rail represents between
41.3 % and 77.0 % of the whole traffic in the provinces of Ha Tinh and Quang
Binh. In the province of Quang Tri, road traffic is more important than rail
(between 60.5 % and 87.0 %). The percentage of passengers using waterways
is not significant in the study area.
(4)   At this place the bridge on the Chanh Hoa River is shared between road and railway.

4.4.6    A2riculture
* Production
Viet Nam has an economy predominantly based on agriculture, namely paddy
rice production. This sector provides 62 % (21.4 million workers) of the coun-
trv's labour force. Of these, 70.8 % (14.3 millions) are engaged in crop produc-
tion; 14.4 % (2.92 millions) in full time livestock raising; 10.3 % (2.1 M) in
sidelines, and the remainder in non-farm related activities (Report on Agricul-
ture, p. 6). Food grains, particularly rice, are the main products of Vietnamese
agriculture. The other irnportant crops are maize, sweet potatoes, cassava,
potatoes and vegetables. Rubber is the most significant industrial crop, but tea,
coffee, coconut, and sugar cane are also important. Low crop yields combined
with a poor endowment of cultivated land spell poverty for the vietnamese
population.
Rice cultivation predominates throughout the study area. The area sowed in
rice represents between 57.9 % and 73.6 % of the total area. In the mountain
area the principal crop is the sweet potato. This crop has a very low efficiency
and the soil gives one or two crops a year. This situation leads to an important
level of poverty in this area. The following table shows the total sown area of
rice and other food crops by province.

VIEI? NAIM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENr REPORT
* Size of tlhe Exploitation
Due to the very high population pressure on land in Viet Nam, the average
size family farm is only 0.6 ha, three times smaller than the average for Indo-
nesia (1.8 ha) and significantly smaller than in Thailand (5.6 ha). In the study
area, the cultivated area per head is 0.08 ha compared to 0.06 ha in the Red
River Delta and 0.17 ha in the Mekong Delta (Atlas of Viet Nam, p. 154).
According to our meetings, land is allocated to each household according to
the availability of farmland in the commune and the number of people in the
commune. In some communes, people living along the road have been allo-
cated from three to four or five hundred square metres of land for each person
in the family.
In the study area, due to the high population density and the low percentage
of cultivated land, almost all of the land available for cultivation is allocated.
* Rice Cultivation System
Four rice cultivation systems can be identified based on seasonal climate vari-
ations within the country. Throughout the Indochina peninsula, rice is mainly
produced during the rainy season (June to November). In Viet Nam, this so-
called "seasonal" rice accounts for over 67 % of the production and 73 % of the
cultivated area in the Northern Highlands and the Central Plateaus. In the
study area, the summer-autumn rice, which grows from May to October, pre-
dominates. Since this is grown earlier in the year than is seasonal rice using
strains with a short growing period, the crops are less susceptible to the effects
of typhoons. Winter-spring rice, which is cultivated from December to May is
also present in the study area.

* Livestock
Despite Viet Nam's high population density and consequent emphasis on food
self-sufficiency, most kinds of domesticated livestock and fowl are raised by
lowland farmers as well as ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas.
The animal production system remains very traditional. Its primary function is
to satisfy the demands for draft power and organic manure in crop cultivation.
In the coastal areas, the typical scale for family units is 1-2 buffalo, 2-3 cattle,
1-2 pigs and/or 4-5 laying hens (Report on Agriculture, p. 87).
* Organization
The cooperative is the dominant farming organization throughout Viet Nam,
especially in the lowlands. Cooperatives control about 80 % of the total culti-
vated area but over 90 % of the total cultivated area in the northern lowlands.
(Report on Agriculture, p. 31).
In 1981 the contract system was introduced. This system restored the family as
a basic production unit. In 1988, producers were to be given land for a period

of at least 15 years with fixed terms (target yield and tax obligations) for the
first 5 years. The planning obligations of agricultural cooperatives and pro-
ducers have been abolished, allowing freedom of choice among production
activities and marketing freedom for all products and inputs except land.
Although the cooperative structure remains intact, its future role is to be
confined to supply, services, tax collection, the representation of the interests
of members and social functions. The farming community is free to choose,
however, what services they require from the cooperative.
* Imigation System
Due to predominance of wet rice production, there is an important irrigation
system in place in Viet Nam. The development of the country's hydraulic
systems has been traditionally divided among central and regional authorities.
Major water resource development (dams, main canal systems, major hydraulic
structures, major pumping plants) are generally planned and funded by the
Ministry of Water Resources. Subsidiary or secondary hydraulic systems are
generally developed by provincial authorities which are also in charge of
operating and maintaining these systems. Construction, operation and mainten-
ance of tertiary systems is usually left to water users as is the provision of small
pumps where pumpage is effected from secondary to tertiary hydraulic systems
or to the fields.
In the study area, the area under irrigation is considerable. It represents, as a
percentage of cropped land, between 48.4 % and 58.1 % for the provinces of
Ha Tinh and Quang Tri and between 60.6 % and 71.6 % for the province of
Quang Binh, enabling two rice crops to be produced each year. (Atlas of
Viet Nam, p. 201).
The channels are in use year-round with 1 month reserved for maintenance,
usually November. We have to note that during the rainy season, the irrigation
system is less useful.
* Aquaculture
Pond fish culture made a major breakthrough in Viet Nam with the introduc-
tion, domestication, and induced-breeding of Asiatic carp. The average pond
production is about 2 tons per ha per year (Report on Agriculture, p. 97). The
DESSAU-EXPERCO                    MARCH 1996                             Page 49



VIEIr NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
grass used to feed the fish usually comes from the banks of the dike and other
underused lands. It appears that fish pond production has a great efficiencv and
is quite simple to manage at the family scale. For this reason the development
of fish ponds is important.
4.4.7    Community Life and Economic Activities
* Settlement Along the Road
The road is a privileged place for settlement, especially for business. The
weakness of the road network and the traffic generated by the road explains
this situation.
Since the introduction of new government policies and the possibility for
people to manage private enterprise, a lot of people have built structures used
as shops, along the road. Shops are scattered all along the road, particularly in
urban areas, but also in rural areas. Most of these shops are located in the
ROW and don't have the right to use land.
The shops vary from very small operations selling a few miscellaneous dry
goods (beer, soap, biscuits, candy) to various sizes of restaurants, to cottage
industries such as woodworking, blacksmith, scrap metal, bicycle repair,
bike/auto washing, tailor/dressmaking, construction materials and rice grinding.
In urban areas, shops are often located in front of a main building close to the
road. The shop can belong to the building owner and be operated by him or
her. The property owner can also rent the shop or the land to a shopkeeper.
In rural areas the shops are often isolated without a main structure behind
them.
The shops may be made with either strong (cement, brick, tile roof) or weak
(grass roof, mud/bamboo) materials.
Some special locations are attractive for shops, as in the case of ferries (Gianh
River, Km 621, Le Ninh, Km 671) and car/rail bridge (Km 650). Vehicles have
to stop at these places and are potential customers for shopkeepers. At these
sites, we found mostly restaurants and retail businesses.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENrAL IMPACT ASSESSMENr REPORT
* Market areas
Daily market areas are present in most of the urban areas. Markets often
encroach onto roadside. As traffic flows will increase with the rehabilitation of
the road, conflicts will increase between these activities and the efficiency and
safety of traffic functions of the road. These activities will also be affected
during the construction phase.
4.4.8    Historic and Cultural Sites
Due to its position in the north and south of Viet Nam, the study area has
been very much affected by the war since 1950. The main historic and cultural
sites in the study area are linked to the war.
J Historic Sites
An historic site is located at the former border between the north and the
south on the Ben Hai River, approximately on the 17th parallel. This border
was in place from 1954 to 1975. It is now inside the province of Quang Tri. A
memorial is present to commemorate this former division of the country.
Another historic site, the Sky Gate, is located closed to the road at the Ngang
pass (Km 495.4). This gate was built in 1831 during the war between the Trinh
Dynasty (in the North) and the Nguyen Dynasty (in the South). This gate is
located on an old boundary in place since the 7th and 8th centuries. About
3,000 to 4,000 people visit the site annually. Two accesses are present to reach
the gate: one is a stairway located in the ascent of the pass and the other is
a path which starts from the top of the pass.
* Bunkers
The road was strategically important for conveying goods and soldiers. To
defend the road, bunkers were built in 1951 and 1952 during the French
period.
Six bunkers are located in the clear area at Km 671.83, 673.0, 692.6, 697.35,
706.6 and 708.1.
DESSAU-EXPERCO                    MARCH 1996                             Pagp 51



VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No 1 BEIWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
Bunkers are historical sites and are under the responsibility of the Ministrv of
Army and the Ministry of Culture. According to our meetings (Ministrv of
Construction of Quang Binh), some bunkers have been demolished after
getting permission from the Ministry of Army. Bunkers are numerous in the
study area and they are all built in the same way.
The removal or the destruction of the bunkers must be authorized by the
relevant ministries. Due to the numerous bunkers in the area and their archi-
tectural homogeneity, the removal of the five bunkers does not appear to be
an important issue. One of them (Km 671,83) is already partially demolished.
* Pagodas and Cemeteries
Pagodas and cemeteries are often present along the road. Some of the pagodas
are declared historic sites by the central Ministry of Culture. Due to the impor-
tance of battles during the war, a lot of cemeteries are often war cemeteries.
Civil cemeteries are also present. The following pagodas and cemeteries are
along the road:
* Den Trao Temple (Km 559.3)
Province of Ha Tinh, District of Ky Anh, Commune of Ky Tho
The Den Trao temple is partially located in the clear area. The temple was
built in memory of the 17th Century General Phan Hoanh by the people of
his commune at Ky Tho. The temple was heavily damaged during the war
and the Ministry of Culture of Ha Tinh Province wants to help the local
people in Ky Tho to restore it. The local people have preserved some of the
artifacts from the temple to put into the restored temple. The Ministry is
preparing a funding proposal for the province.
The Central Ministry of Culture in Hanoi has declared the temple an his-
toric site which means it is protected by law from being moved or destroyed.
The gate, which is situated approximately five metres from the centre of
road, was damaged very little during the war. It is in good condition but
fragile.

Because of its importance and the difficulties of removing this monument
the gate will not be moved. No change in the alignment of the road will be
necessary.
Another temple is located at Km 580.3 (Quang Binh province, Ky Anh Dis-
trict). This temple is partially demolished and does not present a special
interest.
Buddhist Cemetery (Km 643.4 - 643.5
Province of Quang Binh, District of Bo Trach, Commune of Dong Trach.
The cemetery is located on both sides of the road. Graves can be moved
and compensation made for all costs of excavation, moving, and reburial in
accordance with Decree 90, Article 12. There are about 40 graves affected.
Soldier memorial (Km 637.4)
(Province of Quang Binh District of Bo Trach, Commune of Hai Trach).
A soldier memorial is present on the top of the hill overhanging the road.
This memorial is small and will be easily moved and relocated.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
5.0  ANTICIPATED  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND
MITIGATION MEASURES
5.1    METHODOLOGY
Identification of the impacts was done after a series of meetings and after
much environmental field work was carried out in the study area. This included
many meetings with Provinces, Districts and Communes People's Committees,
two survey carried out during the resettlement study visits in the field, exami-
nation of recent aerial photographs and discussion with the technical team.
The anticipated environmental impacts are classified in three categories
Major, Intermediate and Minor.
A major impact can destroy an element of the environment or bring about a
strong environmental modification. Such an impact can greatly affect the
realization component of the project if it is impossible to adopt an adequate
mitigation measure. An intermediate impact will partially reduce the value or
use of an environmental element and will be felt by a limited portion of the
population. A minor impact many be a slight alteration of value or use of an
element and will be felt by a restricted group of individuals. In each case,
mitigation measures could reduce the importance of the impact. The residual
environmental impact assesses the anticipated environmental impacts after
application of the mitigation measure.
An identification matrix of the impacts is made for each phase of the project:
design, construction and operation. In each phase, the type of work causing the
impacts is identified for each environmental component. The major, interme-
diate and minor impacts are identified respectively as 3, 2, and 1. The benefi-
cial impacts are also included, and are identified by the same numbers, but
within parentheses.
The identifiable environmental impacts are presented in drawings (see appen-
dix 5). Identification on a drawing facilitates one to rapidly obtain the major
data concerning these impacts : affected element, impact description, impor-
tance, duration of the impact, specific mitigation measures and residual impact.

A list of general mitigation measures is also presented in appendix 4. This list
presents the proposed addition to the Chapter on Safety, Security and the
Protection of the Environment, to be included in General Conditions of Con-
tract.
5.2    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS RELATED TO DESIGN
It was possible to identify four sources of impacts related to design: the wide-
ning of the road, the raising of the road, the construction of new bridges and
the location of quarries, borrow pits, asphalt plants, material storage areas,
worker camps and dumps. Table 5.1 presents the identification matrix of
potential impacts for this phase.
5.2.1   Widening of the Road
The road will be widened. The roadway (including shoulders) will be enlarged
to a total width of 10 to 12 m. Actually the average width of the road is around
7 m. Figure 2.3 presents the new design of the road in urban and rural areas.
* Physical Resources
* Erosion / Sedimentation
The widening of the road will affect the existing ditches and new ones will
have to be planned. In areas sensitive to erosion, such as the Ngang Pass
(Km 592 to 598) and the low lying sandy hills with gentle slopes between
Km 705 and 725 and between Km 740 and 745, masonry ditches and walls
will have to be replaced or constructed to minimize erosion and silt runoff.
All construction work on steep slope areas should be planned to be realized
between the months of December to August. We anticipate that the impact
will be minor negative.
Re-use of existing materials (asphalt, aggregate, etc.) for the building of the
road will reduce the demand for borrow materials and will limit waste.

* Humnan and Social Environment
. Resettlement
Resettlement constitutes the major adverse issue for this project. Reset-
tlement is treated in detail in the Resettlement Action Plan.
In May 1995, after the first socio-economic survey, the Government of Viet-
nam issued a new decree, Decree CP/36, intended to ensure traffic order
and safety on roads and in urban centres. This decree gives, in particular,
the power to the provincial authorities to clear road beds which have been
illegally occupied.
The decree was enforced in August 1995 by the district authorities and
clearance has been carried out along the main roads of the country, and
especially, along Highway No.1. The result of this implementation was that
most of the PAPs identified in the first survey were removed without com-
pensation.
Considering this situation to be in contradiction with World Bank guidelines,
a new survey was carried out to assess the situation and to integrate the new
data in the RAP. The main results of the survey were
Of a total of 2,116 households (8,350 persons) affected through losses of
structure
- 205 households have been partially demolished;
- 1,207 households have been reorganized beyond the project corridor;
- 312 households have been relocated outside the project corridor;
- 392 households are still in the project corridor; they have not been
affected by the implementation of the decree.
A detailed survey is planned to assess the situation of PAPs already affected.
People will be also affected through land acquisition (especially in agricul-
tural areas). At the present time, the complete scope of the land acquisition
requirements is not known. A land measurement survey needs to be con-
ducted to evaluate the exact losses for every household. Estimates have been

made based on the existing condition of the road. According to these esti-
mates, 89.3 ha are necessarv for the widening of the road; of these. 18.4 ha
are urban areas. 27.3 ha in rural residential areas and 43.6 ha in agricultural
areas.
Policies for compensation, relocation and/or rehabilitation have been estab-
lished. Compensation will be paid at replacement rates for affected assets.
Persons affected by house acquisition will be: a) relocated in a resettlement
site if the number of person is sufficient; b) relocated on individual resettle-
ment site; or c) reorganized on their own land if they have sufficient remain-
ing land area. Persons affected by land acquisition will be compensated for
land in cash at replacement cost if they are only adversely affected, or with
land for land compensation if they are severely affected. Ferries and bridge
workers who will lose their jobs will be provided new jobs by the MOT.
Relocation and compensation for PAPs must be finished before the begin-
ning of the physical work.
The relocation and the compensation of PAPs must be finished before the
beginning of the work.
Relocation of Infrastructures
- Irrigation channel
Some irrigation channels are located along the road. In these areas, some
channel sections are located in the clear area but will not be affected
directly by the project.
The purpose of the clear area is for safety and future widening of the
road. Irrigation channels have no effect on safety and the road could be
widened on the other side if necessary. Due to the importance of struc-
tures and the difficulties to move them, the channels could stay in the
clear area and no impact is anticipated.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
- Overhead network
Electric and telephone lines are present all along the road, particular in
urban areas. Approximately 2,300 poles have been counted in the clear
area(about 35 km of lines).
All structures located in the ROW must be moved prior to the beginning
of the civil works for road rehabilitation. The Ministry of Post and Tele-
communications is responsible for the telephone lines and the Ministry of
Energy for electrical lines. Relocation of infrastructure must be done
before the beginning of the work and without significant interruption of
service.
- Underground communication line
An underground telephone communication system is also present all along
the road. The Ministry of Post and Telecomrnunication is responsible for
moving this infrastructure.
With the relocation of the infrastructures before the beginning of the
work, and without significant service interruption, no impact is anticipated.
Loss of Farmland
The road crosses 92.36 km of agricultural land on the left (east) side and
104.53 km on the right (west) side. 75 % of this land is cultivated in rice.
The widening of the road will encroach on this agricultural land.
In a situation in which the pressure on the land is very strong and where the
area allocated per family is small (0.08 ha per capita in the study area),
losing a piece of land can have a great effect on the farmers. In many
communes in central Viet Nam, all land has been allocated and there is no
free land to replace lost land. Land for land compensation will not be
possible in such cases, therefore compensation will be in cash.
Overall in the context of the project, the loss of arable land will be minor
compared to total land acquisition requirements, but this loss will be import-
ant in areas prone to flooding. As the rehabilitation of the road will main-

tain the existing alignment, farmers will be only partially affected. Most of
these will suffer small losses (20 to 100 m2) due to the widening of the road.
According to Decree 203, farmers will be able to continue to cultivate in the
clear area. This disposition will reduce the amount of affected land. The
impact on farmnland will be intermediate.
The resettlement action plan will describe, in detail, the impacts and the
mitigation measures for the loss of farmland.
Encroachment on Cultural and Historic Sites
- Den Trao Temple (Km 559.3)
Province of Ha Tinh, District of Ky Anh, Commune of Ky Tho
A portion of this temple (the gate) is partially located in the clear area.
The temple was built in memory of the 17ih Century General Phan Hoanh
by the people of his comrnune at Ky Tho. The temple was heavily da-
maged during the war and the museum wants to help the local people in
Ky Tho to restore it. The local people have preserved some of the artifacts
from the temple to put into the restored temple.
The Central Ministry of Culture in Hanoi has declared the temple a
historic site which means it is protected by law from being moved or
destroyed. The gate, which is situated approximately 5 metres from the
centre of the road, suffered very little damage during the war. It is in good
condition but fragile. The gate is also threaten by erosion (ditches are
present just in from of the gate). The initial impact is major negative.
According to our discussions, MOT considers that the gate could stay in
the clear area because of its importance and because of the difficulties of
removing this monument or changing the alignment of the road. Masonry
ditches will be built to replace the existing ditches and to stop the erosion
process. With the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures,
the residual impact will be minor negative.

The cemetery is located on both sides of the road. Graves can be moved
and compensation made for all costs of excavation, moving, and reburial
in accordance with Decree 90, Article 12. About 40 graves are affected.
With relocation and compensation for graves, the residual impact will be
minor negative.
- Soldier Memorial (Km 637.4)
(Province of Quang Binh, District of Bo Trach, Commune of Hai Trach)
A soldier memorial is present on the top of the hill overlooking the road.
This memorial is small and will be easily relocated. The residual impact
will be minor.
- Bunkers
Six bunkers are located in the clear area at Km 671.8, 673.0, 692.6, 697.3,
706.6 and 708.1.
Bunkers are historic sites and are under the responsibility of the Ministry
of Army and the Ministry of Culture. According to our meetings (Ministry
of Construction of Quang Binh), some bunkers have been demolished
after getting permission from the Ministry of Army. Bunkers are numerous
in the study area and they are built in the same way. The moving or the
destruction of the bunkers must be decided by the relevant ministries. Due
to the numerous bunkers in the area and their architectural homogeneity,
the moving of the six bunkers does not appear to be an important issue.
One of them, at Km 671.8, is already partially demolished. The residual
impact will not be significant.
With the implementation of proposed mitigation measures, impacts on
historic sites will be minor or non significant.

Encroachment on Community Activities
In the study area, the road is often used as public space. Encroachment of
local community activities on the road side takes many forms: markets,
kiosks, bus stops, drying crops. Such activities are often found in built-up
areas. These activities are not compatible with traffic but they could be
economically and socially significant. The widening of the road will affect
these activities and cause an intermediate impact. If some training and
education is necessary to ensure the safety of the population, some enhance-
ment measures could be carried out as follows:
Guardrails could be installed between market areas and the road to prevent
encroachment on the road side and to ensure the safety of market cus-
tomers; 13 markets have been identified along the road.
Road signs to indicate the proximity of markets will be installed. MOT, in
coordination with local authorities, will evaluate the necessity of installing
permanent "humpbacks" at the beginning and at the end of markets to slow
down traffic speed if necessary.
From an initial intermediate negative impact, the residual impact will
become minor negative.
5.2.2    Raising of the Road
In flood-prone areas, the road could be raised up to 1.9 m to meet the retained
design criteria. The elevation of the road must be sufficient to ensure a safe
circulation of trucks and buses during floods of 10-year recurrence (determined
by the hydraulic study realized for the project). Therefore, the retain level is
the elevation of the 10-year flood level minus 0.30 m. Important embankments
and slopes will be created.
a Physical Resources
Flood conditions could be changed in sections where raising of the road is
necessary. More retention of water on one side of the road may be anticipated
resulting in the flooding of households and agricultural land on this side of the

Table 5.2 presents, for some flood-prone areas, the actual 10-year flood level
and the anticipated head waters level if the road is raised without the addition
of culverts. The future head waters level could be raised as high as 0.26 m if
no culvert is added.
To prevent water retention, an area of culverts, sufficient for drainage, will be
installed where necessary. According to the level chosen for the raising of the
road and the area of culverts installed, flooding conditions will not change and
therefore agricultural land and the population will not be affected.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BEIWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IhPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
The same comments as found in section 5.2.1 (Human and Social Environ-
ment, Loss of farmland) apply. According to the length of the raised road,
the impact could be major.
Safety
The road is designed to be raised to 0.3 m below the 10-year flood level. To
maintain traffic during flooding, and to ensure the safety of road users,
guardrails or road demarcations will be provided to identify road alignment.
Actually, such guardrails or demarcation signs are not systematically present
in flood-prone areas along the road. The impact will be intermediate posi-
tive.
52.3   Construction of New Bridges
Fifty one bridges will be replaced or rehabilitated for the project. Eighteen of
these will be repaired and thirty-three will need to be replaced. Except for the
two major bridges (Chanh Hoa, Km 650.40 and Quan Hau, Km 671.05) the
new bridges will be built in the existing alignment of the old ones.
The location of the Quan Hau bridge is not yet known. Depending on the
alignment alternative chosen, one of which passes through the urban area of
Luong Ninh, impacts on the environment may be important. An addendum to
the EIA will be necessary once the alternative will be chosen.
* Physical Resources
Temporary bridges, if needed, have to be planned near the bridge to be
replaced. It must not be permitted to ford the river. The residual impact will
be minor negative.
* Human and Social Environment
No impacts are anticipated on farmland or on resettlement due to the location
of new bridges, with the exception of the Quang Hau bridge (Km 671.05).
Special attention will be given if temporary bridges are necessary to ensure the
traffic flow.

VIEI NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACI ASSESSMENT REPORT
Disruptions of surface hydrology could result in the impairment of beneficial
water uses including fisheries, navigation, community water supply, recreation
and others. Particularly, the temporary bridges must be designed so as not to
be a hindrance to navigation. Impacts will be minor with the application of
mitigating measures.
5.2.4    Location of Quarries. Borrow Pits. Asphalt Plants. Worker Camps and Dumps
* Physical Resources
The location of quarries, borrow pits, asphalt plants, materials storage areas,
worker camps and dumps could have a significant environmental impact. All
these infrastructures must be located in appropriate areas to minimize envi-
ronmental impact. At this stage of the project, only limited information is
available on this subject and a detailed survey in the next phase may be neces-
sary to ascertain the location of these areas and their impacts.
In the case of quarries and borrow pits, their location must be away from
coastal areas to avoid impact on these fragile environments. The National Plan
for Enviromnent and Sustainable Development 1991-2000 recommended to
regulate sand mining and beach rock quarrying along the coast, where coastal
erosion is in some areas a serious problem. For quarries, the sites must be
away from urban areas to avoid risks to the population (noise and falling rocks
due to dynamiting).
If it is necessary to use sand dunes for borrow pits, it will be better to exploit
dunes located on the inland side (less affected by erosion). Affected areas have
to be stabilized by planting beach vegetation (e.g. pines, Phy Lao) after com-
pletion of work.
Numerous borrow pits and quarries have to be found along the road. A lot of
small material sites operated along the road could strongly affect the environ-
ment by causing numerous encroachments on the natural areas. However, if
these sites are numerous, it will reduce the distance to transport these
materials and will reduce nuisance linked to traffic (noise, dust, safety).
DESSAU-EXPERCO                    MARCH 1996                             Page 65



VIEr NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. I BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
On the other hand, several big sites will reduce encroachment on natural areas
but will increase the distance of material transportation. A comprornise solu-
tion has to be found according to the sensitivity of the areas affected.
For asphalt plants, material storage areas and worker camps, the surface
drainage should be carefully designed to prevent flooding of the plant area.
To avoid water pollution, dumps have to be located 1 m above the water table.
* Human and Social Environment
To avoid impacts on the population, the already exploited areas and the areas
which don't need to cross crowded areas for transport have to be chosen in
priority. The areas located along rivers where transportation by river is possible
also have to be favoured.
An intermediate negative impact is apprehended due to the location of borrow
areas for all the project components.
5.3     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION
STAGE
Three sources of impact have been identified during the construction stage.
These impacts are due to: a) construction work, including work for widening
or raising the road; b) bridge construction; and c) location of quarries and
borrow pits. Table 5.3 presents the identification matrix of potential impacts
for this phase.
5.3.1    Construction Work
Construction work for the widening and raising of the road will significantly
affect traffic and road safety, air quality (dust and noise), slope erosion and
disruption of local drainage and irrigation systems. The impacts during con-
struction are temporary and of short duration.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
* Physical Resources
* Air Quality
Air quality (dust), noise and vibrations could be significant impacts during
construction work. Some standard mitigation measures can be easily fol-
lowed to reduce these impacts, such as periodic watering down of the con-
struction area, resurfacing the road with asphalt emulsion or cement right
after the completion of one side of the road, installing and maintaining
mufflers on equipment, and restricting construction activities which generate
excessive noise to day-light hours (e.g. between 6.00 a.m. and 10.00 p.m.).
Impacts will be intermediate negative but of short duration.
Erosion / Siltation
Slopes have to be replanted to reduce erosion and stability problems. This
should be undertaken as early as possible in the construction process, and
before erosion becomes too advanced.
In areas sensitive to erosion, such as the Ngang Pass (Km 592 to 598), the
Ly Hoa Pass (Km 636 to 638) and the low lying sandy hills with gentle
slopes between Km 705 and 725 and between Km 740 and 745, masonry
ditches and walls will have to be replaced or constructed to minimize ero-
sion and silt runoff. All construction work on steep slope areas should be
planned to be realized between the months of December to August and no
erosion-prone slopes or ditches should be left unprotected during the rainy
season (September to November). Where it is needed, retention ponds will
be established to reduce the sediment load before the water enters streams
or rivers.
Water flow must be maintained during the construction work to avoid
flooding on the west side of the road.
The residual impact will be minor negative.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENWAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
* Ecological Resources
* Flooded Areas
In the project area, around 125 km of road are subject to overtopping for
a 10-year recurrence period. Work in flooded areas must be controlled to
mitigate effects on the environment.
To avoid the risk of contaminant spillage due to unexpected flash floods,
no storage of material, which may result in accidental spillage of
contaminants, will be authorized in these specific areas during the rainy
season (September to November). Also, hydrophobic oil sorbent booms,
rolls, pads etc. must be kept on the construction site. An emergency plan in
case of oil spillage must also be prepared.
With the implementation of the mitigation measures above, from an inter-
mediate negative initial impact, the residual impact will become temporary
and minor negative.
i Sections along River's Bank
The road borders the Ca River in two sections (from Km 470.00 to 470.40
and Km 474.2 to 475.0). At these sections, the future road will encroach on
the river. The future road will create potential erosion on the river bank and
embankment. The following measures to mitigate these impacts will be
implemented.
Construction work directly in the river must be first minimized. The cons-
truction work in the river or on its bank must also be completed, if possible,
during the dry season (from December to August) to avoid the risk of water
contamination. During the rainy season (September to November) no
material, equipment or temporary structure must be left in the river or on
its bank to avoid the risk of contaminant spillage.
To avoid erosion, susceptible surfaces will be protected with mulch or fabric
and erosion-prone surfaces will be planted as soon as possible.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINE AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
After construction, all materials, equipment and temporary structures must
be removed from the river bank. The river and its bank must be returned
to its natural state.
The residual impact will be minor negative.
Existing Vegetation
Destruction of vegetation along the road should be reduced to a minimum.
Trees, saplings and shrubbery will be preserved to the maximum extent poss-
ible. Erosion of slopes could be minimized by sodding, planting vegetation
or slope paving immediately after the construction work and by controlling
steepness. Reduction of the width of the corridor in natural areas and
erosion-sensitive zones should be analyzed. The residual impact will be
minor negative.
* Sand and Dune Areas
Special attention will be paid to sections of the road in dune areas (Km 673
to 705). In these sections, vegetation along the road was often planted to fix
soil and to prevent sand erosion. The initial impact is intermediate negative.
New plantations of trees to fix the soil (e.g. pines, Phy Lao) must be done
after the construction work is finished. The residual impact will be then
minor negative.
* Natural Environments
Natural environments, such as the Con and Ngang passes and the Ly Hoa
pass, should be preserved from the effects of construction. Location of
depots, camp sites, storage areas, borrow pits and asphalt plants must be
avoid in these areas.
* Human and Social Development
Traffic Maintenance
During the work, the existing infrastructure must be used to carry out the
construction work. At this time, only one lane will be available for traffic.

VIET NAM - REHABILITATION OF HIGHWAY No. 1 BETWEEN VINH AND DONG HA
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT REPORT
To mitigate this problem, the project will have to provide proper markers
on the highway, including lights. In addition, to decrease the duration of
construction work in each area, contractors must work on 500 m sections
and provide clear caution and direction signals for each section. The resi-
dual impact will be intermediate negative but temporary.
Imrigation Channel
The road crosses 162 irrigation channels. These channels are essential for
farmers. The initial impact is major. Water flow must not be interrupted. If
this proves impossible, the work should be done during the rainy season or
in November when maintenance work on the irrigation channels is done.
Farmers and local authorities have to be consulted before any interruption.
The residual impact will be minor negative.
* Worker Safety during Flood Season
The project area is subject to unexpected flash floods during the rainy
season. To ensure worker and material safety, a flood emergency prepared-
ness and a flood disaster management plan will be elaborated in coope-
ration with the Department of Dyke Management and Flood Control
(DDMFC) of the Ministry of Water Resources. These plans must, in par-
ticular, identify evacuation routines for workers, equipment and materials
in case of flash flood warning. The impact will be intermediate positive.
* Accessibility to markets
Market areas are located along the road and the commercial activities could
be disturbed during the construction stage. The initial impact is intermediate
negative. Accessibility to market areas must be ensured during the con-
struction stage. Periodic watering down must be done along the market
areas. If accessibility cannot be maintained, temporary relocation must be
evaluated in coordination with MOT, local authorities and shopkeepers.
With the implementation of these measures, the residual impacts will be
minor negative.

Women Road Workers
Women account for 35 - 40 % of the employees of the Regional Road
Management Unit # 4 in charge of road maintenance. Most of them are
labourers (70 to 80 %). There are no women technicians or engineers.
Employment/training equity programs will be conducted to give women the
opportunity to compete for higher skilled/higher paying jobs on the road.
The impact will be minor positive.
* Economic Development
An intermediate and temporary positive economic impact will be created
with respect to economic activities. In fact, workers in the zone concerned
will have the opportunity of being hired at the various building sites. Also,
the workers will spend their money in the areas where they work.
5.3.2   Construction of New Bridges
* Ecological Resources
Rivers and habitats could be significantly deteriorated due to the construction
of new bridges, the demolition of old bridges or the rehabilitation of existing
bridges. Proper construction methods should be used to reduce water pollution
and sedimentation in the rivers. In particular, moving equipment directly
through the river must be avoided.
If a bridge cannot be used during the reparation or rehabilitation, a temporary
bridge must be used. It will not be permitted to ford the river.
Residual impact will be minor negative.
* Human and Economic Development
At Chanh Hoa (Km 650.30) the bridge is actually shared by the road and the
railway. A new bridge will be built on another alignment. The construction
work must be realized in coordination with the railway authority. After the

completion of the new bridge, the accesses to the railway bridge must be closed
to ensure safetv on the bridge. The accesses to the existing houses along the
former bridge access road must be maintained. The residual impact will not be
significant.
5.3.3    Ouarries and Borrow Pits
* Physical Resources
Quarrying operations should be undertaken, and borrow pits should be
exploited, in a manner that will allow air and water quality standards to be
met.
Erosion and silt runoff could lead to impairment of downstream water quality
or in damage to the land's agricultural value. This must be avoided by
adequate location of these sites. No taking of materials under the water table
will be permitted.
The residual impacts will be intermediate negative and permanent.
* Human and Social Environment
Safety precautions will have to be enforced by appropriate procedures in order
to safeguard workers and nearby residents (presently, no such procedures seem
to be enforced in Viet Nam). Quarry sites must be enclosed and explosives
kept in safety lockers. Blasting activities should always be preceded by a sound
alarm and restricted to day-light hours (e.g. between 6.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m.).
At the end of the exploitation of quarry or borrow pits, all sites to be closed
will have to be cleaned up and revegetated to avoid degradation of environ-
mental aesthetics.
The residual impact will be intermediate negative but temporary.

5.3.4    Asphalt Plants, Material Storage Areas. Dumps and Worker Camps
m Physical Resources
Solid and human waste should be appropriately treated and disposed of.
Latrines and water supply facilities should be provided and maintained at
appropriate locations. Dumps must be located at least 1 m above the highest
level of the water table. Soil pollution from asphalt plants should be controlled
by soil collection and recycling.
Traditional practices for repairing the road (asphalt plant) are very polluting.
Workers put pieces of asphalt in barrels and make a fire under them to make
the asphalt melt. This practice causes thick, dark smoke and generates oil leaks
in the soil. Asphalt plants should be operated in a manner that will allow air
and water quality standards to be met.
The residual impacts will be intermediate negative but temporary.
5.4     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS RELATED TO THE OPERATION STAGE
Two sources of impact have been identified for the operation stage: a) the
rehabilitation of the Highway No. 1 and b) the traffic. Table 5.4 presents the
identification matrix of potential impacts for this phase.
5.4.1    Rehabilitation of Highwav No. 1

* Human and Economic Development
* Induced Developrnent
The project would not cause major indirect development; the road already
exists and is heavily used and its access areas are developed and populated.
According to the option chosen, the road will be usable throughout the
whole year, even in flood season. This situation will improve the economic
development of the study area. An intermediate positive impact is antici-
pated.
5.4.2   Traffic
a Physical Resources
The increase in traffic, due to the rehabilitation of the road, could result in
augmentation of air pollution and noise from road traffic. Vehicle emission
standards and inspection and maintenance requirements could be applied to
reduce air pollution. The clear area will also contribute to the protection of
people living along the road. We anticipate a minor impact.
The transport of hazardous materials which could spill in the event of a road
accident could pollute ground water, streams, and drinking water and conta-
minate soil. Disaster response plans should be established and be quickly
implemented if need be.
* Human and Economic Development
* Safety
The rehabilitation of Highway No. 1 could have a major impact on road
safety. At this time, this road is very dangerous because it has a nlixture of
slow and fast-moving traffic and no apparent regulations are enforced.
Increased vehicle speed on this road would lead to an increase in the num-
ber of accidents. The initial impact could be major. Moreover, urban growth
along the road will add to this situation. Highway No. 1 is used by pedes-
trians walking, crossing or standing on the road, by bicycles, large slow

moving vehicles, motorcycles, cars, buses and trucks. People also use the
road for purposes such as for drying crops, moving buffalos and flattening
sheets of metals or cans. In 1994, there were 4,872 road accident fatalities
(Viet Nam's Ministry of Transport). This implies a fatality rate of 160 per
10,000 vehicles. A detailed analysis of global accident statistics by the UK's
Transport Research Laboratory suggests that this is very high compared to
both developing and industrialized countries. For instance the statistic for
Pakistan is 50, Korea 40, and the UK less than 5 fatalities per 10,000
vehicles. The costs of road accidents are very high and the Government of
Viet Nam should improve policies, regulations, training, and education.
The following measures will contribute to reduce the risk of accident and to
ensure the safety of road users
- Shoulders
Paved shoulders will be designed on each side of the carriageway to
accommodate bicycles and slow moving traffic. This solution will contri-
bute to the separation of slow and fast moving traffic and to increased
traffic safety. The impact will be intermediate and positive.
- Sidewalks
Sidewalks will be built in urban and densely populated areas. They will
improve pedestrian safety. The impact will be intermediate and positive.
- Parkdng Areas
Two sites along the road have good tourist potential: the Ngang pass and
the former border between the North and the South Viet Nam. Presently
no parking areas are located along these sites where people frequently
stop their vehicles. With the traffic increase and the development of
tourist activities in Viet Nam, risks of accident and traffic disturbance are
present around these sites.

north ascent of the pass. This situation can be dangerous due to the nar-
rowness of the road. At the top of the pass is the start of a path linking
the Sky Gate and the whole path network.
To ensure the safety of road traffic, parking areas must be designed at the
top of the pass on the right side (Km 595.18 to 595.25) and on the left side
(Km 595.26 to Km 596.34). Space is available at these locations (500 m2
on the right side and 700 m2 on the left side).
Excavation work and paving will be necessary. Installation of fences and
traffic signs will also be done. Particularly, signs will be installed to forbid
stopping and/or parking along the road side and to indicate the location
of a parking area at the pass.
= Former border between North and South Viet Nam (Km 734.50)
The former border between North and South Viet Nam was in place from
1954 to 1975. The border follows the Ben Hai River on the 17th parallel.
This site is a historic site. A memorial is present, on the north side, to
commemorate this former division of the country. Presently people stop
along the road to reach the memorial and no parking facilities are avai-
lable. A new bridge is under construction on the Ben Hai River and the
old one will be dismantled.
When the bridge will be dismantled, the access road, on the north side of
the river, could be used as a parking area to accommodate the visitors.
Resurfacing will be necessary as well as the installation of fences and
traffic signs.
The impacts linked to the creation of these parking areas will be interme-
diate and positive.

- Market Areas
Monitoring of market areas will be carried out in order to evaluate the
necessity of reducing traffic speed in these areas. MOT, in coordination
with local authorities and shopkeepers, will evaluate the necessity of instal-
ling, for example, permanent "humpbacks" at the beginning and at the end
of markets to slow down traffic speed if necessary.

6.0  INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
MONITORING PROGRAM
Environmental monitoring will begin simultaneously with the commencement
of construction and continue throughout its duration.
6.1    RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION
PMU.1 will be responsible for conducting regular monitoring. At this time, no
department in PMU.1 is in charge of enviromnental aspects. It will be necess-
ary to create an environmental department to carry on monitoring according
to the provisions of the EIA
Strengthening the institutional capacity of PMU.1 in enviromnental aspects will
be necessary. Training of members of this environmental department, by a
senior environmental expert, is required. These members should have a back-
ground in engineering and environmental studies. The estimated costs linked
to training and to the operation of the environmental department will be US
$ 238,000 (table 6.1). This estimate includes the presence of an environmental
expert for training (3 months) before construction and for three periods of I
month (each year) during the construction stage, 3 Vietnamese counterparts,
and allowances and vehicles for this period of time.

APPENDIX 4 - GENERAL MITIGATION MEASURES
Proposed Addition to the Chapter on Safety. Security and the Protection of the Environment
in the Fourth Edition of FIDIC's General Conditions of Contract.
Add the following to Sub Clause (c) of Clause 19.1 of Part I of the General Conditions
19.1 (c)   The Contractor shall, in particular, ensure that following measures are observed
in a reasonable manner and to the satisfaction of the Engineer throughout the
execution and completion of the Works:
(i)  the landscape is preserved to the extent possible by conducting operations
in a manner which will prevent unnecessary destruction or scarring of the
natural surroundings. Except where required for Permanent Works,
quarries, borrow pits, staging and processing areas, dumps and camps, all
trees, saplings and shrubbery shall be protected from unnecessary damage.
After unavoidable damage, reseeding, replanting, or restoration will be
required promptly to prevent further damage (i.e. erosion) and to restore
quasi-original conditions where appropriate;
(ii) the Contractor's facilities, such as warehouses, labor camps and storage
areas, shall be planned in advance based on how the areas will be used
and will be completely dismantled and removed upon completion of
construction. These facilities shall be located to preserve the natural
environment, to the maximum extent possible. Following removal of such
facilities, the areas shall be restored as close as possible to their original
condition and returned to an appropriate land use;
(iii) following completion of their use, borrow pits and other material resource
areas shall be landscaped and planted according to ecological design
standards satisfactory to the Engineer (refer to Technical Specifications as
appropriate) to provide substitute areas for displaced natural habitats or
other appropriate land use;
(iv)  the Contractor's operations shall be performed in a manner sufficient to
prevent accidental spillage of contaminants, debris or other pollutants,
especially into streams and or underground water resources. Such pollu-
tants include untreated sewage and sanitary waste, tailings, bitumen and
other petroleum products, chemicals, biocides, mineral salts and thermal
pollution. Wastewater, including those of aggregate processing and con-

other processes so as not to impair water quality or harm aquatic life. In
case such accidental spillage or other damage occurs, the Contractor shall,
at his own cost, rectify such damage;
(v)   air pollution emissions shall be minimized by using sprinkling or other
methods during production, handling, transportation and storing of aggre-
gates, cement and similar dust producing substances. Dust from vehicles
or equipment moving or operating on the construction site, including
camps, depots, borrow areas and other construction related areas, shall be
minimized by regular sprinkling of water or other acceptable methods.
Waste materials, brush or trees shall be burned only when the Engineer
permits under favorable weather conditions. Asphalt plant emissions shall
meet appropriate environmental standards.
(vi)  the Contractor will organize activities to minimize traffic delays and to
protect pedestrians along his work areas. Temporary pedestrian access
across roads under construction must be provided for local residents. This
will require the Contractor to liaise and cooperate with the local police
and the Ministry of Transport in traffic control;
(vii) construction activities is areas of human habitation and congregation shall
be limited to daylight hours (between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.). Noise
from blasting, hauling and other such operations shall be minimized
through the use of low noise machines where appropriate;
(viii) quarries and- borrow areas shall be carefully selected to minimize impacts
on natural surroundings, agricultural and other areas of sensitive land use.
Route and timing of material transport shall be carefully selected to
minimize impacts on schools, hospitals, and other environmentally sensi-
tive facilities.
