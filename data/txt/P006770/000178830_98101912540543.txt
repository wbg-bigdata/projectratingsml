1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most
promising at some 93 GW of capacity and 400 TWh of annual energy capabil-
ity 1/. Colombia is also endowed with large coal and gas deposits. Since
1970 oil production has declined at an average annual rate of 6%. Over
the same period, consumption of petroleum products increased on average
5.4% annually until 1975 and declined to 3.5% since then. As a result,
Colombia has been a net importer of crude oil since 1976, with petroleum
having become the country's largest single import. Prospects are for oil
imports to rise sharply in the early 1980s unless additional reserves are
discovered and developed rapidly. Measures are being taken to deal with
this problem and to develop alternative energy sources. In the case of coal,
there have been various obstacles to more adequate utilization of the existing
potential: the competition of lower priced petroleum, fragmentation of
production among a large number of small mines with low output and productivity
levels, and lack of efficient transport infrastructure. However, the Govern-
ment has been taking action to address these problems (1.03).
1.02      Production of primary energy during 1970-1980 (Annex 1.1) has not
kept pace with overall economic expansion. It increased at 2.9%/a during
1970-1975, and then in the period 1976-1980 it increased only at 0.6%/a,
mainly due to falling crude oil output. In contrast to the declining energy
output, final energy consumption grew at 3.6%/a during 1970-1975, and at 6.1%/a
during 1976-1980, and has now stabilized at a growth of about 6.0%/a.
1.03      The Government-s development strategy is aimed at achieving a more
favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use through increased
utilization of domestic sources which are in abundant supply, i.e., hydropower,
natural gas and coal and by developing high-value energy resources for export
to reduce the growing energy trade deficit. Toward this end, the Government
is planning a large-scale development of high grade coal deposits for export
by state entities in association with foreign investors. For this purpose, a
new enterprise, Carbones de Colombia (CARBOCOL), has recently been created and
has emerged as the Government's chief agency in coal-related matters. The Govern-
ment attaches high priority to developing, primarily for export, the coal deposits
at El Cerrejon (measured reserves well in excess of 1 billion tons) near Riohacha
in the Department of La Guajira on the Atlantic Coast, under CARBOCOL's responsi-
bility in cooperation with foreign investment. A portion of the thermal deposits
1/   Source:  Electric Energy Sector Study (ESEE) prepared jointly by the
National Planning Department (NPD) and ISA with the full time assistance
of GTZ. (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH -
Federal Republic of Germany) completed in 1979.



at El Cerrejon is earmarked for domestic consumption in power plants and industry
in place of natural gas and fuel oil. The Government also intends to step up
surveys of identified coal fields in the departments of Santander and Antioquia
and to study the feasibility of using this coal for firing large thermal
plants required in the early 1990s when potential hydro sites are expected to
be increasingly more costly to develop (1.25). Small private firms which own
coal mines are pursuing plans to expand output and expand operations in order
to supply fuel for heat-intensive industrial processes and both in-plant and
public power generation. In order to expand potentially viable mines, a
well-coordinated Government program is needed to provide a rational price
struacture, improvements in mine safety, credit facilities and support for
marketing and infrastructure. Such a program would need substantial technical
and capital assistance from abroad. The Bank has been providing guidance to
the Government in the preparation of the proposed El Cerrejon and the Railways
Improvement Projects.
1.04      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to stimulate
investment in exploration and field development, which had declined after 1971
because the prices paid to the producers for domestic sales were below economic
value. Currently, the prices paid for oil produced by increasing yields from
existing fields and from new fields have been raised, with the latter now at
world market levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for petroleum has
been eliminated. Moreover, the Government is encouraging foreign participation
in exploration and development on the basis of joint venture contracts with
Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos (ECOPETROL) (the Government oil agency). As a
result, interest among foreign petroleum companies to expand or start operations
in Colombia has been intensified and an upturn in exploration has taken place.
Domestic petroleum product prices have been increased substantially in line with
the Government's objective of reaching international levels over a reasonable
period of time. A Bank petroleum project is being considered for secondary oil
recovery, surveys and follow-up discoveries. With respect to natural gas, a
previous decline in known reserves and output has been reversed with the dis-
covery of large deposii in3the Atlantic Coast region. These reserves (esti-
mated at over 4.5 x 10   ft ) will provide energy and petrochemical feedstock
to this rapidly industrializing region. The Government has under consideration
several projects for natural gas utilization, including a fertilizer plant,
and the production of methanol as a fuel for vehicles. Nevertheless, the
feasibility of such projects has not yet been thoroughly assessed.
1.05      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential and
the Government has contracted with the French Minatome group for such explora-
tion. Uranium possibilities seem to exist in the Zapatoca, Caldas and
Sanltander Departments. This potential would provide the country with another
long-term energy option.  Although the measures taken by the Government to
achieve a domestically based energy balance have already yielded positive
results, the Government recognizes that its planning and policy efforts have
been insufficiently coordinated among the various energy subsectors. To
remedy this, in 1980 the Government initiated a study to evaluate the country's



- 3 -
options in developing domestic energy resources. The study will also focus on
the policy measures that can maximize the benefits to be derived from recommended
investments, based on least-cost solutions. The Bank is working closely with
the Government in this endeavor.
Power Sector Organization
1.06      Since 1970, electricity has been the fastest growing form of energy
used in Colombia (8.2%/a); its share in overall energy consumption grew from
6.5% in 1970 to 8.9% in 1978. This process has been assisted by the gradual
consolidation of isolated facilities into regional systems and the intercon-
nection of these systems to facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost
hydro resources. The main systems are the Central System, covering the
interior and the Pacific coast, and the Atlantic (or Northern) system covering
the northern part of the country. By 1983 a national grid will have been
established with the completion of a 500-kV line interconnecting the Atlantic
and the Central Systems.
1.07      At present, public electricity service is provided by:
(a)  municipally owned companies, independent of the National
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin,
(EPM), and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), and Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA);
(c)  a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
(d)  a generating and transmission company, Interconexion
Electrica S.A. (ISA), the shareholders of which are EEEB,
EPM, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA.
1.08      The Ministry of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly
through ICEL and CORELCA. EEEB and EPM, currently the largest utilities, are
controlled by autonomous municipal governments. CVC reports to the National
Planning Department (NPD). ISA was established in 1968 to provide a rational
framework for sector development by interconnecting the systems of its share-
holders, thus creating a national grid capable of transmmitting large amounts
of power and energy between the regions. By pooling their financial resources
(provided in part by Government contributions for ICEL and CORELCA) through
ISA, its shareholders have been able to share the costs and benefits of the
country's large hydropower resources, which are geographically concentrated
1/   In most cases, the ownership of these subsidiaries is shared with local
governments.

principally in the areas of Bogota (EEEB) and Medellin (EPM). One of the
problems that the sector as a whole faces is the relatively low level of
salaries of the top technical and managerial staff when compared with those
of equivalent positions in the private sector, which has resulted in a
relatively high turnover of senior staff. During negotiations agreement was
reached that the Government will carry out a study on the adequacy of the
structure and levels of the remuneration at all levels of employment in the
power sector. The conclusions and recommendations of this study, which will
be completed by June 30, 1983 will be received by the Bank. ISA and its
shareholders will give all necessary assistance to the Government for carring
out such study.
Regulation, Planning and Coordination
1.09      The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating na-
tional policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity, including coordination and supervision of power sector planning,
although it shares responsibility with NPD in defining investment priorities.
The ministry discharges its functions through its Electric Energy Division
(which is small and does not have the powers for issuance of licenses, regula-
tion of tariffs, or approval of expansion programs to enforce its policies and
programs). Electricity tariffs are regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas
de Servicios Publicos (JNT) which forms part of the NPD. JNT on the basis of
requests from the companies approves rate increases, but utilities are free to
set tariffs at levels lower than those approved by the Junta. Although the
Government cannot enforce its policies directly on the municipally controlled
power companies, a mechanism for reaching agreement on major issues affecting
the sector is provided by ISA, in which the Government has a major although
not controlling interest.
1.1(      Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly in recent
years, as illustrated by the following:
(a)  ISA defines the generation and transmission expansion program
for the interconnected system. On the basis of studies carried
out by it and its shareholders, ISA determines the least-cost
expansion program. After approval by its Board and NPD, this
becomes the national expansion program. ISA's bylaws specify
that all plants requiring a joint effort of all its
shareholders will be constructed, owned and operated by ISA.
Plants of regional interest may be built by one or several
shareholders, subject to ISA's approval. Under these
arrangements, ISA is, in effect, responsible for an important
part of sector regulation and planning.
(b)  In connection with the San Carlos I loan, ISA and its
shareholders agreed to prepare and present to the Governmnt
and the Bank for comments a Power Sector Development Master
Plan, which has been received and reviewed by the Bank. This
plan covers the period 1980-90 in detail and 1991-2000 in
general terms and consolidates the programs for generation and
transmission expansion. Similarly, ISA's shareholders
undertook, under the coordination of the Ministry of Mines and
Energy, to prepare and present, as part of ISA's Master Plan,
to the Government and the Bank for comments by December 1981,



-5-
a 20 year Sector Development Master Plan for Distribution;
consolidating all existing and future programs for distribution
and covering the period 1982-87 in detail. 1/ Overall, the Master
Plan is expected to provide a valuable framework for long-range
decisions on sector-financing, pricing and rural electrification
which have in the past been based on partial and uncoordinated
information;
(c)  as agreed under the San Carlos I loan, a tariff study based on
marginal costing has been completed and received in the Bank.
The study is an important step towards the understanding of
electric power tariffs in Colombia and is the result of a
commendable effort made by ISA and its shareholders. The Bank
has given its comments to ISA and a Bank mission has been
scheduled to discuss what next step should be taken;
(d)  also in connection with San Carlos I, a study was carried out
by consultants to assess the extent and causes of excesive
losses in the main power systems down to the level of
distribution to recommend actions to minimize such losses.
The Bank reviewed this study, and recommended that an action
committee be set up, representing all the shareholders, to
prepare a work program. A second phase of the study, which
deals with metering errors, is underway; and
(e)  as agreed under the San Carlos II loan, a study on a uniform
system of accounts and financial planning for the sector is
underway by consultants, with participation of professional
from ISA and its shareholders. The results of this study are
expected by June 30, 1981.
Present Developments
1.11      Considering the power sector's important role in Colombia's develop-
ment process, the Government and the main power companies established in the
mid-1970s the "Sochagota" Agreement, for orderly and efficient sector expansion.
The Agreement envisaged that ISA would be responsible for planning, building
and owning all plants of national interest. Since then, ISA has functioned on
this basis. However, in 1979, the shareholders of ISA expressed reservations
about the concentration of almost 70% of planned expansion in generating
facilities through 1987 in the national company and the associated loss of
parity among themselves in relative generating capacity. Another matter of
concern was that ISA's construction capacity would be nearly fully committed
over the next few years with works in progress (1,910 MW of hydro plant,
1/   The Government has delegated management of the study to ISA.  CVC
has completed a draft report, but no information has reached the Bank
from ICEL. CORELCA is expected to have a draft report available soon.
EPM has a distribution program covering 10 years, which was defined in
cooperation with Westinghouse; this study will be expanded to cover the
period up to the year 2000 with the help of consultants. EEEB will
have the study executed by the same consultants to be engaged under the
recently signed loan 1807-CO.



6
numierous 230-kV lines and a 500-kV line). These reservations gave rise to
a proposal that the four plants in ISA-s 1984-88 Investment Program (Betania
500 MW, Guavio 1,000 MW, Playas 200 MW and Urra 1,050 MW) be constructed,
owned and operated by individual shareholders. Although these plants would
represent less than 1% of the hydroelectric resources that Colombia will
develop over the next 20 to 30 years, the Government and the Bank felt that a
sound pattern of development and use of the country's electric energy resources
shotuld be maintained. In accordance with this, the Government and ISA-s Board
have confirmed that:
(a) as a long-term objective, ISA will own and have direct ownership
of at least 33% of overall sector capacity and energy. To this
end, plant ownership under the expansion program subsequent to
the current 1984-88 Program (discussed below) will be allocated to
ensure that ISA will have this share. Moreover, ISA will acquire
and maintain ownership of all trunk transmission lines in the
interconnected.system. These arrangements will assure ISA a
predominant role in directing sector development and operation,
while avoiding problems attendant upon overconcentration of sector
responsibilities in ISA;
(b) with respect to ownership of four hydro facilities in the 1984-88
Program, individual ISA shareholders would, subject to presentation
of viable financing plans, build and own the Guavio (1,000 MW),
Betania (500 NW) and Playas (200 MW) plants. 1/ The two Urra plants
(310 MW and 740 MW respectively) would be owned jointly by CORELCA
and ISA. On this basis, ISA-s direct control of the interconnected
system (currently about 20%) would increase to about 30% by 1988.
As stated above, the policy of 33% ownership will determine the
allocation among ISA and its shareholders of plants to be selected
for the 1989-93 Expansion Program and subsequent ones;
(c) further, ISA will invest in the Guavio and Betania plants in exchange
for absolute rights to 40% of the capacity and energy of the former
and 50% of the latter, which ISA will sell to its shareholders
under long-term contracts. These rights to plant output represent
an additional 6% of the national system, thus bringing ISA's overall
participation (direct ownership plus sharing in Guavio and Betania
investments) in the sector's generating capacity to 35% by 1988; and
(d) ISA, as the future national dispatch agency (facilities are being
constructed), will operate the interconnected system at minimum
cost. This objective has been fully endorsed by ISA-s Board; the
means by which it would be achieved would be based upon the results
of a dispatch study (under San Carlos II) scheduled for completion
by end-1981.
1/   The proposed Bank loan for Playas was approved by the Board on March 3,
1981.



1.12       Another matter which has been under discussion has been the growth
in overdue accounts owed to ISA by its shareholders (except EPM) for capital
contributions and energy purchases. The Government and the sector took
actions designed to overcome this problem; by the end of 1980 CVC and CORELCA
were up-to-date, and measures are well in hand to erase EEEB's remaining
arrears (for capital contributions) by end-April 1981. The capital contribu-
tions of ICEL (a holding company for 13 mostly rural-based local power companies,
"electrificadoras", which are normally paid by the Government, have been
brought up to date, but its electrificadoras' overdue accounts for 1979-1980
energy purchases have not yet been paid (1981 accounts are up-to-date).
The electrificadoras themselves have started taking action to improve their
finances, in order to settle this debt and maintain timely payment of purchases,
with some of them having increased rates by 3.3% per month. Within this
context, the National Economic and Social Policy Council (CONPES) approved
proposals formulated by NPD and ISA's Board, which would eliminate the elec-
trificadoras' arrears. Financing is being provided to free resources to allow
them to settle their overdue accounts to ISA shortly. CONPES has also decided
that a 15% surcharge would be added to the electrificadoras' tariffs (as in the
CORELCA system). Finally CONPES has resolved that national budgetary funds
earmarked for public entities that did not settle their accounts with the power
utilities would not receive the amounts equivalent to their outstanding accounts.
For the long term, however, the Government has realized that the electrificadoras
would need to be grouped into larger market companies to become financially
viable and operationally efficient. In November 1980 CONPES, based upon
recommendations of DNP, approved a number of measures aimed at attaining this,
principally:
(i)  redistribution of markets through mergers of two or more
electrificadoras;
(ii)  restructuring of ICEL's financial and operational aspects; and
(iii)  strengthening ICEL's ability to guide the electrificadoras on
financial and technical matters.
In support, the Bank has been encouraging the Government and the sector to
consider specific institutional arrangements for these small companies. In
response, some ISA shareholders have already begun to buy, or are contemp-
lating buying ownership of electrificadoras in geographic proximity to them.
For example, EEEB has ratified a proposal to obtain, as a first step, a 25%
share of ownership of the Electrificadoras of Cundinamarca and Meta, and EPM
will study the feasibility of acquiring the Electrificadoras of Antioquia and
Choco, and if study results are favorable, the company will proceed with the
acquisition (Playas Hydro Power Project, Loan 1953-CO). It should be recog-
nized, however, that the reorganization will necessarily be achieved only
gradually over a period of years. This effort would be assisted by the
definition of strategy, coordinated at governmental and sectoral levels to
implement the CONPES decision. During negotiations agreement was reached that
the Government will prepare a program for implementing the recommendations of
DNP regarding the structure and operations of ICEL. The program will be put
into effect starting June 30, 1983. ISA and its shareholders will take all
reasonable and appropriate action required on their part for the implementation
of the program.

World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.13      Since 1950, the Bank has made 25 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$979 million (Annex 1.2). In addition, the Bank is currently
supporting rural electrification under the Integrated Rural Development
Project (1532-CO, 1977), and would continue such efforts under the proposed
Village Electrification Project for the North Atlantic Coast.
1.14      Between 1973 and 1978 the Bank was unable to participate in sector
development through lending because of institutional and financial difficul-
ties including severe financial constraints (because of the Government's
reluctance to press for rate increases under inflationary conditions) which
reduced the sector's internal cash generation, well below levels needed for
signiticant expansion of plant facilities. Decisions on system expansion
required protracted negotiations among the shareholders and the Govern-
ment. These negotiations were further complicated by the original share-
holders' reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA. Because
of the time required for resolution of these fundamental issues, the Bank
was unable, until 1978, to proceed with the San Carlos I, the 500-kV Inter-
connection and Mesitas hydroelectric projects, all of them urgently needed to
avoid power rationing in Colombia. Following satisfactory progress in resolv-
ing these problems, seven loans were made, three in 1978 (San Carlos I,
1582-CO; 500-kV Interconnection, 1583-CO; and Mesitas, 1628-CO), one in 1979
(San Carlos II, 1725-CO) two in 1980 (Bogota Distribution, 1807-CO; and
Guadalupe IV Hydro Power Project, 1868-CO) and one in 1981 (Playas Hydro Power
Project, 1953-CO). Nevertheless, the underinvestment during the 1970s has
resulted in substantial power shortfalls. Rationing is currently in effect and
expected to intensify during this year, assuming average hydrological condi-
tions (4.02). The power shortage has also been aggravated by delays in
initiating commercial operation of the Guatape II hydroelectric plant as a
consecquence of difficulties encountered in implementing the population relo-
cation program associated with the project.
1.15      Overall Bank operations through 1970 have been reviewed by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in two reports 1/, which concluded that
Bank financing had been successful in assisting the power companies to develop
hydroelectric plants at lower unit cost than otherwise possible. This per-
mitted greater urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable electricity
supply to industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in the establishment of
the central interconnected system which facilitsted further power sector
development. In addition, OED identified as important considerations for
possible future loans in the sector: the need to give greater attention to
improving power distribution, financial recording and financial planning
capabilities, and tariff structures; these have been addressed under the above
mentioned loans.
1/   "Operations Evaluation Report:  Electric Power" (Report No. Z-17,
dated March 10, 1972) and "Bank Operations in Colombia - An Evaluation"
(Report No. Z-18 dated May 25, 1972).



-9-
1.16      OED additionally reviewed four individual projects 1/.  The most
recent report (575-CO/681-CO), which pertains to ISA, discusses the engineer-
ing, physical, financial and institutional difficulties encountered, particu-
larly in connection with the Chivor Hydro Electric project, ISA's first
generation facility and the largest hydro electric project undertaken in
Colombia until then. The report concluded that the experience gained under
these projects has had a considerable impact on the shaping of Bank policy for
further lending in Colombia. Adequate provisions for price contingencies have
been introduced; local financing is being secured through long-term financial
commitents of the shareholders to ISA; and improved financial planning has
been instituted by ISA and its shareholders, as well as continuous monitoring
of their financial performance.
1.17      Recent developments in the sector indicate that a reasonable
balance between regional and national interest will be maintained, thus
providing a sound basis for continued Bank participation. Further objectives
are, in general: coordinated sector planning, efficient organization and
operation, and sound financial management; within the general scope of these
objectives, specific attention in the short term should be given to: least-
cost operations, stregthening of the operating efficiency and financial
viability of the electrificadoras, rational urban and rural distribution
developments, enhancing financial recording and financial planning capabili-
ties and development of improved tariff structures and levels based on common
concepts throughout the country.

Demand for gross generation and peak capacity are forecast to grow at
average annual rates of 10.2% and 10.3%, respectively, in the priod 1981-1990,
which is reasonable. The system load-factor is expected to remain constant at
61% during the period. The installation of about 6,600 MW is planned between
1981 and 1988 to meet demand (Annex 1.3).
Rural Electrification
1.22      About 32% of the population lives in rural areas.  Even though
access to service is high in urban areas, only an estimated 13% of the rural
population has electricity service. Complete information regarding ongoing and
future rural electrification efforts is not available at present but would be
available upon completion of the Master Plan (1.10).
1.23      Nevertheless, substantial rural electrification programs are currently
underway in a number of regions in the country. Among the most important are:
(a) The ongoing electrification subproject of an Integrated Rural
Development Program (DRI) supported by IDB, Canadian International
Development Agency and Bank financing (Loan 1352-CO) through
which an estimated 15,000 rural families will acquire
electricity service. At present, DRI II is under preparation,
and is expected to cover substantial further areas;
(b) the electrification program in the department of Choco, financed
by the Netherlands Government;
(c) the electrification program in the coffee- growing areas,
financed by coffee sector resources;
(d) an IDB financed rural electrification project for ICEL,
which will provide service to about 130,000 households by
1984, as well as other ICEL projects for similar purposes;
(e) EPM and EEEB programs to extend substransmission and distribu-
tion facilities to rural areas in proximity to their own markets;
and
(f) finally, under a recently approved Bank loan, CORELCA is carrying
out the first phase (1981-1985) of a 15 year village electrification
program covering the North Atlantic region which will, upon program
completion, provide electricity services to agroindustrial and
commercial enterprises and about-215,000 households.
Sector Investment Program
1.24      The total 1981-1990 investment program of ISA and its shareholders
excluding interest during construction, is estimated at about Col$1,519 billion
in current prices (about US$15.4 billion in current prices) with a foreign
component of about 54% (Annex 5.10, Attachment 6 and 7). Some 81% of
currently programmed investments would be for generation, which is extremely
high (a range of some 40-60% would be the norm). Because the new generating
capacity would be of little use without appropriate investments in sub-
transmission and distribution it is probable that the estimated cost of



- 13 -
Col$1,519 billion is understated. The Master Plan for power development being
prepared by ISA and its shareholders would provide a basis for more complete
sector investment estimates (1.10).
1.25      The introduction of large thermal plants later in the century
is expected to play an important role in ISA's planning for the sector in
the next few years (lead time for mine developmnt and power station cons-
truction may aggregate some 10 years). Even the large hydro potential of
some 93 GW (1.01) would be completely utilized by about year 2020 and the
use of the country's large coal reserves in thermoelectric plants may be-
come more economic than hydro before that time. The Government is aware of
this scenario 1/, and the Government agencies involved, together with the
Bank, are addressing it. The use of coal-fired thermal plants and the
substitution of coal for gas and pretroleum would be the primary objectives.
1.26      The generation investment program is imposing a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects are
undertaken, assurances were obtained under the San Carlos loans that, except
for plants in the agreed National Expansion Program, ISA and its shareholders
would not undertake construction of any generating plants of more than 200 MW
(ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders) capacity prior to completion of San Carlos
unless satisfactory evidence has been presented to the Bank that it is eco-
nomically justified and that adequate financing is available to carry it out,
as well as to meet other financial obligations.
Finances and Tariffs
1.27      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments.  EEEB and EPM operate low-cost
systems and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have, there-
fore, been able to finance their investments with an appropriate balance
of borrowings and cash generation while charging relatively low rates.
GVC, previously dependent in part upon Government transfers, has strengthened
its financial position considerably in recent years. Because there has been
no mechanism to obtain financial transfers within the sector from the more
affluent areas to the less affluent ones, ICEL and CORELCA, which operate
high-cost systems in lower income areas than EEEB and EPM, have had to rely
on budgetary contributions from the Government and fuel subsidies. In recent
years, however, the opportunity of sharing in low-cost investments through
ISA has provided an indirect transfer mechanism. In future, the re-structuring
of ICEL and the interconnection of CORELCA with the central system are expected
to strengthen further the sector's overall financial capability.
1.28      Between 1971-1974, rate adjustments lagged considerably behind
yearly inflation. From 1975 onwards the situation began to improve insofar
that rates were adjusted in line with inflation and starting in 1977 rates
have been adjusted to increase them in real terms. This trend is expected

to continue as the result of the agreements reached under the San Carlos I
and II, Mesitas, Bogota Distribution, Guadalupe IV and Playas loans and
current Government policy, which calls for maintaining tariff levels adequate
to provide reasonable contribution to investment requirements. For 1981 this
policy is expected to result in tariff increases in real terms of 20% through-
out the sector.
1.29      The successful long-term execution of Colombia's power development
is contingent not only upon the availability of sufficient cash generation by
the individual entities but also upon domestic and external sources of finan-
cing.  The lag in generation investment during the 1970's together with the
need to accelerate expansion of facilities even further to permit energy sub-
stitution, has resulted in a financial bottleneck that cannot be fully relieved
through tariff action (Annex 5.10).  In recognition of this, during 1980, the
Government reestablished the Electricity Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo
Electrico , FDE) in order to overcome the constraint on investments represented
by the insufficient availability of local commercial financing. This Fund has
been made available to the utilities on the condition that their financial obliga-
tions to ISA are duly attended to. Furthermore, in view of the high priority the
Government attaches to planned power investments, authorization for significant
for-eign borrowings to be monetized was given, even though Government policy
normally precludes this. Moreover, the Government is in the process of estab-
lishing a Permanent Electricity Financing Facility (PEFF) for the sector; funding
for this facility could come from various sources including the Government,
public entities with temporary cash surpluses and public bond issues, although
the specific arrangements are still under study. The Government has confirmed
that the PEFF will be established by January 1, 1982, and that the funds provided
to such facility will be adequate to enable the timely carrying out of the
National Power Expansion Program.
2. THE BORROWER
General Description
2.01      The proposed borrower, Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB),
is an autonomous company owned by the Municipality of the Special District of
Bogota. It was established by private Colombian interests and has operated the
city's electric service for the past 80 years, since 1951 under municipal
ownership. It has an installed capacity of 719 MW, 582 MW of which is hydro
and the balance coal-fired thermal. It served about 580,000 subscribers at
the beginning of 1981.
Prior Bank Lending
2.02      The Bank has made five loans totalling US$256.6 to EEEB:  246-CO in
January 1960, 313-CO in May 1962, 537-CO in June 1968, 1628-CO in November 1978,
and 1807-CO in March 1980. The first two loans helped finance 304 MW of hydro
and thermal generating plant additions, including the Sesquile Dam for the
Guatavita Reservoir, and transmission and distribution system extensions.
The third loan helped finance the 150 MW El Colegio hydroelectric plant and
associated substations, construction of the 50 MW Canoas hydroelectric plant,



- 15 -
expansion of the transmission and distribution systems, and engineering
services. The fourth loan is helping to finance part of the 1978-82 national
power expansion program including the 600 MW Mesitas hydroelectric facility.
The fifth loan (Bogota Distribution Project), MUS$87.0, will help EEEB improve
and expand the existing Bogota subtransmission and distribution systems. Works
financed by the first three loans were completed successfully although with
delays (of about one year and a half for the first two, and three years for the
third) because of a variety of problems. The disbursements of the fourth loan
began in September 1979 and the construction is progressing generally satis-
factorily although with a delay of 3 to 6 months and some MUS$62 of cost over-
runs due to changes in base prices (actual prices offered were higher than
original cost estimates). Disbursements of the fifth loan are expected to begin
shortly (the loan was signed on February 6, 1981), as soon as the loan is declared
effective.
Organization and Administration
2.03      EEEB is directed and administered by a seven-member Board of Directors
headed by the Mayor of Bogota. Two members are elected by the Municipal Council,
three are chosen by the Council from lists submitted by associations representa-
tive of banks, commerce, and industry in Bogota, and one is chosen by the
President of Colombia. This composition was worked out in connection with the
Bank's initial loan to EEEB (246-CO) and has generally proven to be satisfactory.
2.04      EEEB's management is entrusted to a General Manager (appointed by
the Board) assisted by four Deputy Managers, respectively responsible for
(a) Administration; (b) Commercial and Financial; (c) Technical; and
(d) Operations. There is also a Planning Division which provides support to
the General Manager. The current organization chart is shown in Annex 2.1.
Although EEEB has had a stable and competent management during most of its
association with the Bank, turnover in its senior personnel increased during
1976 to 1978 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of experienced
senior officers. The present financial manager, hired in late 1978, and main
financial staff have shown adequate expertise in handling financial business.
An important step for strengthening of financial management was taken in
January 1979, when EEEB hired Peat, Marwick, Mitchele and Co., Management
Consultants, to carry out a study on managerial, budgetary and accounting
systems and financial planning; the study was completed; the findings were
discussed by EEEB's management and the final recommendations are being imple-
mented. Under the Bogota Distribution loan, EEEB agreed to enhance the
effectiveness of its financial management through: (a) employing two financial
experts; and (b) carrying out periodic training courses for its financial staff.
The experts were hired and the financial staff have attended several courses and
seminars. EEEB has planned further financial training for 1981-1982.
Employment
2.05      EEEB had 2,662 employees at the beginning of 1981, including fiscal
audit personnel of 56, administration personnel of 319, financial personnel
of 479, operations personnel of 1,622 and technical personnel of 186, which
are reasonable proportions of staff assigned to EEEB's various activities.
The company's historical staff growth over the past 12 years in relation to
the number of customers served and energy sold is shown below:

2/   Source:  EEEB.
The total number of EEEB-s employees is projected to grow at an average of
about 6.0% per year. The actual trend of generally improving ratios of the
number of customers per employee and of the annual electricity sales per
employee is expected to continue (Annex 2.2).
Accounting and Auditing
2.06      EEEB's data processing and accounting are satisfactory.  Internal
auditing is carried out by a separate department under a General Auditor
responsible to the Board of Directors and appointed by the Mayor of Bogota.
Independent auditing of EEEB was carried out by external auditors acceptable
to the Bank until 1977, at which time the function was taken over by the
"Contraloria del Distrito Especial de Bogota", the auditing body of the
Municipal Government of Bogota. Although audits performed by such body
were in practice similar to those carried out by private auditing firms the
audit report was signed by the Controller, who is the head of the organization
and usually a political appointee of the incumbent Government administration,
as are the General Manager of EEEB, as well as most of the Board. In order
to guarantee a greater degree of independence between auditor and "auditee"
and to ensure audits in accordance with sound commercial principles, under
loan 1807-CO, EEEB agreed to appoint independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank. EEEB hired in mid-1980, the independent auditor Liborio Cuellar
and Associates, to perform the company's audits starting in fiscal year 1980.
Billing and Collections
2.07      Billing, which covers a bi-monthly cycle for all customers, is
carried out using a computerized processing system. Bills must be paid in
caslh at the various company offices or banks located throughout the city. As
of December 31, 1979, accounts receivable was 22% (about 79 days billing) of
total annual sales, which represents an improvement over performance in
previous years. However, the present estimate for 1980 is 23%, which is
higher than the 18% target covenanted under the Mesitas and Bogota Distribution
loans, due to arrears of some government entity bills. During negotiations
EEEB agreed to reduce them to no more than 21% of annual sales by December 31,
1981; and to no more than 19% in 1982; and 17% in 1983 and thereafter.



- 17
Insurance
2.08      EEEB's assets are not adequately insured.  Under the Bogota Distri-
bution loan the company agreed to execute an insurance study with consultants
satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank reviewed the terms of reference for the
study and EEEB, which is currently evaluating the offers, expects to award the
contract by March 31, 1981. The study would be completed by December 31, 1981,
and implemented starting December 31, 1982 after giving the Bank an opportunity
to review the study and comment on its conclusions and recommendations.
3. EEEB's MARKET
Background
3.01      EEEB's service area includes the District of Bogota--the capital of
Colombia--and the areas of influence of more than 55 municipalities within the
nearby departments of Cundinamarca and Meta in the central zone. Total
population living in EEEB's service area is estimated at about five million
in 1979, or about 20% of Colombia's population in that year.
Market Statistics and Forecast
3.02      EEEB's market statistics and forecasts for the period 1975-1990 are
summarized in the following table and shown in detail for the period 1973-1990
in Annex 3.1:
1975             1980           1985           1990

2/   As a percentage of total requirements.
3.03      The forecast for the period 1981-1990 was prepared by EEEB on the basis
of historical trends and recorded indices for each consumer category for each of
the years from 1973 to 1980. Trend curves were derived to project monthly and
annual requirements which were subsequently adjusted to reflect population growth
trends, sector economic conditions and market saturation effects. Residential
consumption grew at an average annual rate of 11.5% in the period 1974-1980
and it is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 12% in the period



- 18 -
198:1-1990. Also residential consumption augmented its share of the market
from 36% in 1973 to 42% in 1980 as a result of increased urbanization and
access to service, as well as expansion of services to semi-rural areas. This
trend is expected to continue over the next few years and by 1990 residential
consumption would represent about 47% of EEEB's total sales. Commercial
consumption grew at an average annual rate of 9% in the period 1974-1980 and
it -is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 9.8% in the period 1981-1990.
Commercial consumption which represented 17% of sales in the period 1973-1980 is
expected to decrease slightly to 16% in the period 1981-1990. Industrial con-
sumption grew at an average annual rate of 7.9% in the period 1974-1980 and it
is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 9.9% in the period 1981-1990.
The industrial consumption share of the market which decreased from 34% in 1973
to 32% in 1980, is expected to decrease slightly to 29% by 1990. Government and
Public Lighting grew at an average growth rate of 4.6% in the period 1974-1980
and it is expected to grow at an average growth rate of 8.4% in the period 1981-
1990, as a result of public lighting expansions included in the Bogota Distri-
bution project, as well as in other future distribution expansion included in
EEEB's investment program. Government and Public Lighting consumption has shown
a slightly decreasing share of total consumption and is expected to represent
about 8% of total sales by 1990. Other consumption, which includes station use
(mainly pumping for storage) and losses, grew at an average annual growth rate
of 1.4.8% in the period 1974-1980 and is expected to grow at about 8.9% in the
period 1981-1990. Actual losses represented about 22% of total gross genera-
tion requirements in the period 1974-1980. EEEB's historical losses are
relatively large and, as for most Colombian power utilities, may contain a
substantial amount of theft. This problem is presently being studied for the
entire sector (1.10(d)) and remedial action would be implemented as a result of
the study. EEEB expects to reduce such losses gradually to about 15% by 1987,
as a result of the measures to be implemented (Annex 2.2).  In 1979 gross per
capita electricity consumption in Bogota was about 707 kWh (assuming a popula-
tionL of about 5 million for the Bogota area), which is lower than gross per
capita electricity consumption in other large cities in Latin America (Medellin,
about 1,000 kWh; Panama City, more than 810 kWh; Buenos Aires, estimated at more
than 1,400 kWh).
4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      In accordance with the most recent updated study on economic ranking
(prepared by ISA during the second semester of 1980), the least-cost generation
development in the interconnected system would be the following:

- 19 -
4.02      After San Carlos I and II (1,240 MW), the first stage of Guavio
(initial capacity 1,000 MW, final capacity 1,600 MW) would be the second
largest plant in the national system. It would be an integral part of the
Interconnected System and is urgently needed to avoid severe rationing in the
national system in the late 1980s and early 1990s. (At present, power is
being rationed an average of four hours per day in the Central System and this
situation is expected to persist, with various degrees of severity until 1983,
when San Carlos I begins operations). The Government, ISA and its Share-
holders, in consultation with the Bank decided to assign to EEEB the owner-
ship and full responsibility for the construction of the Guavio Hydroelectric
Plant, which would be located close to Bogota in EEEB's area of influence.
The shareholders of ISA will have absolute rights to buy 40% of the capacity
and energy of the plant in exchange for financing 40% of the local cost of the
investment (1.11(c), 4.13).
EEEB's Expansion Program
4.03       In the period 1981-1990 EEEB plans to expand its operations to serve
about 816,000 new customers, with its system reaching a peak demand of 2,532 MW
and gross generation requirements of 13,718 GWh/a by 1990. EEEB's expansion
program for the period 1981-1987 is based on the least-cost generation expan-
sion program updated by ISA in 1980 and on subtransmission and distribution
studies carried out by EEEB, and it has been designed to meet (together with
projected electricity purchases from ISA, based upon EEEB's acquired rights
to buy part of ISA's plant output) gross generation requirements in the EEEB
system and to connect the new consumers in the period. Capacity and energy
balances for the EEEB system are shown in Annexes 4.1 and 4.2. As of December
1980, EEEB's expansion program for the period 1981-1987 comprised the following
projects:
Generation
(a) purchase from ISA of the Zipaquira IV thermal plant (Termozipa IV)
which is to be completed in 1981;
(b) completion of the Mesitas hydroelectric facility in 1982;
(c) purchase from ISA of the Zipaquira V thermal plant (Termozipa V)
which would be completed by 1983;
(d) completion of the Sesquile pump-station expansion in 1984;
(e) completion of the Sesquile dam reinforcement in 1985;
(f) raising of the Muna Dam height (initiation of construction in
1982 and completion in 1985);
(g) construction of the first stage (1,000 MW) of the Guavio
hydroelectric plant (initiation of construction in 1981 and
commissioning in 1987);
Transmission
(h) completion of the transmission components associated with the
Mesitas hydroelectric facility (about 100 km of 230-kV lines)
in 1983;



- 20 -
(i) transmission components associated with the Guavio hydroelectric
plant including about 200 km of double-circuit 230-kV transmission
lines, the step-up substation at Guavio and four 230-kV bays at the
Circo and Tunal substations in the future 230-kV Bogota Ring
(initiation of construction in 1984 and commissioning in 1987);
Subtransmission and Distribution
(j) completion of ongoing works in 1981;
(k) completion of the Bogota Distribution Project (Loan 1807-CO)
in 1984;
(1) a substransmission and distribution program (1985-1987);
(m) completion of the rural electrification program 1980-1985;
(n) part of a substransmission and distribution expansion program for
the period 1987-1990;
(o) part of a rural electrification program for the period 1986-1990;
Other Investments
(p) construction of a regional load-dispatch and telecommunications
center (initiation of construction in 1982 and commissioning in
1985);
(q) construction of a maintenance shop (initiation of construction
in 1983 and completion in 1985);
(r) completion of the EEEB's new Headquarters Building in 1982;
(s) completion of construction of the Data Processing Center in 1985;
(t) general plant in the period 1981-1987; and
(u) studies and training.
4.04      The cost of the above 1981-1987 expansion program (Annex 4.3) excluding
interest during construction is estimated at about Col$203.8 billion in current
prices equivalent to about US$2,362 million in current prices. The foreign
cost of the program would be about Col$95.6 billion or 47% (equivalent to about
US$1,141 million), and the local cost Col$108.2 billion or 53% (equivalent
to about US$1,221 million) (5.09 and 5.10).
The ]'roject
4.05      EEEB's market expanded rapidly in the seventies.  However, the
company did not expand its generating facilities rapidly enough to keep pace
with demand. In 1977 EEEB initiated the construction of the El Paraiso and



- 21 -
La Guaca hydroelectric plants (total capacity 600 MW) for the Mesitas project
(under Loan 1628-CO), which would be completed in 1983. However this addi-
tional capacity will not allow EEEB to meet incremental demand beyond 1986,
even taking into account possible purchases from the interconnected system
(Annexes 4.1 and 4.2).
4.06      The proposed project aims at (i) providing new capacity and energy
needed by EEEB and the rest of the National System to meet forecast demand;
(ii) assisting EEEB to participate with the other ISA partners in the least-
cost operation of the National System, as well as to improve its own efficiency;
(iii) assisting EEEB in improving its maintenance practices through studies
and a training program for its technical staff; (iv) encouraging adequate
environmental protection in the project area; (v) assisting EEEB in the
execution of the studies required to complete the assessment of the environ-
mental impact of the Guavio hydroelectric plant; and (vi) promoting Govern-
ment efforts to improve overall sector organization and to ensure sufficient
access to local financing needed for the National Power Expansion Program.
Project Description
4.07      The proposed project would comprise:
(i)  The Guavio hydroelectric p ant will be constructed on the Guavio
river with a 950 million m useful capacity r servoir. The annual
average flow into the reservoir would be 72 m /s.  The p ant,
designed for a gross head of 1,100 m and a flow of 176 m /s would
have an initial capacity of 1,000 MW (5 units of 200 MW each) and
a final capacity of 1,600 MW (addition of 3 units of 200 MW each
by the end of the century). The average annual generation for the
first stage would be about 7,500 GWh in average-hydrology years
and about 5,350 GWh in dry years. The annual generation would
increase marginally in the second stage. The plant would include:
(a) river diversion, rockfill dam (with impervious core) and
spillway tunnels;
(b)  intakes and diversion tunnels (about 4 km) to conduct waters
of the Chivor and Batatas Rivers into the Guavio reservoir;
(c)  pressure tunnel (about 15 km), underground power house and
transformer caverns with access tunnel (about 2 km), and
tailrace tunnel (about 5 km);
(d) five generating units of 200 MW each to be located in the
underground power house;
(e) ancillary electromechanical equipment for the power house;
(f) a step-up substation, at Guavio, including five single-phase
transformer banks (to be located in an underground cavern
parallel to the main cavern) and a 230-kV outdoor switching

Project Cost
4.08      The bids for the two main civil-works contracts, which were received
shortly after the completion of the combined IBRD/IDB appraisal mission in
Deceimber 1980, 1/ showed average prices significantly lower than the originally
estimated costs and, consequently, EEEB and INGETEC updated the project cost
estimate (Annex 4.4). The project cost in current prices (which is summarized
in the table below) excluding interest during construction, is estimated at
about US$1,053 million of which the total foreign cost would be about US$678
million or 64% of the total cost. Interest during construction is estimated
at about US$250 million. Total financing requirements for the project amount
to about US$1,303 million, of which US$928 million represents the foreign
component.
1/   Procurement procedures have been in accordance with Bank and IDB guidelines.

4.09      All base prices are as of December 1980.  The aggregate cost of
engineering design, supervision and administration of the project represents
about 6% of the total project cost excluding interest during construction,
which is reasonable. Physical contingencies adopted are 15% for the dam and
associated works, 20% for the underground works and for the load-dispatch
center, 10% for the transmission component, and 10% for consulting services and
the training program. Price contingencies were calculated assuming that local
inflation varies from 25% in 1981 to 14% in 1990 and foreign inflation from
9.0 in 1981 to 6% in 1990. The average exchange rate was assumed to increase
from, 47.30 Col$/US$ in 1980 to 125.05 Col$/US$ in 1988.
Project Financing
4.10      A detailed financing plan is set out in Annex 4.5.  In brief,
local currency requirements would be provided by EEEB (about US$255 million,
or 60% of the local cost) and ISA (about US$150 million, 40% of the local
cost). The foreign exchange cost would be financed as follows:
Amount              % of Foreign                  % of
(In Millions of US$)   Exchange Requirements   Total Requirements
Commercial Banks        340                      36.6                     26.1
Suppliers               129                      13.9                      9.9
1DB                     100                      10.8                      7.7
World Bank               359                     38.7                     27.5
Total                   928                     100.0                     71.2
Based upon extensive discussions with other external sources of finance, the
above represents the outer limit of cofinancing likely to be forthcoming,
taking account of EEEB's total borrowing program over the period. However,
a sine qua non for the high level of cofinancing projected would be EEEB's
maintaining tariffs high enough to ensure sound finances. EEEB's first venture
in the capital market was in 1975 with a US$7.5 million loan from the First
National City Bank. Since then, it contracted three additional external loans
totalling US$93.9 million equivalent and is working on a further one for US$35
million. Between 1981-1987, EEEB will need to mobilize about US$285 million
in external financing for its investment program over and above the cofinancing
of the proposed project of US$340 million (5.11). Commercial banks/suppliers
would finance 50.5% of the foreign exchange needs or 36% of the total project
requirements, while IDB and the Bank combined, 49.5% of the foreign exchange
needs or 35.2% of the total requirements for the project. The proposed Bank
loan, would finance 27.5% of the total project requirements.

4.11      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against:
Amount Financed
100% of the foreign cost of:                                       (US$ million)

intake and initial part of the pressure tunnel,
and intakes and diversion tunnels for the Chivor
and Batatas rivers                                           255.0

Total              359.0
4.12      The proposed US$100 million IDB loan would finance about 51% of
the foreign cost of the underground waterways, underground caverns and
access tunnel.
4.13      Suppliers' credits totalling about US$129 million would finance 85%
of the foreign cost of the main generating equipment, power transformers and
230-kY power cables, and of the 230-kV substation and transmission lines
for the project. EEEB's own cash generation is expected to finance some
US$225 million. The other ISA shareholders would contribute about US$150
million equivalent to cover 40% of the local cost of Guavio (4.02).
4.14      The Bank would assist EEEB in arranging the cofinancing by external
commercial banks of the remaining US$340 million. An IDB proposal to assist
with the co-financing of US$96 million (to finance the remaining 49% of
the foreign cost of the underground waterways and caverns and access tunnel)
was declined by the Government (IDB cofinancing requires Government guarantee,
which is incompatible with Government policy not to guarantee commercial loans
to decentralized agencies, in order to encourage prudent financial management).



- 26 -
Engineering
4.15      The final feasibility study for the Guavio project, dated June 1978,
is available in the Bank. The Guavio hydro facilities have been designed by
INGETEC, one of the largest, most experienced and capable Colombian consulting
firms. The final feasibility report takes account of possible alternatives
(dam location and height, capacities, etc.). The Bank engaged a geologist
consultant, Dr. Merritt (USA), who visited Colombia in September 1979 and
reported favorably on project design and preparation. Pre-qualification
documents for the main civil works were issued in January 1980, bidding
docurnents by mid-1980 and the offers received in December 1980. EEEB has
retained INGETEC to assist in the preparation of designs and bidding documents
for the transmission system and for the acquisition of the main generating
equipment, power transformers, and ancillary electric and mechanical equipment
for Guavio, and to continue assisting in the design aspects until completion
of the project. Supervision during construction would be carried out by other
consulting firms, because the fiscal code for the District of Bogota proscribes
using the same consultants for design and supervision. This regulation is
being observed with good results in the Mesitas project financed by the
Bank (Loan 1628-CO). Detailed engineering design, and supervision during
construction are estimated to require 16,750 and 15,300 man-months of con-
sulting services and have costs of about US$32.3 million and US$24.1 million
in 1980 prices, respectively. The corresponding average man-month costs
would be about US$1,900 and US$1,500 in 1980 prices. These costs, which
are estimated by INGETEC on the basis of experience with recent projects,
are reasonable 1/.
4.16      The consulting services for the study to determine the final
characteristics, preliminary designs and final cost estimate for EEEB's
load--dispatch center are being financed under Loan 1807-CO. EEEB hired the
consulting firm Systems Control-Sistecom under satisfactory terms of reference.
As agreed under Loan 1807-CO, the study, which is expected to be completed by
the end of 1981, would be sent to the Bank together with EEEB's proposals for
its iimplementation, for review and comments. In the meantime, preliminary
cost estimates and construction schedule for this item were prepared by EEEB
on the basis of bids received for ISA's National Dispatch Center and
for EPM's satellite load-dispatch center (in both cases the studies were
also carried out by Systems Control-Sistecom), and are reasonable.
4.17      Engineering services for supervision during construction of EEEB's
load--dispatch center is estimated to require about 50 man-months of foreign
consulting services and 300 man-months of local consulting services and
have a total estimated cost of US$1.2 million. The corresponding average
man-month costs would be about US$12,000 (ranging between US$10,000 and
15,000) and US$1,900 respectively.
1/   Both figures represent average billing per man-month in 1980 prices and
reflect charges for services provided by professional staff, technicians,
non-professional staff, overheads and fee.



- 27 -
Studies
4.18      A   study will be carried out to assess the improvements needed in
EEEB's present operation and maintenance planning and practices in generating
plants. The study will also recommend the necessary training required by
EEEB's staff in charge of operation and maintenance of generating plants. The
consultants for this study, which is estimated to cost about US$0.3 million
(foreign cost US$0.1 million) will be engaged by EEEB under terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank by June 30, 1982. The study will require some
30 man-month of consulting services. The average man-month cost will be about
US$10,000. The study will be completed by April 30, 1983 and sent to the Bank
for comments before starting its implementation by October 31, 1983.
4.19      Consulting services will also be engaged for the studies needed to
complete the analysis of the environmental impact of the project, by December
31, 1981. The studies will be completed by December 31, 1982 (4.29), and
their recommendations will be implemented starting June 30, 1983. The cost of
this study has been preliminarily estimated at US$0.6 million in current
prices (foreign cost US$0.2 million). The study will require about 60 man-
months of which 20 will correspond to foreign consultants. The average
foreign man-month cost will be about US$10,000. The studies are expected to
be completed not later than December 31, 1982.
Training
4.20      A training program will enhance the skills of operation and mainte-
nance personnel for EEEB's generating plants. This training program will be
designed taking into account the recommendations of the operation and mainte-
nance study (4.18). The cost of such program, which will be completed by
April 30, 1985, has been preliminarily estimated at US$0.4 million in current
prices (foreign cost US$0.2 million).
4.21      Training will also be provided to EEEB's staff for the operation of
its proposed load-dispatch   center.  This program will be provided by the
load-dispatch center supplier and its terms and conditions will be discussed
between EEEB and the Bank together with the bidding documents for the load-
dispatch center. This program is estimated to cost about US$1.1 million in
current prices (foreign cost about US$0.9 million.
Project Organization and Implementation
4.22      The Guavio hydroelectric plant, the 230-kV transmission system,
and the EEEB's load dispatch center will be constructed by contractors under
the supervision of consultants. Construction is expected to start in
May 1981. The project which would take some 7 years to construct, would
be completed late in 1987. A detailed project implementation schedule is
included in Annex 4.6.



- 28 -
4.23      EEEB, which is responsible for coordinating the implementation
of the project, has created to this effect a Project Management Unit (PMU).
The nineteen remaining staff positions of the twenty-five required by the PMU
have been recently approved by EEEB's Board. So far, six posts had been
staffed. During negotiations EEEB confirmed that experienced staff and
experts will be appointed in line with project requirements.
4.24      EEEB received by the end of January from Instituto Agustin Codazzi
the list and estimated values of lands to be purchased for construction of
the access roads, and EEEB is now progressing satisfactorily in acquiring it.
Since only some 250 scattered families live in the entire project area, EEEB
will simply purchase the land; resettlement would not be necessary. EEEB is
seekirng a firm support from both the local and regional governments, to
facilitate timely acquisition. By June 1981, EEEB expects to obtain all the
land for the access roads and main work areas of the project; if delays would
be encountered, project start-up would have to be delayed.
Procurement
4.25      All project items to be financed by the Bank will be procured
under international competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. EEEB has requested a margin of preference in accordance with Bank
guidelines for goods manufactured in Colombia; such expenditures would
not exceed an estimated US$6 million. The IDB-financed project items would
be procured in accordance with IDB guidelines. For those items to be financed
under suppliers' credits, EEEB would also use ICB. All consultants services
will be obtained under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Advanced Contracting and Retroactive Financing
4.26      Bids for the main civil works contracts, the foreign exchange for
which would be financed by the Bank and IDB, were opened on 12/12/80 (4.08)
and EEEB awarded the two contracts in April 1981 to permit commencement of
the works not later than May 1981. Contract signing and initial expenditures
would then take place before Board presentation of the Bank loan. Considering
that these contracts include the construction of access roads, the rather long
period of execution of the project (about 7 years), the shortage of generation
capacity existing in Colombia, and the large project cost increases, as well
as the adverse impact on the economy, which would result as a consequence of
any delays in the completion of the project, the Bank did not object to the
advanced contracting of the main civil works by EEEB. However, EEEB has been
advised on the risks of advanced contracting in the event the Bank loan is not
made or is delayed. Retroactive financing would be required for the down
payments for the dam and civil-works contracts including access roads,
as of January 1, 1981. In the aggregate, retroactive financing would not
exceed some US$36 million, equivalent to 10% of the proposed Bank loan.



- 29 -
Disbursement
4.27       Disbursements from the loan account will be fully documented and
would be made for:
(a) 66% of total expenditures for the civil works contract including
the river diversion, dam, spillway tunnels and associated works,
which is estimated to represent the foreign cost of such item;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of the ex-factory cost
of ancillary electro-mechanical equipment for the powerhouse
(which is not suitable for suppliers' credits);
(c) 100% of the foreign cost of the load-dispatch and telecommunication
center and associated design consulting services; and 100% of
the foreign cost of consulting services for the studies and training
included in the project; and
(d) 50% of the total expenditures for consulting services for
engineering design and supervision for the Guavio hydroelectric
plant including the associated transmission system, and for
supervision during construction of EEEB's load-dispatch and
telecommunication center.
4.28       Annex 4.7 shows the estimated disbursements from the proposed Bank
loan. The closing date of the proposed loan will be May 30, 1988, six months
after completion of the project in November 30, 1987.
Environment
4.29       A preliminary comprehensive environmental reconnaissance on the
project was received in the Bank before negotiations. This report identified
the priority aspects which will be studied in detail under the Final Environ-
mental Study to be partially financed by the Bank (4.19). During negotiations
agreement was reached that the conclusions and recommendations of the study
will be discussed with the Bank before starting their implementation by
June 30, 1983.
Project Risks
4.30        The execution of the project does not involve any major risks other
than those normally associated with the construction of large dams and under-
ground works. INGETEC, the firm responsible for project design is one of the
most experienced and capable Colombian consulting firms and all appropriate
precautions have been provided for. The fact that supervision during
construction would be carried out by a different consulting firm does not
involve any risks because such procedure has given good results in previous
projects (4.11). EEEB has experience in managing and coordinating large
projects. Assuming that the necessary land would be acquired in a timely
manner (4.24) and that the PMU would be appropriately staffed (4.23), the
project is expected to be carried out as scheduled.

5. FINANCE
Suimary
5.01      Over its 20-year relationship with the Bank, EEEB has maintained a
sound financial position. However, EEEB's 1979-1980 financial situation
has been unusually difficult, as a consequence of three factors. First, over
the last five years there has been a trend for operating costs to rise at a
faster pace than tariffs, despite substantial tariff adjustments in real terms.
The two other circumstances, beyond the company's control, have been delays in
receiving authorization for requested tariff increases in 1980 and, insufficient
availability of local financing in the same year. The extra-fiscal measures
taken in conjunction with Bank-financed projects, including revaluation of
assets, for monitoring financial performance, have considerably strengthened
EEEB's financial structure. EEEB's 1981-1987 investment program including
its own construction program, investments in ISA, interest during construction
and requirements for working capital, amounts to MCol$327,081, of which
MCol$88,845 or 27.2% correspond to the proposed Guavio project. EEEB's net
internal cash generation would finance MCol$152,266 or 46.5% of the total re-
quirements of the 1981-1987 program; ISA's contributions for Guavio would fund
MCol$12,650 or 3.9% of the total; and the remaining 49.6% would be covered by
loans amounting to MCol$162,165. The present financial projections are based
on EEEB's plan of tariff increases and on external and domestic inflation
assumptions. Net operating income with the above plan is expected to produce
annual rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 15.3% in 1981 to
20.5% in 1988 and the company is expected to maintain an adequate financial
position throughout the projection period.
Earnings History
5.02      Over its 20-year relationship with the Bank, EEEB has maintained
a sound financial position. During the period 1969-1978 its internal cash
generation provided more than 50% of annual investments on average,
including substantial contributions to ISA. This may be attributed in
part to the high density of its market and low-cost facilities, given
the area's geographic advantages for hydro generation. The balance of
the company's investment funds has been obtained through borrowings,
generally at reasonable cost; no Government funding has been required.
5.03      EEEB's 1979/1980 financial situation has been unusually difficult.
This is a consequence of the tariff/operating cost trend of the last five
year period and of two other developments in 1980, beyond the company's
control: delays in obtaining authorization for timely tariff increases
and very recently, lack of local financing. The tariff increases have
not been sufficient to offset the increasing operating costs: EEEB's
tariff has increased rapidly in current USO (from 1.2 per kWh in 1976 to
approximately 2.7 in 1979 --3.1 USJ/kWh is estimated for 1980--) and it
has also increased in real terms, 1/ 43% in the 1976-1980 period, under a
1/   Deflated on the basis of the Colombian blue collar consumer price index.

program of fixad monthly increases. 1/ However, mainly because of the
growing participation of the energy purchased from ISA in EEEB's total
energy sold, during that period, operating costs have increased at a
faster pace than tariffs, as shown below (in real prices indexes):

Operating costs            100      137       146       144
This has resulted in an estimated foregone income (assuming tariff in-
creases similar to operating costs increases) aggregating MCol$1,070 in
end- 1980 prices, approximately equivalent to EEEB's arrears to ISA as
of December 31, 1980. Furthermore, during 1980, the local authorities
were reluctant to support in full the tariff increase request of EEEB's
management due to the considerable increments in charges for other
public services in the city of Bogota, combined with inflationary
pressures and a slackening of economic activity. These facts did not
cause any serious constraint to EEEB finances until mid-1980, when
financial difficulties began to slow down the normal flow of its
construction program and delay the payments to ISA (capital contributions
and energy bills). In addition, the limited availability of domestic
financing brought about, during 1980, shortfalls in planned local
borrowing. National monetary policies aimed at dampening inflation
severely constrained the domestic banking system. By mid-1980 the
Government realized the impact of these policies on urgently needed
power sector expansion, and reactivated the Electricity Development Fund
(FDE), as an interim measure until long-term local financing arrangements
could be established. However, it was not until late in the year that
EEEB was able to obtain disbursements from FDE.
5.04      The 12% adjusted average rate of return covenant under the Bogota
Distribution project (Loan 1807-CO) for the years 1979 and 1980 exceeds
the actual rates of return for those years, 8.2% and 9.2% (estimated),
respectively, and the estimated 1980 adjusted average was 5.5% (in accor-
dance with the existing agreements for calculating the rate of return,
1979 shortfall has been carried forward to 1980 operating income). Never-
theless, at end of 1979, EEEB's debt/equity ratio was 34/66, calculated
on the basis of revalued assets, and the debt service coverage was 1.7.
The company's working capital has been adequate in recent years; the
current ratio has exceeded 1.4 since 1974 and reached 2.0 in 1978. Although
accounts receivable as a percentage of annual sales had grown to 27% by
the end of 1976, they decreased to 22% in 1979, which is somewhat higher
than the 19% target agreed for that year under the Mesitas and Bogota
Distribution loans (2.07).
1/   The present one year program (July 1980-June 1981) consists of an 8%
flat increase (implemented in July 1980) and monthly average increases
of 2.3%.  (5.06).

Rate Base
5.05      For public accounting purposes, Colombia's public utility regu-
latory law has not allowed full revaluation of fixed assets but only
revaluation to match the revaluation of outstanding foreign debt for
changes in exchange rates 1/. To reflect the international and domestic
inflation, an agreed fixed value of EEEB's assets and accumulated depre-
ciation was assumed as of December 31, 1976 and, starting from this date, EEEB
revalues its assets quarterly by the Colombian blue collar cost of living
index for the Bank's purpose of monitoring its financial performance. Under
the Mesitas and Bogota Distribution Projects, EEEB agreed to commission
a consultant's study to establish the value of its assets. The study was
to be completed and made available to the Bank by March 31, 1981, to discuss
the advisability of revising the gross and net value of assets, the valuation
methodology and the rate of return requirement. However, it took longer than
expected to select consultants (Gilbert and Associates in consortium with
Salgado Melendez) who were hired at the end of 1980. Because there is no
urgency attached to revising the asset value, the Bank has extended the above
dates as follows: by December 31, 1981, the study would be completed and
submitted to the Bank for comments and by March 31, 1982 discussion with the
Bank on the findings would take place.
Tariff Structure
5.06      Although EEEB's average rate has improved significantly and is
expected to continue to improve (5.03, 5.11), its tariff structure lacks
appropriate balance among major categories of consumers. Under the Bogota
Distribution Project, EEEB agreed to prepare by April 30, 1980 and put
into effect by June 30, 1980, a program satisfactory to the Bank to correct
the tariff structure, taking into account the conclusions of the ongoing
country-wide tariff study referred to in Sections 5.10 of Loans 1582-CO
1725-CO. The purpose of the program is to revise gradually the structure
of EEEB's tariffs and rates such that, for each category of consumers
(residential, industrial, commercial and governmental) the aggregate tariffs
and rates charged to the category, as a whole, will cover approximately the
cost of the service received by each category. The revision will also take
into account the income redistribution policies of the Government benefitting
the lowest-income consumers. Also, EEEB agreed to implement such program
by June 30, 1980. Because the completion of the country-wide study was
delayed, and taking into account the possibility that the study would be
further delayed (1.10 (c)), EEEB agreed to implement an interim program
of adjustments, with the aim of bringing the average residential tariff
to parity with the average industrial tariff over the period ending no
later than October 1, 1982. However, when the tariff study becomes
1/   The Office of the Comptroller General of Colombia has recently pres-
cribed by Resolution No. 8345 of July 30, 1980 that commissions shall
be set up in public entities to identify a more realistic procedure
for asset revaluation.

available, the interim program is to be superseded by one based on the
findings of the study. An important step toward the agreed objective
was taken in July 1980, with the 1980-1981 program of tariff increases
authorized by JNT and implemented by EEEB. The features of the program
are:

Financial Structure
5.07      As a result of the extra-fiscal measures taken under the
San Carlos and Mesitas loans, including revaluation of assets for
monitoring financial performance, EEEB's financial structure has been
strengthened. As of December 31, 1979, EEEB's capitalization was:

first four loans from the Bank amounted to MCol$2,986 (56% of total long-
term debt). The second largest creditor is the IDB with MCol$1,066 (20%
of total long-term debt), followed by two private banks: The Merban Corp.
MCol$352 (7%) and First National City Bank MCol$90 (2%) (Annex 5.5.)
The pension and other liability reserves (noncurrent and contingent
liabilities) are estimated at MCol$1,108.

Investment and Financing Plans
5.09      EEEB's 1981-1987 investment program including its own construction
program (4.03), investments in ISA, interest during construction and re-
quirements for working capital, amounts to MCol$327,081, of which MCol$88,845
or 27.2% correspond to the proposed Guavio project; the ongoing works, which
comprise mainly, the Mesitas and Bogota Distribution projects partially
financed by Loans 1628-CO and 1708-CO, amount to MCol$34,125 or 10.4% of
the total; other future construction, mainly including the purchase of
Tennozipa IV and V from ISA, and urban and rural distribution projects, calls
for an investment of MCol$80,887 or 24.7% of the total. Capital and bond
contributions to to ISA amount to MCol$62,845 or 19.2% of the total, and
the working capital requirements to MCol$15,024 or 4.6% of the total. The
investment program and financing plan is summarized on the next page and shown
in detail in Annex 5.
5.10      EEEB's net internal cash generation would finance MCol$152,266
or 46.5% of the total requirements of the 1981-1987 program; ISA's contri-
butions for Guavio would fund MCol$12,650 or 3.9% of the total; and the
remaining 49.6% would be covered by loans amounting to MCol$162,165. Of
this figure MCol$14,976 comes from undisbursed proceeds of existing loans,
including MCol$11,678 from the 1628-CO and 1708-CO loans. The Guavio project
would require the following loans: (a) the proposed loan: MCol$29,555; (b)
a proposed IDB loan: MCol$6,914; (c) cofinancing loans: MCol$32,438; and
(d) suppliers credits: MCol$12,366. Other future loans would be required
for the rest of the program 1981-1987: (a) MCol$26,461 from international
financing institutions, commercial banks and suppliers; (b) MCol$11,355
froma ISA 1/ for financing the purchase of Termozipa IV and V; and (c)
MCoL$28,100 from both the PEFF (5.13), which is currently being set up by the
Government, and local commercial banks. Assuming adequate tariff levels are
maintained, it is reasonable to expect that EEEB will be able, with major
efforts on its part and Bank assistance, to obtain the financing estimated
above in view of its present financial position, its planned tariff increases,
Government support and the interest shown by commercial external lenders in
projects supported by the Bank. As an indication of availability of adequate
domestic financing, EEEB has provided the Bank, prior to negotiations, with a
satisfactory plan to finance its 1981 construction program. The effectiveness
of the proposed loan would be conditional upon receiving evidence that
satisfactory arrangements have been made for the financing the balance of
EEEB's Investment Program requirements for the period 1982-1983.

5.11      EEEB would generate sufficient internal cash which, together with
ISA's contribution and planned borrowings, would enable timely carrying out
of the proposed project, as well as the balance of EEEB's 1981-1987 invest-
ment program. EEEB plans a three year (1981-1983) program of tariff increases
representing an estimated increase in real terms -for each year over the
preceeding year's average- of about 20% for each year. The three year plan,
which has been approved by EEEB's Board and authorized by JNT, is being put
into effect in the present April-May 1981 billing period. The tariff adjust-
ment will increase the yearly average for 1981, and subsequently for 1982 and
1983, by about 50% in nominal terms; for 1981 this comprises a one-time, flat
16.5% increase plus monthly increments of 2.37%. 1/
5.12      ISA's share of local cost (40%) for the Guavio project would
be provided to EEEB on appropriate terms and conditions based upon a schedule
reflecting project requirements. 2/ In return for participation in the
investment through the purchase of "Guavio Participations", 3/ ISA will
acquire, on behalf of its shareholders, absolute rights to buy 40% of Guavio's
power and capacity (at the purchase price established for bulk power transfers
in the interconnected system), and will share in the financial return on the
operation of the facility. To ensure that a suitable framework for this would
be concretized in a timely fashion, EEEB and ISA, before negotiations, worked
out the basic features of their collaboration. These include an estimated
schedule of ISA contributions, the associated obligations and rights, the
financial instruments to be used and a method by which Guavio profits will be
calculated. Prior to loan effectiveness, the contractual arrangements,
satisfactory to the Bank, on "Guavio Participations" would be finalized.
5.13      Sufficient availability of local financing would be needed to
cover the balance of funds required for the program. Since the Govern-
ment precludes the use of national budgetary resources for power invest-
ments (except for ICEL and CORELCA), a rising need has emerged for financing
part of the increasing share of local components of the construction programs,
that cannot be fully financed through tariff action. However, because of the
limited capital market in Colombia and the Government's contractionary mone-
tary policies aimed at dampening inflation, it has been difficult for the
power companies to mobilize sufficient domestic resources. Over the last
1/   The nominal tariff increases assumed in the financial forecast are slightly
lower than the increases approved by JNT.
2/   Sector finances were analyzed in detail during a post-appraisal mission
in January-February 1981 to ensure the feasibility of ISA's shareholders'
contributions to the financing of Guavio (5.11 and 5.18 to 5.24).

year, this financing shortage slowed construction and presented cash flow
problems for most of the companies and particularly for EEEB. To overcome
this local financial bottleneck, the Government has been taking determined
action to facilitate the sector's access to financing sources, including the
setting up of a PEFF (1.29) to ensure that the heavy program of future con-
struction will be carried out without significant delay. Because access to
sources of local currency financing is essential for the carrying out of
EEEB's investment program, including the proposed project, the Government has
confirmed that the PEFF will be established by January 1, 1982, to complement
internally-generated cash for the ongoing National Power Expansion Program,
and that it would take all necessary measures to ensure EEEB access to all
financing required for the project, as well as for the balance of its
Investment Program.
Future Finances
5.14      Present financial projections (Annex 5) are based on:  (a) the
updated assumptions for inflation and rate of exchange devaluation (4.09);
(b) the energy balance agreed by ISA and the shareholders in October 1980
(1.21); and (c) the EEEB's plan of tariff increases (5.11), which assumes
the following rates of nominal increases: 1981 47.5%; 1982 to 1986: 31.4%
(about 2.3% per month); and 14% (about 1.1% per month) in 1987 and there-
after. The financial forecast assumes a Bank loan of MUS$359 for the
proposed project with an interest rate of 9.6% and a term of 17 years
including 4 year grace period.
5.15      EEEB's net operating income with the above plan is expected to
produce annual rates on fully revalued assets ranging from 15.3% in 1981
to 20.5% in 1988 (Annex 5.1). The unusually high rates of return result
from the large internal generation of funds needed as a consequence of:
(a) EEEB's heavy investment program; (b) the present limited supply of
local financing from the domestic capital market and banking system to
public utility companies; and (c) the amount of financing anticipated to
be available from the PEFF during its first five-years of operation. To
assure the internal cash generation needed during the period 1981-1987, during
negotiations EEEB agreed that it would generate from its operations 35% of
total investment requirements in each of the years 1982 to 1984 and 55% during
each of 1985 to 1987. This would be consistent with the above rates of
return. However, the 14% rate of return covenanted for 1981 and thereafter
under the Bogota Distribution, will be repeated for the proposed loan because
of the difficulties that could be engendered with respect to future tariff
increases by covenanting higher rates of return. The methods for calculating
the rate of return and for monitoring and implementing required adjustments of
tariffs, (used in the quarterly financial reports "On the Adequacy of Tariffs
and Cash Generation"--5.16--), both covenanted under Bogota Distribution, will
be repeated for the proposed loan.



- 38 -
5.16      Under the Mesitas and Bogota Distribution loans, EEEB agreed
to furnish to the Bank quarterly financial reports on cash generation,
rate of return and adequacy of its tariffs; these covenants, including
the provisions for submitting semi-annual financial forecasts, will be
repeated for the proposed loan. During negotiations agreement was reached
that the investment limitation covenanted under the Bogota Distribution loan
will be amended as follows: EEEB will not: (a) construct generating
plant exceeding 100 MW unless economically justified and adequately funded;
(b) incur expenditures for investments not included in EEEB's Investment
Program aggregating annually in excess of 1% of net revalued fixed assets in
operation; or (c) incur investments unrelated to the power sector.
5.17      EEEB's financial position as measured by the debt/equity ratio
(34/66 in 1979) would be maintained at safe levels throughout the projected
period (Annex 5.1); despite the borrowings required for construction of
Mesitas, Bogota Distribution, Guavio and other investments, it would not
exceed 51/49. Debt service coverage on an annual basis would not descend
under 1.5, which is satisfactory. The debt service limitation covenanted
under Bogota Distribution loan will be repeated for the proposed loan.
Sector Finances
5.18      Introduction:  The analysis of the power sector finances is based
for the first time, on consolidated financial projections (Annex 5.10)
which were carried out by ISA, as the sector planning agency, and its share-
holders, with Bank assistance, in the period May 1980 to February 1981, 1/
to demonstrate the viability of the "Acuerdo de Cali" 2/ proposal and to
ensure the feasibility of ISA's shareholders' contributions to the financing
of Guavio. These consolidated projections, aiming at displaying the financial
outlook for the 1980-1990 period, are preliminary and have to be deemed as a
basis-for-discussion document requiring further analysis among the electric
sector entities and the Government.
5.19      Methodology:  The working group developed a methodology for the
electric sector financial consolidation, which consists of the arrangement and
aggregation of the individual financial statements of the Colombian electric
companies, forecasted on a homogeneous basis. The intercompany accounts and
transactions that cancell out each other have been compensated for or eliminated
in two steps: (a) ICEL and CORELCA and its "electrificadoras"; and (b) ISA and
its shareholders. Several simplifications for correcting different accounting
or projecting approaches have been used for calculating some global items (i.e.
purchased energy, other operating costs, non operating income, etc); therefore
1/   This report includes financial projections finished by January 26, 1981.
Subsequently, EEEB's and CORELCA's financial projections have been modified
for the Guavio and Village Electrification Staff Appraisal Reports.

which modifies the previous "Acuerdo de Sochagota" (1.11).

some consolidated financial items may differ slightly from the individual
original statements. These adjustments grant the consolidation an acceptable
degree of uniformity and coherence giving reasonable validity to the findings.
However, minor errors may subsist.
5.20      Basic projection parameters were agreed among the Bank, ISA and
its shareholders during May to October 1980. The main concepts have been
applied consistently and are summarized: (a) energy balance: based on pro-
jected demand, sector expansion and generation programs, energy interchanges,
tariff for interchanges in the interconnected system, commissioning schedules,
construction programs, 1/ etc.; (b) expected international and domestic
inflation rates and rates of exchange; (c) annual asset revaluation using the
expected domestic inflation rates; (d) tariff increases projected individually
by each company, according to its particular financial situation; the nominal
average increase resulting for the sector is 35% per annum for 1980-1984
and 16% per annum per 1984-1990; (e) depreciations, operating costs and
working capital requirements have been estimated with adequate projection
criteria based on the recent historic experience; (f) capital contributions
from national budgetary resources to ICEL, CORELCA, and ISA (through CORELCA
for the 500-kV Interconnection); (g) reasonable availability of external
financing from international institutions, commercial banks and suppliers
for foreign components of construction programs; (h) limited availability of
local financing from: (i) FONADE (studies), (ii) "Fondo de Desarrollo Electrico"
(refinancing of long-term debt), and (iii) the PEFF (local component of
construction programs).
5.21      The electric companies, except ICEL, forecast their financial
projections according to methodologies, formats and timing agreed with the
Bank under San Carlos I Loan 1582-CO; financial planning offices and trained
staff regularly prepare such financial projections as well as other financial
monitoring reports on rate of return and adequacy of tariffs. On this
occasion, for the first time, ICEL (having no financial planning body in its
management organization) has made an important step towards financial planning
by projecting its financial statements as well as the financial statements of
its "electrificadoras". Nevertheless, some of ICEL's projection assumptions
should be further reviewed and discussed with ISA and DNP, especially those
related to estimated capital contributions from the national budget and
construction programs.
1/   Under the ongoing program, EEEB would construct and own the Guavio Plant,
with 40% of its output guaranteed to ISA; the Betania facility (500 MW)
would be owned by ICEL, with 50% of its generation allocated to ISA.
Playas (200 MW) would be the property of EPM, and Urra (1000 MW) would be
owned jointly by CORELCA and ISA.

5.22      Preliminary Findings:  The investment program and financing plan for
1980-1984 that resulted from this exercise is as follows:

Capital Contributions                              103,561             23
Borrowings:                                        234,583             52

453,483            100
5.23      The financing plan referred to above shows:  (a) net internal
generation of funds of 25% 1/ resulting from a sharp and sustained tariff
action (10% per annum real increase over the period); starting from the present
tariff levels, strong measures should be taken to ensure that tariff increases
are to reach this target; (b) capital contributions from the national budget
(maLinly to ICEL and CORELCA) 23%; this estimate on the capital contribution
is higher than the one originally foreseen by ISA and DNP and implies a heavy
resources allocation from the national budget; and (c) borrowing 52% (foreign
47%:--financing the foreign costs of the construction program--and domestic 5%).
5.24      Because of the importance of the contributions of ISA and its
shareholders to the project financing plan, during negotiations, agreement
to this effect was reached (between the Bank and the companies--ISA, EEEB,
EPM, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA--) through a draft Sponsors' Agreement (5.12). In
addlition, to ensure that ISA and its shareholders will be able to meet their
financial commitments to the project without compromising their other finan-
cial obligations, the Sponsors' Agreement also includes suitable financial
performance indicators as follows: (a) EPM: those covenanted under the
Playas loan 1953-CO; (b) ISA and CVC: those covenanted under the San Carlos
II loan 1725-CO; (c) CORELCA: those agreed under the Village Electrification
project. ICEL's obligations will continue to be covered by Government con-
tr:ibutions from the national budget. However, the Sponsors' Agreement will
provide for reorganization of ICEL (1.12) which is expected to enable the ICEL
group to evolve gradually into financially viable and operationally competent
enltities.
1/   The 1980 financing structure of the electric sector is:  net internal
generation 7%; capital contributions mainly from national budget 27%;
borrowing 66% (foreign 53 and domestic 13%).

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      ISA prepared in 1977 a first report to establish the least-cost
expansion for the sector for the period 1984-1988, 1/ on the basis of the
economic comparison of least-incremental costs for several alternative
expansion programs, including thermal plants (both fuel-oil and coal-fired
steam units), gas turbines and hydroelectric projects (San Carlos II
appraisal report No. 2464a-CO). The alternative expansion programs were
designed to meet the sector energy and peak demand requirements through 1990.
The studies are carried out using a model with stochastic variables for both
hydrology and demand, and with the restriction that under adverse hydro-
logical conditions occurring less than once in 20 years, energy requirements
would not have to be met. The operation of the system is then simulated through
computer models to estimate the operational costs of each alternative program
and to compute the probability for the program of not meeting the system
requirements. Adjustments are introduced to ensure that capacity deficits
would have a probability of occurrence of less than 5% in any one year of the
period. The alternative program representing the least-cost alternative is
then selected as the System Expansion Program, representing the least net
present value of all the costs associated to it, discounted at 11% (which
represents the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Colombia). Sensi-
tivity analysis of the program costs to the discount rate (10% and 12%)
and to fuel prices (plus minus 20%) do not show any substantial changes in
the merit order of the best and second-best alternatives. The analysis also
shows that the results are insensitive to a reasonable range in variation of
the standard conversion factor (corresponding to the shadow-price exchange
rate). Also, the results are insensitive to the use of conversion factors
since neither the timing of individual plants within a proposed expansion
program, nor the ranking of the several alternative programs are affected
whether conversion factors are or are not used. Since 1977, ISA annually
reviews and revises if necessary the least-cost expansion program for the
sector. The latest revision (1980) has introduced only minor changes to
the commissioning dates of the proposed projects but has not changed the
sequence of implementation of the hydroplants proposed by previous programs.
Such sequence includes in the same order, Guadalupe IV (Loan 1868-CO),
Betania (being constructed by ICEL), Playas (Loan 1953-CO), Guavio and
Urra (4.01).
Return on Investment
6.02      The return on investment was calculated as the discount rate
equalizing the present values of the streams of benefits and costs associated
with EEEB's 1981-90 development program of which the Bank project is a part
1/   "Verficacion y actualizacion del programa de expansion del sistema inter-
conectado, periodo 1984-88; diciembre 1978" (subsequently partially amended
by several reports for updating and to justify emergency programs).



- 42 -
and cannot be reasonably segregated. In addition to the project, EEEB's
program includes transmission, subtransmission and distribution expansion
(4.03). EEEB's transmission program has been designed by INGETEC. The
subtransmission and distribution programs have been designed by EEEB on
the basis of the 1981-90 load forecast. The subtransmission and distri-
bution program for the period 1980-82 is being financed by the Bank under
Loan 1807-CO. EEEB hired the consulting firm Gilbert and Associates to
assist the company in reviewing and revising if necessary the subtransmission
ancl distribution expansion after 1982 and to prepare a Master Plan to cover
up to the year 2000.
6.03      The cost streams comprise the capital costs of this program and
incremental operational and maintenance cost related to the incremental
sales associated with the program. These costs were converted to border
prices using weighted average conversion factors for individual local cost
components (materials, machinery, equipment, labor, consumables and such).
As a proxy for benefits, revenues were used, derived from incremental sales
associated with the program and average 1988 annual rates, deflated to 1980
and adjusted to border prices by the standard conversion factor (Annex 6.1).
6.04      On this basis, the return on investment is about 15.0% (Annex 6.1),
which compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for Colombia,
estimated to be 11%.
6.05      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to estimate the impact on
the internal financial return of possible changes in cost and revenues.
These are summarized below:
Rate of Return on Investment Program (%)
Benefits
85%         100%         11%
Cost
100%                      11           15          17
115%                      10           12          15
If the cost of the program increases by 15%, the rate of return would be about
12%. If the program costs do not increase but benefits are 15% lower than
estimated, the return would be about 11%. If the program costs increase by
15% and the benefits decrease by 15% the return on the investment program would
be -about 10%. The equalizing rates obtained understate the real economic rate
of return of EEEB's investment program since revenues from electricity sales
do not fully reflect all benefits to society.

(a) satisfactory arrangements would have been made for the financing
of the balance of EEEB's Investment Program requirements for the
years 1982   and   1983 (5.10); and



- 45 -
(b) EEEB, ISA and its other shareholders will finalize contractual
arrangements for the "Guavio Participations" (5.12).
Recommendation
7.05      With the above assurances the proposed project would be suitable for
a Bank loan of MUS$359 equivalent, to be made to EEEB with the guarantee of
the Government of Colombia. The loan would have a repayment period of 17
years, including 4 years of grace.

/  Actual figures include bulk sales to other utilities (transfer through EEEB's network of ISA supply to these
utilities). For forecast of net sales of energy to customers, see paragraph 3.02.
h/  See paragraph 5.11 for EEEB's plan of rate increases.
ci  Consists of connection charges (approximately 85% of the figure shown) plus charges for service changes, meter
rentals, special services and penalties for late paynent of bills.
di Except where noted otherwise, the operating costs are estimated by EEEB based on 1970-1979 average in real terms and
then escalated. Cost itens, except purchased energy and depreciation, have been increased about 7% in comparison with the
nriginal EEEB's estfsate, based on post appraisal mission findings.
e/  Hydro generation:  assuming Mesitas 65% commissioning in 1982 and full in 1983, and Guavio full commissioning by end
1987. Thermal generation: assuming long-term contracts for purchase of coal.
f/  Based on ISA's energy balance 1980-1990.
g/  Projected on the basis of estimated future number of kilometers of lines in operation; 1979 figure includes an unusual
adjustment charge not expected to be repeated.
h/  Projected on the basis of estimated future number of customers; 1979 figure includes an unusual adjustment charge
not expected to be repeated.
i/  Consists of: (a) administration expenses projected to grow in the same proportion as the sum of all other operating
costs excluding ISA's charges and depreciation; (b) billing and collection expenses projected to grow in proportion
to other distribution costs; and (c) coats of unfunded pension and severance pay liabilities projected to grow in
proportion to sioe of EEEB's staff.
ji/  Consists of the value of public lighting supplies at no cost donated to the city of Bogota (which offsets a symbolic
equal amount included in "Operating Revenue") and actual expenditures made by EEEB for maintenance of the public
lighting system (which average approximately 35-40% of the figure shown).
k/  As projected by ISA.
1/  EEEB uses straight-line depreciation applying adequate rates for each of the major fully revalued asset components.
Some typical rates are: existing assets in 1978 3.4%; transmission 2.8%; distribution 3.2%; Mesitas 3.125%;
maintenance facilities 4%; data processing and dispatch center 10%.
m/  Costs shown for 1977-1979, other than depreciation (which is based on fully revalued assets) are identical to EEB's
financial statements.
n/  Projected by EEEB includes interest on ISA bonds, dividends fr.m ISA and interest on short-term deposits and profits
on real estate and equipment sales.
