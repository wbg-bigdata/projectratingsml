                                   REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

             Second Sustainable Employment Development Policy Operation


Recipient                   Republic of Kosovo
Implementing Agency         Ministry of Finance
Financing Data              The proposed Second Sustainable Employment Development Policy
                            Operation (SEDPO-2) will be financed from a €23 million (US$30
                            million equivalent) trust fund (from FY08 IBRD surplus
                            administered by IDA following the World Bank Board decision of
                            July 3, 2008). The operation is co-financed by grants from ten
                            bilateral and multilateral donors which amount to €12.1 million and
                            US$1.8 million.
Operation Type              Programmatic Development Policy Operation; second and final
Main Policy Areas           Macroeconomics and Public Financial Management; Investment
                            Climate, Labor, Education, Social Protection
Key Outcome Indicators      1. The 2013 budget includes consolidated procurement to be
                                 launched in at least two procurement categories in 2013.
                            2. Job classification is completed for core civil servants working at
                                 the Central level.
                            3. Number of days to register a business reduced to fewer than 40
                                 days in 2012 from 58 days in 2009.
                            4. At least 75 percent of planned measures in the Employment
                                 Strategy Action Plan for 2011 are completed.
                            5. At least 33 percent of public works participants are Category II
                                 Social Assistance benefit recipients in 2011 and in 2012.
                            6. All accredited public and private higher education institutions
                                 have established internal quality assurance mechanisms, as per
                                 the guidelines developed by the Kosovo Accreditation
                                 Authority.
Program Development         The Program objectives are to: (i) maintain a stable macroeconomic
Objectives                  framework through strengthened budget and fiscal management and
                            increased transparency, and accountability of public expenditures;
                            (ii) lay institutional and legislative foundations for sustainable
                            employment and growth.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   Substantial risks are associated with Program implementation.
                            These risks include:
                            Macroeconomic risks. Kosovo has an uneven track record in fiscal
                            management raises questions about medium-term macroeconomic
                            stability, together with a contagion risk from a European growth
                            slowdown. In addition, authorities may experience increasing
                            pressure to satisfy political demands for social benefits (including
                            additional benefits to veterans), which may threaten macroeconomic
                            stability. The Staff Monitored Program with the IMF and the
                            recently announced staff-level agreement on a Stand-By
                            Arrangement in addition to SEDPO-2 Grant financing, are strong
                            incentives for Government to maintain a stable macroeconomic
                                                  i
               framework. The new 20-month, €107 million Stand-By
               Arrangement will put Government in a better position to address
               potential growth shocks. In addition, the World Bank, through
               technical assistance on sustainable employment, will help
               Government better communicate to stakeholders the nature and
               medium-term benefits of SEDPP-supported reforms.

               Weak labor market institutions and Ministry of Labor and
               Social Welfare capacity constraints could limit the impact of
               employment promotion measures and create disincentives for
               their take up. This institutional risk is mitigated by cleaning and
               updating the unemployment registries and on-going World Bank
               technical assistance for design and delivery of labor market
               programs that address the needs and constraints of active job
               seekers.

               Governance and political structures could destabilize if faced with
               significant shocks. Governance systems still lack full transparency
               and accountability in Kosovo, hence, are vulnerable to domestic
               unrest and political pressures. Governance and political
               developments will need to be followed closely as related problems
               could undermine external development support activities. Actions to
               improve public financial management, including actions supported
               by SEDPO-2 and the ongoing Public Sector Modernization Project
               to improve transparency in information systems, should help to
               reduce risks stemming from a lack of full transparency and
               accountability.

               Some reforms aimed at improving governance and transparency
               could encounter resistance. For example, the implementation of
               consolidated procurement may be delayed in some institutions.
               Likewise, introducing unified pay and grading scales for core civil
               servants, although broadly supported by civil servants, may
               encounter difficulties due to potential pressures within line
               ministries and municipalities to place staff in the highest possible
               grade. If not managed properly, such pressures could result in high
               fiscal costs, prompting further delays or resulting in a failed reform
               effort. A phased reform implementation approach (to be supported
               by the ongoing Public Sector Modernization Project) is expected to
               enable dissemination of positive results (e.g., cost savings from
               consolidated procurement) and thereby increase support for the
               reforms.

          SECOND SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT POLICY

                                       REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

                                        I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      Kosovo is endowed with important assets, but remains one of the poorest
countries in Europe and its labor market outcomes are weak. Kosovo is endowed with
important assets, including abundant natural resources, good quality agricultural land, a young
labor force, and proximity and virtually duty-free access to the EU market.1 Economic growth
has been solid since the end of the conflict and the global crisis had a relatively limited impact
on the economy, with expected growth between 3.8 and 4.0 percent for 2012 and 2013.
However, Kosovo still faces important challenges. Almost 35 percent of the population lives
in poverty and 12 percent in extreme poverty.2 Kosovo has one of the highest unemployment
rates in Europe (45 percent in 2009).3 Macro and fiscal risks, a weak investment climate,
nascent labor market policies, skills mismatches, and weak work incentives are among the
most binding constraints to the creation of sustainable employment and growth. Effectively
tackling these constraints is likely to enable Kosovo to tap into its potential to shift towards
sustainable private sector-led growth.

2.      The Sustainable Employment Development Policy Program (SEDPP) addresses
some of the key constraints to sustainable employment. Specifically, the objectives of
SEDPP are to: (i) maintain a stable macroeconomic framework through strengthened budget
and fiscal management, and increased transparency and accountability of public expenditures;
and (ii) lay institutional and legislative foundations for sustainable employment and growth.

3.      SEDPP has experienced successive delays due to macroeconomic concerns and
unplanned Parliamentary elections in 2010. The original plan was to disburse SEDPP in
three operations; each in 2009, 2010, and 2011. However, after the declaration of
independence in 2008, the Government introduced spending initiatives that put the
macroeconomic framework at risk. A Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was negotiated with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2010 and the First Sustainable Employment
Development Policy Operation (SEDPO-1) was submitted to the World Bank Board in
September 2010. Before legal agreements could be signed, the governing coalition lost its
majority and this led to early elections. New spending initiatives in the pre-electoral period
were not in compliance with the commitments Government had made under the SBA. The
Government and the IMF agreed on a six month Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in July
2011, which was successfully implemented during the second half of 2011. Upon successful
implementation of the SMP, which included agreement of the 2012 budget, SEDPO-1 was
disbursed in December 2011.

4.      Despite delays due to unplanned Parliamentary elections and macroeconomic
concerns, structural reforms supported by SEDPP have continued throughout this
entire period. Substantial progress in implementing the reforms originally envisioned
(indicative triggers) under the second and third SEDPP operations justifies merging the two
planned operations into a single final operation (SEDPO-2). Fourteen out of the twenty-two
original indicative triggers were completed by February 2012. The objectives of these reforms
were to: (i) improve public financial management, (ii) make the investment climate more
attractive for domestic and foreign investors, (iii) protect workers while maintaining a flexible
labor market regime and increase labor force participation through labor market programs,
and (iv) provide better linkages between social assistance and labor market programs to
encourage a welfare-to-work transition (see Section V for details). In addition, the
Government undertook reforms which are consistent with SEDPP objectives but that were not
identified as indicative triggers at the start of the SEDPP.

5.       Progress was slower, however, on some of the other reforms identified in
SEDPO-1 (see Section V for details). First, measures to track performance targets more
thoroughly have been delayed along with civil service reforms due to technical capacity
constraints. Second, measures to modernize the pledge registry are being implemented at a
slower pace than originally anticipated, but are expected to take effect in the first half of 2012.
Third, plans to consolidate smaller active labor market programs by establishing a
coordinating mechanism were delayed due to human resource constraints at the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW). Recently, however, MLSW hired qualified personnel and
initial steps have been taken to consolidate small active labor market programs. Other World
Bank instruments, including the Public Sector Modernization Project, Business Environment
Technical Assistance (TA), Financial Sector TA, and the labor and social protection TA, are
supporting Government reforms in the above areas.

6.       In some cases, the Government has re-oriented its reform strategy relative to
SEDPO-1 indicative triggers (see Section V for details). First, the Government changed the
focus from developing adult training programs jointly by Ministry of Education, Science and
Technology and MLSW to one that involves other stakeholders, including employers and
private providers. This is likely to lead to better alignment between curricula and labor market
needs. Second, the Government changed its strategy from revising its targeting methodology
to one that improves activation of social assistance beneficiaries by enhancing the information
base available to administrators through a database of social assistance beneficiaries, allowing
better links to employment programs. Given that most of the social assistance benefits already
accrue to households in the bottom quintile, the shift in focus is justified.

7.      SEDPO-2 supports 14 prior actions which have been identified as critical and
timely to support the objectives of the Program of promoting macroeconomic stability
and creating sustainable employment. The actions supported are the core of the
Government’s Public Financial Management Reform Action Plan and Employment Strategy
for 2010-2012, which together identify five pillars to promote sustainable employment: (i)
macroeconomic stability and public financial management; (ii) investment climate; (iii) labor
market policies, institutions, and regulations; (iv) education, skills, and training; and (v) social
protection policies. Nine of the 14 prior actions supported in the proposed SEDPO-2 are
derived from indicative triggers specified in SEDPO-1. In addition, the proposed SEDPO-2


                                                 2
supports five new prior actions, which contribute to SEDPP development objectives. Section
V discusses the choice of prior actions in detail.

8.     The SEDPP is financed from trust funds created to assist the Government of
Kosovo through budget support.4 There are two sources of trust funds for SEDPO-2: (i)
IBRD surplus €23 million; and (ii) 10 bilateral and multilateral donor contributions €12.1
million and US$1.8 million.

9.      The SEDPO-2 is an important part of the proposed World Bank Group Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Republic of Kosovo FY12-15. One of the two pillars of
the proposed FY12-15 CPS is to accelerate inclusive growth and employment generation,
precisely the area supported by SEDPO-2. The proposed SEDPO-2 would focus on improving
public financial management, thus transparency and accountability of public finances;
improving the investment climate to promote domestic and foreign investment; strengthening
labor market institutions to provide targeted services to active unemployed persons; setting
education qualification standards and accrediting education institutions to increase the quality
and relevance of education and increasing education quality; and transforming information
systems to improve beneficiary activation into the labor force.

  The provision of budget support followed a Government request to strengthen the credibility of Kosovo
institutions and coalesce donor interventions around Government priorities.

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
10.     Kosovo is a potential candidate for European Union (EU) membership. However,
the integration process has been held back by the non-unanimous recognition of Kosovo’s
February 17, 2008 declaration of independence. As of March 22, 2012, 89 countries have
recognized Kosovo’s independence, including 22 EU member states. In June 2009, Kosovo
became a full member of the World Bank and IMF.

11.     Kosovo has moved towards greater security and stability—in collaboration with,
and with assistance from, international development partners. While ethnic Albanians,
comprising over 90 percent of Kosovo’s population, overwhelmingly support independent
statehood, the Serb-majority communities in northern Kosovo have rejected the legitimacy of
the Government of Kosovo and its institutions. The situation remains unresolved politically
and, as a result, has led to the periodic outbreak of localized tension.

12.      Kosovo aspires to deepen its EU integration. The recent compromise on Kosovo’s
regional representation has allowed the European Commission (EC) to establish contractual
relations with Kosovo and, therefore, (i) take first steps in the Stabilization and Association
Process; and (ii) support the process towards full membership in European (financial)
institutions. In parallel, the EC has opened the visa liberalization dialogue, while the
International Steering Group agreed to end Kosovo’s “supervised independence? by end-
2012.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN KOSOVO
13.     Prior to the crisis, Kosovo experienced strong economic growth and continued
growing, albeit at a slower pace, in 2009. GDP grew on average by 5.1 percent between
2005 and 2008, reaching a record-high 6.9 percent in 2008 owing to increasing economic
activity,5 consumption, and public investment. In 2009, growth decelerated to 2.9 percent in
the wake of the global financial and economic crisis. However, Kosovo’s economy, unlike the
rest of Europe, was less affected by the crisis owing to its limited integration with the
European economy. In addition, expansionary fiscal policy countered the negative effects of
slowing remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and exports.

14.    Growth accelerated in 2010 (3.9 percent) and continued during 2011 (estimated
at 5.0 percent). The increase in public spending on infrastructure and a rebound in FDI and
remittances were the main drivers of a pickup in growth. Investment rose to above 33 percent
of GDP in 2010 and 2011, mainly as a result of the construction of the Route 7 motorway to
Albania (2.9 and 5.3 percent of GDP was allocated for the motorway construction from the
budget in 2010 and 2011, respectively). Negative net exports slowed growth despite an
increase in exports (largely metal exports) in both 2010 and 2011.

  Sectoral analysis is not possible because Kosovo does not produce statistics on industrial output or GDP using
a production approach.

15.   High investment (motorway construction) plus the dependence on imports for
many final consumption goods led to a widening current account deficit (CAD). In 2010,
the CAD widened to 17.4 percent of GDP and it is estimated to have reached 20.3 percent of

                                                             5
GDP in 2011, partly explained by rising commodity prices, which adversely affected Kosovo.
The FDI, foreign exchange reserves and “unidentified inflows? (i.e. errors and omissions)6
have been the main sources of financing of the CAD (Table 1). Since trade credit has been
stable at around 2.0 percent of GDP and private external borrowing is limited (estimates put
this borrowing at below 1.0 percent of GDP), total external debt is projected to be slightly
higher than external public debt levels.

16.     Kosovo’s public debt stock is low. Public debt stood at 5.6 percent of GDP at the end
of 2011, comprising almost entirely inherited IBRD debt.7 The authorities have set a legal
limit on public debt at 40 percent of annual GDP. In addition, any external borrowing needs
an absolute majority approval in Parliament.

17.      Fiscal developments have been marked by expansionary spending in recent
years. Expenditures rose from 20 percent of GDP in 2007 to 29.8 percent of GDP in 2011. At
the same time, the budget moved from a 7.0 percent of GDP surplus in 2007 to a 2.6 percent
deficit in 2010. The 2011 fiscal deficit, though projected to be 2.9 percent of GDP in the mid-
year review, is estimated to have ended at 1.8 percent of GDP. The main contributor to the
expenditure increase was capital spending, which had reached 11.9 percent of GDP by 2011.
Revenues grew as well during the same period mainly as a result of increasing tax collection
and a dividend withdrawal (of 5.0 percent of GDP) from the telecom company in 2009. The
2010 and 2011 deficits were financed by accumulated government deposits from previous
fiscal surpluses. However, these government resources have now been largely used up; the
usable treasury balance was estimated to be 3.5 percent of GDP at end-2011 and about one
percent of GDP (€46 million) is earmarked for central bank interventions in the banking
sector.

18.      Fiscal policy has been hampered by uncertain and volatile policy making. During
2010 and 2011, major spending initiatives were introduced following the adoption of the
budget, which then led to substantial readjustments in mid-year budget reviews. In 2010, the
Government signed a contract to construct the Route 7 motorway to Albania, which was
estimated to cost about 20 percent of 2010 GDP and not included in either the 2010 budget or
the medium-term expenditure framework. In addition, in 2011, public salaries were increased
on (annualized) average by 27 percent to fulfill an election promise. Furthermore, several
initiatives with significant or unknown fiscal impact were announced outside of the budget
framework, which if introduced, could have led to long-term financing challenges. These
initiatives included constructing the Route 6 motorway to Former Yugoslav Republic
Macedonia, increasing war-related benefits, and introducing pensions for veterans. Additional
uncertainty on the revenue side arose during privatization of the telecom company (PTK), a
process that was derailed when the public bid failed because three of the four bidders
withdrew.8 Privatization of PTK is ongoing and the financial transaction is expected to be
closed in early 2013.

  The “error and omissions? line item may include unrecorded private transfers from abroad, which in turn would
imply that the CAD is overestimated.
7
  Until 2009, Kosovo had no public debt but in 2009 it assumed its share of IBRD debt from the former
Yugoslavia in the amount of €381 million (9.7 percent of GDP). Kosovo has not participated in the division of
other assets and liabilities of former Yugoslavia and if this process takes place Kosovo could inherit additional
debt (to the Paris and London Clubs).

  The law on public procurement requires at least two bidders.

19.     Fiscal policy faces additional challenges in Kosovo. First, even though Kosovo’s
budget is small compared to other European countries, the country has adopted the Euro as a
currency―this limits monetary policy and puts the responsibility for macroeconomic stability
primarily on fiscal policy. Second, the Government faces constraints to financing fiscal
deficits because Kosovo’s access to foreign borrowing is limited to the IMF, the World Bank
and donor resources; the country has no credit rating and political risks are perceived to be too
high for the country to access private external markets, though plans are underway to obtain a
credit rating in 2012. Arrangements for issuing domestic government securities were
completed in 2011, and the first Treasury bills were issued successfully in January 2012.

20.    The banking sector has remained stable during the post-crisis period. Kosovo’s
banks are majority foreign-owned: 90 percent of total assets are under foreign-owned bank
management. The difficulties of European parent banks have not thus far impacted local
banking, in part because banks rely primarily on domestic deposits to fund their lending
operations (the loans-to-deposit ratio has been maintained at around 80 percent). Both credit
and deposits continued growing at about 15 percent in 2010 and 2011. At the same time, non-
performing loans have been rising; however, they remain low (at 5.9 percent of total loans)
compared to other countries in the region. Overall, banks remain well-capitalized (the capital
adequacy ratio was 17.2 percent in July 2011) and profitable (return on average equity for the
sector was 12.9 percent in the first half of 2011). In addition to measures described in the
SEDPO-1, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have taken further action to
preserve banking sector stability: as noted earlier, €46 million from treasury deposits have
been earmarked for an “emergency liquidity assistance? fund9 and a Deposit Insurance Fund
has been established.

21.     While the July 2010 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF was not
completed, the authorities and the IMF agreed on a six month Staff Monitored Program
(SMP) in July 2011. The SMP aimed to ensure fiscal discipline, and in turn to pave the way
for a new SBA in 2012. Following the successful completion of the two SMP reviews (which
included over-performance on the fiscal deficit targets), the authorities and the IMF
announced staff-level agreement on March 5, 2012 on a 20-month, €107 million SBA.


MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
22.    Output growth is expected to be around 3.0 to 4.0 percent in the near term.
Kosovo’s geographical position, free trade access to the region and the EU offer potential for
export growth, and Kosovo’s large, underutilized resources (labor, minerals, and land) could
be used to attract foreign investment in mining, agriculture, and labor-intensive
manufacturing.10 However, given the worsening economic outlook in Europe and slowing
global economy, growth is projected to be moderate (vis-à-vis pre crisis levels) hovering
around 3.8-4.0 percent in 2012-13 and 3.2 percent in 2014.11 High public infrastructure
investment and increasing private investment (in response to improvements in the business

   The use of the “emergency liquidity assistance? fund is regulated by the Memorandum of Understanding
signed by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Kosovo.

   The projections assume a 0.5 percent growth in 2012 in the Euro zone, and a slow recovery in subsequent
years.
                                                    7
environment), as well as rising consumption supported by credit growth, are expected to be
primary drivers of growth. Moreover, domestic economic activity is projected to expand on
the basis of previous investment, including FDI. Inflation is expected to remain moderate and
based on import price movements. In the context of a slowing global economy, the spike in
inflation caused by rising food and commodity prices in the first half of 2011 is expected to
revert to a moderate level of about 0.6 percent in 2012 and below 1.5 percent in 2013/2014.

23.      The CAD in 2012 will remain high though decreasing, partly given the large
import content of investment spending. Even though exports (of metals) are also projected
to grow, their contribution to reducing the CAD is expected to be modest and uncertain, at
least in the medium term. Nonetheless, the CAD will continue to be financed mostly by non-
debt creating inflows (foreign investment, accumulated savings, and not-identified inflows,
i.e. errors and omissions), but some public borrowing is also expected (from International
Financial Institutions). The FDI inflows are projected to cover almost one-half of the 2012
CAD; while the financial transaction related to PTK privatization is planned to be closed in
early 2013, the energy distribution company is expected to be privatized in 2012.

24.     The economic outlook is, however, subject to substantial external and domestic
risks. The recovery of global growth weakened during 2011 and the outlook for 2012 and
beyond remains uncertain. Economic troubles in Europe are transmitted to Kosovo via FDI,
remittances, and exports. Kosovo’s economic linkages are stronger with the better-performing
countries (Germany and Switzerland) than with the troubled southern EU countries (Greece
and Italy), but Kosovo still faces a contagion risk. Also, the economic outlook abroad will
influence the success of planned privatizations in telecom and energy sector. Further, falling
demand for metals would reverse the positive trend of export growth in Kosovo. The
autonomous trade measures allowing exporters from Kosovo duty free access to
the EU market, which ended in December 2010, were reintroduced in December 2011.12 On
the domestic front, political risks linked to hostilities in the north of the country and rising
social tension could exert stronger pressures on government spending and slow down
structural reforms if the focus moves from economic to political issues. Further political risks
pertain to the lack of policy planning experience, although this is mitigated somewhat by
recent efforts to conduct medium-term assessments prior to submitting laws to parliament.

25.      Parliament approved a 2012 budget that is in line with commitments under the
IMF’s SMP. The projected deficit of the 2012 budget is 2.7 percent of GDP, resulting from
expenditures on the Route 7 (6.0 percent of GDP allocated in 2012). Expenditures are
projected to increase slightly to 30.5 percent of GDP due to rise in recurrent expenditures
from 17.9 percent of GDP in 2011 to 18.5 percent of GDP in 2012. On the revenue side,
projections are based on a reasonable GDP growth forecast and improved tax collection
efficiency. The deficit target postpones new infrastructure investments, such as the Route 6
motorway. In addition, the December 2011 law on war values, establishing benefits for war
veterans of the 1990s conflict, is fiscally sustainable and in line with agreements under the
SMP (“passage of the law regulating benefits for war-related categories by the Assembly in a
form that is consistent with the Letter of Intent of June 20, 2011? was a prior action for the
first review of the SMP).13
12
   The reintroduction had a retroactive effect, meaning that the exporters from Kosovo who have been paying
customs duties to EU countries during 2011 will be reimbursed for the customs paid.
13
   Earlier drafts of this law stipulated generous benefits with unknown, but most likely substantial, fiscal impact.
                                                         8
26.     The 2012 and 2013 budget deficits will be financed through public borrowing and
privatization proceeds. Expected revenue from PTK privatization is at least 6.5 percent of
GDP, but it is not expected to finance the 2012 budget. Privatization was expected to
conclude in 2011. Several reputable European market players showed interest in the company,
but delays linked to the elections and other circumstances dampened investor interest and
three of the four prequalified companies canceled their participation. The process is being re-
launched and is expected to conclude in early 2013. Nevertheless, for 2012, the authorities
have alternative sources to ensure prudent financing of the budget, including: (i) the new SBA
of €107 million,14 which in turn could make additional donor resources available, and (ii)
increased access to domestic borrowing.

27.     Over the medium term, the authorities are considering expenditures that could
have a significant fiscal impact, but only if this can be implemented without
compromising medium-term fiscal sustainability. First, the construction of the Route 6
motorway towards Former Yugoslav Republic Macedonia will start only after a cost-benefit
analysis is carried out and financing is secured. Second, additional war-related benefits,
defined by the December 2011 law on war values, will be introduced based on a fiscal impact
assessment and will consider affordability and economic incentives criteria. In this context,
the authorities would first define the amount of spending and then define the benefits so that
spending limits are not breached. Third, to strengthen budget management, the Government is
pursuing consolidated procurement and monitoring capital budget execution regularly.
Finally, the potential introduction of health insurance, which is proposed by the Ministry of
Health, would be done in a manner that does not increase the tax wedge. The World Bank and
the IMF are providing support to the authorities to ensure that the health reform is fiscally
sustainable.

28.     Reforming the energy sector is crucial to Kosovo’s long-term fiscal outlook and
economic development potential. The energy sector has been a major drain on budgetary
resources, but since 2011 subsidies have been substantially decreased through loss reduction
and improved billing and collection. Nevertheless, operational and financial performance
improvements are critical. If sector reforms and investments are delayed, severe repercussions
are likely for the national economic prospects and budget in the medium and long term. The
World Bank Group, together with other donors, has been working with Government to
address energy sector issues, including developing a new power plant and privatizing
electricity distribution.

29.    Despite its low external and public debt, Kosovo’s debt sustainability could be
jeopardized by worsening fiscal deficits or a slowdown in economic growth. The IMF’s
debt sustainability analysis in the 2011 Article IV report shows that all debt indicators remain
on a sustainable path over the next two decades in the baseline fiscal and external scenarios
shown in Table 1. However, the debt trajectory is subject to prominent risks, which come
from the fiscal side and growth shocks. Maintaining the primary deficit as a share of GDP at
the budgeted 2011 level of 4.8 percent of GDP over a two-decade period would put debt on an
unsustainable path. Debt would also become unsustainable if growth is lower than expected

14
  On March 5, 2012, staff-level agreement was announced on an economic program that could be supported by a
20-month SBA.

by one standard deviation (2.3 percentage points) in 2012 and 2013. For external debt, the
main weakness lies with the high debt and debt-service-to-exports ratios. This is due to
Kosovo’s low export base, but this weakness is somewhat offset by Kosovo’s large and stable
remittance flows.15

30.     While there are substantial risks related to the external environment, Kosovo’s
macroeconomic framework is considered adequate for the proposed operation. The 2012
budget and the agreed 20-month SBA with the IMF demonstrate the authorities’ commitment
to maintain fiscal stability, though risks remain for fiscal policy shifts. It is expected that
recent and planned reforms to increase transparency and accountability of public expenditures
will help strengthen budget management. Reforms aimed at improving the business
environment can stimulate private sector activity, although lack of a reform track record poses
a risk for sustainability. Actions taken to strengthen banking sector stability and establish a
government securities market will increase the authorities’ capacity to maintain macro-
economic stability. This operation would support the authorities in continuing the structural
reforms and preserving macro-stability.


POVERTY AND EMPLOYMENT
31.    Kosovo is one of the poorest countries in Europe with almost 35 percent of the
population living below the poverty line of €1.55 per adult equivalent per day. Around 12
percent of people live in extreme poverty – with less than €1.02 per adult equivalent per day.
Youth are disproportionately poor; 60 percent of poor people are less than 30 years old.

32.     Kosovo has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe and gender
inequality remains a challenge. In 2009, Kosovo’s unemployment rate recorded 45 percent.
The weak labor market outcomes are, however, significantly worse for women. Female labor
force participation rates in Kosovo are the lowest in the region at 26 percent, compared to 58
for men (2009). Furthermore, only 12 percent of working age women are employed (34
percent of men), slightly up from 9 percent in 2002. Unemployment rates are by far the
highest in the region at 41 percent for men and 56 percent for women. Unemployment has
declined for women from 74 percent in 2002, mainly due to reduction in activity rates rather
than due to job opportunities, while remaining largely unchanged for men. Unemployment is
particularly severe among the young people (15-24) at 68.5 percent for young men and 81.7
percent for young women.

33.    Poverty status is closely linked to labor market status. Among households that
include an unemployed head-of-household, about 57 percent are poor; among households in
which the head-of-household is employed with a salary, only 37 percent are poor.16 It is
estimated that a 10 percent drop in unemployment would reduce poverty by roughly 6.0
percent.17

15
   IMF’s debt sustainability analysis includes potential additional liabilities arising from former Yugoslav debt
which Kosovo may inherit in the context of possible division of assets and liabilities of former Yugoslavia.

34.     Poor labor market outcomes are primarily the result of low labor demand
associated with macroeconomic and fiscal risks and a weak investment climate.18 Job
creation is low because most firms in Kosovo are small and experience no revenue growth.
Frequent shifts in fiscal policy during 2010 and 2011 likely led to domestic and foreign
investor uncertainty about macroeconomic and fiscal policy priorities. Similarly, Kosovo is
ranked at 117 in the 2012 Doing Business Ranking. Barriers to firm entry are high (it takes 58
days to start a new business), and credit is expensive (average interest rate was about 15
percent in 2011).

35.     Though labor regulations are more flexible than in other European countries,
labor market intermediation is still limited and inefficient. The unemployment-to-work
transition is also relatively slow because labor market intermediary services are weak and
active labor market programs reach only a few people. Capacity in Public Employment
Services is severely limited and information systems are lacking for effective case
management for job seekers.

36.     Moreover, skills mismatches and uncertainty about skills are a concern. Despite
large numbers of unemployed workers, some firms are finding it difficult to recruit qualified
workers. Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (2008) found that 45
percent of businesses indicated that worker education and training are inadequate; and more
than 50 percent of unemployed men cited lack of appropriate education and skills as a reason
for their inability to find employment. Little information exists on the differences in education
streams of men and women and whether that explains some of the gender differences in
employment rates. Training opportunities are scattered and do not provide appropriate
signaling about employees’ qualification, including because certificates are issued without
quality control. As a result, firms are likely to be overly cautious with hiring decisions.

37.     Welfare recipients lack incentives to seek and secure employment opportunities
and long-term unemployed have a difficult time re-entering the workforce. The social
assistance program provides poor people with vital support to afford basic needs and mitigate
income shock impacts, but program design shortcomings encourage long-term welfare
dependency. These shortcomings include benefit calculation methods; the benefits formula
pays the difference between a pre-set threshold and actual family income, thus, the formula
subtracts each additional earned Euro from the benefit payment, lowering incentives for
beneficiaries to seek wage employment. Furthermore, social assistance is paid only to
registered unemployed people, meaning that unemployment is a program requirement, which
discourages job searches.

                          III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM


MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT
38.    There is strong Government ownership of the economic reform agenda in
Kosovo. In 2009, an Inter-Ministerial Committee for Sustainable Employment was created. It
is headed by the Deputy Prime Minister, who is also the Minister of Trade and Industry, and
includes the Ministers of Finance; Labor and Social Welfare; and Education, Science and
Technology. Before the Committee was set up, ministries were pursuing largely
uncoordinated employment initiatives and policies. The Committee adopted an ambitious
Public Financial Management (PFM) reform action plan and an Employment Strategy, and
derived annual action plans.19

39.      The Government’s PFM Reform Action Plan and Employment Strategy for
2010-2012 identifies five pillars to promote sustainable employment. The PFM Reform
Action Plan includes measures to (i) promote Macroeconomic stability and strengthen public
financial management. Reforms focus on improving public expenditure linkages to the policy
framework and strengthening the credibility of public expenditure planning, in particular,
capital expenditures. The Employment Strategy contains measures that focus on: (ii)
Investment climate; (iii) Labor market policies, institutions, and regulations; (iv) Education,
skills, and training; and (v) Social protection policies (known as the MILES Framework). The
reforms address constraints to job creation and bottlenecks in skills formation and recognition,
and in the enabling regulatory environment. These reforms are expected to boost private
sector led growth and job creation, but some of the benefits might take a few years to
materialize. To complement these structural measures, the Government has identified
interventions, such as public works, that are expected to improve labor market conditions and
work incentives in the shorter term.

40.    In 2010, the Inter-ministerial Committee for Sustainable Employment introduced
regular reporting mechanisms to monitor progress on the PFM Action Plan and the
Employment Strategy made during implementation. At the end of each reporting cycle,
line Ministries submitted progress reports (narrative and financial) to the Deputy Prime
Minister on each activity in the action plan and strategy. The Deputy Prime Minister’s office
consolidated these reports and summarized them in a common progress report.

41.     The Government’s Employment Strategy was reinforced by the Economic
Development Plan (EDP). In April 2011, the Government approved the EDP 2011-2014,
demonstrating high-level commitment to economic reforms. The EDP implementation plan
(Economic Development Vision Action PlanEDVAP) specifies medium-term reform
priorities for the following: maintain macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability, improve
investment climate, develop public infrastructure, revitalize agriculture, and develop human
capital. In general, EDVAP contains the core of the Employment Strategy and the PFM action
plan within it, but also addresses other reform areas.

19
  In June 2009, the Inter-ministerial Committee for Sustainable Employment presented and discussed the
Employment Strategy with social partners (the Chamber of Commerce of Kosovo, the Alliance of Kosovo
Businesses, the Union of Independent Trade Unions of Kosovo, and the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of
Kosovo) and donors.
                                                   12
42.  The rest of this section illustrates key pillars of the Government reform plan, which
SEDPP has been supporting.

Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management

43.     A PFM Reform Action Plan adopted in late-2009 has substantially addressed
many weaknesses identified in PEFA assessments. The 2007 and 2009 PEFA assessments
noted the following systemic weaknesses: (i) low budget credibility due to major capital
projects and salary expenditure commitments outside the MTEF; (ii) budget under-execution,
especially for capital expenditures; (iii) insufficient linkage between strategic planning and
budget preparation, including at the line ministry level; (iv) weak procurement capacity and
low value-for-money results; and (v) poor payroll management owing to unbudgeted pay
increases and the lack of a civil service pay/grading structure that hinder effective wage bill
planning and controls. In response to weaknesses noted in the 2009 PEFA assessment, the
December 2009 PFM Reform Action Plan (PFMRAP) focuses on establishing a rolling multi-
year budget process that integrates strategic and investment planning and minimizes
deviations from budget appropriations during budget execution. To this end, the PFMRAP
includes measures to improve public expenditure linkages to the policy framework and
strengthens public expenditure planning credibility, in particular, for capital expenditures.

44.      Recent SEDPO-1-supported achievements in PFM reform have improved budget
planning and capital investment management. In particular, the Strategic Planning Office
established in February 2010 under the Prime Minister has improved integration of
Government policy priorities in the MTEF. Multi-annual fiscal planning has been improved
by incorporating forward estimates for the outlying years in MTEF ceilings and the budget
circulars. The authorities undertook a public expenditure review in 2011 to improve
prioritization in fiscal planning. In addition, the Government ensures that all budgeted capital
projects include provisions for associated recurrent costs, are approved under the Public
Investment Program, and consistent with MTEF ceilings (achieved in the 2012 budget). For
the first time, the 2012 budget includes key performance indicators for budget programs for
all line ministries, which will enable the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to track results of public
expenditure. Likewise, MOF has begun monitoring progress in execution of capital
expenditures (including projects in the PIP), and presented the first capital budget execution
reportfor 2010in early-2011. MOF will continue to refine and improve capital
expenditure monitoring and reporting and has provided a report to the Minister of Finance on
2011 capital expenditure performance in February 2012. This measure is expected to increase
capital expenditure transparency and reduce scope for irregularities and malpractices such as
the reported practice of advancing payments at fiscal year-end without prior delivery of
required goods or works. It will also facilitate reallocation of funds, where appropriate, to
allow for the most effective use of the capital budget.

45.     The Government took steps to improve efficiency and integrity of public
procurement. In October 2011, amendments to the Public Procurement Law (PPL) were
approved to seek closer alignment with the EU legislation (acquis communautaire)
establishing a stronger mandate to conduct centralized and consolidated procurement on
behalf of Government. Secondary legislation and manuals were updated and came into force
on March 1, 2012 to avoid ambiguities in implementing the law. The new PPL replaces the
                                              13
Public Procurement Agency functions with the Central Procurement Agency under MOF.
This reform includes provisions for centralized procurement, due to be implemented in 2013
in selected procurement categories. This should increase value-for-money by exploiting
economies of scale, while reducing risks of non-compliance with legal procedures that
resulted from low capacity in many contracting authorities. Under the current decentralized
system, low capacity plus high levels of discretion among contracting authorities leads to
wide price discrepancies for the same goods or services among contracting authorities,
creating waste and mistrust of the public procurement process. In the past two years, the
Public Procurement Regulatory Commission, responsible for monitoring the PPL
implementation and reporting on public procurement, has increased compliance tests.

46.      Civil Service and Civil Servant Salaries’ Laws were adopted in 2010, but they
have not been implemented due to technical capacity constraints. The Civil Servants
Salaries Law was adopted as a package with the Civil Service Law, which lays the foundation
for a professional civil service; and defines civil servant legal rights and obligationstenure
security, career development prospects, and satisfactory performance. The new legislation
also establishes uniform pay and grading structures for core civil service (i.e., public
administration staff engaged in policy formulation not direct service delivery). In order to
move towards its implementation, and after significant delays, the Government adopted on
February 15, 2012 the regulation on job classification establishing new pay and grading
structures that will apply across central ministries and municipalities and replace existing
arbitrary practices of setting salaries and salary “coefficients? by position without reference to
standard rules. This reform is therefore expected to improve transparency, fairness (through
the principle of equal pay for equivalent work based on a clear job grading structure), and
facilitate predictable wage bill planning as well as more robust controls over wage bill
execution.

47.     The Government is committed to implementing the Civil Service Laws by 2013,
but advance work is needed for an orderly transition. The process is underway to prepare
job descriptions, a precondition for job classification (establishing grades and salary steps for
core civil service posts in the new pay/grading structure). However, the task of developing the
job classification exceeds existing public administration technical capacity. In particular, the
Ministry of Public Administration, responsible for overseeing reforms, must conduct a
thorough review of job descriptions and classifications proposed by line ministries and
municipalities to minimize the risk of over-grading and associated fiscal costs. Setting salary
levels by grade and salary step will be informed by an updated fiscal impact assessment,
currently under MOF review. Based on the new regulation, job classifications are
implemented consistently to avoid over-grading. The World Bank-financed Public Sector
Modernization Project has already started to provide technical support to the Ministry of
Public Administration for this task.
Investment Climate

48.     Kosovo has achieved significant progress in establishing basic legal frameworks
and institutional structures for a market-oriented economy. Most essential commercial
legislation has been enacted, including laws on companies, bankruptcy, pledges, property
rights, foreign investment, accounting, and mortgages. On several investment climate
indicators, Kosovo is well positioned relative to its neighbors. For instance, labor markets are
relatively flexible and few constraints are imposed on businesses to expand or replace their
                                              14
workforce; the trade regime is open and liberal and the banking sector is relatively dynamic,
following the entry of foreign banks and increasing depositor confidence. However, key
institutional challenges remain, including complicated and fragmented licensing regimes and
weak property rights, which create fertile ground for the grey economy. Some degree of
complexity in business licensing may be unavoidable because it is a municipal responsibility,
and similarly, enforcement of enterprise regulations varies across municipalities. However,
the Government is taking steps to reduce red tape by establishing one-stop-shops, which
should stimulate new business start-ups.

49.    Government has made improving the business environment a priority and
formed a task force with a mandate to improve Kosovo’s ‘Doing Business’ ranking
(currently 117th overall). The task force recently sponsored amendments to business
organizations and internal trade laws that reduce registration costs, simplify procedures,
eliminate work permits, and wave charter capital requirements for limited liability companies.
These improvements could be particularly important for women, as firms with some female
ownership are more likely to report facing certain regulatory hurdles than male-owned firms
(BEEPS, 2009).

50.     Government is taking steps to speed up and ease new business registration. Prior
to establishing one-stop-shops, business registration could take place only in a centralized
office in Pristina, a significant barrier for citizens living outside the capital. In addition, it
takes an estimated 58 business days to obtain the required licenses, permits, and three
business numbers (VAT, fiscal, and business registration). Compliance with regulation is
difficult for existing business too, because regulatory functions are spread across multiple
government levels with little coordination between central and municipal authorities. Central
authorities handle some enterprise sector regulatory functions, such as industry-specific
licensing, business and tax registrations. The one-stop-shop business registration facilities at
the municipal level and efforts to harmonize business numbers across the Ministry of Trade
and Industry (MTI), customs and tax administration are making the process of registering a
business cheaper, easier and quicker.

51.     Uncertainty about property rights is an obstacle to doing business because it is
difficult to buy or lease land for development purposes or to use property for collateral,
but Government is taking steps in this regard. A large proportion of land is built upon
informally or is locked into state-owned and public enterprises, and the liquidation process is
prolonged and not transparent. Many original land tenure documents that were moved to
Serbia during the 1999 conflict have not been returned so only a small fraction of land,
buildings or apartments are registered in the Immovable Property Rights Registration (IPRR).
Improving land, building and apartment registration within the IPRR (managed by the Kosovo
Cadastre Agency) will provide owners with collateral to obtain finance. By December 2011,
68,142 IPRR transactions were recorded, up from 63,534 in 2010. KCA are in the process of
systematically verifying and registering property rights and plan to complete 350 priority
areas over the next five years. The priority areas were selected based on the expected real
estate market activity. Initial results on verified property rights are completed for over 1,200
buildings and nearly 2,000 apartments and are expected during the first six months of 2012
for 26 cadastral zones.



                                               15
52.     Government has eased financing constraints and improved access to credit by
enacting the Leasing Law in June 2009. According to the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK),
the active leasing portfolio up to third-quarter 2011 grew to over €15 million, primarily from
two leasing financial institutions operating in Kosovo. Leasing products have been used for
vehicle purchases and more recently, one bank introduced real estate leasing. Operational
leasing is still underdeveloped in Kosovo due to lack of a secondary market for used
equipment.

53.     To foster and maintain a stable financial system and protect depositors’ interests,
the Government drafted the Law on Banks, Microfinance Institutions (MFI), and non-
Bank financial institutions (NBFI). The Law aims to foster and maintain a stable financial
system through promoting sound and prudent management of banks, microfinance institutions
and other non-bank financial institutions, and through providing an appropriate level of
protection for depositors’ interests. The Law enhances governance standards, introduces
tighter restrictions for lending to bank-related parties and allows consolidated supervision for
banking groups. Additionally, the law strengthens the existing framework for bank
resolutions, including establishing a framework for official administration that authorizes the
CBK to take control of a bank before it reaches insolvency; and provides a clear legal
framework for oversight of MFIs and all other NBFIs.

54.     With the aim of improving borrowers’ rights and access to credit history, the
CBK is revising the Credit Reporting Regulation for the credit registry. These revisions
are aligned with Kosovo law on protection of personal data, based on the EU directive on
protection of personal data. The new regulation will help the credit registry improve its focus
on the rights of borrowers’ and registry users. Insurance companies have been added as credit
providers; borrower’s rights, use of credit and access to information have been strengthened.
In parallel CBK is reforming the credit registry to improve operational capabilities and
expand the scope, including new software, new operating instructions, new marketing
materials, and for users of the registry, eventually improve access to credit.

55.     The MTI is modernizing the pledge registry by undertaking measures for legal
reform, software upgrades and capacity building. The existing pledge registration system
is underdeveloped for financial institutions, which are now unable to learn in real time about
existing claims on property. Purchasers of movable property have no means to inquire about
movable property they wish to purchase. Also, the registry system has security deficiencies in
archive and IT administration, and accounting is now performed manually. The MTI is
revising the pledge law, including registry reform, and creating a supportive and harmonized
environment to remedy some of these drawbacks. The World Bank’s Balkan TA facility is
providing advice on legislative reform and secondary legislation; the Business Environment
Technical Assistance project is supporting hardware and software assistance, and pledge
registry staff capacity building.

Labor Market

56.    Businesses rate the labor market as flexible, but workers perceive that they lack
the protection provided elsewhere in Europe. Rudimentary worker protection was
introduced through the Essential Labor Law (2001), the Labor Inspectorate Law (2002) and
the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Environment Law (2003), but lack of
                                              16
enforcement remained a problem. Moreover, this legislative framework provided for a
flexible labor market in terms of hiring and firing - the Doing Business employment rigidity
index is one of the lowest in the region - but it was still basic and provided limited coverage.20
In addition, labor taxes are low. Thus, pressure on Government was mounting to introduce
new legislation that would increase worker protections and provide generous benefits - e.g.,
longer vacations, restrictions on hours worked, reduced employer flexibility to hire and fire
workers, unemployment insurance, pensions, and health benefits.

57.     Recognizing links between labor taxes, onerous regulation, employment, and a
very high unemployment rate, the Government has prioritized job creation. As a result,
the Government enacted a labor law in 2010 that maintains labor market flexibility in terms of
hiring and firing rules and low labor taxes to avoid negative effects on nascent labor demand
while providing basic worker protections. By doing so, the Government resisted significant
pressures to enact a law that may have been more generous to some workers at the expense of
job creation, formalization and fiscal sustainability. On maternity benefits, though, the labor
law is more generous than ILO guidelines and this provision may lead to reduced female
hires.21 In parallel, the Government focus has turned to enforcing existing provisions.
Effective implementation will require capacity-building efforts in the Ministry of Labor and
Social Welfare and in the Labor Inspectorate.

58.     To encourage the transition from welfare and long-term unemployment to work,
MLSW is implementing a public works program (PWP). To reduce joblessness in the
short-term, MLSW introduced a PWP, with technical support from the World Bank, which
generates temporary employment through labor-intensive projects for Category II Social
Assistance beneficiaries (i.e. eligible poor households with unemployed adult family
members, in which at least one child is aged 5 years or below, or is an or is an orphan up to
age 15) and long-term unemployed (Box 1.). The PWP aims to bridge the gap between
welfare/unemployment and work, which is important because long-term unemployed people
can have difficulty re-establishing the skills required for a successful return to employment
(63 percent of unemployed remain unemployed for more than a year). PWPs provide
beneficiaries with cash income during participation, and with much-needed work experience,
which can increase future employability prospects.


59.     In parallel, the Government is taking steps to improve labor market
intermediary services by strengthening its information base and employment office
capacity. In November 2011 there were about 336,000 paper-based records of registered
unemployed people. Registered unemployment records remain in the system irrespective of
subsequent developments; therefore, the ‘registered unemployed’ could have found work
(either in Kosovo or abroad), suspended their employment search, returned to education or
training, or even died. The paper-based recordkeeping system renders public employment

20
   The Essential Labor Law of 2001 had no provisions obliging employers to cover all employees with insurance
against injuries and related illness; providing special protection for youth, women and persons with disabilities
as well as protection of employees from the violation of the basic rights.
21
   Government is beginning to collect evidence on the impact of maternity benefits on female hires to understand
if it has had a negative impact on female employment, but results are not yet available.
                                                      17
officers’ caseloads unmanageable; in the system, active and passive job seekers are
indistinguishable from each other.22 The MLSW is digitizing the paper-based registry system
of unemployed people, which will lead to better registry system management (allow
automatic separation of active and passive job seekers and decrease the employment office
caseloads). Furthermore, to strengthen public employment service capacity, MLSW initiated a
service delivery review process to evaluate public employment service policy and strategy,
organizational structure and functions, and human and financial resources.

Box 1: Kosovo Public Works Program (PWP)
The MLSW launched a public works program (PWP) to provide labor-intensive work opportunities as part of its
Employment Strategy 2010–2012 to generate short-term jobs for people while more sustainable job creation
measures are put in place.

Unlike many other PWP around the world that use the wage rate as a self-targeting mechanism, Kosovo’s PWP
allows the market to determine the wage rate, which is determined by skills, local wage rates, negotiating power,
etc. However, the PWP explicitly targets poor people by requiring that at least 50 percent of the workers for the
PWP are drawn from Category II of active (receiving benefits) or passive (no longer receiving benefits due to
ineligibility, for example, a child is older than 5 years) Social Assistance recipients. The program commitment to
labor absorption is also demonstrated by the minimum 40 percent labor intensity required in the entire project,
which is generally a small-scale infrastructure community project.

The PWP commenced in May 2010 with the following key objectives: (i) generate temporary employment for
long-term unemployed persons and social assistance beneficiaries who are capable of work, and (ii) rehabilitate
and maintain municipal assets and public spaces. During 2011, MLSW allocated €3 million (€2.1 million in
2010) for this program and implemented 43 (34 in 2010) labor-intensive projects in 28 municipalities (25 in
2010) in Kosovo. Projects included urban regeneration, maintenance and repair of municipal infrastructure and
public spaces and environmental conservation.

The PWP created temporary employment opportunities for about 1,800 people including 1,152 poor and long-
term unemployed people registered in MLSW. Of the 1,152 PWP participants, 654 are recipients of Category II
Social Assistance. The PWP attempts to introduce more activationto provide social assistance beneficiaries
with a route back into the labor market and out of welfare.




22
  In Kosovo, the ratio of employment officers to registered jobseekers is 1:3,696; the ratio is 1:80 in the Czech
Republic, 1:80 in Montenegro, 1:66 in Poland, and 1:77 in Slovenia (Kuddo, 2010).
                                                       18
Education, Skills and Training

60.     Inadequate quality and relevance of education hampers employment. The
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (2008) indicated that 45 percent of
businesses considered worker education and training inadequate; in turn, more than 50 percent
of idle men cited lack of appropriate education and skills as a reason for their inability to find
employment in the 2008 Labor Force Survey (LFS). Vocational training and adult learning
opportunities are offered widely, but remain poorly regulated resulting in low quality and
weak linkages with labor demand. Pre-university education system - including vocational
upper secondary education - faces deep systemic challenges, ranging from limited capacities
and weak financing and accountability arrangements to insufficient training opportunities for
teachers and inadequate infrastructure. Curricula lack relevance and fail to equip students with
marketable skills. At the same time, Kosovo faces challenges in aligning higher education
study programs to labor market needs, efficiently using resources, and implementing all
aspects of quality assurance and accountability mechanisms needed for quality improvements.

61.     Government is implementing reforms to improve pre-university education, with
donor support. The reform agenda, as elaborated in Kosovo Education Strategic Plan
(KESP) hinges on several initiatives. The recently adopted Law on Pre-University Education
clarifies the roles and responsibilities of levels of government in the delivery of education
services. The resource allocation formula is revised and the transfer of greater autonomy to
schools is being piloted. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) will redirect teaching
from subject-based to competency-based curricula with the aim of providing students with
transferable skills. A teacher career system is being developed to assess performance and
improve career opportunities. Instruments for student assessment and examination are being
developed and improved. Finally, school infrastructure standards are being developed and
school capacities increased. The success of these reforms hinges on building capacity at the
central and local level to implement and monitor system performance, including financing,
and to plan and reevaluate policies. It will therefore take several years for these reforms to
take full effect and deliver significant and measurable improvements in outcomes. The World
Bank has been supporting these reforms through the Institutional Development for Education
Project (IDEP), coordinating efforts with other donors.

62.    Government adopted the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan (KESP) that - among
other education sector priorities - recognizes the importance of transforming the
vocational education and training system. The KESP aims to rapidly improve skills with a
four-pronged approach. First, the Government developed a National Qualifications
Framework (NQF) in line with the European Qualifications Framework,23 which establishes
coherent levels of learning outcomes. Second, drawing on the National Qualification
Authority (NQA), and in consultation with stakeholders, the Government developed
occupational standards and accreditation criteria and initiated the accreditation of training
providers in priority sectors.24 Third, the Government approved a NCF that establishes

23
   The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) was adopted by EU Member States and the EU Parliament in
2008 as a Recommendation. The EQF has eight levels of learning outcomes (from primary school to Ph.D.),
which allows comparison of different national qualifications systems so they can be translated, understood, and
recognized abroad thereby supporting individual mobility and integration of European qualification systems.
24
   These include agriculture, commerce and trade, nursing and health care, business administration and
economics, construction, ICT, and metal and wood processing.
                                                      19
competence-based curricula25 for all pre-university education, and a stronger emphasis on
general academic skills for vocational upper secondary education. Fourth, the Government
developed the concept of niche schools, also called Centers of Competence,26 which will
deliver high-quality vocational and technical education with opportunities for short-term skills
upgrade of the existing workforce. SEDPO-2 would support the establishment of the NQF and
the launch of the accreditation process. In its entirety, the reform of the vocational and
technical education system will not only improve the quality and relevance of training and
skills, but also enhance the portability of credits in the local and EU education market,
facilitate transition to higher education, boost worker mobility in the local and EU labor
markets, and contribute to an improved investment climate.

63.     Vocational education and training reform benefits from experience in building
quality-assurance mechanisms for higher education supported under SEDPO-1.
International experience suggests that quality assurance in higher education hinges on an
adequate system for accreditation of institutions and programs.27 Although, Kosovo is not a
signatory, it has aligned its legislation and began reforming its higher education system in
compliance with the principles of Bologna Process.28 Established in 2008, the Kosovo
Accreditation Agency is an independent quality assurance agency responsible for the
accreditation of all higher education institutions (see Box 2). SEDPO-1 supported
Government in initiating the accreditation process and establishing transparent external
quality assurance standards in line with standards and guidelines of the European Association
for Quality Assurance in Higher Education.29 It is anticipated that higher education system
reform will gradually increase access from an estimated enrollment rate of 25 percent in 2011
to 35 percent by 2016.




25
   The NCF foresees six general academic competencies: communication and expression, thinking, learning, life
and work environment, personal competencies, and civic competencies.
26
   Two Centers of Competence offering training in business administration and construction are being piloted
this academic year; two more will be completed in 2012.

   Due to lack of international recognition, Kosovo is not party to the European Cultural Convention of the
Council of Europe and cannot yet become a member of the Bologna Process. However, Kosovo has been granted
observer status since 2003.
29
   In 2010, Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) was granted associate status in the European Association for
Quality Assurance. One of KAA’s objectives for 2012 is full membership in ENQA.

Box 2: Kosovo Successfully Conducted An Accreditation Process For All Higher Education Institutions
After the war in 1999, a handful of private institutions opened and their numbers rose to more than two dozen
within a few years. Some of the schools were for-profit enterprises that provided degrees in exchange for annual
fees of €1,000 to €3,000 without offering quality education. Licenses were granted or withheld in a non-
transparent manner, and several providers began programs without a license, expecting that licenses would be
granted later. An Administrative Instruction establishing the Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) (AI 11/2004)
was issued in February 2004, but the Agency was not established until four years later in 2008.

In July 2008, the British Accreditation Council (BAC) undertook an initial accreditation exercise on behalf of the
KAA. The BAC Report recommended that the Minister of Education issue a license to the American University
of Kosovo only. The Government accepted and endorsed the recommendation. All private providers were
allowed one year to prepare and apply for accreditation. A common methodological approach was adopted that
involved panels of independent, international experts and extensive documentary scrutiny by KAA staff. Several
private providers attempted to merge with other institutions, hoping that the resulting larger size and wider
curriculum scope would permit accreditation as universities.

Eventually, applications were received from 13 institutions/groups during the 2008/09 process. Based on KAA’s
recommendations, the Government decided that (i) one institution failed to meet the criteria and should not be
relicensed; (ii) six institutions were reclassified as colleges (thus permitting them to offer bachelor’s and
master’s programs, but not doctoral studies); (iii) three were reclassified as institutes; (iv) two were reclassified
as higher professional schools; and (v) one was reclassified as a higher technical school. Private providers’
licenses and accreditation were valid for academic year 2009/10, during which period KAA monitored the
institutions to ensure that accredited institutions complied with standards. In mid-2010, KAA assessments
revealed that all private higher education institutions and the University of Pristina had complied with
accreditation standards, and were granted an institutional accreditation for three years. The second public
provider - University of Prizren was accredited for only one year because it did not comply with criteria and
recommendations. The KAA review also found that several departments in public and private higher education
institutions had to close for failure to meet criteria. All recommendations were approved by Government.

HEIs that received the three-year institutional accreditation are required to conduct a self-assessment and submit
an annual report to KAA. They are required to report progress on KAA recommendations provided in their
institutions’ accreditation report. KAA conducts inspections throughout the academic year and is required to
recommend to Government that the license or accreditation be revoked if an institution is in breach.

Social Protection

Social Assistance

64.     Government has focused on measures to encourage employable individuals to
transition from social assistance into the workforce. Kosovo’s Category II Social
Assistance program (i.e. eligible poor households with unemployed adult family members, in
which at least one child is aged 5 years or below, or is an orphan up to age 15),30 is the single
instrument for poverty and unemployment risk. Because benefits are generous, the social
assistance program absorbs 0.7-0.8 percent of GDP or one-fifth of all social protection
spending; while average spending for similar programs is around 0.3 percent of GDP in the
Europe and Central Asia Region. However, coverage rates are low especially in the context of

30
  Social assistance is provided to vulnerable groups under two categories: Category I households are those
households with no adult family members who are capable of working, and Category II households are those
with at least one member of the household capable of working who is registered as unemployed with the PES,
and with at least one child under the age of 5 or an orphan under the age of 15.
                                                        21
high poverty rates – only 9 percent of the population receives Category II Social Assistance
benefits, and only 12 percent of the extreme poor receive benefits. The program is well
targeted; most of the program’s expenditures accrue to households in the bottom quintile.
However, because of its design, the program encourages long-term welfare dependency since
the benefit formula pays the difference between a pre-set threshold and the actual family
income, thus lowering incentives for beneficiaries to seek wage employment. Also, no legal
guarantees exist for re-entry into social assistance after a period of earning, which discourages
beneficiaries from securing short-term jobs.

65.     Government has taken steps to strengthen linkages between social assistance and
active labor market programs, thereby promoting a welfare-to-work transition. The
MLSW is improving coordination between the Department of Labor and Employment and the
Department of Social Welfare and establishing regular data exchange protocols. This
coordination will eventually lead to work-enforcement for Category II Social Assistance
recipients who are capable of work. In addition, to improve information exchanges, the
Government is also easing the welfare-to-work transition though the public works program
(see above) by giving preference to Category II Social Assistance beneficiaries.

Health Insurance

66.     Government faces difficult tradeoffs in improving health and financial protection
to avoid adverse consequences for job creation and macro-stability. Infant, child and
maternal mortality rates are among the highest in Europe. This situation is fueled by low-
quality care and high out-of-pocket expenditures that undermine household financial
protection. Comprehensive reform is imperative, not only to improve health outcomes and
financial protection, but also because access to quality services contributes to a favorable
investment climate. However, reform needs to avoid spending increases financed through
labor taxes (i.e., social health insurance contributions) that create incentives for the informal
labor market, hamper job creation, and increase government financing that contributes to
macro-risks. As a first step, the Government proposed a revision of the health and health
insurance laws that aims to strengthen policy-making, quality assurance, coordination of care
and financial protection. The Government, the World Bank and other development partners
are assessing the proposed reforms to ensure that it does not create significant upward
pressures on social health insurance contributions and government financing.

          IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM AGENDA


LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
67.    The proposed operation is an important component of the proposed Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-15. The CPS is organized around two pillars: (i)
accelerating inclusive growth and employment generation; and (ii) improving environmental
management. The proposed operation is crucial to Pillar I in the CPS. The SEDPP was a key
component of Bank support for Kosovo in the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY10-11; the
focus was on: (i) accelerating inclusive growth and employment generation; and (iii)
supporting social cohesion.

68.    The proposed operation resulted from World Bank Board approval (on July 3,
2008) for using €30 million of IBRD FY08 surplus to provide grant support for Kosovo,
as seed money to attract other donor contributions.31 The Board approved the grant funds
for a programmatic series to be administered by IDA. The World Bank donation raised an
additional €30 million from 10 bilateral and multilateral donors who have partnered with
Government and the World Bank.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
69.     The World Bank team has collaborated closely with the IMF team and other
development partners. The World Bank team worked closely with the IMF during the
Stand-By Agreement and the subsequent Staff Monitored Program. Specific areas of
collaboration have included, but were not limited to, the deposit insurance, Banking Law,
increasing Central Bank capacity, war values law, basic pension and second pillar pensions
law, labor law, health law and health insurance law, and minimum wage policies. The World
Bank team has also worked closely with donors. For example, collaboration with the EC
included providing detailed implementation modalities of the public works program to the EC
and their implementing partner, the International Organization for Migration. Similarly,
collaboration with USAID included improving business environment, Pledge Law, and
business inspection and licensing. Finally, collaboration with KfW has included work on
establishing the deposit insurance fund and providing seed capital.

70.    SEDPO-2 is co-financed by pledges from 10 bilateral and multilateral donors,
which limits transaction costs for Government and donors. SEDPP is the largest joint
financing activity in Kosovo. The 10 pledged donors include the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, the European Commission, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the
United States. There is close coordination among donors and some individual donors are
contributing to the SEDPP by providing additional funds for technical assistance. In addition,
SEDPP collaboration has resulted in closer coordination beyond actions supported through the
Program. Coordination has helped the new Government to avoid the high transaction and
opportunity costs of interacting with multiple donors. Details of donor pledges to SEDPP are
shown in Table 2.



31
     Kosovo also received €4.8 million on IDA terms from the Crisis Response Window under SEDPO-1.

71.     Complementary technical assistance (TA) has been crucial to Government’s
ability to implement the SEDPP-supported reforms. The TA tasks have included the
World Bank and DFID supporting the Employment Strategy; DFID supporting a study on
investment climate, a model for financial decentralization in the social sectors, and a
performance monitoring framework for EDVAP; SIDA, Norway, Switzerland, GIZ and the
World Bank supporting land titling and property rights reforms; the EC and World Bank
supporting business regulation issues; USAID, KfW, Denmark, and the EC supporting access
to finance issues. The KfW and the World Bank provided TA on internal policies and
procedures for the deposit insurance fund of Kosovo. The World Bank provided TA on
banking and insurance supervision and payment systems law to the Central Bank of Kosovo.
The EU and UNICEF, along with the World Bank, are assessing the fiscal and distributional
impacts of reform options in social assistance. The EU plans to continue support for the
review and revision of the social benefits systems. The World Bank provided TA for the labor
law revision, contributed to the debate on minimum wages, and helped to improve the impact
of labor market programs. UNDP assisted MLSW in assessing the structure, organization and
performance of public employment services. Austrian Aid and the British Accreditation
Council supported accreditation of higher education institutions; GIZ and the EC have
supported the National Qualifications Framework for vocational education. The Swiss,
Norwegians and GIZ have also been active in vocational education and establishment of
Centers of Competence. Finland has supported institutional development for inclusive
education. Sweden provided support for capacity building and the development of KESP.
Denmark supports an Employment Promotion Program in horticulture (together with
Switzerland), finance (with the European Fund for Southeast Europe), and in education, an
“Improving Employability of Youth? component, which will help the Ministry of Education,
Science and Technology enhance the employability of graduates from upper secondary
vocational schools in the fields of agriculture and food processing. Finally, the EC, DFID,
USAID, the IMF, GIZ, and IDA support the public financial management reform action plan.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
72.     Government is implementing eight other IDA-financed operations, five of which
are directly linked to SEDPP: (i) the Education Project supports improvements in education
quality in pre-university education and higher education; (ii) the Business Environment TA
(BETA) supports improvements in the investment climate by reviewing business regulation,
licensing, and inspection; (iii) the Financial Sector TA supports improvements in the capacity
                                                             24
of the Central Bank to supervise bank and non-bank financial institutions, which will
strengthen access to finance; (iv) the Public Sector Modernization Project supports the Civil
Service Reform, PFM Reform and Procurement Reform; and (v) the Real Estate Cadastre
Project supports improvements in property rights, which improves the investment climate.

LESSONS LEARNED
73.     Key lessons learned from work in Kosovo and other post-conflict states have
shaped SEDPP preparation. These lessons include: (i) maintaining flexibility
(programmatic approach) while providing a framework for policy development; (ii)
generating significant leverage over policy and legislative reforms despite committing
relatively small budget support; (iii) complementing budget support with technical assistance
provided by the World Bank or other donors; (iv) coordinating donor efforts to support
Government’s reform agenda; and (v) fostering Government ownership.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
74.    SEDPO-2 benefitted from the following major analytical studies: (i) poverty
assessments (2011, 2007); (ii) Human Development policy notes analyzing education, health,
labor markets, and social protection policies (June 2008); (iii) the Kosovo Youth Employment
Study (September 2008); (iv) public expenditure reviews (2007, 2010); (v) Country Economic
Memorandum (2010) focusing on investment climate; (vi) the BEEPS (2009); (vii) Doing
Business Report (2011); (viii) the PEFA assessment and the ‘Quick Gains’ study of the public
procurement system (2009); (ix) public works assessment (2011); (x) Social Safety Nets in
the Western Balkans: Design, Implementation, and Performance (2010-11); (xi) Financial
Sector Stability Report (2011) and (xii) the Kosovo Gender Diagnostics (2012).

           V.    THE PROPOSED SECOND SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT
                        DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION


OPERATION DESCRIPTION
75.     The SEDPP supports Government’s goals to: (i) maintain a sustainable
macroeconomic framework through strengthened public financial management, increased
transparency, and accountability of public expenditures, and (ii) lay institutional and
legislative foundations for sustainable employment and growth. As such, SEDPP is fully
aligned with the Government’s reform plans detailed in the PFM Reform Action Plan and the
Employment Strategy.

76.      The reforms supported by SEDPO-1 contributed towards maintaining
macroeconomic stability and developed the legal and institutional framework for a
coherent strategy on sustainable employment. In particular, SEDPO-1 supported reforms
included: (i) completing the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) self-
assessment in 2009 and adopting an action plan to improve Kosovo’s Public Financial
Management (PFM) system; (ii) enacting a new Civil Service Law that creates uniform pay
and grading structures for the public services, a major step in creating a firm basis to exercise
management and fiscal controls; (iii) completing and adopting a cross-sectoral Employment
Strategy; (iv) adopting a new Leasing Law that allows firms to gain a new source of finance
for machinery and equipment; (v) conducting an accreditation review of higher education
institutions by the Kosovo Accreditation Agency, which will improve the quality of
education; and (vi) increasing funds for social assistance and pensions as a crisis mitigation
measure.

77.     Substantial progress in implementing the reforms (indicative triggers) under the
originally planned second and third operations justifies their merger into a single final
operation (SEDPO-2). The original plan for SEDPP foresaw three operations, in 2009, 2010,
and 2011, but macroeconomic concerns and unplanned Parliamentary elections led to delays
in disbursing SEDPO-1 (which was disbursed in December 2011). However, these delays did
not compromise the momentum behind Government’s reform agenda.

78.     Government has completed 14 out of the 22 indicative triggers identified in
SEDPO-1, and in some cases exceeded originally envisaged outcomes (Table 3
summarizes the implementation status of the indicative triggers specified in SEDPO-1).
Under the public financial management pillar, the Government implemented budget
management reforms to increase transparency, accountability and medium-term fiscal
planning. Within the investment climate pillar, measures were taken to ease business
registration by simplifying the process and increasing the number of locations at which
business registration can take place. In fact, the number of one-stop-shops set up for business
registration is almost three times higher than the number targeted in SEDPO-1. Under the
labor market pillar, the Government enacted the Law on Labor, funded actions supported by
the Employment Strategy, and implemented a public works program. Finally, within the
social protection pillar, the Government strengthened the information base by digitizing the
social assistance registries, paving the way to promote labor market activation of social
assistance beneficiaries.

                                               26
79.    Progress was slower, however, in other reforms. First, measures to implement a
monitoring and evaluation framework for selected programs, including tracking of
performance targets, has been delayed along with civil service reforms due to technical
capacity constraints. Second, under the investment climate pillar, measures to modernize the
pledge registry are being implemented at a slower pace than originally anticipated, but are
expected to take effect in the first half of 2012. Third, plans to consolidate smaller active
labor market programs by establishing a coordinating mechanism were delayed due to human
resource constraints at MLSW. Recently, however, MLSW hired personnel to coordinate
ALMPs and initial steps have been taken to consolidate small ALMPs. Other World Bank
instruments, including the Public Sector Modernization Project, Business Environment TA,
Financial Sector TA, and the labor and social protection TA, are supporting Government
reforms in the above areas.

80.     In some cases Government has re-oriented its reform strategy relative to what
was originally envisioned (as indicative triggers) in SEDPP. Within the education pillar,
the Government changed the focus from developing adult training programs jointly by
Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and MLSW to one that involves other
stakeholders, including employers and private providers. This approach is likely to lead to
better alignment between curricula and labor market needs. Within the social protection pillar,
the Government changed its strategy from revising its targeting methodology to improving
activation of social assistance beneficiaries, by enhancing the information base available to
administrators through a database of social assistance beneficiaries. This will allow for better
links to employment programs. Given that most of the social assistance benefits accrue to
households in the bottom quintile, the shift in focus is justified.

81.    The Government also undertook reforms which contribute to SEDPP
development objectives, but were not identified in SEDPO-1. These reforms are part of the
Government’s strategy to improve civil service job classification, improve the investment
climate, ease the school to work transition, and improve health sector accountability though
an insurance system (see below for details).

82.     The proposed SEDPO-2 prior actions undertaken by the Recipient (Republic of
Kosovo) include nine SEDPO-1 indicative triggers that are critical and timely to achieve
SEDPP objectives (Table 4). Under Pillar I (macroeconomic stability and PFM), four
indicative triggers to strengthen transparency and accountability are now prior actions; under
Pillar II (investment climate), two indicative triggers to reduce barriers to firm entry are
converted into prior actions; under Pillar III (labor market), indicative triggers on passage of
the Law on Labor and implementation of the public works program are converted into prior
actions; and under Pillar V (social protection), the indicative trigger on developing a database
of social assistance beneficiaries is converted into a prior action (see Policy Areas below for
details).

83.     The SEDPO-2 prior actions also include five additional reforms not envisioned
during preparation of SEDPO-1 but that are important and complementary to
achieving SEDPP objectives (Table 4). Under Pillar I, the Government is adopting
regulation on civil service job classification, which specifies coefficients in the new civil
service salary grid; under Pillar II, two new actions are included to improve credit reporting
and strengthen the Banking Law; and under Pillar IV, two new actions have been included to
help to ease the school-to-work transition. (see Policy Areas below for details)

Table 4: SEDPO-2 Prior Actions
Pillar I: Macroeconomic stability and public financial management
1.       The Recipient, through the Public Procurement Regulatory Commission, has adopted
secondary legislation to implement the Public Procurement Law No. 04/L-042, published in the
Official Gazette on September 19, 2011. The Recipient has adopted the Rules of Procedure for the
Central Procurement Agency to conduct consolidated procurement on behalf of the Recipient for
selected procurement categories.

2.      The Recipient has introduced a monitoring and review system for monitoring and reviewing
financial and physical progress of capital expenditure starting in 2011.

3.     The Recipient has included all major capital projects (i.e. those to be financed with public
funds and exceeding €1 million in cost) approved in the Recipient’s 2012 budget in the Public
Investment Program database for 2012.

4.      The Recipient has introduced a mechanism requiring all Ministries to prepare program
performance indicators with their budget submissions, and all Ministries have included program
performance indicators with their respective 2012 budget submissions.

5.     The Recipient has adopted the Regulation on Classification of Jobs in Civil Service No.
05/2012, dated March 2, 2012, specifying the coefficients in the Recipient’s new civil salary grid.
Pillar II: Investment climate
6.       The Recipient, through the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the municipalities, has
established ‘one-stop-shops’ for business registration in at least 22 municipalities.

7.      The Recipient has enacted the amended Law on Business Organizations No. 04/L-006,
published in the Official Gazette on July 22, 2011 and the Law on Internal Trade No. 04/L-005,
published in the Official Gazette on July 21, 2011.

8.      The Recipient, through the Governing Board of the Central Bank of Kosovo, has approved the
Regulation on Credit Registry dated February 24, 2012.
                                                30
9.       The Recipient has submitted to its Parliament the draft Law on Banks, Microfinance
Institutions, and Non-Bank Financial Institutions.
Pillar III: Labor market
10.      The Recipient has enacted the Law on Labor No. 03/L-212, published in the Official Gazette
on December 1, 2010, which regulates employment and labor relations.

11.    The Recipient, through the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, has implemented the Public
Works Program of 2011, and has revised the operation manual for the Public Works Program of 2011
to promote labor market activation for Category II social assistance beneficiaries and long term
unemployed.
Pillar IV: Education, skills and training
12.     The Recipient, through the Steering Committee of the Kosovo National Qualifications
Authority, has approved the National Qualifications Framework.

13.     The Recipient, through the National Qualifications Authority, has issued a call for
accreditation applications from vocational training providers.
Pillar V: Social protection
14.     The Recipient, through the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, has digitized all social
assistance registries.


POLICY AREAS

84.      This proposed operation will support policy reforms to promote macroeconomic
stability and sustainable employment. The policy reforms supported by SEDPO-2 are an
important step in moving Kosovo’s economy towards private sector led growth. Specifically,
SEDPO-2, and more broadly the SEDPP, is organized around five pillars: (i) macroeconomic
stability and public financial management enhancements; and (ii) investment climate
improvements (iii) labor market policies, institutions, and regulations; (iv) education, skills,
and training; and (v) social protection policies. The specific actions have emerged as key from
the Public Financial Management Action Plan and the Employment Strategy.

85.      This proposed operation supports PFM actions aimed at addressing some of the
most pressing weaknesses identified by the recent PEFA assessment and investment
climate actions expected to increase domestic and foreign investment. The PFM actions
are expected to address budget under-execution for capital expenditure; weak procurement
capacity and poor payroll management for civil service (see Section III). In parallel,
investment climate measures (Pillar II) address key bottlenecks to firm entry and growth by
easing business registration across the territory and improving access to finance and financial
stability. Combined, these sets of actions are expected to increase domestic and foreign
investment, which would in turn increase employment opportunities and raise incomes.
Reforms in business are also expected to support increasing formalization of enterprises and
with it, formal employment opportunities.

86.    The Program also addresses complementary constraints to effective job creation
through labor regulations and more effective jobs intermediation (Pillar III), building
quality human capital (Pillar IV), and labor force participation among the most

                                                31
vulnerable (Pillar V). In particular the new labor law will provide a framework to protect
workers from exploitative working conditions, while keeping the employer burden low.
Accreditation of vocational education training providers is likely to signal worker ability to
potential employers, thereby improving employment outcomes. Finally, measures to digitize
the social assistance registry are likely to improve linkages between social assistance
beneficiaries and labor market programs. Some of these measures are likely to help job
creation in the short term - public works could help to activate social assistance beneficiaries
and passage of the national qualification framework is likely to have an impact on job creation
in the short term through the and improving signaling in domestic and international labor
markets.

Pillar I: Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management

87.     Prior action 1: The Recipient, through the Public Procurement Regulatory
Commission, has adopted secondary legislation to implement the Public Procurement
Law No. 04/L-042, published in the Official Gazette on September 19, 2011. The
Recipient has adopted the Rules of Procedure for the Central Procurement Agency to
conduct consolidated procurement on behalf of the Recipient for selected procurement
categories. This prior action is expected to increase competition, value-for-money, and
transparency in public procurement by attracting more bidders, achieving economies of scale,
and reducing the current degree of fragmentation of public procurement, thereby facilitating
effective fiduciary controls. More specifically, this prior action will ensure that secondary
legislation is updated in time to avoid uncertainties in implementation of revised Public
Procurement Law, which would cause delays, complaints, and increase procurement process
compliance risks.

88.     Prior action 2: The Recipient has introduced a monitoring and review system for
monitoring and reviewing financial and physical progress of capital expenditure starting
in 2011. This measure is expected to improve governance in the use of public funds by
strengthening accountability for performance in a category of expenditure where it typically
has been difficult to achieve execution levels anticipated in the budget. It is thus expected to
increase the transparency of capital expenditure and reduce scope for irregularities such as the
reported practice of making advance payments to contractors at the end of the fiscal year prior
to the delivery of the required goods or works. It will also facilitate reallocation, where
appropriate, to allow for the most effective use of the capital budget.

89.     Prior action 3: The Recipient has included all major capital projects (i.e. those to
be financed with public funds and exceeding €1 million in cost) approved in the
Recipient’s 2012 budget in the Public Investment Program database for 2012. Under-
execution of capital investments remains an issue, partly due to over-budgeting. This measure
will help to improve the credibility of fiscal projections and allow for better management of
capital expenditures. This will in turn facilitate access to budget support from the international
community, progress toward the strategic goal of integration with the European Union, and in
the longer run, allow Kosovo to secure access to debt financing.

90.    Prior action 4: The Recipient has introduced a mechanism requiring all
Ministries to prepare program performance indicators with their budget submissions,
and all Ministries have included program performance indicators with their respective
                                               32
2012 budget submissions. Public expenditure management weaknesses are partly due to a
lack of expenditure management oversight among executing agencies in terms of strategic
policy priorities. This reform puts in place a mechanism to strengthen the linkage of strategic
planning, budget allocation and expenditure monitoring in the line ministries and
municipalities with their relevant executing agencies. It will also allow for more timely
provision of information on expenditure needs for budget management of service delivery
units.

91.     Prior action 5: The Recipient has adopted the Regulation on Classification of
Jobs in Civil Service No. 05/2012, dated March 2, 2012, specifying the coefficients in the
recipient’s new civil salary grid. The new civil service salary/grading structure is expected
to provide a high degree of transparency in civil service salaries, reducing scope for abuses
and creating a basis for career development. The regulation will facilitate budgetary provision
for transition to the salary grid in the budget of 2013. To this end, the Government is
reviewing the fiscal impact assessment based on the initial 2009 assessment and taking
account of the salary increase awarded in 2010 as well as any (minor) staffing changes. Costs
would result from salary equalization to eliminate pay distortions for same-grade positions.

92.     The outcome of macroeconomic stability and PFM reforms will be measured
through the following indicators: (i) deviation of actual from budgeted capital and recurrent
expenditure less than 10 percent in more than one year between 2009 and 2012 and the
variance in capital and recurrent expenditure composition overall deviation less than 5 percent
in any year between 2009 and 2012; (ii) 2013 budget includes consolidated procurement in at
least two procurement categories; and (iii) job classification completed for core civil servants
working at the central government level.

Pillar II: Investment Climate

93.    Prior action 6: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Trade and Industry and
the municipalities, has established ‘one-stop-shops’ for business registration in at least
22 municipalities. High barriers to business registration have been identified as significant
impediments to private sector growth. This reform will lower the barriers to entry for
businesses, thus creating potential for increased domestic and foreign investments. Out of 30
municipalities, 22 one-stop-shops have been established to date through the BETA project.32
The indicative trigger in SEDPO-1 envisioned only eight one-stop-shops, thus Government
exceeded the envisioned targets with this action.

94.    Prior action 7: The Recipient has enacted the amended Law on Business
Organizations No. 04/L-006, published in the Official Gazette on July 22, 2011 and the
Law on Internal Trade No. 04/L-005, published in the Official Gazette on July 21, 2011.
The business registration process has been simplified by removing the provision requesting
deposit of the minimum startup capital of €5,000 for limited liability companies and by
reducing startup capital for joint stock companies from €25,000 to €10,000. Shortening the
time period for obtaining a Business Certificate to three days and removing the payment for



32
  Additionally, four more one-stop-shops are expected to be opened through the Business Start-up Centre, an
EU-funded project launched by the MTI in coordination with BETA project
                                                    33
business registration will enhance business start-ups, and reduce the time to start a business.
These improvements could be particularly important for firms with some female ownership.

95.     Prior action 8: The Recipient, through the Governing Board of the Central Bank
of Kosovo, has approved the Regulation on Credit Registry dated February 24, 2012.
This regulation will improve credit data, customer care and user access to individual credit
histories. The previous credit reporting regulation covered only Credit Registry reporting;
under the new regulation, insurance companies qualify as credit providers and borrower’s
rights regarding credit and access to information are now regulated, in line with the EU
directive on data information.

96.     Prior action 9: The Recipient has submitted to its Parliament the draft Law on
Banks, Microfinance Institutions (MFI), and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI).
The Law aims to foster and maintain a stable financial system by promoting prudent bank,
MFI, and other NBFI management; and protect depositors’ interests. The Law enhances
governance standards, introduces tighter restrictions for lending to bank-related parties and
allows consolidated supervision for banking groups. Furthermore, the Law strengthens quality
requirements of the existing framework for bank resolutions; it establishes a framework for
official administration that authorizes the CBK to take control of a bank before it reaches
insolvency. The new law assigns CBK responsibility for licensing MFIs and provides a legal
framework for registration, supervision and regulation of MFIs and all other NBFIs. Although
the prior action refers to the draft law being submitted to Parliament, the Government is
committed to adopting the law without substantive amendments within the first half of 2012.

97.     The outcomes of these reforms to improve the investment climate are measured
by the following indicators: (i) number of days needed to register a business reduced to less
than 40 days; (ii) banks’ leasing portfolio increased from zero in 2009 to at least €15 million
at end-2012; and (iii) governance standards (single shareholder and borrower exposures,
resident board representation) of banks are strengthened. The SEDPO-1 included three other
indicators; the first two33 have been dropped because the BEEPS survey has not been
undertaken since 2009, and the third indicator (on the increase in number of apartments
registered with Kosovo Cadastre Agency) is replaced by an indicator on the volume of the
leasing portfolio, which more accurately reflects the impact of improving property rights on
the increase in access to finance.

Pillar III: Labor Market

98.     Prior action 10: The Recipient has enacted the Law on Labor No. 03/L-212,
published in the Official Gazette on December 1, 2010, which regulates employment and
labor relations. The Law on Labor provides reasonable protection for workers (e.g., prohibits
discrimination based on gender and disability, forced or compulsory labor, child labor, etc.),
allows part time work, allows for paid and unpaid maternity leave.34 The Law, however,
limits costs and impediments to employers, a deliberate attempt by Government to maintain

33
   “Reduction in percentage of firms indicating a problem in access to finance from 55 to 45 percent? and
“reduction in percentage of firms indicating problems with business licensing and regulation from 47 to 37
percent.?
34
   Most of the articles of the labor law are reasonable given the Kosovo context. The maternity leave provision is
however, somewhat more generous than international experience would suggest.
                                                       34
labor market flexibility. The Government plans to strengthen labor inspection by creating an
appropriate structure and organization for labor inspection. Although this Law was enacted in
December 2010, the importance of the law to workers in Kosovo and the inclusion of the Law
as an indicative trigger in SEDPO-1 justify its inclusion as a prior action in this operation.

99.     Prior action 11: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare, has implemented the Public Works Program of 2011, and has revised the
operation manual for the Public Works Program of 2011 to promote labor market
activation for Category II social assistance beneficiaries and long term unemployed. This
measure aims to provide Category II social assistance (eligible poor households with
unemployed adult family members, in which at least one child is aged five years or below, or
is an orphan up to age 15) beneficiaries and long-term unemployed people with a bridge to the
labor market by providing short-term employment in the public works program. The program
allows flexible entry and exit from social assistance and is a key intervention to create
employment in the short run while providing support to the most vulnerable families. The
Government is committed to implementing the Public Works Program in 2012 with a €3
million budget.

100. The outcomes of labor market policy reforms are measured through the
following indicators, which operationalize the general outcomes specified in SEDPO-1:35
(i) at least 75 percent of planned measures in the Employment Strategy’s Action Plan for 2011
are completed; and (ii) at least 33 percent of public works participants are Category II Social
Assistance benefit recipients in 2011 and in 2012 up from less than 10 percent in 2010, with
data on beneficiaries disaggregated by gender.

Pillar IV: Education, Skills and Training

101. Prior action 12: The Recipient, through the Steering Committee of the Kosovo
National Qualifications Authority, has approved the National Qualifications
Framework. The NQF was finalized and adopted in December 2011. It defines the national
mechanism for classifying qualifications according to criteria that define levels of learning
outcomes, which are aligned with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). It thus
provides a basis for cooperation with the EQF and other EU instruments.36 The NQF is
expected to improve the quality and transparency of qualifications, improve linkages with
labor market, and facilitate recognition (signaling) of qualifications in Kosovo and the EU,
thereby improving opportunities for labor mobility.

102. Prior action 13: The Recipient, through the National Qualifications Authority,
has issued a call for accreditation applications from vocational training providers. The
accreditation of vocational training providers is the first step toward implementing NQF. The
NQA has developed and piloted accreditation criteria for vocational education training
providers, and will issue a call for applications in February 2012 for two out of the eight

35
   The SEDPO-1 policy matrix included the following general outcome indicators: (i) employment strategy and
action plan is reflected in the MTEF; (ii) elements of the employment strategy and action plan requiring
budgetary allocations are reflected in annual budgets; and (iii) employment strategy and action plan are
implemented on the expected timetable.
36
   Now, no formal provision exists to link non-EU member states to the EQF, but the Kosovo NQF-level
descriptors are strongly influenced by the EQF descriptors thus facilitating comparison of Kosovo qualifications.
                                                      35
priority sectors for which it has developed and approved occupational standards. To be
accredited, providers must meet criteria for quality of assessment and certification including
capacity to deliver and assess qualifications. Accreditation is valid for fixed time periods and
subject to review. The NQA has developed guidance for providers in the form of toolkits and
manuals on developing qualifications, a checklist for self-assessment and guidance defining
occupational standards. This policy measure is expected to increase the accuracy of
qualifications signaling to employers (local and international), and quality of training through
specified standards that providers must meet.

103. The outcomes of the education, skills and training reforms are measured through
the following: (i) NQA initiates accreditation of at least 6 vocational training institutions in
2012; and (ii) all accredited public and private higher education institutions have established
internal quality assurance mechanisms, as per the guidelines developed by the KAA.

Pillar V: Social Protection
104. Prior action 14: The Recipient, through the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare, has digitized all social assistance registries. Data from the old registry are being
uploaded into the new web-based system. The new management information system will help
to promote activation by allowing information exchanges with the employment offices.

105. The main outcome of social protection reforms is: monthly pension and benefits for
children in social assistance beneficiary families have increased by at least €5 and €5 per child
per month, respectively, compared to the level in 2009.37




37
   SEDPO-1 included the expected outcome indicator of “at least 2000 beneficiaries in welfare-to-work
programs,? but SEDPO-2 proposes to move this indicator to Pillar III (labor, skills, and training) because it
aligns with public works programs that are implemented under the employment strategy and action plan.
                                                     36
                               VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

106. The operation is expected to have primarily positive poverty and social impacts,
particularly through the education/employment nexus. The following components are
expected to have positive poverty and social impacts, including on gender equality, although
it is not possible to quantify the anticipated impacts with existing data.
               New civil service job classification/salary scales are expected to have some
                positive effects on poverty and gender. Most civil servants earn above the poverty
                line, but some live below the poverty line due to lower salaries and/or a larger
                number of dependents to support. Salaries within grade are generally being
                equalized by adjusting low salaries upwards; high salaries will remain constant.
                The only anticipated income losses are for civil servants identified as grossly
                under-qualified for their positions; they will be reassigned to lower-paying
                positions.38 Furthermore, this reform will have a particular impact on women
                workers, given that over half of employed women (56.6 percent) are in the civil
                service.
               Actions to improve the investment climate—such as one-stop-shops for business
                registration, easing requirements for business start-ups, and harmonizing business
                numbers—are expected to increase domestic and foreign business investment,
                which will increase employment opportunities and raise incomes. Actions
                emphasize easing business registration outside of Pristina should enhance their
                poverty-reducing impact. As female-owned firms have a more negative perception
                about the business climate in Kosovo (BEEPS, 2009), this reform could have a
                particular positive impact on firms of women entrepreneurs.
               Reforms in business and credit regulations are expected to support increasing
                formalization of enterprises, and in turn, formal employment opportunities.
               Employment registry digitization is expected to improve provision of employment
                services to the unemployed, although caseload levels will remain very high.
               Accreditation of vocational education training providers is likely to improve
                training opportunities and employment outcomes as workers build skills to meet
                changing labor force demands and benefit from formal certification.
107. Reforms to the social assistance system are expected to have net positive poverty
and social impacts. Available data permit rough estimation of the quantitative impact of
these reforms on poverty. Several reforms will produce unambiguously positive impacts.
               An unambiguously positive poverty impact is expected from increased labor
                activation for able-bodied Category II Social Assistance recipients. Increased
                activation through stricter work requirements, supported by expanded public
                works, will provide immediate benefits of employment for 600 poor individuals, at
                a pay rate higher than Category II Social Assistance benefits. Employment through
                public works will allow these existing Category II Social Assistance recipients to

38
     Existing data do not permit quantification of people affected.
                                                          37
           expand their work experience and improve future employment prospects, but allow
           them to return to social assistance if they are unable to secure longer-term
           unemployment.
          Higher benefits for Category II Social Assistance recipients are also
           unambiguously positive. Category II Social Assistance beneficiaries will receive
           higher payments; (i) indexed benefits will prevent erosion of purchasing power;
           (ii) the maximum number of recipients per family will be raised from 7 to 15; (iii)
           a €5.0 per month child allowance will be implemented; and (iv) the gross standard
           rate for all family sizes will be increased. Simulations based on recent data
           indicate that the higher Category II Social Assistance benefit levels will reduce the
           poverty rate by at least 0.2 percentage points (34.4 to 34.2) and the poverty gap by
           at least 0.4 percentage points (9.6 to 9.2). The simulations indicate a drop in the
           extreme poverty rate of at least 0.7 percentage points, from 12.1 to 11.4.

Consultation with Stakeholders

108. The Employment Strategy has been discussed with social partners, as well as
donors. The Government organized consultations between July – November, 2009 during
which the draft Employment Strategy was presented to stakeholders and comments solicited.
A workshop was held in November 2009 with key social partners, the Chamber of Commerce
of Kosovo, Alliance of Kosovo Businesses, the Union of Independent Trade Unions of
Kosovo, and the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Kosovo and comments were reflected
in the final document. In addition, a Performance Framework was developed to evaluate
whether Employment Strategy implementation is carried out in a transparent and open
manner.

109. In June 2011, shortly after the formation of new Parliament and Government,
the Kosovo Economic Development Vision Action Plan (EDVAP) was developed and
adopted by the Government. The EDVAP builds on the reforms supported through existing
sectoral strategies, including the Employment Strategy. The preparation of this
comprehensive economic plan followed high-level brainstorming on economic priorities by
Cabinet members in April 2011 and contributions from other decision makers as well as
international organizations and bilateral partners. In addition, the preparation of EDVAP
involved consultation with non-government stakeholders, in particular the business
community.

110.    Donors and stakeholders commented on the PFM Reform Action Plan when it
was distributed in July 2009. Extensive intergovernmental consultations took place on the
Action Plan given that its implementation will require changes in the processes affecting
individual line ministries, budget organizations, and municipalities. Subsequent updates on
implementation progress of the PFM Reform Action plan in 2010 and 2011 have provided
further opportunities to scrutinize and comment on priorities and achievements under the plan.

ENVIRONMENTAL, FORESTS, AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCE ASPECTS
111. Specific policies supported by the operation are unlikely to have significant
effects on Kosovo’s environment, forests, and natural resources. Most measures supported
under the operation are geared to increasing sustainable employment and improving public
                                              38
financial management. These will cover improvements in business licensing, property rights,
access to finance, and improvements in education, labor market policies, institutions, and
regulations, and in pension and social assistance provision. The public financial management
reforms will focus on increasing transparency and accountability in public finances and
improved public wage bill management. None of the sectors included in the operation is
expected to have any significant links to the environment.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
112. SEDPO-2 will require close coordination between the World Bank team and the
respective institutions responsible for implementation. The institutions include Ministries
of Finance; Trade and Industry; Local Government Administration; municipalities; Labor and
Social Welfare; Education, Science and Technology; and Public Service; the Public
Procurement Agency, the Public Procurement Regulatory Committee, the National
Qualifications Authority, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Central Bank of Kosovo.
The institutions will provide requisite baseline data against which outcomes will be measured
at the end of the Program. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through the Inter-
Ministerial Committee on Sustainable Employment will coordinate reporting on Program
monitoring indicators.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
113. The Public Financial Management system in Kosovo is adequate to support a
DPO, and Government has demonstrated strong commitment to continued PFM reform.
Recently Kosovo received substantial external support and made significant progress in
establishing a workable Public Financial Management (PFM) system, including with support
from donor-financed projects (e.g., USAID, EC, DFID, CIDA, and World Bank). The main
strength of the PFM system remains the Single Treasury Account and automated payments
system, which is now used by all primary spending units (ministries, agencies, and
municipalities) enabling centralized budget execution and production of timely and reliable
financial reports. In conjunction with the automated Treasury system, the detailed and
comprehensive chart of accounts, which includes municipal budgets, identifies all
expenditures by administrative, functional, and project codes, and by source of funds, which
allows for a high level of transparency in public expenditure.

114. Kosovo’s PFM performance has improved in recent years, as indicated by the
PEFA assessment (2009). Relevant reforms are underway as part of Government PFM
Reform Action Plan (PFMRAP) adopted in late 2009 to address the main weaknesses
identified in the PEFA assessment. These include establishing a rolling multi-year budget
process that integrates strategic and investment planning while minimizing deviations from
budget appropriations during budget execution. In line with the PFMRAP, the triggers for
SEDPO-2 included measures to improve the linkage of public expenditures to the policy
framework and strengthen the credibility of public expenditure planning, targeting capital
expenditure in particular. The 2009 PEFA reports rated donor practices ‘poor’ with regard to
channeling aid funds to Kosovo (D scores in all three indicators). Recent SIGMA reports
(2009-2011) note that planning processes of external and internal funds are not adequately
harmonized, donor coordination remains a challenge, and most donor funds are still channeled
outside the budget. The usage of budget support, including through SEDPO, remains a key
method for coordinating donor dialogue with Government, increasing the predictability and
transparency of donor assistance, and strengthening incentives for the further improvement of
                                              39
the PFM system. The final budget report is prepared by Treasury, and the legal date for
submission is respected and statements are submitted no later than March 31 from the closure
of the fiscal year. This is supported also by evaluations from the Office of Auditor General.

115. Control environment for foreign exchange in the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK).
In 2010, the IMF conducted a Safeguard Assessment of the CBK; it concluded that the CBK
had in place key safeguards concerning external audit, foreign exchange reserves, and
financial reporting frameworks. In particular, (a) CBK annual financial statements are
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards by qualified CBK
accounting staff; (b) CBK external audits are performed in accordance with International
Standards and by a qualified professional audit firm; and (c) audit opinions refer to
International Standards on Audit, were unqualified, and issued within the mandated deadline
for completion. The report highlighted that going forward, internal audit independence needs
to be strengthened by transferring incompatible control responsibilities, and expanding IT
audits.

116. The fiduciary risk for this development policy operation is assessed as moderate.
The fiduciary risk is based on two dimensions: (i) the overall PFM environment in Kosovo
and (ii) the clean audit opinions of the Central Bank of Kosovo. The government’s core PFM
systems (budget management, treasury, in-year and annual reporting, external audit, etc.)
function well. Additionally, the Bank (and the donor community) is continuing to work with
the government to follow-up on the PEFA report recommendations to further advance the
performance and strengthen the country’s PFM systems.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
117. Legal and Disbursement Arrangements. World Bank Group disbursement
procedures for development policy operations will be followed. The operation will be
financed from a €23 million trust fund that was established to support the programmatic
operation. It consists of funding from FY08 IBRD surplus administered by IDA following the
World Bank Board decision of July 3, 2008. The operation is co-financed by grants arising
from contributions by ten bilateral and multilateral donors amounting to €12.1 million and
US$1.8 million. The financing terms and conditions for the IBRD surplus funds administered
by IDA will be reflected in a Trust Fund Grant Agreement between the Republic of Kosovo
(as Recipient) and IDA, acting as administrator for the IBRD surplus funds; and two separate
Grant Agreements between IDA, as administrator of donor funds, and the Republic of Kosovo
in respect of other donor funds.

118. Upon effectiveness of the Trust-Fund Financed Grant Agreement and IDA
Financing Agreement, the Republic of Kosovo (the Recipient) will submit a withdrawal
application to IDA. IDA will disburse the Grant proceeds to a dedicated Government
account (deposit account) held at the Central Bank of Kosovo, which forms part of the official
national foreign exchange reserves. The deposit account will be available for financing
budgeted expenditures. The Recipient will ensure that upon deposit of the net proceeds of the
financing into said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the Recipient’s budget
management system. The Government will confirm to IDA within 30 days of receipt of the
disbursement, by sending a confirmation letter on the Grant amounts deposited in the foreign
currency accounts and credited to the budget management system. If any proceeds of the
financing/grant are used to finance ineligible expenditures as defined in the Grant
                                             40
Agreements, IDA will require the Recipient to promptly refund said amount. Amounts
refunded to IDA upon such request shall be cancelled.

119. No audit will be required under this Development Policy Operation. The
administration and accounting of the Loan proceeds will be the responsibility of the Ministry
of Finance. The established treasury procedures, rules and regulations will be followed for
loan administration and accounting. The Government will maintain accounts and records
showing that credit disbursements were made in accordance with provisions of the Financing
Agreement. The MOF will be responsible for the DPO administration and for preparing the
withdrawal application. The MOF, with the assistance of the Central Bank of Kosovo, will
maintain records of all transactions under the DPO in accordance with sound accounting
practices. As previously noted, the central bank’s annual reports (which includes the audited
financial statements, the auditor’s unqualified, or clean, audit opinion and management letter)
indicate that there are no strong prevailing reasons for the Bank to request an audit of the
deposit account or to require additional safeguard measures, as permitted under OP 8.60.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
120. There are substantial risks associated with the implementation of the Program.
The risks include:
(i)     Macroeconomic risks. Kosovo’s uneven track record in fiscal management raises
        questions about medium-term macroeconomic stability, together with a contagion risk
        from a European growth slowdown. In addition, authorities may experience increasing
        pressure to satisfy political demands for social benefits (including additional veterans’
        benefits), which may threaten macroeconomic stability. The IMF’s SMP and the
        announced staff level agreement on an SBA in addition to SEDPO-2 Grant financing,
        are strong incentives for Government to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework.
        Should the new 20-month, €107 million, SBA materialize, the Government will also
        be in a better position to address potential growth shocks. In addition, the World Bank,
        through technical assistance on sustainable employment will help Government better
        communicate to stakeholders the nature and medium-term benefits of SEDPP-
        supported reforms.

(ii)    Weak labor market institutions and MLSW capacity constraints could limit the
        impact of employment promotion measures and create disincentives for take up.
        This institutional risk is mitigated by cleaning and updating the unemployment
        registries, and by ongoing World Bank technical assistance for design and delivery of
        labor market programs that address the needs and constraints of active job seekers.

(iii)   Governance and political structures could destabilize if faced with significant
        shocks. Kosovo’s governance systems still lack full transparency and accountability,
        hence, are vulnerable to domestic unrest and political pressures. Governance and
        political developments will need to be followed closely as related problems could
        undermine external development support activities. Actions to improve public
        financial management, including actions supported by SEDPO-2 and the ongoing
        Public Sector Modernization Project to improve transparency in information systems,
        should help to reduce risks stemming from a lack of full transparency and
        accountability.

                                               41
(iv)   Some reforms aimed at improving governance and transparency could encounter
       resistance. For example, implementation of consolidated procurement may be delayed
       in some institutions. Likewise, introducing a unified pay and grading scale for core
       civil service, although broadly supported by civil servants, may encounter difficulties
       due to potential pressures within line ministries and municipalities to place staff in the
       highest possible grade. If not checked, such pressures could result in high fiscal costs,
       prompting further delays or aborting reform efforts. Such political economy risks will
       therefore need to be regularly tracked, as reform implementation progresses. A phased
       reform implementation approach (supported by the ongoing PSMP project) is
       expected to enable the dissemination of results (e.g., cost savings resulting from
       consolidated procurement), which would increase support for reforms.
