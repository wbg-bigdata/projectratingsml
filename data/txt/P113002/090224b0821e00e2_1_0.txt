                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original project was approved on September 30, 2008 with a Closing Date of September 30, 2011. With the approval of the Additional Financing on May 26, 2010, the Closing
                         Date for the original project was also extended to match that of the Additional Financing, until September 30, 2013. The project was restructured on September 26, 2013 following
                         which the closing date was extended to September 30, 2014. Other key changes in the restructuring include:
                         a. Cancellation of SDR 3,444,000.00 (US$ 5.34 million equivalent) with cancellations detailed as follows:

                         b. Revision to the Results Framework is limited to the addition of two intermediate indicators. These indicators are being added in order to reflect the results of the Community
                         Challenge Fund (sub-component 1b) and the Strengthening Safety Net Systems subcomponent (sub-component 1c) as these are the main pieces being implemented during the
                         proposed extension period.

                         Implementation of the project is satisfactory, with two sub components having met their targets (component 1a (public works) and component 2(support to seeds and fertilizers ) and
                         the other two main sub components (community challenge fund and strengthening safety nets system) having accelerated implementation since the restructuring.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured on September 26, 2013 following which
                         1. the closing date was extended to September 30, 2014.
                         2.There was a cancellation of US $5.34 million.
                         3. Components 1a and 2 have achieved their targets, as such during the extension period implementation (from October 1 2013 onwards) is focused on implementation of remaining
                         commitments: component 1b and 1c
                         Two indicators were added to the results framework to better monitor the results under components 1b (community challenge fund) and 1c (strengthening safety net systems)
                         4. A supervision review is planned for end of January 2014, and the ISR will be updated following that review.
