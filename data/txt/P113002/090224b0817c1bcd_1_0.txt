                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The suspension of disbursement under this project that was placed due to an unresolved audit issue has been lifted. The audit issue was resolved in mid August 2012.
                         The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Local Development has requested the Ministry of Finance for extension of the project up to July 2014. The extension is requested to support the
                         implementation of cash for work program through the Ministry's own systems, establish and implement a Management Information System (MIS) for the cash transfers programs and
                         pilot the payments through branchless banking for a full cycle (i.e. one fiscal year).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
