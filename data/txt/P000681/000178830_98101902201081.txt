INTERNATIONiT. DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATTON OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THFE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Empire of Ethiopia in an amount
equivalent to US$10.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance
a third education project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        P. report "Cirrent Position and Prospects of the Ethiopian
Economy" (AE-21) was circulated on November 18, 1971 (R71-257).
The report of a recent economic mission is nearing completion. A
Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex T.
3.        Virtually isolated from modern science and technology until
the middle of the twentieth century, Ethiopia is recognized to be one
of the twenty-five least developed countries.  The per capita income
is $76 a vear and some 85 percent of the population of 25 million are
presently farmers.  Agriculture accounts for about 90 percent of
employment, 58 percent of GDP,  and almost all exports.  Mantfacture
contributes only around 5 percent of GDP.
4.       During the last two decades the Government has made notable
efforts to accelerate the pace of development. Ethiopia is now in
its Third Five-Year Plan. The first two plans gave priority to the
development of infrastructure, and the establishment of manufacturing
industries (mainly government-financed) based on import substitution.
The Third Plan emphasizes the development of agriculture and of
activities such as feeder road construction which directly support
agricultural development. However, progress has been below Plan
targets. Institutions are changing only gradually, and this slow pace
of institutional change has inhibited rapid growth. Additional cons-
training factors have been the low and somewhat uneven capital inflow
and fluctuations in the world price of coffee (which accounts for
about 60 percent of Ethiopia's exports), leading to large fluctuations
in investment. With respect to aid, Ethiopia, unlike many other



-2-
African countries which were formerly denendent, has no traditional
source of technical and financial. help.
W.        Over the past decade, per capita GDP has grown at about 2
percent a year.  Growth would have been even lower but for a 16 oercent
annual rate of growth of the manufactluri.ng sector based on import
substitution. The economy was particularly sluggish during the late
1960's, although there was a sharp upturn in the economy for abouit a
year beginning in mid-1969, attributable to a rise in coffee prices.
UJnfortunately, coffee prices declined in 1ate 1.970 and although they
have risen again since mid-July 1972, future prices are uncertain.
Partly becaulse the opportunities for further impo-t substitution were
more limited, the growth of manufacturing during the nast several years
was less rapid. than before and,the economy as a whole has grown at
or below the l.5 percent average for the 1.960's, and below the 6 per-
cent growth target of the Third Five-Year Plan whiich expires in 1974.
Jith population growing at 2.5 percent, per capita GDP has not risen at
the 3.5 percent envisaged in the Plan. As a result of these develop-
ments, the investment and growth targets for the remainder of the Plan
are not expected to be realized. Also, while total population grew at
2.5 percent a vear, the urban population rose at 7 percent a year and
the problem of urbar tanemployment is becoming more significant.
6.        Turning to the future, the last economic mission projected
that the rate of growth of total export earnings after a few years of
growth reflecting higher prices is likely to decline, particularly
after 1975. Assuming there is a limit on external capital inflow,
this implies that the availability of foreign exchange resources will
increase at a decreasing rate, and finally decline absolutely.  Foreign
exchange resource availability largely determines the growth of invest-
ment, production and large parts of consumption, and through them the
growth of GDP. Thus, unless the inflow of external capital increases
substantially, and unless the rate of growth of non-coffee exports
and of total export earnings is significantly rai.sed, the economic
growth rate may decline to below the populatiion growth rate during
the nex:t fifteen years.  Export. possibilities other than coffee include
livestock, fresh fruit and vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds.   Increas-
ing exports, however, depends on providing the appropriate incentives
to producers andi marketing intermediaries.  Experience in other
countries suggests that the pattern of agricultural output is respon-
sive to changes in the relative prices of agricultural commodities.
Furthermore, some preliminary work undertaken in Ethiopia concludes
that the supply ci a number of export commodities has responded posi-
tively tc changes in prices. It appears, therefore, that if the foreign
exchange constraint is tu be confronted in an effective manner, policy
measures should be taken which affect relative prices in a way which
discourages imports and encourages exports.
7.       With respect to capital inflows, Ethiopia has attracted only
modest amounts of private capital, and thus depends mainly on public



capital inflow. Annual gross capital inflows have been only $1.25
per capita in the past five years (see page 3 of Annex 1 . Given
Ethiopia's low GDP and the resultant low availability of domestic
resources, this level is not adequate to support a rate of investment
necessary for the achievement of a reasonable growth rate. With
regard to public savings, performance has improved in recent years, but
is below taxable capacity.
8.        The Bank Group is pursuing a number of activities to support
the Government's developmernt strategy.  A mission visited Ethiopia to
make a comprehensive study of the agricultural sector and the resulting
report was recently circulated to the Executive Directors (R73-37).
The Ethiopian Government, with IDA assistance, has undertaken a review
of the education sector to enable it to design a strategy, policies,
and curricula which will produce the trained manpower needed for
Ethiopiars development. The Bank is executing agency for a UNDP-
financed study of internal air transport with special regard to
tourism development, and for a UNDP project which is providing a team
of experts to help the Government in improving its planning.
9.        The Agricultural Sector Mission has concluded that the prob-
lem of Ethiopian agriculture is one of supply, mark-eting, and proces-
sing, rather than demand. Livestock has the best export growth
potential. The country's production potential and the international
markets for its non-coffee exports are favorable. However, the
development of this productive potential is constrained by inadequate
infrastructure, shortage of credit facilities, shortage of skilled
manpower, and existing land tenure systems. The Government is aware
of these constraints and is taking some steps to deal with them.
For example, the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB)
has been established, and legislation for tenancy reform has been
submitted to Parliament.
10.       Three main difficulties confront Ethiopia - inadequate
domestic resources, foreign exchange constraint, and an absorptive
capacity problem. A large part of Ethiopia's investment, public
and private, will need to be financed externally; since public
savings are likely to fall short of needs, some part of the domestic
cost of public investment will have to be financedfrom external
resources.  The present debt service ratio is about 11   percent.
However, assuming that the external capital necessary to support a
modest growth rate of only 4.5 percent is obtained on normal Bank
terms and that exports continue to grow at the present low rate (3
percent a year or less), the debt service ratio wculd likely exceed
20 percent before 1980. Thus, needed capital should be provided
to the greatest extent possible on concessionary terms.
PARC II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
11.       From 1950 through Naiay  31, 1973, Bank Group lending in
Ethiopia has totalled $196.2 million, comprised of eleven IDA credits
totalling $88.2 million and twelve Bank loans totalling $108.6 million.



Two additional credits totalling $38.0 million were approved on
June 7. Four loans have been fully repaid, and four others are
fully disbursed. Two credits have also been fully disbursed. IFC
has made four commitiments in Ethiopia totalling $14.1 million.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of May 31, 1973, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
12.       Until 1969, the lending program concentrated primarily on
assisting the construction of Ethiopia's infrastructure of roads,
power and telecommunications. Aside from some small amounts for
agriculture provided under loans to the Development Bank of Ethiopia,
the Bank Group's first lending for agriculture in Ethiopia was the
credit for the Wolamo Project (169-ET) in 1969. Since that time
six additional credits have been approved for agricultural projects,
the most recent of which are the credits for the AgricOfrtural
Minimum Package and the Amibara Irrigation Projects approved on
June 7. Additionally, the credit for the Agricultural and Industrial
Development Bank (AIDB) was partly for agricultural credit and partly
for credit for industrial development. Credits have also been made for
a second education project and a highway project with emphasis on
feeder roads, and a loan has been made for a water supply and sewerage
project. This shift in the lending program reflects the Bank Group's
emphasis on agriculture, the increased opportunity for agricultural
lending brought about in part by improved sectoral knowledge, and the
heavier emphasis on agriculture in the Govemrment's own priorities.
This shift has been greatly assisted by the Bank's Permanent Mission
in Easterm Africa (PMEA), which has played a major role in project
identification and preparation in the agriculture sector.
13.       With respect to Bank Group lending, a basic constraint is
the Ethiopian capacity to prepare and implement projects, especially
in the agricultural sector. Hence, we intend to provide assistance
in project preparation, and, through technical assistance, to help
strengthen the administrative capacity in the beneficiary institutions
so that they may be able to utilize larger inflows of assistance. At
the same time we plan to continue lending to such institutions as the
Imperial Highway Authority (IHA), the Imperial Board of Telecoomunica-
tioIns of Ethi-opia (1BTE), and the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power
Authority (EELPA), institutions   with which the Bank has worked for
some years and which now have substantial capacity for channeling
resources into development programs.
l.       We have a sizeable pipeline of projects at various stages
of preparation. Several of these will be follow-ups to ongoing
projects and others will be breaking new ground. Included in the
first category will be a third livestock project, and follow-up credits



for the Wolano, Hiunera, Coffee and AID3 n"ojects. Tncllrded in the
second catesory are proposals for a land spttlennt project in the
Shire Lowlands, a Grain Storage snd Marketing Project, and several
regional agricultural projects ,,hinh will provide a base for eventual
expansion of the  ininmul PacTcaqe Prog-ran into other areas. The
education sector is another pr-oritir for Bank l.ending and wJe hope to
rresent a foarth education project for your consideration in the next
12 to 18 months; it w-ill be based on a major F-iucation Sector Review
recently completed by the Government. Tn addition, we plan to present
projects in telecommunicatiors, roads, and one in aviation which is
linked to the promotion of tourism.
iS.       A summaryr of recent externol assistance to Ethiopia bv
source and by sector can be seen on nag 3 of Amex I. Dttring 1967-71
the Bank and IDA contributed 36 percent of gross inflows on official
account.     This share is eroected to increase substantially during
the next few years as amounts disbursed under Bank loans and IDA
credits rise. Given the poverty of Ethiopia, the need for capital
and at best moderate export prospects, most of the Bank Group's
future lending should be in the form of IDA credits.
PART? ITT - EDUCATION IN FIT{IOPIA
16.       Modern public education in Ethiopia is of recent origin.
Until the end of World War IT, most of the institutions at the
nrimary and secondary levels were operated by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church
or private organizations. Since then the Government has made subs-
tantial efforts to expand public edbcation and t,raining.  Over the
past 15 years, enrollment in Government primary schools has grown at
an average 11 percent annually and in secondary schools and Universi-
ty at 19 percent and 20 percent respectively.
17.       Despite the recent rapid growth, the literacy rate in the
country is still estimated at only about 7 percent. Only 16 percent
of the 7-12 age groups are in primary schools and participation rates
at secondary and post-secondary levels are , and 0.4 percent respective-
ly. Three-fourths of the school enrollment today is in Government
schools with the rest mainly in primary schools operated by the
Church, though some is in schools operated by missionary groups and
private agencies.
iS.       The education system consists of a six-year primary course
from age 7, a second level with a two-year junior cycle and a four-
year senior cycle, and a third level of ITniversity and other courses.
19.       The Government's increasing emphasis on education is evidenced



-6-
bv- the fact that budgetary expenditure on education has increased
at. about 15 percent a year in the last five years. In 1970-71
exrpenditure amounted to Eth.$85 million or about 19 percent of
recurrent expenditure. THowever, the education system falls far
short of adequately meeting the develonment needs of the country.
20.       A large proportion of the Ethiopian teachers are untrained
and lack certificates of aualification.   A high rroporti-on of secon-
dacv school teachers are expatriates.   Student "drop-ouit" and repeti-
tion rates are high.  in spite of a Drimary school building program
assisted by the Swedish International Development Agency and the
secondary echdcation expansion and imrnroerement helped by the first two
TDA education projects, facili.ties remain inadequate and over-
crowded. Tlittle use is made of mode(r ecuirnment and audio visual
aids.  The distribution of schools is heavily biased toward urban
areas. There are also wide discaritier in particination rates at the
provirncial andl sub-provi ncial  eSel s  The two universities (in Addis
Abaha and Asmara) PTnroll som,e ,.nOO s+udHernts ;r facilities that were
planned for about 4,000 ancd teaci;.ng suffers also because inecoming
students are poorly prenared in science and ]anguages.
22.       The nrina-v school. cu.rrfulT77im is still dnsi7ned, mainl:r to
crepare stu,dents for general secenda-- eder_to.^ n and is not as relevtant
aS n t should be to the rural economic enmu.ronment in which 90 percent
cf Ththiopians live.  Al+horgh second:ary educctioP has. been broadened
to include rractica2 subjects, '.t iS still basically acadenic and its
7-rad-utes are inadequiately prepared for the labor market.  The techni-
ofT schools have yet to devel.on the kind of coTrhmiz7rcatAon with industry
wbiJh will ersicre a surply of graduate trainee-s Cor its reeds.  -ittle
-rrhasis has so far been given to agn cultuiral education.
2?.       Thn developmert of a better loncer tern stratey- for supply
of essential manpower and hurarn resource development -s necessary Vor
suc essfutl ilmlementation of Ethiopi a s develeorment rrn-ran.  To fit
th>e Fthioniar situation, the stratev wil-l need to t3ke `nto account
the varied ecology of the col.untry and ethnic. comoosition of the people,
the existing traditionail learning syster, the limitations of Governnent
finance, the manpower refnu.rements of the modern sector of the economy
and the need for an improved and more relevant learnincg system in the
-iral areas.
23.       The Government ic swell awarc of these probl]ems and has
recertly completcd a c-iStia. revie -T of ins ~dncation seetor. This.
review was ornanized and conduicted almost entirely bv Ethio ians
with the Association cuosoeratin.7. mairly by helvnir  tc identify
foreign advisors andl consultants, most, of whom Tsere financed by the
Second Eubication credit.  The obWectives of the review were to
mnprove the edination endl training systen ef Ethiopia and its capabi-
lity for promoting economic, social and cl41.tural development, suggest



-7-
ways in which education could best be utilized to promote the
integration of the nation, and to identify priority studies and
investment in education and training.
2)h.      The report published following the review proposed
changes in the structure and content of the education system aimed
at the rapid expansion of the first level of education, restriction
in the expansion of the second level to about 2.5 percent a year
and pegging of both the second and third levels to manpower require-
ments of the economy. Proposed changes in curricula emphasized
practical subjects, particularly in the rural areas, for those who
leave schools at either the primary or secondary level. A national
comnission for higher education was proposed for planning and coor-
dinating post-secondary education. The report explored ways of
reducing the costs of schooling, including more practical standards
of teacher training and qualifications, increase in pupil-teacher
ratios, extension of the school year and use of extension agents,
artisans and the like for teaching practical courses in the lower
levels in the schools. It proposed locating schools so as to bring
about better distribution of educational opportunities throughout
the country. Non-formal education was emphasized for both adults
and younger people through various practical courses using existing
schools and Government buildings and through the establishment of
development centers in the rural areas.   It proposed restructuring
of the Ministry of Education and gradual decentralization of the
administration of educational system in line with projected local
Government reforms. Voluntary contributions by the people, includ-
ing contributions of labor and materials, were proposed to cover an
increasing proportion of the costs of the education system.
25.       The Government has accepted the basic findings and
recommendations of the Sector Review and is now examining the
implications of its various proposals with a view to planning their
gradual implementation. This exercise is being conducted within the
framework of discussions on the country's fourth Five-Year Develop-
ment Plan (1974-1979), which is also currently in preparation.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Education Project
in Ethiopia" (No. 19a-ET dated May 31, 1973) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. A Credit and Project Summary
is provided in Annex III.
Background
27.       The implementation of the reforms adopted as a result of
the Education Sector Review will require major new investment.



- 8 -
A.ssistance from the Association in financing this investment will
be considered once specific plans and projects have been prepared.
1eanwhile, however, there are some urgent educational needs to be
satisfied which do not have to await the completion of investment
planning stemming from the Sector Studly.  The proposed credit is
to finance an interim project designed to meet urgent needs for
aefined manpower and educational requirements which are of high
priority.  It was iaentified with the assistance of an IDS
mission during the first part of the Education Sector Review
work in January 1972. A credit application was received by
the A.ssociation in Iahv 1972 and a mission to Ethiopia appraised
the project in July 1572.
23.       The project airs at improving the teaching of science and
the supply of manpower needed for carrving out the agricultural
investment rrogram and making more effective the existin7 self-
sluDnorting riral learning network of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
The total cost of the project i.s estimated. at UTStI2.7 million an.d
the foreian e-xchange component at US-6.7 mi.llion.
29.       Negotiations for the credit took place from April 25 to
May 3, 1973. The Ethi.onian delegation was led by H. E. Ato Seifu.
Mnhteme Selassie, M--n-Lster of Fdication, ass;sted by H. F. Nibured
,rm.ias Kabede, General. Manager, Ethiopian Orthodox Church; Dr.

Project Descriotion
20.       T.he project has seven orincipal. components as described
below.
(a)  F-xansion and Renovation of the Science Center of ITSET.
Thi.s part of the project would assist exoansion of the
facilities of the Science Center   fron the present
enrollment. capacity of about 1,100 to ]_,7?0.  It would
pro-vifde a scdence libraryT, two I -ct'ire ball.s, and instruc-
tional and research laboratories, staff cfices, and
supporting facilities for the various departments of the
UTniversitv. The new con<striction would permit some
remodelled bulldings to become available for the use of
the Faculty ot' Social. Sciences. The S .eience Center as
eyxanded woii,ld meet the needs of the "core rrogram" for
all freshmen  entering mvn,.T one of the science fields,



-9-
the degree programs of the Faculty of Science in biolog7y,
physics, chemistry, matheratics, geology, and pharmacy,
and science subject programs for prospective science
teachers enrolled in the Faculty of Education. The
center would enable HSIU to expand outpults in the priority
fields of Agriculture (fron 60 in 1971 to 110 in 1981)
Education (from !O to 133), En-ineering (from 70 to -60)
and Medicine (from 20 to 60). Total output of the Center
would go un from 250 in 1971 to 583 ir 19P1.
HSIU has a good nlan for filling through graduate
studies abroad all its teaching staff needs with
Ethiopians by 1980. It is preparing a plan to increase
the number of laboratory technicians from 15 to about.
70 bv 1980. Effective use of the laboratory facilities
would be essential to the success of the Science Center
and this would reouire careful planning. Durin- nego-
tiations, it was agreed that within one -rear from the
signing of the Credit Agreement, a laboratory organization
expert will be appointed and the plan for training and
employing laboratory technicians will be completed and sent
to the Association for comments.
(b)  7.rpansion of the Srience Curricualin Development Center (SCIOC).
This center is r-art of the Ministrdr of E&acation. This
part of the project would provide for the expansion of the
activities of SCDC through the provision of  offices,
laboratories, curriculum workshops and related facilities
and technical assistance for a feasibility study in the local
production of science equipment.
The SCDC is responsible for in-service trainir. of
sc5ence teachers, curriculum develonment An science for the
school system, the preparation of science teaching materials
and for examination procedures. Its activities will be
expanded to include the development of prototypes of locally
designed science ecquipment on an experimental basis and,
if a feasibility studv proves it warranted, the local
prodluction of science kits and other equipment. The
Government is now preparing a plan under which SCDC would
coordinate the activities of other agencies in the field of
science curriculum development such as T4STJ, the Academy of
Pedagogy, and the teacher trainLn_ institutes.  During
ne-otiations, it was agreed that this plan will be
completed and sent to the Association for comments within
one year of signing of the Credit Agreerent.



-1 0-
(c)  Establishment of a Church Training Center.  The Ethiopian
Orthodox Church has recentlyr established a Development
Commission wTith the aim of aiding the general endeavor in
the country for educational, economic and cultuiral deve-
lopment in the rural areas. A center will be constructed
on the Patriarchate's farm at Menagasha for training
clergymen in the teaching of practical and applied subjects
such as arithmetic, agriculture, applied science, com'munity
development and hygiene. The provisiorn of such training
will make it possi.ble to use the existing andt potential
resources of the Church more effectively for rural develop-
rnent. The center will provide educational and boarding
facilities for 500 trainees through a 6-month course with
outDut of 1,00C per year.
The Church, with more than ]0O,O00 priests spread
throughout the countr-y, operates schools in most of its
15,000 monasteries and churches where children aged 7 to
12 learn to read the hol' hool.s, as well. as some basic
nluneracv, under the gnidance of a te.acher priect. The
training center at,          'iould hI thl9 mos.+ ambitious
undert,akin- of the ne--e!opment Commissior to date. *A
satis factory curri.culntrt ontline for the training nrenter has
been nrepared by the Development Commission in cooperation
w'ith the MJn lsturirs of Education, Agriculture, Communrit:
Development and Public Health. The complete curriculum
will be sent to the Associat-ion for review with,in one year
of the signing of the Credit A,7reement. The ce.dnter wil  be
operated hy a board composed of reDresent.atires of the
Chureh and the relevant o7overnment nin+,:tries. The
Government wt;  meet the capital costs of the center. will
maintain the faci.ities and will nre)v-'de snecialized tea-
chers w.hile the Church i-!ill provide the necessary land and
will meet the recurrent costs.   As a condition of effective-
ness of the credit., the Government will enter into arrange-
ments with the Church, acceptable to the Association,
which wTll provide for the fInancing, operation and
maintenance of the fa.cilitles.
((i) Establishment of A7ricultural Traininc., Centers. Three new
agri-cultural training centers will be established in the
provinces of t'Toamn, Kaffa and Wollo. They will  each provide
facilities and eouipment for 40 students in a 9-month
practical course for field assistants. Each will admit
graduates of Grade 8 who  are at least '19 years of age.
The center will  be administered by the Mfinistry of
Agriculture and operated in. close cooperation with the exten-
sion services. The course will be directly related to the



-ll-
type of agricultural improvemrnts within reach of the average
farmer. During negotiations the Government confirmed that
the centers will complement their programs with short
courses for farmers.
(e) Expansion of the Animal Health Institute. This institute,
which is operated by the Ministry of Agriculture at Debre
Zeit, gives a two-year course for students who have completed
Grade 12. It is proposed under the project to expand its
capacity to provide additional trained manpower required to
exploit the large livestock potential of Ethiopia. Teach-
ing and boarding facilities and staff housing will be
built to cater for an increase in enrollment from 60 to 140.
The Institute has received UN DF/FAO assistance for curri-
cultUn development and staff training.  However, due to lack
of' qualified counterparts, the staff training program has
not been completed. The proposed credit would therefore
finance 15 man-years of technical assistance and fellow-
ships to provide specialists in clinical veterinary medicine,
parasitology and microbiology. Annual output of trained
veterinary assistants will rise from 2$ to 65.
(f) Establishment of an Educational. Materials ProduLction Center
(EMPO). This part will   assist the establishmnert of the
E4PC by providing offices, work-f!ng space and neeting rooms,
warehouses and vehicl]es for thie center and technical
assistance for the center's manager and technical staff,
particularly in developing a satisfactory accounting and
control system for the center and its distribution points
in the provinces.
The Governnent is reoranizing7 its system of productior
anrd distribution of textbooks ead visual aids with a iLew to
putting the educational materieals Production center on a
business footing operating as a share company under the

the Government through the Ministry of Finance; other share-
holders will be the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBP) and the
TSlTUr  It will. be mnarged bY a Board with representation from
the Ministry of Finance, the Mlinistry of Education, the HSI1T
and the CBE. It will be operated for reasonahle profit;
students iwill  be charged the full cost of textbooks excent
possibly in the less developed regions where a subsidy will
be provided by the Governmert. The Government, will, provide
the Association for its comment a detailed proposal for the
establishment of the REPC, will ensure that for the first
five years it will be directed by qualified manager acceptable



-1 2-
to the Association and will provide the center with
working capital.
(g) Technical Assistance. The project includes about
25 man-years of technical assistance. The major purposes
are to help make detailed plans for the implementation
of the reforms resulting from the Education Sector Review
and to develop a long-range physical development plan for
the University. Other elements will provide for a
feasibility stud-y of the local production of school science
equipment, management advisory services for the Educational
Materials Production Center, and specialists for the Animal
Health Institute.
The technical assistance rela-ted to educational reforms
(50 man-months of specialist and related services) is needed
to assist the Government with the planning and programming
of reforms arising from the Sector Review, and the training
of Ethiopians in administration of the reform programs.
Specific needs will be clear only after the Government has
made detailed decisions on the implementation of the Sector
Review's recommendations. Therefore, the content of this
technical assistance and the number and character of
specialists will be agreed between the Government and the
Association later.
The technical assistance to the University (36 man-months
of specialist services)will assist it in preparation
of a long-range physical development plan and in the organi-
zation of a staff development plan and with training for
laboratorv technicians.
The Government has undertaken that qunlified counter-
parts will be assigned to work with the foreign experts.
Project Implementation and Management
31.       The project will  be implemented over a period of five years.
The existing project unit, established within the Construction and
Maintenance Department of the Ministry of Education for the implemen-
tation of the first and second projects financed by IDA, will be
responsible for overall supervision of the proposed third project and
liaison with the Association. The project unit will also provide
coordination with other parties concerned, such as HSIU, the Ministry
of Agriculture and the Church. Design and supervision of construction
for the Science Curriculum Development Center, the Educational Materials
Production Center, the Agricultural Training Centers, the Animal
Health Institute and the Training Center for the Church will be



-13-
carried out by the project unit. The Aaricultural Training Centers
will  be patterned on the standardized design developed for similar
institutions included in the second project. Design and supervision
of' construction of the Science Center will be the responsibility of
a consulting firm of architects acceptable to the Association and
commissioned on terms and conditions satisfactory to it.
Financing
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at IJS$12.7
million, of which UTS$16.7 million would be in foreign exchange and.
TJS ;6.0 mil]4.on in locall currency. Imported furniture and equipment
would be exempted from import duties   and so would imported materials
for biilding construction  and local manufacture of furniture and.
equipment. The proposed credit of U.S$10.0.million would cover 79%
of the total. cost and would meet the entire foreign exchange compo-
nent plus US$.3.3 million of local cost. The Government would meet
the remaining cost of the project. The justification for local
cost. financing is given in paragraph 10 above.
33.       The additional recurrent cost arising from the project is
estimated at about Eth.$2.5 million per annum at 1972 prices and
amounts to 1.3" of the estimated recurrent cost of education in
Ethiopia  in FY 1980. The Government should be able to meet this
cost and its share of the capital cost without curtailing expenditure
for other on-going educational activities.
Disbursement
34.       The credit would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. costs of directly imported instructional
equipment and fiurniture, and of the ex-factory price of
locally manufactured furniture and equipment; and 80% of
total expenditure for imported furniture and equipment
procured locally;
(b)  80% of total expenditure for technical assistance;
(c)  80% of total expenditure for professional architectural
and engineering services;
(d)  80% of the project unitts local expenses; and
(e)  80% of total expenditure for civil works.
The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex III.



Procurement
35.       Contracts for furniture, equipment and civil works would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Association's Guidelines for Procurement,
except in the case ( see Annex III) of civil works contracts of
US$200,000 or less and for furniture and equipment costing less
than us$ho,000 up to a total of $250,000. Items would be grouped
to the extent practicable to encourage international competition.
The Ethiopian buiilding industry is competitive and it is not
likely that foreign contractors will gain awJards for civil works.
The bulk of instructional equipment is expected to be procured
abroad and furniture locally.  Local manufacturers of furniture
and equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or
the existing rate of import duty, whichever is the lower.
PART V - LEGAL INSTR1MJ1TS AND AUTHORTY
36.       The draft Development Credct A-reement between the Empire
of Ethiopia and the Association, the R?ecommendation of the Committee
provided for iunder krticle V, Section I(d), of the Articles of
A7reement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit are being distri-buted to the zxecutive Directors
senarately.
37.       The draft agreement reflects the normal pattern for credits
for educati-on projects accotnt being taken of special features out-
lined in earlier paragraphs of the report.
38.       I an satisfied that the proposed Developrent (redit would
comiwDly with the Articles of Agreement of the- Association.
PART VT - RECOMMIENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Fxecutive Directors approve the
proposed credit.
