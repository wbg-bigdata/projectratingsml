I                 IEGWB Mission: Improvingdevelopment resultsthrough excellence inevaluation.                        I
 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroupassesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
 first, to ensure the integrityof the Banks self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe
 expected results,and second, to helpdevelopimproveddirections,policies,and proceduresthroughthe
 disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannually assessesabout 25 percentof
 the Banks lendingoperationsthrough field work. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
 that are innovative,large,or complex;thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor countryevaluations;those for
 which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate
 importantlessons.
        To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examines project files and other
 documents, interviewoperational staff, visit the borrowingcountry to discuss the operation with the Government,
 and other in-country stakeholders,and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand
 in local offices as appropriate.
        Each PPAR is subject to internalIEGWBpeer review, Panel review, and management approval.Once cleared
 internally,the PPAR is commented on by the responsibleBank department. IEGWBincorporatesthe comments as
 relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attachedto
 the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has been sent to
 the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

 About the IEGWB Rating System
        IEGWB's use of multiple evaluationmethods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
 lending instrument,projectdesign, or sectoralapproach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic methodto
 arrive at their project ratings.Followingis the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
 (additional informationis available on the IEGWBwebsite: http:/horldbank.org/ieg).
        Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved,or are expected to
 be achieved,efficiently.The rating has three dimensions:relevance,efficacy, and efficiency. Relevanceincludes
 relevanceof objectivesand relevance of design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
 objectives are consistent with the country's current developmentpriorities and with current Bank country and
 sectoral assistance strategies and corporategoals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
 Assistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevanceof design is the extent to
 which the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's
 objectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking into account their relative importance.Efficiency
 is the extent to which the project achieved,or is expectedto achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
 capital and benefitsat least cost compared to alternatives.The efficiency dimensiongenerally is not applied to
 adjustment operations. Possibleratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,
 Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or
 expected outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
 Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
 operationand supported effective implementationthrough appropriate supervision(including ensuring adequate
 transition arrangementsfor regular operationof supported activities after loadcredit closing,toward the
 achievement of development outcomes.The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision
 Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe Governmentand implementing
 agency or agencies)ensuredquality of preparationand implementation,and complied with covenants and
 agreements,toward the achievement of developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions: Government
 performanceand implementing agency (ies) performance.Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
 Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
 Unsatisfactory.

*Evaluation
 The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department. The
             Summary (ES) is an intermediate IEGWB product that seeks to independently verify the findings
of the ICR.
**As of July 1,2006, Institutional Development Impact is assessed as part of the Outcome rating.
***AS of July 1, 2006, Sustainability has been replaced by Risk to Development Outcome. As the scales are
different, the ratings are not directly comparable.

        This is a Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) for four operations in
Uganda: the FirstPoverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSCl, FY 2001), the Second
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC2, FY 2003), the Third Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC3, FY 2004), and the FourthPoverty Reduction Support Operation
(PRSC4, FY 2005).

        The four were chosenfor a PPAR insupport of the Uganda Country Assistance
Evaluation (CAE).

        The First Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSCl) was for SDR 116.2million
($150 million equivalent) from IDA. The credit was approved inMay 31,2001,became
effective inNovember 29,2001 ,and closed inMarch31,2002.

        The SecondPoverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC2) was for SDR 120.2
million ($150 million equivalent) from IDA. The credit was approved inJuly 23,2002,
became effective inMarch 12,2003, and closed inJune 30,2003.

       The ThirdPoverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC3) was a grant for SDR
106million ($150 million equivalent). The grant was approved in September 9,2003,
became effective inFebruary 11,2004, and closed in September30,2004.

       The Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC4) was a grant for SDR
102.6 million ($150 million equivalent). The grant was approved inSeptember2,2004,
became effective inFebruary28,2005, and closed on September 30,2005.

       This PPAR is based on areview of relevant World Bank documents, includingthe
President's Report, Program Documents, Credit and Grant Agreements, Implementation
Completion Reports (ICR), other project documents, Government reports, andreports

Summary

1.      After about 25 years o f economic turmoil and conflict which ended in 1986,
Uganda adopted policies that brought about economic stability and growth. Fiscal
discipline was a central element o fthe program, as well as an increased reliance on
markets andthe opening o fthe economy. Since the early 1990s per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) grew at about 3.3 percent per year and inflation fell from 40 percent in
1991 to about 3 percent by 2000. The rapid growth reduced the poverty headcount from
56 percent in 1992/93 to 38 percent in2002/03. Despite the gains attained, inthe late
1990s it became evidentthat Uganda's large external debt constrained its economic
prospects because it could not sustain highlevels o f debt repayment and at the same time
achieve higher rates o f growth.

2.      To deal with this issue, in 1997 the Governqent embarked on a deeper set o f
reforms through the Poverty EradicationAction Plan (PEAP). The PEAP sought to
transform the economy and to reduce the incidence o fpoverty, and consisted o f four
pillars: (a) Framework for Economic Growth and Transformation (Pillar I); Ensuring
                                                                               (b)
Good Governance and Security (Pillar 11); (c) Directly Increasingthe Ability o f the Poor
to Raise their Incomes (Pillar 111); and (d) Directly Increasing the Quality o f Life o f the
Poor (Pillar IV). The PEAP sought objectives fully consistent with the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) process and opened the door for Uganda to participate init.

3.      This PPARreviews four operations for a total o f $600 millionthat supported the
PEAP during2001-2005. The Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), comprising
two development policy credits andtwo development policy grants, sought as their
ultimate objectives to reduce poverty, measured by the headcount index o f poverty, and
to increase the public's satisfaction with public services. The PRSCs aimed to achieve
these objectives by helpingto: (a) promote an efficient and equitable use o f public
resources; (b) improve service delivery through cross-cutting reforms; (c) promote an
enabling environment for rural development; and (d) improve delivery o f basic services.

PrincipalFindings

4.      The principal findings of the review are:

        PRSCs constitute an effective mechanismto support the Government's budget,
        increase the Government's capacity to spend, and give it more flexibility to
        allocate resources to priority sectors and activities.

        Efficacy indevelopment results varied by area o f support. Substantial results were
        achieved ineducation, health, and water and sanitation, where coverage expanded
        and the quality o f service improved. Literacy rates inurbanand rural areas rose;
        child and infant mortality fell but maternal mortality remained unchanged; water
        and sanitation services expanded their coverage, but more so inurbanareas,
        where 13 percent ofthe people lives.

More could have been done on improving efficiency inthe use o f public
resources, improving service delivery, andpromoting rural development. It i s
unlikely that the efficiency o f public expenditures improved overall given the
trends inGovernment employment andthe allocation o f expenditure. Government
employment, after declining from 320,000 to 160,000 between 1990 and 1997,
increased to about 220,000 by 2003 inthe absence o f a functional review. Public
domestic expenditureexpanded from 14.9 percent o f GDP in2000/01to 17.6
percent o f GDP in2003/04, andthe expansion o f Government investment,0.2
percent of GDP,was not commensurate with the foreign assistance received
duringthe period. Actual expenditures by sectors came close to matching the
allocations for PRSC1-3 but differed from the allocations, sometimes by
substantial margins, for PRSC4. Also, expenditures indefense and public
administration exceeded their budgetallocations, while expenditures inhealth,
agriculture, roads, and social services fell below their budget allocations.

Regarding public service delivery, there is little evidence to suggest that service
delivery improved inareas o fpublic administration other thanhealth, education,
and water and sanitation inurbanareas. Regardingrural development, the PRSCs
had few interventions inagriculture, and the interventions could not alter rural
welfare directly duringthe period they were active. Farmers' income declined and
rural welfare deteriorated duringthe period: the proportion o frural people under
the poverty line increased from 39 percent in 1999/2000 to 49 percent in2002/03.
The PRSCs might have affected agriculture indirectly, and negatively, because the
assistance financed a larger level o f expenditure that tended to reduces the price
o f traded goods (agriculture among them) relative to non-traded. Finally, it i s
unlikelythat the PRSCs improved governance and security since neither
corruption, nor the quality o f bureaucracy, nor law and order improved during the
period under review.

The policy matrices o fthe PRSCs tended to be too large and ambitious inscope.
Their large size made it difficult to separate what the Bank could support with
success from what it could not. Because such separation was not carried out, the
Bank's program suffered from the ambiguities. A concise policy matrix compels
to make evident the connection (or lack thereof) between actions and results, and
imposes discipline inthinking about development outcomes and the specific
actions that could generate them.

With their ambitious objectives, the PRSCs strained the Government's capacity
and unveiled the limited capacity o f its organizations to deliver results. The
MinistryofFinance, PlanningandEconomic Development could not force the
program on the agencies executing it and ensure their ownership o f it. Shifting
program coordinationto the Office o fthe Prime Minister improved the
preparation o f PRSC4, and increased the interaction between different
Government ministries and their involvement inreform. Thus, the selection o f an
apex agency with the proper authority is a necessary aspect for preparing and
implementingPRSCs.

Assessment and Lessons

5.       The review concludes that the PRSCshad substantial relevance andmodest
efficacy. The credits and grants sought to solve important problems, making the
relevance o f their objectives substantial. The design fell short o f what the programs
intendedto achieve: the logical chain between actions andresults was not specified and
several o f the actions selected for support could not leadto the objectives sought. The
relevance o f design was modest, This review rates overall relevance as substantial for all
PRSCs but PRSC3 whose relevance was modest because o f its weak design. Overall
efficacy was modest, except for PRSC4 which was negligible, because the expected
outcomes did not materialize even though most prior-actions and triggers were met. As a
result, the reviewrates the outcome for PRSC1-2 moderately satisfactory and the
outcome for PRSC3-4 as moderately unsatisfactory.

6.       The following lessons are derivedfrom the review:

         The PRSCs were effective inproviding timely and predictable resources for the
         Government's budget but less so inproducing development results. To produce
         development results, the Bank needs to pay attention to the design o fthe credit,
         the quality o f prior actions, and their relationto the expected outcomes.
         PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as investment and sector operations for
         solving specific sector issues. The PRSCstended to cover macroeconomic and
         sector issues ina broad manner, makingit difficult to cultivate ownership inthe
         agencies responsible for implementing the program. The assistance i s more likely
         to succeed when the Bank targets specific problems and works their solution with
         the agencies incharge o fexecutingthe program.
         A program o fbudget support tends to create a higher permanent level o f
         Government expenditure that may not be sustainable inthe medium term.
         Predictable budget support may create inflexibilities inexpenditure, forcing
         donors to continue their support beyond what i s needed and desirable. Uganda
         exemplifies this situation as the PRSC series grew over time.

1. Backgroundand Country Context

Country Context

1.1     After about 25 years of economic turmoil and conflict ending in 1986, Uganda
adoptedpolicies directed at rehabilitation and stabilization that brought about economic
stability and growth. Fiscal disciplinewas a central element ofthe programto support
more reliance on markets andthe opening of the economy. Since the early 1990sper
capita GDP has grown at around 3.3 percent per year and inflationfell from 40 percent in
1991to about 3 percent by 2000. The gains were insufficient to cut Uganda's external
debt sharply. By 1997external debt hadreached65 percent of GDP and the net present
value of its service was about 2.5 times the value of Uganda's exports inthat year.
International Monetary Fund(IMF) and World Bank analyses concluded that Uganda
could not sustain high levels of debt repayment and at the same time achieve higher rates
of growth. To deal with this issue, the Government decidedto embark on a deeper
transformation ofthe Ugandan economy.

1.2     During 1997the Government prepareda Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)
to transform the economy and to reduce the incidence ofpoverty. The PEAP was a
home-grown mediumterm development planto guide Government policy, and was
further revised in2000 and2004. Inadditionto the PEAP, the Government participated
inthe HeavilyIndebtedPoor Country (HIPC) initiative, which sought to provide debt-
relieve to countries meeting defined conditions. In 1998Uganda becamethe first country
to reach the completion point of a debt reductionpackage and qualified for an enhanced
relief in2000. These developments opened the door for Uganda to participate inthe
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process.

1.3     The PEAP sought objectives fully consistent with the PRSPprocess. Its
overarching goal was to reduce the incidence o fpoverty from 44 percent in 1997to 10
percent or less in2017.Towards this end, the PEAP aimed to achieve universal access to
primary education, primary health care, safe drinking water, political freedom and human
rights, and to establishan effective disaster relief program. The PEAP consisted of four
pillars: (a) framework for economic growth and transformation (Pillar I);      (b) ensuring
good governanceand security (Pillar 11); (c) directly increasing the ability o fthe poor to
raise their incomes (Pillar 111); and(d) directly increasing the quality o f life of the poor
(Pillar IV). A summary of the revised PEAP becamethe basis for the Uganda PRSP
presentedto the Boards of the World Bank and IMF inMay 2000. Later on, Uganda
preparedaPRSP progressreport that was presentedin2001 to the Bank's Boardjointly
with the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) that this PPAR reviews.

The Poverty ReductionSupport Credit (PRSC)

1.4     The PRSCsbecamea principaltool for the World Bank Group's country
assistancestrategy to support Uganda's economic transformation and its poverty
reduction effort. They supplementedinvestment operations and aimed at replacing sector
investmentlending inUganda and facilitating sector-wide as well as macroeconomic
policy reforms. Unlikeinvestment lending, the PRSCs were one-tranche operations,

                                             2


disbursedas annual budget support into the GOU's national budget and becamethe
preferredmode of borrowingby the Government.

1.5    The first three PRSCswere designedas an integrated program, with tentative
commitments for PRSC-2 and PRSC-3, foreshadowedinthe President's Report for
PRSCl Similarly, PRSC-4 was originally conceived as the first of a second set of three
        .
one-year PRSCsthat would support a newUgandanPEAP as part of the "rolling design"
of these operations. Delays inthe completion ofthe new PEAP, however, ledto PRSC-4
to be presentedas a stand-alone operation. The credits and grants provided by the PRSCs
becamethe principalinstrumentsto support the Government's efforts to improve public
service delivery andto initiate broader policy reform(including macroeconomic
adjustments). By early 2009, the Boardhad approved seven PRSCs for Uganda for about
$1.1 billion. This review evaluatesthe performance of the first four operations whose
value is $600 million.

2. FirstPovertyReduction Support Credit

2.1          The first series o f PRSCs (PRSC1-3) were developed inthe context o f the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FYO1-03, which was de-facto extended to FY05.
The CAS supported Uganda's economic transformation and poverty reduction strategy as
articulated inthe Government's 2000 PEAP. The first three PRSCs emphasized the
humandevelopment dimensions ofpoverty by focusing on improved accessto education,
health, and water and sanitation. Relatively less attention was paidto issues o f
macroeconomic stability; improved governance and some aspects o f agriculture, all o f
which were needed to achieve rapid economic growth for sustained poverty reduction.
Objectivesand Components

2.2          Objectives.The PRSCl supported pillars I,I1andIV o fthe Government's
PEAPPRSP, with emphasis on reforms inhealth, education, and water and sanitation
(that is, Pillar IV- to raise quality o f life o f the poor). Ina lesser way, it supported actions
to improve governance and security (Pillar 11) and to establish a framework conducive to
economic growth and transformation (Pillar I).                    Table 1 summarizes the objectives o f the
credit as they relate to the PEAP pillars. It was expected that under the PRSC1, Uganda's
reform program would lead to improved service delivery through: (a) efficient and
equitable use o f public resources, (b) improved governance, and (c) improved access to
and quality o f education, health care, and water and sanitation services. The PRSCl
aligned its objectives with those o f the PEAP whose strategy was relevant for Uganda's
problems.

2.3         Components.The PRSCl consisted o f 12 core actions (referred to as prior-
actions) carried out by the Government prior to IDA management's presentationo f the
program to the Board. The prior-actions reflected the three objectives outlined inthe
program, supported by a series o f expected results (Table 2). The credit intervened in 12
o f the 21 action areas considered relevant to the achievement o f the PEAP objectives.

Relevance of Objectivesand Design

2.4      Objectives.The reform program sought to resolve problems that prevented
Ugandans from improving their standard o f living and the Government from usingits
resources better. L o w standards o f living arose, among other reasons, from the low
humancapital o fthe population, a consequence o fpoor healthandlow educational
services. Illiteracy rates averaged about 40 percent o fthe population aged 15 and older,
andthe lack ofteachers, schools andbooks for the growing student population
contributed to it. Highmortality rates exemplify the poor conditions inhealth and health
services; according to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in2000/2001 for every
1,000 live births 88 children died duringtheir first year o f life, 152 died duringtheir first
five years, and one mother died for every 198 live births.

2.5      Also, there was waste o f resources within Government programs, arising from
three main areas. First, the budget allocated insufficient resources to support activities
with the highest return(such as education). Second, the agencies managingthese
resources also produced sub-standard results because o fpoor management systems and
practices. Third, corruption affectedthe execution o f public expenditure programs and by
raising the costs o f services constrained the access o f the poor to public services (World
Bank 2001,pp. 5,9).' By helpingthe Government to deal withthese problems, the
PRSC1's objectives had substantial relevance.

2.6      Design.PRSC1 established prior-actions andtriggers that consisted mainly o f
procedural outputs such as the need to approve andpublishpay strategy and to allocate
budget for selected sectors. It also specified qualitative outcomes associated with service
delivery. The few quantifiable outcome indicators were intermediate outputs. Overall,
neitherthe PRSC1documentationnor those o fthe follow-up programs presented any
explicit results chain connecting triggers andprior actions to outcomes. Because
procedural conditions usually lacked explicit linkto outcomes, their relevance for the
program i s questionable. Proceduralconditions may be important and necessary for
directing steps for achieving certain policy goals, but they must be associated with
results. The designframework therefore requires establishing explicitly the causal chain
o f assistance-to-outcome so as to facilitate the evaluation o f impact.

2.7      Because o f the designweaknesses, this review rates the relevance o f design as
modest. The overall relevance o f objectives and design i s deemed substantial.

Achievement of Objectives(Efficacy)

2.8      This section examines the potential outcomes associated with the three objectives
established inTable 1 and reviews the implementation o f PRSC1 with respect to the
prior-actions and the activities o f the program associated with the triggers.

2.9     Efficient and Equitable Use of Public Resources. The Government carried out
the prior actions specified inthe credit agreement (see Table 2). Italigned public
expenditures with PEAP priorities through the expenditure review and executed the
budget inthe first two quartersinaccordance with the agreed allocations. Italso
incorporatedresults orientation into the budgetby introducing output targets and the
monitoring o f results for roads, education, health, and water and sanitation inthe
2000/01-2002103 budget framework paper (BFP). But these actions did not serve a useful
purpose because neither PRSC1 nor subsequent PRSCs used these results to monitor
efficiency and equity concerns. Also, the PRSCl did not define measurable short-term or
medium-term results attributable to the prior actions carried out. Moreover, actual
Government expendituresfell short o f the budget allocations in sectors that could have
helpedraise productivity (e.g., 90-93 percent inhealth, education, agriculture) and
exceeded the allocations insectors where productivity gains were unlikely (e.g., 114
percent inpublic administration).

2.10    The review concludes that while the achievement o f the sub-objectives was
substantial, it i s not clear that a more efficient and equitable use o f public resources
occurred. First, budget monitoring and evaluation at the central Government level
remainedweak and were hardly present at the local level. Second, public expenditure
discipline did not improve. The 2007 Public Expenditure Review (PER) noted that "the
public administration `sector' has been overspending its budget since the MTEFbeganin
1997/98",2 which included the period covered by PRSC1. Overall, the efficacy in
achieving the objective was modest.

2.11    Improve Service Delivery through Cross-cutting Reforms. The prior actions
related to this objective consisted o f a number o fprocedures that were largely satisfied.
With respect to the objective o f improvingmanagement systems andpractices inthe
public sector: (a) MOFPED and the Ministry o f Public Service (MPS) agreed on the
objectives and principles o f a pay strategy consistent with boththe MTEF and improved
service delivery, and (b) MOFPED established a coordinating mechanism for guidingand
monitoring reform programs infinancial management. Despite the prior actions taken,
the pace o f public service reform envisioned inthe program was not realized during
PRSC1; the strategy for public service reform was "stalled at the conceptual level, with
no action despite the fact that reform needs had been clearly analyzed inthe Public
Administration Study" (World Bank 2005c, p. 19). Neither PRSCl nor subsequent
PRSCs defined results normally associated with this objective, such as financial and
budget management, expenditure control, and efficiency o f public expenditure.
Performance on these areas provides indirect evidence that the prior actions taken in
PRSCl and the triggers for PRSC2 failed to produce any significant result. For example,
the Government could not control expenditures onpublic administration (including
political administration and transfer grants to districts), suggesting that public service pay
was not consistent with a pay strategy linked to performance. A shortcoming o f this and
subsequent PRSCs was their lack o f defined and measurable short-term or medium-term
outcomes which could be attributed to the prior actions carried out.

2.12       Regarding public financial management the evidence on achievements is
contradictory. An IMF report in2003 on fiscal transparency noted that since 1999
Uganda had made significant progress inenhancing transparency practices inthe fiscal
area. The report pointed out that some new issues had emerged since then, undermining
the gains made; they were: (a) extensive use o f supplementary appropriations that
undermine the budget process; (b) difficulty o f assessing the accumulated stock o f
domestic arrears; and (c) central Government contingent liabilities not fully rep~rted.~                           In
procurement, MOFPED issued new procurement regulations for ministries,departments
and agencies. Although the technical aspects o f procurement advanced, vested interests
andpotential corruption at local level hinder the procurement system, preventing
improvements ingovernance. Infinancial management, PRSC1 helped strengthen the
legal and regulatory framework, and the systems o f accounting for and auditing public
expenditure, As inprocurement, the technical advances moved faster than the practice
and the enforcement; the practice stalled because the organizations responsible for
financial management and oversight need to improve their performance.

2.13       With respect to increasing transparency andparticipation and to reducing
corruption, the established prior-actions were met. The prior action consisted o f
submittingto Parliament a bill on leadership code andestablishing the post o fInspector
General o f Government (IGG). But PRSCl neither intervened nor envisioned
interventions inthe other three areas supporting this objective: transparency, civil society
participation, and legal andjudicial reform. This review concludes that efficacy i s highat
the procedural level, but does not ensure that corruptionwould fall. For example, in2003,
about two years after PRSCl,the IGGfound large scale corruption and embezzlement as
the top concern inits 2003 National Integrity Survey. Inits score on the corruption
perception index Transparency International rated Ugandawith 1.9 in2001,2.1 in2002
and 2.2 in2003, suggesting that corruption was rampant and that the change observed is
not significant to conclude that it fell duringthese yearsq4Information from the
International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) indicates that corruption was widespread and
remained unchanged, and that bureaucratic quality was low and unchanged. Overall, the
efficacy inachieving the objective was negligible.

2.14       Improve Delivery of Basic Services. To achieve this objective the Government
was to carry out the actions agreed inthe education and health sector reviews o f April
and October 2000, set up fully staffed district water and sanitationteams (DWST) inat
least half o f the districts, and make procurement arrangements for the Ministry o f Health
inaccordance withprocurementregulations. PRSCl also set triggers for PRSC2 in
education, health and water and sanitation aimed at supporting the objectives sought by
the assistance.

2.15       With respect to improved quality of education, the Government carried out the
undertakings agreed to inthe education sector review. The actions covered procedural
aspects, budgetary allocations, educational inputs, and equity o f access. Onprocedural

 aspects IDA and the Government heldjoint sector reviews at six-month intervals, the
 MinistryofPublic Service agreedto ensure access ofall appointed teachers to the payroll
 withinone month ofnotification, andthe Ministryof Educationand Sports completed its
 restructuring and recruitment o fpersonnel.

 2.16     Interms ofbudget allocation,the IMFnotes that the Government spent in
 education 24.9 percent o f its current and total domestic expenditure inits budget year
2000/01,which comes close to the 24.1 percent quoted inthe 2003 PER andthe
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for PRSC1-3, and to the 26.8 percent for
budget allocations reported inby the Government for that year.                          The evidence from
these sources does not support the claim o f the President's Report of the PRSCl that
 semi-annual education sector reviews confirmed that the Government maintainedbudget
allocation and releases for the education sector at a minimumo f 31 percent o f recurrent
discretionary expenditure, o f which at least 65 percent went to primary education. The
review considers this shortfall may have led to a better use o fpublic resources because

for (quality 08education, the program sought to increase the number o f teachers,
there i s evidence that expenditure ineducation has inefficiencies.6With respect to inputs

textbooks and classrooms per student enrolled at the primary level. Two o f the four target
indicators were met; one was not met and the other was not reported (see Table 12).* The
Government also launched a program to recruit 15,000 new teachers. The review
concludes that efficacy inachieving the objective i s substantial.

2.17      To improve the quality of health care, the Government met the prior actions by
fulfilling the requirement for an interimprocurement arrangement inaccordance with
procurement regulations, and carried out the undertakings agreed to inthe health sector
reviewo f 2000. Most o fthe undertakingsconsisted o fprocedures and steps needed to
improve the quality o f health care: initiating the training o f 1,300 nursing assistants,
preparing and submittingprocurement planinthe Ministryo f Healthto establish its
procurement capacity, establishing a contract committee and procurement unit,
completing and disseminatingthe guidelines to deliver a minimumhealthpackage at the
district level, completing the mapping o f health infrastructure, and completing study on
district drug management. Last, the monitoring indicators inSchedule 3 o fthe President's
Report specify that 2,500 Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) outreach sites were
made operational and that 1,300 nurse assistants were trained. This review concludes that
efficacy inachieving the objective was modest

2.18      Finally, with respect to the undertaking to improve access and equity in water and
sanitation, the Governmentmet the prior actions requiring that (a) the Ministry o f
Finance (MOFPED) settle the Ugandanshillings (Ush.) 5 billion debt that Government
agencies owed to the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC); and (b) at least

practice in the sense that if an input moves inthe desired direction there is apresumptionthat quality has improved.
* Accordingto   World Bank 2002, p. 117, the Governmentintroducedanew curriculum, invalidating all existing

sources to determine iftargets were met.

half o f rural districts set up a fully staffed district water and sanitation teams (DWST).
The conditions sought to expand the access and equity to water supply and sanitation in
rural and urbanareas, objective which was achieved, often exceeding targets (See Table
13). This review concludes that efficacy inachieving the objective was substantial.

2.19      Overall, efficacy inachieving the objective o f improving delivery o f basic service
was substantial.

2.20      Outcome.Overall, the relevance ofthe objectives under PRSCl isjudged
substantial. With respect to efficacy, the actions carried out under PRSC1helpedto
increase access to education and water supply and sanitation services. The evidence on
budget allocations and executions indicates that executionfell below the allocations for
sectors that could have helped raise productivity (e.g., education, health, agriculture) and
exceededthe allocation for those that were less likely to increase productivity (e.g., public
administration). Also the expected impacts o f cross-cutting reforms didnot materialize as
insome casesthe reforms were not carried out. Onthe basis ofthe assessmentofrelevance
and efficacy, andthe PRSC's failure to monitor likely outcome o fthe programs initiated
under the prior actions andtriggers, this review rates the Bank's contribution to the
outcome o fthe program as moderately satisfactory

2.21      Riskto DevelopmentOutcome.The Government took actions to advance its
objectives ineducation andwater and sanitation, two sectors it considers essential to reduce
poverty. It made serious efforts to expand educational opportunities for children through
the universal primaryeducation program and was committed to continue that effort and
sought improvements inits quality. The central and local Governments are committed to
                                       '
expand access to water and sanitation. Expandingaccess to education andto water and
sanitation requiredensuring resources for them, which likely happened. The Government
has taken a prudentapproach to ublic finance that is at the hearto f Uganda's past success
and current economic program.            Such approach is likely to continue as the Government's
economic strategy consists o f measured increases indomestic revenue andcontinued
expenditure control, suggesting that the Government would have the resources to support
programs ineducation and water andsanitation.lo         The question remains as to whether that
support would lead to better quality o f education andbetter health outcomes. Nevertheless,
the evidence suggeststhat the risks to development outcomes for education andwater and
sanitation are likely to be moderate.

2.22      On the other hand, the PRSCl advanced little inraising the efficiency inthe use
o f public resources. Vested interests and competing claims for less productive uses (e.g.,
the Public Administration budget) hampered the Government's range o faction. Some
groups see a threat to their interests inthe drive to use public resources better, as well as
inthe attempts to reduce corruption andimprove management inthe public sector under
PRSCl These groups can also collude with the sectors that benefitfrom budget
         .

allocation (education, health, sanitation) to advance their interests, thereby puttingin
jeopardy the gains achieved. Moreover, the actions supported by the PRSCl and those
envisioned for subsequent ones suggest that the scope for improving transparency and
reducing corruption remained limited. Vested interests and ineffective measures can pose
a significant risk to what could be achieved with the actions taken. Overall, the risk to
development outcome i s signficant.

2.23    MonitoringandEvaluation(M&E): Design.The PRSCl established its
objectives and outlined the program to be supported by the two follow-up credits. For
PRSCl,the program defined two indicators for outcomes (reduce headcount index o f
poverty, increased satisfaction with public services) but did not specify baseline and
target values for them nor explainedhow their achievement would leadto improved
quality o f service (e.g. learning outcomes). To monitor andverify results associated with
the program, annual surveys o fhouseholds ando f service delivery, as well as periodic
participatory poverty assessments were to be carried out. Ingeneral, the design o f the
M&Efor PRSCl failed to makeclear the causal chain o fresults from interventionto
outcomes and did not produce the necessary indicators to measure betterthe performance
o f the program. For these reasons, the review rates the design o f M&E as modest.

2.24    M&E:ImplementationandUtilization.PRSC1established a low standard for
the quality o findicators that couldand should have been gathered to evaluate results, and
subsequent PRSCs missed the opportunity to improve on them. Inaddition, fewer than
the specified indicators were collected. Itis clear that the proliferation o fexecuting
agencies andthe short-lived nature o f the PRSC made it difficult to coordinate M&E
activities since no single agency (except perhaps the Ministry o f Finance) had a vested
interested inthe credit. The Ministry o f Finance, on the other hand, i s not equipped to
carry out this hnction. This review rates the quality o f M&E for implementation as
modest. With respect to utilization, given the structure o f PRSCs and its short duration,
the findings ofM&Esystem usually do not affect the programunderimplementation.
Thus, both implementation and utilization o f the M&E system was modest andthe overall
systemis ratedmodest.

2.25    BankPerformance.Bankperformance isjudged largely on ensuring quality at
entry and relevant follow-up dialogue with the implementing agencies. The Bank support
was based on the PEAP, which ensured national ownership o f the program's objectives
and the actions initiated by the credit. While the areas o f focus for Bank assistance in
PRSC1 were appropriate and duly implementedby Government as prior actions (and
triggers for follow-up PRSCs), the program design did not ensure that the expected
outcomes would be achieved. First, the PRSCl did not adequately spell out the
framework for the results chain. Second, the objectives lacked clear and measurable
results indicators, even inprograms like education, health, and water and sanitation
where quantitative indicators existed. Third, most prior actions consisted o f procedural
activities that didnot guarantee achievement of results. On this basis this review rates
Bankperformance moderately satisfactory.

2.26    BorrowerPerformance.The reform program was largely based onthe
Government-owned PEAP which was prepared through extensive consultations,
including participatory poverty assessments, and extensive use o f household surveys and

                                             11


census data, all of which permittedindepth analysis of sector problems. The donor
community consideredthe PEAP as a good strategy to reduce poverty that contained all
the elements consideredessentialfor such strategy: institutional, environmental,
economic and social factors, civic participation, and community development. The
program's ambitious objectives tested the Government's ability to deliver results. The
MinistryofFinance, Planning andEconomic Development coordinated the operation. It
performed well inprocedural terms but it could not ensure ownership among all the
agencies executing the program. Ingeneral, agencies chargedwith preparing and
enacting strategies, laws and action plans did so, but corruption and weak capacity of
Government staff hamperedchange inprocurement and financial accountability. Overall,
Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

      Objectivesand Components

      3.1                                     The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC2) continuedthe support to
     the PEAP that started with PRSC1. At that stage, the three series PRSC was expanded to
     include a fourth operation (PRSC4) inan effort to deepen the reform process.

     poverty reduction strategy. Unlike PRSC1,it included the third pillar of the PEAP (that
     is, increasing the ability o f the poor to raise their incomes) by supporting an enabling
     environment for rural development. Table 3 shows the objectives o f the credit and their
     relationship to the pillars o f the PEAP. The PRSC2 expected that Uganda's reform
     program would improve basic public service delivery, and that the outcome would be a
     reduction o f poverty, measured by a lower headcount index, and increased satisfaction
     withpublic services.

Relevance o f Objectives and Design

3.4     Objectives.PRSC2 sought to resolveproblems that preventedUgandans from
improving their standard o f living and the Government from using its resources better. It
constitutedpart o f the four program PRSC series and therefore its objectives were
deemed relevant as inthe case o f PRSC1. Inaddition, the focus o f PRSC2 included the
PEAP objective to increase the ability o fthe poor to raise their incomes. Since about 85
percent o f Ugandans (and96 percent o f its poor) lived inrural areas, adding this objective
to the program enhanced the relevance o f PRSC2 thus yielding a high rating.

3.5     Design. The PRSC2 incorporatedupdates andrefinements based onthe
experience o f PRSCl (Simplified ICR, Report No. 31762, March 10,2005, p. 1) but
essentially continued with the designo fthe PRSC1 and therefore was characterized by
the designflaws associated with PRSCl Most o f the prior actions were procedural and
                                          .
the results chain was poorly defined making it difficultto monitor outcomes. This review
rates the relevance o f design as modest. Despite these shortcomings indesign, the overall
relevance o f objective i s considered substantial.

Achievement o f Objectives (Efficacy)

3.6     This section assesses the implementationo fthe program andthe outcomes
associated with the key objectives o f PRSC2.

3.7     EfficientandEquitableUse of PublicResources.The program supported
Government's effort to achieve an efficient and equitable use o f public resources for
improved access to public services, to be monitored by annual service delivery surveys,
as well as through periodic participatory poverty assessments. The Government carried
out the prior actions specified inthe credit agreement (see Table 7). It agreed with donors
on a MTEF for 2001/02-2003/04 and executed the 2001/02 budget inthe first two
quarters inaccordance with the agreed allocations. Also, although not a condition of the
credit agreement, MOFPED included inthe MTEF for 2002/03- 2004/05 indicative
expenditure ceilings for donor-financed projects ineducation, health, andwater and
sanitation. Inthe absence o f a baseline survey for service delivery standards, it i s not
possible to assess the outcome o f these efforts. Actual expenditures by sectors came
within 90 percent or more o fthe budget allocations, except for agriculture and economic
functions and social services (86 and 87 percent o f the allocation) and public
administration (114 percent o f the allocation). PRSC2, like PRSC1,lacked well defined
outcome indicators for this objective, which explains why while procedural efficacy was
high from a results view point the efficacy i s modest. The review concludes that efficacy
was modest.

3.8     ImprovedServiceDeliverythroughCross-cuttingReforms.The program
sought to improve service delivery through cross-cutting reform, and expected as its
overall outcome (a) an increased access andusage o fpublic services; and (b) a reduction
incorruption inpublic services. With respect to improvedmanagement systems and
practices inthe public sector, the implementation o f the program fell short o f
expectations. The Cabinet approved and published a pay strategy consistent with MTEF,

                                                 16


the MPS developed a draft strategic framework for public service reform, and MOFPED
submitted the procurement bill to Parliament. The pay strategy was not carried out as
expected and the public service reform envisioned inthe program was not realized,
because the strategy was "stalled at the conceptual level with no action despitethe fact
that reform needs had been clearly analyzed inthe Public Administration Study" (World
Bank 2005c, p. 19). The Government could not control expenditures on Public
Administration (including political administrations and transfer grants to districts),
thereby undermining the objective pursued under its pay strategy for public sector
performance. Moreover, the ICRGindicator for the quality o f the bureaucracy shows no
change duringthe period under review. Regarding procurement, the Public Procurement
Law was approved thereby permittingthe set up o fprocurement units inthe central and
local Governments although procurement issues persisted. While efficacy inthis aspect
o f the program was substantial, outcomes were negligible.

3.9      Indealing withthe needfor improvedtransparency andreducedcorruption, the
Government (a) hadparliament to pass a leadership code and to establish an Inspector
General o f Government; and (b) requiredselect highlevel Government officials to submit
to the IGGtheir statement o f income, assets, and liabilities. Compliance was once again
highat the procedural level butthe evidence, as for PRSC1,indicates that effi`cacy in
achieving the objectives was negligible. As noted above, the absence o f well defined and
reasonable results indicators plus the evidence surveyed above explains why high
efficacy inprocedures can leadto such low efficacy o f outcomes. Overall, efficacy i s
rated negligible.

3.10    Promotionof EnablingEnvironmentfor RuralDevelopment.The program's
overall outcomes included (a) increased access and usage o f agricultural and rural
services; (b) increased proportion o f household agricultural production sold; and (c)
reduced environmental degradation. The credit sought to promote the enabling
environment through prior actions on land management and on research and technology,
which were met. On research and technology, the Ministryo f Agriculture, Animal
Industries and Fisheries (MAAIF)completed a draft institutional review o f public
fundingo f agriculturalresearch. On landmanagement MOFPED andthe Ministry o f
Water, Landsand Environment (MOWLE) agreed on the financial and institutional
arrangements for executing the land sector strategic plan(LSSP). The actions consisted
o fprocedural steps whose effects on agriculture depend on the incentives for research
and for creating well functioning landmarkets. Between 2000/01 and 2001/02
development expenditure for agriculture increased its share intotal development
expenditure from 4.2 to 7.0 percent. The increase indicates an effort to support
agriculture, but it may take some time for the higher expenditure to show its effect on the
sector and the welfare o f people inrural areas. Because the short-term effect on
agricultural productivity i s not clear, the efficacy o f the program i s rated modest.

3.11    ImprovedDeliveryof Basic Services. The program sought to improve the
quality o f education and the quality o f health care, and to improve access and equity in
water and sanitation. The program expected to achieve as overall outcome (a) universal
primary educationand improved learningoutcomes inprimaryeducation; (b) increased
satisfaction with and increased access and usage of health care services; and (c) increased
satisfaction with and increased access and usage o f water and sanitation services. To

                                                    17


achieve the overall objective the Government carried out the actions agreed inthe
education and health sector reviews o f April and October 2001,the Directorate o f Water
Development established fully staffed technical support units, andthe National Water and
Sewerage Corporation adopted a formula for periodic tariff adjustments.

3.12     Efforts to improve the quality of education included enhanced budget allocation
and expenditure management. The PD for PRSC2 noted a minimumbudgetary allocation
of 31 percent of recurrent discretionary expenditure for education, o f which no less than
65 percent went to primary education. Onthe other hand, the IMF estimated that in
2001/02 total expenditure ineducation reached 24.1 percent o f the Government's total
domestic expenditure, while current expenditure ineducation reached 25 percent o f the
Government's current expenditure, below the targets report inthe PD. As noted inthe
discussion o fthe PRSC1,and inview o fthe inefficiencies inpublic expenditure in
education, the review does not consider this shortfall a shortcoming o f the program as it
may have ledto less waste ineducation expenditure. On expenditure management the
Government carried out a financial audit for education expenditures for the central and
local Governments for the previous financial year. The program also sought to increase
the number o f teachers, textbooks and classrooms per student enrolled; the target was met
for the pupilper classroom ratio only. The authorities recruited 6,683 teachers duringthe
year,12 leading to partial fulfillment o fthe target established. The established equity
targets were not met. The share of appropriate age range o f girls and boys inPrimary 7
nationally and by district reached 8 percent, below the 16percent benchmark.
Nevertheless, the Government produced a draft policy paper that explored options to
enhance equitable access to education by disadvantaged groups. The review considers
that efficacy inachieving the objective was modest.

3.13     To improve quality of health care, the Government carried out the undertakings
agreed to inthe health sector review o f April 2001 and confirmed inthe October 2001
review. Most actions agreed to inthe review referred to procedural aspects, including one
requiringthe Ministryof Healthto make interim procurementarrangements in
accordance with the procurement regulation. Inhuman resources an important step taken
was to clean up the payroll o f the health sector and to consolidate all staff into the
primaryhealthcare strategy (PHC) conditional grant payroll. The Government also
starteda strategy for in-service training andcontinuing education. Inprocurement the
Government produced a comprehensive medium-term procurement plan. InJinance the
Government announced its commitment to increasingthe proportion o f Government
funds allocated to the health sector, andthe Ministries o fHealth and Finance reviewed

3.14    The Government metthe prior actions agreedto. They requiredthat (a) the Minister
o fWater, LandsandEnvironment (MWLE) andthe Directorate o fWater Development
(DWD)establish fully staffedtechnical support units; and(b) the National Water and
Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) adopted a formula for periodictariffadjustments. The
Government also met all but one o fthe quantitative targets set forth for the PRSC2. The
conditions sought to expandthe access to and improve the equity o fwater supply and
sanitation inrural andurbanareas, anobjective that was essentially achieved. The review
concludes that efficacy inachieving the objective was substantial, Table 13 presentsthe
relevant informationshowing that the indicators were met.

substantial.

Ratings

3.16    Outcome.The actions taken helpedto achieve the expenditure targets partially,
to increase access to health and water supply and sanitation services, and to increase the
number o fclassrooms, reducingthe number o fstudents per classroom. Inrural
development the review notes the increase inthe investment budget for agriculture, a
necessary and important step for generating and disseminating technology, but not
enough to change living conditions inthe short-term. Little changed interms o f
transparency, and reduced corruption. The review rates the project outcome as
moderately satisfactory.

3-17    Riskto DevelopmentOutcome.The PRSC2 built onPRSC1but its design, and
the nature o f the prior actions and the expected results remained essentially unchanged.
The economic andpolitical conditions inUganda experienced little change during 2001
to mid-2003, when PRSCl and PRSC2 were effective. For these reasons, the review
considers the challenges faced by PRSC2 as similar to that o f PRSC1, and rates the risk
to development outcome as signzfzcant.

3,18    M&E:Design.The PRSC2 specifiedquantitative targets to monitor progress in
improving service delivery and added indicators to tracking progress inthe efficient and
equitable use o f public resources and financial management. Three indicators were
specified for monitoring macroeconomic performance (inflation, international reserves,
and real GDP growth), buttheir link to achieving an efficient and equitable use o fpublic
resources was not made clear. As with PRSC1, the M&E framework for PRSC2 fell
short o f explaining how achieving inputtargets inthe delivery o f basic services would
leadto better quality (e.g., learning outcomes, reduced infant mortality). This review
rates the design o f monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as modest.

3.19    M&E:Implementation.The PRSC2 expandedthe number ofmonitoring
indicators and outcome targets relative to PRSCl but the effort to track them fell short of
what was needed. Several reasons contributed to shortcomings inimplementation. First,
the Government did not carry out the annual surveys o f households and service delivery

                                                       19


which were identified as the way to verify overall outcome for the program.13 Second, the
parties involved inpreparing the PRSC2 did not solve its problems o f design during
preparation (essentially, its implementationperiod) and did not correct the weaknesses
inherent inthe indicators selected to evaluate results. Third, stakeholders had little
ownership o f implementationo fthe credit and, as a result, o f its expected results. This
review rates the quality o f M&E for implementation as modest.

3.20    M&E:Utilization.The PRSC2hadthe same shortcomings inutilizationofits
M&E system as PRSCl For example, M&E did not assess whether the theory o fchange
                             .
withinthe project and its logic ofcausality were sound, nor didthe indicators o fPRSC2
measure outcome better than those inPRSCl Inaddition, the M&E effort did not affect
                                                         .
the design o fPRSC3.This reviewrates the quality o fM&E for utilizationas modest.
Overall, the M&E systemfor PRSC2 i s ratedas modest.

3.21    Bankperformance.Bankperformancefor PRSC2 must bejudged onthe quality
at entry, that is, the quality of the interventions that support the program and the results
indicators that permit evaluatingprogress. Because PRSC2 has a structure similar to that
o f PRSCl the comments that apply to Bank performance inPRSCl are also valid for
PRSC2. The expansion of objective to include rural development and associated
interventions did enhance Bankperformance under PRSC2. As a result, overall quality at
entry did not change and the review rates Bank performance moderately satisfactory.

3.22    Borrowerperformance.Borrower performance for PRSC2 mustbejudged to a
large extent on the quality at entry o fthe credit but also on its readiness to meet the prior
actions agreed to, After the credit's approval it took more than nine months for the
Government to meet the prior actions it had agreed to, which suggests that the
Government was not ready to carry out some o f the actions it had agreed to. For this
reason, the review rates Borrower performance moderately unsatisfactory.

4. Third Poverty ReductionSupport Credit

Objectives and Components

4.1        The third poverty reduction support credit (PRSC3) continued the support to the
PEAP provided through the PRSCl and 2. It was provided ina form o f a grant and was
approved in September 9,2003, disbursed inFebruary 11,2004, and closed in September
30,2004.0bjectives. The grant supported the four pillars o f the Government's reform
program spelled out inits PEAP. Beyondthe overall PRSC objective to help improve
basic service delivery, PRSC3's specific objectives were to: (a) achieve an efficient and
equitable use o f public resources; (b) improve service deliverythrough cross-cutting
reforms; (c) promote an enabling environment for rural development; and (d) improve
delivery o f basic services (Table 5).

Relevance of Objectives and Design

4.3         Objectives,The PRSC3 followed the same reform framework andemployed the
same objectives as those of the precedingtwo PRSCs, consistent with the overall thrust
o f the four PRSC series. Inthis respect, the relevance o f objectives for the PRSC3 i s rated
high consistent with the previous PRSC.

4.4         Design.The credit had a weak design. Because it shared manyelements of design
with PRSCl and PRSC2, it also shared their weaknesses. The PRSC3 focused "on
actions to deepen reforms inmost o fthe sectors covered inthe first two PRSCs and
incorporated additional financial sector issues such as pen~ion."'~Like the PRSCl and 2,
PRSC3 did not explain how meetingprocedural conditions and achieving certain input
targets ensured that it would achieve their objectives. Furthermore, the monitoring
requirementfor PRSC3 was expanded to correspond to the increased number of
indicators. Overall, PRSC3 had unrealistic expectations given the objectives, the prior
actions, the triggers established, and the Government's capacity to deliver on them. As a
result,the review rates the relevance o f design as negligible and overall relevance of
objectives and designmodest.

Achievement of Objective (Efficacy)

4.5         EfficientandEquitableUse of PublicResources. The PRSC3 supported this
objective with interventions inbudget allocation, intergovernmental transfers, focus on
results orientation, and financial sector reforms. The prior action consisted o f donors and
Government agreeing on MTEFfor 2002/03-2004/05 and executing the 2002/03 budget
through the first two quarters consistent with the agreed allocations. The review finds that
budgetary inputswere delivered andthat actual expenditure for 2002103 came within 97-
105 percent o f budget allocations for all sectors but security, which exceeded its
allocationby 13 percent. Total expenditure and net lending increased from 19.3 percent
o f GDP in 1998/99 to 23.4 percent o f GDP in2002/03, and foreign financing reached
13.7 percent o f GDP in 1998/99 and 15.6 percent o f GDP in2002/03. Because the
Government lacked the capacity to absorb the large amounts o f aid "resulted in
absorption problem^"'^. Expenditures indefense exceeded their budget allocations,
causing cuts indevelopment expenditures by about 15 percent o f the initial allocation,
thereby undermining the effort to improve budgetmanagement. l6 As inprevious PRSCs,
the gap inefficacy o f procedures and efficacy o f outcomes arises from the lack o f a
reasonable link betweenthe prior actions and the expected outcomes and the absence of
well designed results indicators for this objective. The review concludes that efficacy in
achieving an efficient and equitable use o f public resources was modest.

4.6         ImproveServiceDeliverythrough Cross-cuttingReforms.The PRSC3 sought
to achieve this goal by supporting actions leading to an improvement inmanagement
systems andpractices and to less corruption and more transparency and participation..

4.7     To improve managementsystems andpractices inpublic sector, the PRSC3
supported interventions and demanded prior actions inthe areas o f public service
management, public procurement, and financial management. The Government carried
out the prior actions specified inthe credit agreement. Specifically, for public service
management: (a) MOFPED and MPS agreed on target salary adjustments inline with the
pay reform strategy, and the associated wage bill reflected inMTEF; and (b) MPS, in
collaborationwith line ministries, submitted preliminary findings on cost effectiveness
and efficiency o f employment/staff utilization insocial sectors. Onpublic procurement,
the Procurement Bill was enacted, with the bill ensuringcompetition inthe selection o f
third party procurement agents. On financial management, the Public Financeand
Accountability Billwere enacted. O fthe three areas covered, the one for financial
management had outcome indicators, one o f which was met andthe other two were not
(see Table 14). Moreover, the rapid expansion inpublic service employment constitutes a
threat to pay reform and overall civil service reform. Although the Government reduced
its work force from 320,000 workers in 1990 to 160,000 in 1997, the effort was nullified
by the subsequent expansion inemployment, which reached 220,000 by 2003 inthe
absence o f a functional review.To some extent this has been made possible by the large
inflows o f foreign aid the Government received duringthose years. This review
concludes that efficacy inachieving this objective was negligible.

4.8     The PRSC3 sought to help achieve increased transparency andparticipation, and
reduced corruption by requiring the Government to carry out the following prior action:
the Inspectorate General o fGovernment (IGG) issuedletters for disciplinary action
against Ministers, PresidentialAdvisors, Permanent Secretaries, Directors, and Uganda
Revenue Authority officials who failed to declare their income, assets, and liabilities.
While this action was a bold move, it did very little to improve the environment for
reducing corruption. Available evidence suggests that people believedthat corruption
was lower in2004 than in2003 and 2001,but the change does not constitute a significant
one (from a statistical view point) to suggest that the practice has declined. The review
concludes that efficacy inachieving the objective has been negligible.

4.9     PromoteEnablingEnvironmentfor RuralDevelopment.Topromote an
enabling environmentfor rural development,the PRSC3 supported interventions inland
management. The focus was on the LandAct o f 1998 and a prior action required that the
MWLE andthe Public Services Commission complete the recruitment o f staff for the
division incharge o f executing the land sector strategic plan. Staffing the office charged
with executingthe land sector strategic planwas necessary to give people access to land
but landdistribution did not improve. The village census andother studies showed that
the wealthiest landholders increasedtheir holdings, rather thanpoor households
increasingtheir access to land.Moreover, rural poverty increased, and by 2002/03 about
49 percent o f the self-employed were under the poverty line, up from 39 percent in
1999/2000. The review concludes that efficacy inachieving the objective was negligible.

4.10    ImprovedDelivery of Basic Services. The PRSC3 helpedto improve the quality
of education, the quality o f health care, and the access to water and sanitation andthe
equity o f access through a set o f prior actions: (a) the Government to carry out the actions
agreed inthe education and health sector reviews o f April and October 2002; (b) the
Ministryo fPublic Services to approve the reorganization o fthe Directorateo fWater

                                               25


Development; and (c) MOFPEDand NWSC to agree on a time-bound action planto
settle the existing arrears owed to NWSC andtake measures to prevent new ones.

4.1 1   To achieve improved quality of education, the Government agreed to carry out the
undertakingsagreedto inthe education sector reviews o f April 2002 and October 2002,
which consisted o f meeting financial commitments, carrying out procedural aspects, and
meeting quantitative input and output targets. To this effect, the program document notes
that the Government allocated a minimumo f 3 1percent o f recurrent discretionary
expenditure for education, o f which no less than65 percent went to primary education.
Actual expenditurewas not consistent with the percentages noted inthe program
document. IMF data indicate that total expenditure ineducation in2002/03 reached only
23.3 percent o f total domestic expenditure. Again, as noted inPRSCl and PRSC2, in
view o fthe inefficiencies documented inpublic expenditure ineducation, the review does
not consider this a shortcoming o f the program. Similarly, the program sought to increase
the number o f teachers, textbooks and classrooms per student enrolled but he targets were
not met. The actual pupils per teacher ratio, 58, exceeded the target o f 50, and the actual
pupils per classroom ratio, 94, exceeded the target o f 92. N o targets were set for the
pupil-text book ratio. Duringthe review the parties strengthened the mechanisms for
monitoring the share o f positions for teachers filled. The parties also discussed a draft
policy framework that included the costs o f expanding post-primary education and
training. To achieve equity, the Government also prepared a draft framework for basic
education for disadvantaged children with costs; this information was used for the
2003/04 budgeting cycle. The review concludes that efficacy inachieving the objective
was modest.

4.12    Efforts to improve the quality of health care led to a wide range o f undertakings,
including (i) the production o f a strategy to justify increasing health sector allocation
to15 percent o f the total Government budget, up to a minimumo f $25 per capita, (ii)    the
need to improve the flow o f funds to and within the Ministry o f Health, and (iii)  the
carrying out o f studies, conducting needs assessment o f staffing levels, and reviewing the
structure o f Ministryo f Healthheadquarters and regional referral hospitals. Benchmarks
for vaccinations, HIV prevalence, service utilization levels, staffing o f private-not-for-
profit health units (PNFP), and institutional deliveries inGovernment and PNFP health
unitswere established. These benchmarks were exceeded for all indicators, except for
HIV prevalence and institutional deliveries.     The review concludes that efficacy in
achieving the objective was substantial.

4.13    With respect to access and equity inwater and sanitation, the Government metthe
prior actions agreed to as well as some o f the monitoring indicators. The achievement for
urbanwater supply and sanitation exceeded their targets andfell short o fthe expectation
for rural water supply and sanitation; no information i s available to establish ifthe targets
for small town water supply and sanitation were met (Table 15). The review concludes
that efficacy inimproving access to water and sanitation was substantial.

Ratings

4.14    Outcome.The actions taken didnot leadto more efficient and equitable use of
public resources nor to the cross-cutting reforms that could improve service delivery, but
they helpedto increase access to education, health, and water supply and sanitation
services. Given the progress made on all fronts and subject to the failure to link outputs
and procedures to expected outcomes, this review rates the outcome o f PRSC3 as
moderately unsatisfactory.

4.15    Riskto DevelopmentOutcome.The PRSC3 succeeded inits aimofimproving
delivery o f services ineducation, healthcare, and sanitation. It did not succeed in
improving service delivery through cross-cutting reforms, or inincreasing the efficiency
and equity o fpublic resources or inpromoting an enabling environment for rural
development. The risks to development outcomes noted for PRSCl and PRSC2 remain
valid for PRSC3. The large dependence o fthe Government's budget on grants, and the
inability of the Government to reduce it, poses significant risk to future expansion to
service delivery. The Government has increased revenues by less than one percent o f
GPD and its deficit inthe absence o f grants remained high(11.3 percent o f GDP),
suggestingproblems with expenditure control. For these reasons the review rates the risk
to development outcome as signzjkant.

4.16    Monitoringand Evaluation. PRSC3 suffered from the same deficiencies in design
noted for PRSCl and 2: mismatched sets o f indicators with prior-actions, insufficient
explanation o f the choice o f indicators, and inadequate monitoring. As such, the design is
rated modest. Interms o f implementation, the Government carried out national integrity
surveys which gathered information on delivery o f public services ineducation and
health and on perceptions o f corruption. Despite the surveys, the scarcity o f statistics
continued, although agencies like the NWSC and sectors like education andhealth
gathered data to assess performance and adjusted targets according to that information.
The quality o f M&Efor implementationis thus substantial. Butthe PRSC3 hadthe same
shortcomings inutilization o f M&E as PRSCl and PRSC2. The program document
neither assessedthe theory o f change within PRSC3 nor tried to go beyond inputs and
outputs to measure outcomes. Overall, M&Ewas only modest.

4.17    BankPerformance.This review rates Bankperformance moderately
unsatisfactory. The rating i s based on the problems o f designand quality at entry
discussed earlier and on the problems o f design o f M&Enoted above.

4.18    BorrowerPerformance,This review rates Borrower performance moderately
satisfactory. The Government had spelled out its reform program inthe PEAP. The
PEAP set goals and means to achieve them, guidingpolicy and imposing some discipline
to Government actions. The Government met the prior actions set inthe program
document for PRSC3 but did not spend as much ineducation as it was expected from the
budget allocations agreed to. The review notes that there seems to be a trend to reduce
corruption, but the trend does not constitute a significant change to assert that it
represents a true break with past practices.

       Background

        5.1                                    The PRSC4, the final inthe series o f PRSCs, continued the Bank's support to
      Uganda for its service delivery and rural development reform program. Unlikethe
      previous PRSCs, the objectives o f PRSC4were better defined, the results orientation was
       much improved, and its focus on gender, andinfant and maternalmortality was sharpened.

       Objectivesand components

       5.2                                     Objectives.The PRSC4 defined as anoverall objective o fthe programthe
       equitable accessto and effective delivery o fpublic service and improved rural
       development. The grant sought to achieve ten outcomes to matchthe four pillarso fthe
       Government's PEAP (Table 7).'* The ten outcomes were similar to the themes identified
       inthe four objectives ofPRSC1-3, buttheydefine better what to expect fromthe
       interventions. Table 7 outlines the similarities between the PEAP, PRSCl-3 and PRSC4.
       The PRSC4aligned its objectives with those o fthe PEAP whose broad strategy was
      relevant indealing with the problemsUganda faced at the time.

Relevance of Objectivesand Design

5.4      Like the previous PRSCs inthe series, the relevance o f PRSC4's objectives i s
relevant inmeeting the development needs o f Uganda. Inaddition, because PRSC4
defined its objectives muchbetter and reduced their scope, this made it possible to
articulate with more precision what was expected to be achievedwith the prior actions. In
addition, PRSC4 also defined three-year outputs that were essential steps towards
achieving the long-term outcomes that the PEAP targeted. By makingits objectives and
results indicators more precise and the chain o f results more explicit, the design o f
PRSC4 became more relevant thanthose o f PRSC1-3. This review rates overall relevance
and the relevance o f designas substantial.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)

Pillar I:Creatinga Frameworkfor Economic Growth and Structural Transformation
5.5      EfficientandEquitableUse ofPublicResources.Consistent withPRSC 1-3, as
part o fthe annual public expenditure review, the Government had agreed on anMTEFfor
2003/04-2005/06 withthe donors and executed the 2003/04 budget through the four
quartersconsistent withbudget allocations. But largediscrepancies appear between actual
andbudgeted expenditures by sectors. For example, expenditure insecurity exceeded
planned budgetby 25 percent, while expenditures for roads and works, agriculture, health,
and economic function and social services fell below their targets by 40 percent, 31
percent, and 44 percent. Expenditure exceeded the budgeted amounts by 19 percent in
public administration, 18 percent injustice and law, and 12percent ineducation.                         These
numbers suggest that the actual allocations didnot lead to a more efficient and equitable
use o fpublic resources. The PER for 2007 concludes that progress was markedly slow in
increasing expenditure efficiency.         2oFor example, expenditure inthe education sector                -
from pre-primarythrough universitypost-graduate -accounted for one-fourth o fthe
Government's domestic expenditure. A recent internal Bank report found that the internal
efficiency o fprimary education was low for two reasons. First, leakage o f resources
between the central Government andthe school through ghost teachers, and misuse o f UPE
grants to district Governments. Second, resources leak withinthe schools, mainly
attributable to highrates o f student, teacher, and headmaster absenteeism.21 Efficacy in
achievingthe objective was negligible.

Pillar 11:StrengtheningGood Governanceand Security
5.6      ImprovedCapacityandPerformanceofthe PublicService.The Government
carried out the prior actions specified inthe credit agreement but they are unlikely to have
ledto animproved capacity andperformance o fthe public service. The appraisal document
for the Uganda Public Service Performance Enhancement Project notedthat capacity inthe
public sector hadnot increased and suggestedthat deficiencies incapacity stalled the

execution o fthe PRSP during 2001-2006.22 An indicator o fbureaucratic quality produced
by ICRGindicates that the quality is low andremained unchanged duringthe periodunder
review. The review concludes that efficacy inachievingthe outcome was negligible.

5.7        Strengthened Rule of Law, Transparency, Detection and Sanctioning of
Corrupt Practices. The Government met the two conditions for this objective making
efficacy at the procedural level high.But the evidence on rule o f law, transparency, and
corruption indicates that the country advanced little. 23 The ICRGindicator for
corruption indicates that the practice i s widespread and little changed duringthe period
reviewed. According to the corruption perception index o f Transparency International
Uganda's level moved from 2.1 in2002 to 2.2 in2003 and 2.6 in2004, ranking it inthe
top 5th, 15th, and 30thpercent o f the most corrupt countries inthe world. The change
shows an improvement inperceptions o f corruption, but it does not represent a real break
with the past. Despite conceptual limitations with corruption perception indexes, they
suggest weaknesses inachieving the goals set inPRSC4 and thus the efficacy i s rated
negligible.

PILLAR IV: Improvingthe Quality of Life of thePoor
5.8        To achieve this objective the PRSC4 set as prior action the satisfactory
implementation o fthe undertakings agreed inthe (a) health and education sector reviews
inNovember 2002 andconfirmedbythe November 2003 review; and (b) water and
sanitation sector review in September 2003 and confirmed by the March2004 review.

5.9        Universal Primary Education. PRSC4 supported the Government goal o f
universal primary education by improving budget allocation to the education sector. The
program document notes that Government allocated a minimumo f 31percent of
recurrent discretionary expenditure for education, o f which no less than 65 percent went
to primary education. But IMFdata show that actual total Government expenditure in
education in2003/04 accounted for 22.2 percent o f the Government's total domestic
expenditure, below the 31percent established inthe prior actions. As argued before, this
i s not necessarily a shortcoming when there is evidence that expenditure ineducation is
inefficient. The PRSC4 also supported improvement inthe quality o f teaching (pupils per
teacher), increased access to learning materials (pupils per textbook), and improved
learning environment (pupils per classroom). Of the three outcomes, only the target for
access to learning materials was achieved, with three pupils per textbook. The other two
outcomes fell short o f their goals (58 pupils per teacher versus a target o f 52, and 94
pupilsper classroom versus a target o f92). Onequity, PRSC4fell short o fachieving the
goal o f having 12percent o f girls and boys o f appropriate age range completing primary
grade 7, as 10.7 percent o f boys and 9.3 percent o f girls did so. Overall, efficacy was
modest.




22 The PAD notes that "Under the resultsorientedmanagement approach(ROM), which remainsthe core component
of the PRSP, ministries,departments and agencies (MDAs) are requiredto plan, implement, monitor and evaluate
performance. However,the low capacity and a weak incentivesysteminMDAs,          .,.,haveseverely constrained
progressin institutionalizingthe results-basedapproach within the public service management." World Bank, 2006c,

  I        Health. The PRSC4 also supported reforms to reduce child mortality, provide
better maternal health care, andmake progress against HIV/AIDS,malaria and other
diseases. Ofthe outcomes sought, the percentage o f children receiving DPT3 vaccination
exceeded its target (83 percent versus 65 percent), the prevalence rate o f HIV fell short o f
its target (6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent), and the institutional deliveries inhealth units
basically reached its target (25 percent target versus 24.4 percent actual). Inaddition, the
mortalit rate (per 1,000) for infants dropped from 89 to 75, and for under-five from 158
to 137.    y4 Maternal     mortality stood at 435 per 100,000 births for the ten year period 1995-
2005.25The achievement o f objectives was therefore substantial.

5.11       ImprovedAccess to FunctionalWater and SanitationServices.The
Government carried out undertakingswhich consisted o frevising sector investment and
operational plans, developing and initiating implementation o f a subsidy policy and
strategy for the sector as a whole, and accelerating the implementation o f the institutional
reform process inthe urbanwater and sanitation subsector. The targets for rural water
supply and sanitation were not met. Missing this target was a setback for the program
because 87 percent o f the people live inrural areas.26For small towns, one target was met
andthere is no information for two other targets. For urbanareas, except for the need to
establish the level o f unaccounted water, all targets were met (Table 18). This review
concludes that efficacy in improving access was modest.

5.12      Outcome.The actions taken under PRSC4 didnot leadto more efficient and
equitable use o f public resources nor to cross-cutting reforms that would improve service
delivery, but they helped to increase access to education, health, and water supply and
sanitation services. This review rates the project outcome as moderately unsatisfactory.

5.13      Riskto DevelopmentOutcome.Thisreviewconsiders the risks to development
outcome for PRSC4 similar to those for PRSC1-3. Four points need to be highlighted.
First,despite the growth ofdomestic revenues the Government continued to depend
heavily on foreign aidto finance its large level o f expenditures. Second, Government
investment as percent o f GDP has remained stable, inpart crowded out by the growth o f
public employment and o f expenditures inpublic administration. Third, investment

UgandaDemographic and HealthSurvey (UDHS). See UgandaBureauof Statistics and Macro InternationalInc., 2006,
Figure9.1, p. 112
25 The UDHS notesthat "it i s impossible to say with confidence that maternalmortality has declined" and "a decline in
the maternalmortality ratio is not supported by the trends in relatedindicators, such as antenatal care coverage,
delivery in healthfacilities, andmedicalassistance at delivery, all of which have increasedonly marginallyover the last
ten years." Ibid., p. 282. Table 2.1 of Governmentof Uganda2007%shows a decline inmaternalmortality per 100,000
birthsfrom 505 in 2001 to 435 in 2006. The Report quotes the UDHSas its source, but its interpretationdiffers from
UDHS
26 Accordingto the Government'spoverty status reportfor 2005 "access to rural water supplies remainsambiguous.
access to rural water supplies increasedfrom 54.9% in 2002 to 61.3% in 2004/05., on the basesthat functionalityrates
nationwideare reportedto be significantlybelow the 100% mark, amore realistic figure for access to ruralwater
supplies has beenestimatedat 49.7%." Moreover,newpopulationfigures show a larger rural populationmeaningthat

expenditurehas a large component ofrecurrent expenditures, making itmore difficult to
reduce expenditures ifthe need arises.           27Fourth, according to Freedom House both the
functioning o f Government and the rule o f law have deteriorated since 2006, which
suggests that any gains achieved so far will be harder to maintain. For these reasons the
reviewrates the riskto development outcome as signvcant.

5.14      M&E:Design.The PRSC4program document improved significantly on the
design of M&E over that o f PRSC1-3. The Policy Results Matrix defined better the
expected outcomes and the indicators to judge results, explained better the results chain
between prior actions and outcomes, identified the sources o f information to check on
results, and inmost instances specified the baseline and target values. As the
Government notes inits comments to the ICR, the PRSC4 enhanced the focus on
resultsS2*Still, some shortcomings persist. First, the operation had an unwieldy policy
results matrix that covered many actions, most o f them unrelatedto what the operation
supported and intendedto achieve. As a result, separating achievements o f the operation
from general changes inUganda became difficult. Second, some results could have been
defined with more precision. For example, the PRSC4 could have used a better indicator
to determine changes inefficiency and equity inthe use o fpublic resources; the use o f
allocating a percentage o f the budget to priority areas as an index i s not appropriate
because earmarking revenues usually leads to the waste o f resources. This review rates
the design o f monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as modest.

5.15      M&E:Implementation.The PRSC4 expandedthe number o findicators and
outcome targets for monitoring purposes but this was defeated by the absence o f data.
There were also limitations with respect to the definition o f concepts. The shortcomings
didnotprevent donors and Government from monitoring implementation and results.
Uganda has M&E systems for some Government programs that the Poverty Action Fund
supported. With support from PRSC4 the Government beganto establish a national M&E
system inthe Office o f the Prime Minister. Ownership o f M&Eimplementation
increased when the Office o f the Prime Minister took over coordination o f the PRSC, and
other ministriesrecognized its rightto do it, ensuringthat they would carry out the
actions for which they were responsible. Progress inthe various sectors was monitored by
the sector working groups, supplemented by a number o f surveys. Inits comments to the
ICR for PRSC4, the Government notes that "although the policy results matrix for
measuring each outcome and output and progress on indicator have been agreed upon,
measuringo fprogress remains largelya challenge. Also, the linkage o f PRSC to efforts
o f other Bankprojects and development partners inattainment o f poverty reduction and
other benchmarks could further be improved."29 This review rates M&E implementation
as substantial.

5.16      M&E:Utilization.The Bank carried out a stocktakingofPRSCs 1-3 with
UgandanGovernment officials, donors andBank staff. The stocktaking revealed that
identifying and measuring results constituted a key challenge for the PRSCs. The Bank

involvement o f all Government stakeholders inthe dialogue on the reforms that the
PRSCs supported. As a result o fthe changes, Government and development partners
improved their coordination and enhanced their dialogue on prior actions, especially
those dealing with corruption, public service reform, and budget execution and
management, where outcomes have tended to be weaker. These efforts did not translate
into a more effective program as the Government did not deliver on several aspects that
the program supported as the discussion on efficacy shows. The review rates Borrower
performance moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Findings and Lessons

What worked well

6.1     The PRSCs constitutedan effective mechanismto transfer resources to
Government and to support its budget. There is less clarity, though, as to whether the
PRSCs constituted an effective tool to produce development results. Ifthe PRSCs
become a defacto instrument to transfer resources only, the process accompanying its
preparationand the associated conditions may not bejustified. IfBank assistance aims at
supportingthe budget and producing development results, ,it is pertinentto ask ifmaking
the support conditional on prior achievements o f specified outcomes (e.g., growth, fiscal
deficit) might not be more effective thanthe approach used for the PRSCs under review.

6.2     Efficacy indevelopment results varied by area o f support. Substantial results were
achieved ineducation, health, and water and sanitation, where coverage expanded and the
quality o f service improved. Specifically, literacy rates inurbanand rural areas rose;
child and infant mortality fell but maternal mortality remained unchanged; water and
sanitation services expanded their coverage, but more so inurbanareas, where 13 percent
o fthe people lives.

6.3     PRSCs reduce the constraint to the Government's budget, giving the Government
more flexibility to allocate resources to sectors and activities. The support helped ensure
a given level o f support for the budget for education. Inpart as a result o f the support,
public expenditure ineducation reached about four percent of GDP.

What did not work

6.4     Budget support i s unlikely to have improved the achievement o f development
outcomes envisaged for the economy. The large inflow o f external funds created
absorption problems, which resultedinan overvalued exchange rate, higher interest rates,
and higher unit labor costs inthe non-traded goods sector. The traded goods sector,
agriculture inparticular, was disadvantaged and its potential to grow hampered.
Moreover, there was little improvement in local revenue collection, probably dampening
the efforts to improve governance and efficiency inpublic expenditure, since anincrease
inthe taxpayer's base increases the constituency for more accountability andbetter
governance.

6.5     More could have been done on improving efficiency inthe use o f public
resources, improving service delivery, andpromoting rural development. It i s unlikely
that the efficiency o f public expenditures improved overall given the trends in
Government employment andthe allocation o f expenditure. Government employment,
after declining from 320,000 to 160,000 between 1990 and 1997, increased to about
220,000 by 2003 inthe absence o f a functional review. Public domestic expenditure
expanded from 14.9 percent o f GDP in2000/01 to 17.6 percent o f GDP in2003/04, and
the expansion o f Government investment, 0.2 percent o f GDP, was not commensurate
with the foreign assistance receivedduringthe period. Actual expenditures by sectors
came close to matching the allocations for PRSC1-3 but differed from the allocations,

                                              36


sometimes by substantial margins, for PRSC4. Also, expenditures indefense andpublic
administration exceeded their budget allocations, while expenditures inhealth,
agriculture, roads, and social services fell below their budgetallocations.

6.6      Regarding public service delivery, there i s little evidence to suggest that service
delivery improved inareas o f public administration other than health, education, and
water and sanitation inurbanareas. Regarding rural development, the PRSCs had few
interventions inagriculture, and the interventions could not alter rural welfare directly
duringthe period they were active. Farmers' income declined and rural welfare
deteriorated duringthe period: the proportion o f rural people under the poverty line
increased from 39 percent in 1999/2000 to 49 percent in2002/03. The PRSCs might have
affected agriculture indirectly, andnegatively, because the assistance financed a larger
level o f expenditure that tended to reduces the price o ftraded goods (agriculture among
them) relative to non-traded. Finally, it is unlikely that the PRSCs improved governance
andsecurity since neither corruption, nor the quality ofbureaucracy, nor law and order
improved duringthe period under review.

6.7      The policy matrices o fthe PRSCs tended to be too large and ambitious inscope.
Their large size made it difficultto separate what the Bank could support with success
from what it could not. Because such separation was not carried out, the Bank's program
suffered from the ambiguities.A concise policy matrix compels to make evidentthe
connection (or lack thereof) between actions and results, and imposes discipline in
thinkingabout development outcomes andthe specific actions that could generate them.

6.8      With their ambitious objectives andcoverage, the PRSCs strained the
Government's capacity. Carrying out the program unveiled the limitedcapacity o f its
organizations to deliver results. The Ministry o f Finance, Planning and Economic
Development could not force the program on the agencies executing it and ensure their
ownership o f it. Shifting program coordination to the Office o fthe Prime Minister
improved the preparation and execution o f PRSC4, and increased the interaction between
different Government ministries and their involvement inreform. Thus, the selection o f
an apex agency with the proper authority is a necessary aspect for preparing and
implementingPRSCs.

Ratings

6.9      The review concludes that the PRSCs had substantial relevance and modest
efficacy. The credits and grants sought to solve important problems, makingthe
relevance o f their objectives substantial. The design fell short o f what the programs
intended to achieve: the logical chain between actions and results was not specified and
several o f the actions selected for support could not leadto the objectives sought. The
relevance o f design was modest. This review rates overall relevance as substantial for all
PRSCs but PRSC3 whose relevance was modest because o f its weak design. Overall
efficacy was modest, except for PRSC4 which was negligible, because the expected
outcomes did not materialize even though most prior-actions and triggers were met. As a
result, the review rates the outcome for PRSC1-2 moderately satisfactory and the
outcome for PRSC3-4 as moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons and Recommendations

6.10    The PRSCswere effective inprovidingtimely andpredictable resources for the
Government budget but less so inproducing development results. To produce
development results, the Bank needs to pay attention to the design o f the credit, the
quality o f prior actions, and their relation to the expected outcomes.

6.11    PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as investment and sector operations for
solving specific sector issues. The PRSCstended to cover macroeconomic and sector
issues ina broad manner, making it difficult to cultivate ownership inthe agencies
responsible for implementing the program. The assistance i s more likely to succeed
when the Bank targets specific problems andworks their solution with the agencies in
charge o f executing the program.

6.12    A programof budgetsupport tends to create a higher permanent level o f
Government expenditurethat may not be sustainable inthe medium-term. Predictable
budgetsupport may create inflexibilities inexpenditure, forcing donors to continue their
support beyond what was needed or desirable. Uganda exemplifies this situation as the
PRSC series grew over time.
