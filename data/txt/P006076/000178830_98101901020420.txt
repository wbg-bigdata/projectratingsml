I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. General
1.01      Barbados is a densely populated island in the Southeastern
Caribbean with 250,000 people living on an area of 431 km2 and limited
resource endowment. Despite relatively rapid GDP growth during the 1970's,
which brought up the per capita income to about US$3,000 in 1980, serious
*             economic problems persist.  Unemployment has remained at high levels and
existing employment opportunities are frequently not compatible with the
skills of the work force. Since the 1950s, the main economic activity of the
country has been shifting from sugar cane agriculture to industry and
tourism. However, sugar is still an important export commodity providing 25%
to 30% of export earnings in recent years. Despite the high annual average
growth rates of industry (7%) and tourism (8%) in the last decade, the
process of restructuring the economy towards these two sectors is far from
complete, as indicated by the current low shares of GDP (about 11%) for each
of the two sectors. Moreover, the present economic recession of the
Barbadian economy has brought this restructuring process to a halt. Industry
and tourism in Barbados require a new impetus to resume a leading role in the
country's development and to provide needed additional employment
opportunities and foreign exchange earnings.
1.02      After a satisfactory performance since the recession of 1975 with
GDP real growth rates varying between 3.7% (1977) and 7.9% (1979), GDP at
constant prices declined by 2.6% in 1981 and by an estimated 5% in 1982.1/
Tourism was seriously affected by the recession and the main goods producing
sectors--agriculture, construction and manufacturing--suffered a particularly
severe set-back; value added in these sectors declined by about 10% in 1982.
Sugar earnings dropped substantially following a poor crop, and the export
boom of manufactures came to a halt due to the stagnation of the world
economy. The balance of payments worsened significantly between 1980 and
1981. Total exports fell by about 12% in value after four years of growth
averaging 22.4%. Exports of manufactured goods continued to grow by 10%,
only one third of their average growth rate between 1977 and 1980.
Unemployment, which had fallen to 11% of the workforce in 1981, is estimated
to have risen to over 13% in 1982.
1.03      Following severe difficulties in public finances in FY 81/82 the
Government anticipated further weak economic performance, and introduced
austere fiscal measures and tight monetary policies including new taxes,
strict control of the growth of current expenditures, a reduction in capital
expenditures, alignment of domestic interest rates with international rates,
and controls on bank credit. Based on these adjustments, the Government
entered into a stand-by arrangement with the IMF in October 1982 in the
1/ Preliminary estimate by the Central Bank of Barbados.

amount of SDR 32.0 million. The Government was also provided with SDR 12.6
under the compensatory financing facility.
1.04      In addition to these fiscal measures for countering the effects of
the current recession, the government has taken steps which would assist
industry and tourism to resume a long-term growth trend.  In the industrial
sector, the government has initiated, with the financial assistance of the
Bank (under Loan 1813-BAR), an industrial development strategy study to
identify products with promising export markets. The Government is also
analyzing the impact of existing policies on desired development with a view
of improving the system of industrial incentives and protection. Resulting
policy recommendations of these two exercises will be discussed with the
Bank.  In tourism, the government has recently implemented controls to
reorient the construction of new hotel capacity away from the congested areas
to the less developed parts of the island. A program of upgrading existing
tourism facilities is currently underway. The proposed project would support
these efforts by providing financing for manufacturing development and for
the upgrading of tourism facilities (para 1.15).
B. The Manufacturing Sector
1.05      During the period 1974-1980, manufacturing grew at a real average
annual rate of over 7%, which is above the country's economic growth rate for
this period.  In the late 1970's manufacturing grew at about the same rate as
the economy and its share in GDP remained at about the 11% level until 1981
(Table 1.1).     Manufacturing growth was particularly high in the metal

products and assembly industries, including electronics which have a strong
export orientation: from 1971 to 1981 this subsector grew at an average
annual rate of 15%, followed by 9.1% for chemicals, petroleum and
non-metallic mineral products. Paper, printing and publishing grew at 8%,
followed by textiles and clothing with 7.6% annual growth. Domestic market
oriented industries, such as food processing and wood products, generally had
below average growth until 1980. The sharp recession in the economy since
1981 has affected manufacturing initially more than the rest of the economy.
Manufacturing dropped by about 3% in 1981 and by another 1% in 1982.  Garment
manufacturing and metal and assembly products are the only major industrial
subsectors that continued to grow during 1981/82. While food and beverages
and tobacco maintained a predominant share of manufacturing sector value
added until 1981, the contribution of metal products and assembly industries
to industrial value added rose substantially.

1.06      Food processing is the predominant sector of manufacturing activity
in terms of value added, 34%, followed by metal products and assembly, 24%
and textiles and garments, 18%. Also the share of food processing
industries' investments was by far the highest among the manufacturing sector
(table 1.2), while metal products and assembly and textiles and garments were
the leading subsectors in terms of their share of manufactured exports.
Regarding ownership, over one half of the 158 industrial establishments
included in the 1979 industrial survey were fully or mainly foreign owned.
All of the 24 enterprises operating as enclave industries are foreign owned.
In line with the increase of foreign ownership during the last two decades
the manufacturing sector has undergone a rapid structural change. The 1960
Census found that about one half of total employment in manufacturing was
provided by the informal workshops of shoemakers, tailors, cabinet makers and
mechanics. With the exception of some repair shops, most of these workshops



- 4 -
have now been replaced by modern factories. The average industrial
establishment is much larger than 20 years ago with about 60 employees per
plant. Nevertheless, even the largest plants--with up to 850
employees--remain small by international standards.
1.07      In spite of the high labor intensity of the assembly operations
which were established during the 1970s, manufacturing employment creation
did not coincide with the growth of the sector. The annual surveys of
industrial establishments during 1970-1979 indicate that, after an initial
increase from 7,000 manufacturing workers in 1970, total manufacturing
employment stagnated at around 9,000 workers from 1973 onward, which is less
than 10% of the country's workforce. The current recession which has
affected manufacturing considerably is estimated to have reduced
manufacturing employment to less than 8,000 workers, the level of employment
reached in 1971. High labor productivity in Barbados has fostered the
development of the manufacturing sector. However, the sector's wage
increases in recent years have begun to diminish earlier productivity gains.
The Government is aware of this and has been restraining wage increases and
trying to promote industries that are in line with Barbados comparative
advantages. The industrial strategy study also suggests that Barbados should
shift to higher technology industries that are compatible with its skilled
labor force. A move in this direction has recently been taken as Barbados
was able to attract a large US airline company which will establish a data
processing operation for on-line reservation by satellite employing over 300
people.
1.08      Exports have been the main driving force in the industrialization
process of Barbados. Between 1970 and 1981 exports of manufactured goods
increased more than ten-fold to BDS$237 million. The strong export growth
was mainly due to garments and electronic components which have a 55% share
of total manufactured exports. However, other manufactures like processed
foods, chemicals and sports equipment also performed well on export markets.
Excluding oil refining, the share of exports in total industrial production
is about 40%. Due to the recessionary economic situation, manufactured
exports have stagnated in real terms for the first time since the 1960s.
While only a small number of export manufacturers have started operations in
Barbados in recent years, some established exporters seem to be considering a
move to locations outside of Barbados with more favorable cost structures.
The government has recognized the potential dangers of these developments.
The Bank financed industrial strategy study has identified subsectors and
industries where Barbados has comparative advantages, and which have export
potential.
C. Industrial Policy
1.09      Barbados' economic policy and industrial incentives are generally
well conceived and administered. This was reflected in the considerable
industrial growth achieved in the last two decades. The Industrial
Development Act of 1969 for export industries and the Fiscal Incentives Act



of 1974, which replaced earlier industrial development legislation2/, are
the main instruments of industrial policy. Duty-free imports of machinery
and production inputs and tax holidays on profits and dividend payments are
the most important incentives provided under the two laws. These concessions
are granted for 10 years to the enclave industries and for 6 to 10 years to
other enterprises. The Trade Incentives Committee grants duty-free import
concessions for an average period of 5 years. The Barbados Industrial
Development Corporation (BIDC) has been put in charge of reviewing
applications for incentives under the Fiscal Incentives Act and to make
recommendations on incentives to the Minister of Trade and Industry. The
criteria used by the BIDC to evaluate applications for incentives are export
potential, employment generation, domestic value added and existing
production capacity, which are applied in each case in a discretionary
evaluation procedure. These procedures are currently under review within the
context of the Bank supported industrial strategy study (para. 1.04) to reach
better defined evaluation and approval criteria and procedures, and to
examine the need for closer coordination with the Trade Incentives
Committee.
1.10       Caricom agreements are the basis for determining tariffs in
Barbados.  Import licensing and quantitative restrictions have been used as
additional tools in Barbados external commercial policy. The list of
products subject to license is extensive.  However, a relatively small number
of goods that require an import license are subject to quantitative
restrictions.  Some items on the import license list are imported freely
while others are subject to temporary restrictions (e.g. agricultural
products). There is also a restrictive list of textile items the importation
of which is prohibited if they are products below a certain CIF value; this
list is designed principally to protect local garment manufacturers. The
only significant use of restrictions for balance of payments purposes is a
quota on vehicle imports, though this quota also forms part of the
transportation policy that supports the public transport system.
1.11      Barbados Industrial Development Corporation (BIDC) provides factory
space for manufacturers as an incentive to establish in Barbados. BIDC used
to provide the factory shells at subsidized rental rates as an added
incentive. However, BIDC has adopted a new policy, under the Bank's first
industrial loan (para 3.06), by which it will move away from subsidizing
industries to charging market rates on the leases of their factory
buildings. Of course, the increase in rental rates is gradual since
increases on old leases must await their reneweal.  The new market rates will
encourage manufacturers to build their own plant facilities and rely less on
BlDC's factory buildings.  This would permit BIDC to concentrate on providing
infrastructure and on the maintenance of existing facilities. In addition,
*          BIDC is currently taking an active role in establishing several co-operative
enterprises such as a multiuser furniture manufacturing complex to provide
small entrepreneurs with the advantages of economies of scale.

- 6 -
1.12      In view of the current recession in the world economy and the
stagnation of Barbados manufactured exports, additional incentives for
manufactured exports may be required. Currently exports to markets outside
of CARICOM may obtain a 50% reduction of corporate taxes on export profits.
However, since most export enterprises already benefit from tax holidays
under the Fiscal Incentives Act, this "export allowance" has had little
impact. Other types of incentives to export industry are administered by the
Export Promotion Corporation (EPC), and they include an export incentive
scheme under the first Bank loan (1813-BAR) to encourage non-traditional
exports and those directed to non-Caricom region by reimbursing exporters
some of their costs associated with export promotion. However, EPC having
been established only in 1979, is at an incipient stage of its development
and has still to gain the confidence of exporters. The proposed project
would be an additional instrument in promoting exports by providing
manufacturers with needed financing for raw material and equipment imports.
In addition, the current data collection exercise undertaken by the
Government and the on-going study on Industrial Development Strategy (para
1.04) would help the Government and the Bank to continue the dialogue on
possible improvements in existing industrial policies, within the CARICOM
framework, that would result in stimulating exports to restore their past
growth trend.
1.13      Exchange rate stability in Barbados favored industrial investment
in the 1970s, and the Government attaches great importance to maintaining a
stable relationship between the Barbados dollar and the US dollar. Because
the Barbados dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and because of the
relatively high levels of domestic inflation, it is estimated that the
Barbados dollar appreciated by about 15% during 1981 and the first six months
of 1982. However, due to the recent decline of the US dollar vis-a-vis the
relevant European currencies, this slight appreciation should have decreased
proportionately. The Government recognizes the importance of maintaining the
country's international competitiveness; it has been restraining prices and
wage increases, particularly in manufacturing and tourism, in order to
maintain Barbados competitive position in these areas.
D. Tourism Industry
1.14      Tourism has been an important and dynamic sector in the economic
development of Barbados. It provides employment in services and construction
activities and is the country's single most important earner of foreign
exchange. Gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism were over BD$500
million in 1982 and direct employment provided by tourism is around 4000. In
line with the dramatic rise of demand in the 1970s the sector attracted
considerable investment from both foreign and local sources. The number of
beds to accomodate tourists has more than doubled since 1970, while the
number of tourist arrivals rose from 150,000 in 1970 to about 325,000 in
1982. Tourist arrivals peaked in 1979 at a level of 371,000 but, has since
sharply declined as a consequence of the world economic recession, and



increased travel cost. After a prolonged growth period, the tourism sector
in Barbados is thus currently in a recession.
1.15      In an effort to control the creation of additional capacity the
Government is not issuing building permits or granting fiscal incentives for
new capacity in built-up areas. New hotels may only be established on the
North-east coast which has so far little hotel capacity. On the other hand,
the Government supports upgrading and refurbishing of existing tourism
facilities with credit, tax and import duty concessions. A classification
system for tourism facilities is being introduced which is assisting in the
effort to improve the quality of existing establishments. The Ministry of
Tourism expects that about one half of all hotels will participate in
refurbishing their facilities, which would create a considerable requirement
for term financing. The proposed project would provide some of the financing
needs of the tourism sector.
E. Energy
1.16      Domestic Production of oil started in Barbados in 1973 and
increased steadily up to 1980 when it reached 320,000 barrels, or about 25%
of total petroleum consumption. In 1981, Barbados imported fuels for over
BDS$100 million, about 10% of total retained imports. The Government gives
high priority to energy matters; one of the Development Plan's objectives is
to raise the degree of self-sufficiency by promoting energy conservation and
the development of traditional as well as non-traditional sources of energy.
A technical assistance project supported by the Bank is expected to assist
the Government in implementing its energy conservation program through the
provision of expert services, training, studies, and institutional support.
The proposed project would complement the efforts of the technical assistance
project by providing term financing for the purchase and installation of
energy saving devices and processes.
F. Outlook and Demand for Credit
1.17      A recovery of manufacturing and tourism from their current
depressed state is not expected before 1984. The Central Bank of Barbados
projected in July 1982 that manufacturing output and tourist arrivals would
practically stagnate at their low levels during 1983. Thereafter a recovery
in line with the expected improvement of the world economy should take
place.
1.18      Due to the business slow down in manufacturing and tourism and the
short-term outlook for a continued recession the volume of fixed investment
would be small during 1983 and possibly part of 1984.  Thereafter, the volume
of fixed investment would rise, as manufacturing is expected to return to its
long-term growth path of 6-7% per year in real terms. The outlook for
capacity expansion in the tourism sector is uncertain, and it will depend on
the ability of Barbados to maintain its price competitiveness and on the
international economic recovery.



- 8 -
1.19      While there is likely to be relatively little demand for financing
of fixed investment in the near future, it is expected that there will be
considerable demand for working capital financing in manufacturing, and for
financing the refurbishing of tourism facilities. The estimates of
investments in Table 1.3 are based on the relationship between past increases
in permanent working capital requirements (principally inventory change) and
economic activity. The projected (nominal) increase in manufacturing value
added over the three-year period 1983-1986 of US$75 million would require a
permanent working capital increase (additional inventory) of US$35
million.3/ Investment in tourism would be largely for refurbishing and
upgrading. Since about one half of the hotels would participate in the
upgrading program (para 1.15), at BDS$5000 per hotel bed, the financial
requirements for this program would be US$18 million over the period
1983-86. An additional US$2 million may be required for technological
improvements, for example installation of solar water heating which has
proven to be efficient and where domestic manufacturing of equipment exists
in Barbados. Fixed investments in manufacturing are projected to resume
their past growth trend from 1984 onward at about 7% p.a. with price
increases of 8% p.a. Fixed investments in tourism projects during 1983-86
will depend largely on realization of the potential of currently undeveloped
areas on the island. Therefore, it is not possible to make a reasonable
projection of this investment category. Overall, the loan is expected to
finance less than 10% of the total investment requirements in manufacturing
and for the upgrading needs in tourism.

II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. The Macro Setting
2.01       For almost 300 years economic activity in Barbados has centered
around the production of sugar which required forms of trade, economic
organization and finance that have more in common with industrial economies
than with subsistence or agriculture based societies. As a result, the
country has had for many years a relatively well developed financial system.
Until the early 1970s the system was dominated by British and North American
commercial banks, which dealt almost exclusively in short term loans and
overdrafts.  Initially, most of the deposits were demand or savings
deposits.
2.02      While commercial banks have continued to play the leading role in
the financial sector in recent years, their growth has not kept pace with GDP
growth. The ratio of monetary liabilities to GDP declined from 78% in 1946
to 50% in 1980 (Annex 2-T.1). However the ratio of all financial assets to
GDP rose substantially as new financial institutions and expansion of
existing ones more than compensated for the banks' relative slowdown in
resource mobilization (Annex 2-T.1).  Government made the most substantial
contribution to the mobilization of resources with the creation of the
National Insurance Fund (NIF) and the expansion of Central Bank activities.
The other new state owned financial institutions, the Barbados Development
Bank (BDB), and the Barbados Mortgage Finance Corporation (BMFC) had less of
an impact in mobilizing resources. The rapid expansion of private sector
trust companies also contributed to the growth and diversification of the
financial system.
2.03      The financial system showed a considerable degree of deepening as
the financial intermediation ratio (FIR)1/ increased from 75% in 1965 to
102% in 1970 and to 111% in 1980 (Annex 2-T.1). These rates are high for a
developing country and compare favorably with countries with advanced
financial systems (Table 2.1). Among the factors that contributed to the
rapid development of the financial system are: (i) rising income; (ii) the
stable socio-economic framework; (iii) minimum banking regulations; (iv) the
emergence in the last two decades, of the two important activities of tourism
and manufacturing; and (v) the increasing importance of Barbados in regional
financing.

B. Resource Mobilization and Allocation
2.04      Up to 1970 the banking system in Barbados mobilized over 80% of all
financial resources in the country. After 1970, the other financial
intermediaries began to grow and by 1980 the share of financial liabilities
held by the banking system had declined to 53% (Annex 2 T-5) and the National
Insurance Fund, a compulsory social security fund, accounted for about 11%.
The share of deposits in total financial liabilities has declined steadily
from about 62% in 1970 to 45% in 1980, as a result of the creation of new
financial institutions such as trust companies and Barbados Development Bank.
2.05      Table 2.2 provides data on the composition of deposits of the
commercial banks during the 1978-1982 period. It is notable that the share
of savings deposits increased consistently and reached 49% in June 1982.
This was due to the small interest rate differential between time and savings
deposits: in 1981, the savings deposit rate was 8% while time deposit rates
ranged from 8.5-10%.   However, time deposit rates rose to 13% and 14% during
1982 as a result of the bargaining power of the National Insurance Board
which was able to get high rates on its deposits because the commercial banks
were suffering from very tight liquidity. The share of demand deposits also
declined in June 1982 to 19.3% from 23.6% in a year earlier, due mainly to a
decline in deposits because of severe liquidity problems in the business
sector.

2.06       Foreign commercial banks have borrowed from their headquarters to
supplement domestic financial resources when the need arose, especially in
the periods from 1960 to 1962 and 1973 to 1978, to cover domestic loan
demand. Otherwise foreign commercial banks have maintained small working
balances to service foreign transactions. However, during 1981 and 1982,
although suffering from very tight liquidity, commercial banks did not
bring in any significant amount of foreign exchange.
2.07       Sectoral use of credit mainly followed the relative importance of
*         productive activities.  Agriculture and distribution dominated in the
fifties, but as manufacturing and tourism grew, they attracted credit as did,
to a smaller extent, other emerging sectors such as construction, personal
services and public utilities (Annex 2-T.2) . The maturity structure of
lending did not change much, however, and mechanisms for financing new
ventures remained weak. Overall, credit grew more quickly than national
income in the buoyant 1960s but less so in the 1970s. Construction credit
was the most volatile, a characteristic of the sector.   Exporters of
manufactured goods and small businesses were relatively neglected by the
banks. The Barbados Development Bank (BDB) is the only institution
dealing exclusively with term lending, but it accounts for only six percent
of total financial assets. The Central Bank made efforts to fill some of
these gaps through discount and guarantee schemes for exporters and small
businesses. Some of these schemes such as the exports financing schemes,
were quite successful, but the small business scheme was not widely used,
probably due to the low spread offered to banks relative to the risk and
additional work. Also the Central Bank restricted personal loans by
imposing credit ceilings on this type of lending which also reduced the flow
of credit to small business. The proposed loan would support the Government
and Central Bank's efforts to provide credit, especially long term, to the
manufacturing and tourism sectors.
C. Interest Rate Policy
2.08       Interest rates in Barbados largely follow rates in international
capital markets. The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) sets minimum deposit2/
and loan rates as well as a ceiling on the commercial banks average lending
rate. Within these overall limits, commercial banks set their own borrowing
and lending rates. The Commercial banks influence the rates at which
Government borrows through their treasury bill tenders. CBB sets rates for
discounts to commercial banks. CBB intervention has had, on occasion, a
restraining or lagging effect, but overall it has not altered the underlying
tendency of local rates to follow the trend of international interest rates
despite the institution of exchange controls in 1974. When interest rates
started to rise rapidly in the US and European markets in 1980, Barbados was
reluctant to let domestic interest rates follow.  However, the growing
differential between US and domestic rates started to cause some capital
outflow and it became increasingly difficult to maintain local rates
unchanged.
2/   Central Bank used to set maximum deposit rates.



- 12 -
2.09       Late in 1981 credit policies were tightened significantly and
interest rates were allowed to rise by 4 to 5 points in the face of the
sustained increase in interest rates abroad. CBB raised its general discount
rates from 10% to 18% in September 1981 and a few weeks later to 22%. It
also raised the reserve requirement from 20% to 27% to shift some of the
burden of financing the widening Government deficit from the Central Bank to
the commercial banks, thus limiting the creation of new money and reducing
inflationary pressures in the economy. Banks were also instructed to reduce
outstanding consumer credit by 10% by March 1982. Treasury bill rates were
allowed to rise and surged from less than 8% in mid 1981 to over 16% in
January 1982 before settling back to about 11% in October 1982. In line with
the fall of interest rates in international markets which started in the
summer of 1982 the Central Bank reduced all interest rates (Annex 2-T.3) in
the fall of 1982. By November 1982 the ceiling on average interest rates for
commercial banks was 13% and the minimum lending rate, 10%. Interest rates
in Barbados are adequate at present as they are broadly in line with rates
prevailing abroad, and lending rates are positive in relation to the current
and projected rates of inflation. (Para 2.10).
2.10       Rapid GDP growth accompanied by large public expenditures caused
inflationary pressures in Barbados, particularly since 1980, when labor costs
began to accelerate. Consumer prices rose by 14-15 percent a year in 1980
and 1981, with wages rising by similar percentages. In the 12 months period
ending October 1982 consumer prices rose by 10.1%. The inflation rate in
Barbados is declining and is estimated to have been limited to about 10% in
1982. Inflation is expected to continue falling in the coming year or two
and seems likely to drop below 10% in 1983.
D. Structure of the Financial System
2.11       In addition to the Central Bank, financial institutions include
six foreign owned private commercial banks, the Goverrnment owned Barbados
National Bank (BNB), and the Barbados Development Bank (BDB). The financial
system also includes some non-bank institutions, such as trust and insurance
companies.
2.12       Central Bank of Barbados (CBB).  The Central Bank of Barbados was
set up in 1972 to provide the Government with a vehicle to establish
independent monetary policies. There was no official management of the
financial sector prior to the establishment of CBB. Since its inception CBB
has played an active role in further developing the financial system. It has
created a unit which provides export credit and insurance to eligible
exporters of manufactured goods and opened several discount windows for
agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and small business, and has set up a
small business guarantee scheme (Para. 2.07). The monitoring of commercial
banks has been strengthened. In terms of monetary policies, CBB has resorted
to more control of interest rates by setting minimum deposit rates and
ceilings on average lending rates. CBB has played a major role in the
economic growth of Barbados by expanding credit to the Government. When the
Government started to issue treasury bills CBB promoted the wide acceptance
of Government debt by buying and selling Government securities to enhance
their marketability.  Also, CBB has made use of the reserve requirement to
assist in financing the Government deficit and has made direct advances to



- 13 -
the Government.  The discount rate was not used as an active monetary
instrument until September 1981, when the gap in local and international
rates widened dramatically. In addition, CBB's policies served largely to
reinforce credit allocation (para 2.07).
Commercial Banking System
2.13       The commercial banking system in Barbados, as in most developing
countries, is the dominant force in the financial system. At present, there
are seven commercial banks operating in Barbados. Six of the seven are
branches of U.S., Canadian and U.K. banks, and one is a local publicly owned
bank, BNB. In June 1982, the seven banks had total assets amounting to
BDS$1,043 million.  The six foreign banks controlled 81% of commercial banks
assets and deposits, and 82% of loans (Table 2.3).

Barbados Development Bank (BDB)
2.14       BDB was established by the Government in 1969 to provide long-term
loans in the principal growth sectors of the economy, e.g. manufacturing and
tourism. BDB's liabilities at the end of 1970, its second year of
operations, were BDS$1.5 million and they had grown to BD$70.4 million by
March 1982. BDB's portfolio reflects the emphasis placed on the development
of the tourism and manufacturing sectors although the bank granted some
agricultural loans up to 1978 when this function was taken over by the
agricultural division of BNB. BDB was financed by Government capital grants
up to 1971; however, since then borrowings from multilateral institutions
have become a more important source, which has been supplemented by the issue
of National Development Bonds. BDB remains a relatively small development
bank (Annex 2-T.4), mainly serving the smaller industrial and tourism
enterprises and covering a limited share of the total financing requirements
of the sectors. BDB's assets in March 1982 were 6% of total
financial assets and its portfolio was about 7% of the banking system's
portfolio. However, BDB has been instrumental in providing term financing
for the small and medium enterprises which would otherwise have had limited
or no access to commercial banks credit.
E. Financing of Industry and Tourism
2.15       Commercial bank loans to the manufacturing sector were rather
limited up to 1978. This could be partly explained by the tendency of a



- 14 -
large number of firms established before that date to secure their fixed
assets financing from abroad. In 1978, commercial banks' loans to the
manufacturing sector amounted to BDS$38.8 million, or 9.8% of their total
loan portfolio of BDS$395.5 million. However, lending to industry by
commercial banks increased substantially to BDS$103.6 million in 1981
representing 16% of the portfolio (Table 2.2). Loans to the manufacturing
sector have exceeded those to the tourism sector since 1979 due to the rapid
growth of industry during this period. However, commercial bank lending to
manufacturing increased by only a nominal 6% from September 1981 to September
1982, reflecting a decline in real terms of about 5%. This was due to the
tight liquidity situation of the commercial banks and the slowing down of
manufacturing activity as a result of the worldwide recession.

Source: CBB.
2.16      BDB's share of total lending to the manufacturing sector increased
from around 6% in 1980 to about 13% in 1982, reflecting the extremely tight
liquidity situation of commercial banks. Because of its contrasting ample
liquidity, BDB was able to increase its lending to the sector by 50% in real
terms during the year ending September 1982. Tourism as a share of BDB's
total portfolio dropped from 71% in 1978 to 52% by September 1982, because of
the recession in this sector. Nonethless, BDB's share of total lending to
both sectors amounted to a modest 8% as of September 1982.
2.17      During the period 1978-81 total lending to the manufacturing and
tourism sectors increased as a percentage of commercial bank loan
portfolios (Table 2.4).   The bulk of this lending was for working capital
which can be rolled over on an annual basis. At the same time commercial
banks increased their share of total term lending to the manufacturing sector
from 68% to 78% (Table 2.5). Nevertheless, the share of term lending to
these sectors as a percent of commercial bank assets was still a very modest
4% for manufacturing and, 5% for tourism in 1981. This is still in excess of
their term liabilities (deposits of one-year and longer) which represented
only 3.5% of their total liabilities in 1981. In addition, total term credit
granted to manufacturing historically has covered an average 19% of total



- 15 -
long term capital requirements of the sector. The proposed loan would
provide additional long-term resources to the banking community for lending
to these sectors, which in turn should promote the growth of the productive
sectors and strengthen the financial structure of local firms.

III. THE PROJECT
A. The Previous Loan
3.01      The Industrial Development and Export Promotion Project (Loan
1813-BAR) was the first Bank operation in support of the industrial sector in
Barbados. The US$10 million loan was approved by the Board in March 20, 1980
and became effective August 28, 1980. The project included four components:
(a) for financing the construction of factory shells for potential investors,
channelled through the Industrial Development Corporation (BIDC) (US$6
million); (b) an industrial credit component providing subloans through the
Barbados Development Bank (BDB) and technical assistance to BDB (US$3.2
million); (c) an export promotion component mainly supporting an incentive
program to stimulate non-traditional exports and those directed to
non-Caricom countries through the newly established Export Promotion
Corporation (EPC) (US$300,000); and (d) management and vocational training
through the National Training Board (NTB) and Barbados Institute for
Management and Productivity (BIMAP) (US$500,000).
3.02      Total commitments under Loan 1813-BAR are US$5.7 million.  By
mid-January 1983 BDB fully committed its industrial lending component (US$3
million) while BIDC has committed 40% of its factory shell component which is
only expected to be completed with at least one year delay. Since BDB has
totally committed its component there may be some reallocation of loan
resources from BIDC to BDB. EPC has totally committed its component but has
been slow in disbursing due to lack of effective promotion and administrative
delays. BIMAP's reduced budget for local counterpart funds has caused a
temporary change in priorities which resulted in slow commitment of its
share. NTB has recently reformulated its program under the project since it
has obtained more concessional funds.
3.03      BDB's credit component has been used to finance 23 subprojects
(Annex 2, T-6), two thirds of which are broadly defined as manufacturing,
with the remainder in the service category. Sixteen subprojects were
classified as small scale, (less than US$200,000) and the other 7 subprojects
ranged in size from US$1.3 million to US$2 million. The cost per job created
for small scale projects is about US$7,000 and for larger projects,
US$20,000. As shown in Annex 2, T-6 the vast majority of machinery,
equipment and raw materials required for the subprojects was imported and the
equivalent of 10% was purchased locally.
3.04      For the fiscal year ending March 1982 BDB had total assets of
BDS$55.5 million (excluding BDS$15 million channeled on behalf of the
Government for mortgage lending). This represents an increase of 48% over
the previous year's total of BDS$37.38 million and was mainly due to a 55%
increase in the lending portfolio. Total equity increased, due to Central
Bank contributions, from BDS$9.7 million to BDS$15.8 million and the debt
equity ratio decreased from 2.8:1 to 2.5:1. Due to the large increase in



- 17 -
disbursements and an increase in interest rates, BDB's net income for FY81/82
rose to BDS$462,000 or more than 7 times the previous year's level. The rate
of return on average equity reached 3.6% compared to the 0.6% of the previous
year. In the last two quarters of the fiscal year BDB increased its lending
rates from 12% to 13% for small manufacturing, 14% for small business,
toiurism and ancillary projects, and 15% for larger tourism and industrial
projects. These rates are broadly in line with commercial bank lending
rates. BDB has a relatively high and persistent arrears level. As of March
1982 overdue amountsrepresented 6.8% of the portfolio, 0.4% below the
previous year's level. The portfolio affected by arrears is also high at 43%
as compared to 44% a year before. Arrears are highest in the small
manufacturing subsector (7.4%), followed by small business (3.7%), industry
(2%) and tourism (1.7%). Given the difficult economic situation and the
business slow down, BDB's arrears could have been expected to increase over
their previous level. However due to the action program BDB is following at
present under the first Bank loan (1813-BAR), the arrears' level has been
stabilized.
3.05      The factory shell construction component of the first operation has
moved slower than was forecast at appraisal. This is due primarily to
restrictions on BIDC's budget that coincided with a decline in demand from
foreign investors who are being adversely affected by the world recession.
As a result, the government and BIDC are expected to scale back the project's
construction program for FY83-84, so that the commitment period would need to
be extended for a year, or possibly more if the recession continues.
3.06      BIDC has increased its rents on leases when they have been renewed
and for new buildings as agreed with the Bank, but its financial position has
not improved to the extent forecast at appraisal.  This is due mostly to the
fact that rental increases were less than anticipated and the amount of new
space rented was also less. BIDC has engaged, with Bank financing, a
management consulting firm to make recommendations on ways to improve
internal accounting and management information systems, and its organization
structure. The changes made have been designed to help BIDC achieve the
objective of financial self sufficiency and to manage its industrial estates
more efficiently. BIDG is also sponsoring a national industrial development
strategy study with the help of consultants financed under the first Bank
loan (Para. 1.04). The Bank has reviewed the terms of reference for the
study and is following its progress closely, and will discuss the findings
and recommendations with the consultants, BIDC, and the Government.
3.07      The proposed project is intended to provide continuity to the
existing loan's (1813-BAR) industrial lending component which was fully
committed in January of 1983. However, to ensure broader coverage of credit
6           demand of various types and scales of enterprises in the industrial and
tourism sectors, the proposed project will use as a channel for lending, in
addition to the BDB, all banks in Barbados that are willing to participate in
the two tier lending scheme to be established by the CBB (para. 3.10).

B. Project Objectives
3.08       The proposed project is intended to support the development of the
industrial and tourism sectors by making available through eligible financial
intermediaries term resources, with the ultimate objectives of (i)
accelerating the level of industrial investment to expand industrial output
and exports; (ii) generating employment to help absorb part of the rapidly
expanding labor force and reduce the high unemployment rate; (iii)
establishing a new mechanism to expand term credit supply by using all the
banking institutions in line with Central Bank's objective of increasing
commercial bank development-type lending; and (iv) contributing to the
Government's energy conservation program by financing energy saving devices
and processes. In addition to financing the establishment and expansion of
business ventures, the project is also intended to maintain the viability of
existing enterprises by providing them with currently scarce resources for
the financing of working capital to increase the presently low utilization of
installed capacity.
C. Description of the Proposed Lending System
3.09      To accomplish project objectives a two-tier credit system would be
established comprising CBB as the apex insitution and a network of
participating financial intermediaries, qualified by CBB. A special fund,
the Industrial Credit Fund (ICF), with separate financial resources,
accounts and staff would be established permanently within CBB to provide
term financing for industrial and tourism operations. ICF would also
provide,through financial intermediaries, short and medium term financing for
industrial and tourism enterprises in periods of tight liquidity and high
demand for working capital. Up to 50% of ICF initial resources could be
directed to finance working capital not associated with fixed
asset investments.
3.10      Financial intermediaries (FIs) will consist of all public and
private banks legally established in Barbados and accredited by CBB to
participate in the ICF scheme. The FIs will be responsible for making and
administering all subloans to beneficiaries for their respective operations
and will bear the credit risk. Eligible FIs would sign a participation
agreement with CBB; the signing of one participation agreement would be a
condition of effectiveness.  ICF, mainly through the CBB Supervision
Department, will follow-up on the intermediaries' operations, check, on an
ad-hoc basis, the performance of firms financed under the scheme, and ensure
the proper utilization of ICF resources for the purposes of the project
pursuant to its statement of policies.
3.11      Operating Criteria.  ICF will be established within CBB as a
separate unit to exist for an indefinite period of time. ICF will report
directly to CBB's General Manager and be subject to the control of CBB's
Board of Directors. It will have non-transferable permanent resources and
separate staff consisting initially of two professionals and a secretary



- 19 -
(para. 4.06). In addition to being subject to the control of CBB's internal
comptroller, ICF's accounts will also be audited by an independent external
auditor. During negotiations agreement has been reached with CBB on the
establishment of ICF and hiring of a manager for the unit acceptable to the
Bank. These would be conditions of loan effectiveness.
3.12       ICF's lending activities will be conducted pursuant to its
statement of policies which, in agreement with the Bank, will be approved by
CBB's Board.  ICF will also have operating procedures to be followed by its
staff in conducting the discount operations and in supervising existing
subloans. Any amendment in the ICF Statement of Policies would have to be
acceptable to the Bank. The final drafts of the ICF statement of policies
and operating procedures have been discussed during negotiations and are
satisfactory to the Bank. The adoption of ICF's statement of policies by
CBB's Board would be a condition of effectiveness.
3.13      ICF will finance through FIs all productive activities in the
industrial and tourism sectors and related services. Financing will be
provided for new ventures, expansion, renovation and restructuring of
existing firms, working capital for increasing capacity utilization and
energy conservation devices. Only viable enterprises and sound projects will
be eligible for ICF financing which will cover construction, the purchase of
equipment and machinery, cargo vehicles, civil works and industrial
buildings, raw material, preinvestment studies and technical assistance
services. ICF will discount up to 90% of intermediaries' subloans but with a
maximum of 70% of each new subproject's cost, and 80% of expansion
subprojects cost.
3.14      To make ICF resources available to as large a number of firms as
possible ICF financing for each beneficiary will initially be limited to
US$1.50 million. This limit is also intended to enable BDB to be in a
reasonably competitive position as a participant in the scheme, since its
maximum loan amount is currently BDS$2.2 million (US$1.1 million).
Intermediaries will have a free limit with ICF of US$150,000 equivalent.
Below this limit Fl's would submit a simpler and less detailed evaluation of
subprojects focusing on the viability of the enterprise and its investment
plan, and the viability of the project. ICF will only check that the
necessary information for justifying the project has been provided, that the
subproject is eligible for financing and that the proposed subloan terms are
appropriate. Larger subprojects (above US$150,000 equivalent) will be
subject to a more detailed review of the technical, financial, marketing and
economic aspects (para 4.03). Commercial banks in Barbados have the capacity
to evaluate projects for term lending. They normally include in their
project evaluations cash flow projections, profit and loss statements, and
some financial ratios for the borrower.  They also make an assessment of the
market, technical and management aspects of the project. However, the
manager of ICF or the consultant that may be hired (para. 4.06) would
undertake the training of commercial banks' loan officers in project
evaluation should the need arise for this type of assistance.

D.  Project's Cost and Financing Plan
3.15      Total project cost is estimated at US$16.5 million or BDS$33.0
million. This estimate includes US$16 million for project financing and
about US$0.5 million for technical assistance which would be 100% financed
from the Bank loan. Table 3-1 below shows that out of the total $16 million
for project financing US$10 million would be provided from the Bank loan to
the GOB which is to be passed on to the Fund, US$2 million equivalent
represent CBB's counterpart funds and an estimated US$4 million are expected
to be contributed by project beneficiaries and the financial intermediaries
from their own resources.  In addition, the table includes the capitalized
front-end-fee of US$26,000.

IV. THE BANK LOAN
A. Borrower and Terms
4.01      The Government of Barbados would be the borrower of the proposed
Bank loan of US$10.5 million (including the front-end-fee of about
US$26,000). The Ministry of Finance and Planning would act as the
Government's agent.  The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk
and variations of the Bank's interest rates, and would pass-on the proceeds
of the loan to CBB as an equity contribution for the establishment of ICF and
its discounting operations. Signing of the relevant agreement would be a
condition of effectiveness. The loan would be on standard terms for the
country of 15 years including 3 years of grace. The commitment fee would be
the standard 0.75%. Because of the expected large number of subloans, and
the estimated short average maturity of subloans (5 years), ICF, to be
established as a permanent fund, will allow subloan repayments to be recycled
into new lending for the same purpose and the Bank loan would have a fixed
amortization schedule. ICF would onlend its resources (comprising the
capitalized Bank loan passed on to it from the Government and the CBB
counterpart fund of US$2 million equivalent) in Barbados dollars for maximum
maturities of 15 years including up to 3 years of grace. FIs would pass-on
subloans repayments to ICF as they are received from final borrowers. The
terminal date for submission of requests for subproject financing would be
June 30, 1987 and the closing date would be December 31, 1987.
B. Loan Components
4.02      The proposed loan would include an amount of US$10 million for
industrial lending through ICF, an amount of US$0.25 million for consulting
services to ICF, and an unallocated amount of US$0.22 million that could be
used (i) for other consulting or technical services to BNB, (ii) to assist
BDB to improve its operations, (iii) to ICF if additional specific assistance
is required, or (iv) to the sector in the form of studies or particular
programs, that might be needed in the course of implementing the project.
Any unused portions of the technical assistance or unallocated loan
components could be reallocated for additional ICF subloans.
C. Free Limits and ERR
4.03       ICF maximum discount size would be US$1.5 million (para 3.16).  ICF
would have a subproject free limit with the Bank of US$250,000 and discounts
exceeding this amount would require previous Bank authorization. For
subloans above the Bank's free limit, ICF would calculate the economic rate
of return (ERR) of the subproject. Based on the experience of the commercial
banks in term lending, the average subloan size is expected to be US$150,000
and the Bank would review about 20% to 25% of all subloans representing an
estimated 33% of the loan amount.  FIs will have a free limit with ICF of
US$150,000, above which ICF would review the intermediary's project
evaluation (Para. 3.14).



- 22 -
D. Interest Rates
4.04      The ICF discount rate under the project would be fixed at 2 points
below the commercial banks' weighted average prime rate (currently between
12% and 13%). That rate, which would apply to both outstanding and new
discounts, is adjusted frequently to reflect money market conditions and
therefore is considered a sound basis for pegging interest rates on project
subloans. It would also ensure that ICF resources would continue to be
attractive to financial intermediaries and provide them with an adequate
spread on their operations. Accordingly, CBB will calculate quarterly, from
the statistics collected on commercial banks' prime rates, the weighted
average prime rate, and would adjust the ICF discount rate accordingly.
This would be consistent with the variable interest rate practice prevailing
in Barbados. Intermediaries will fix their lending rates with no restriction
or ceiling from CBB and therefore would establish their own spreads depending
on each subproject and each client. Competition amongst intermediaries,
including the two public banks BDB and BNB, would ensure that the rates are
in line with market conditions. Intermediaries would also be exempt from
reserve requirements on these operations. The average spread for commercial
banks is expected to be around 3.5 points under current conditions. Interest
rates in Barbados would be reviewed at least once a year with CBB to ensure
that they continue to reflect domestic and international credit market
conditions and inflation levels. If the rates are considered inappropriate
and agreement can not be reached within 60 days, the Bank would have the
right to stop approving further subloan commitments under the project.
E. Procurement, Commitment and Disbursement
4.05      Financial intermediaries and ICF would satisfy themselves that
procurement items were suitable for the respective investment projects and
reasonably priced, and that beneficiaries had canvassed the main sources of
supply and were purchasing from the most advantageous source. Whenever
justified, mostly for larger procurement contracts, items would be procured
on the basis of several quotations, in accordance with standard practice for
IDF-type projects. The loan funds would finance the estimated foreign
exchange cost of subprojects by reimbursing the CBB for 90% of ICF discounts
with a maximum of 70% of each new subproject cost and 80% of expansion
subproject cost.  This will result in the Bank financing not more than the
estimated foreign exchange component of 67%.  Disbursement will be made
against statement of expenditure submitted by CBB for subloans below the
Bank's free limit and full documentation for loans above the Bank's free
limit (US$250,000 equivalent).  Expenditures made less than 180 days prior to
Bank receipt of the corresponding request for authorization, but in no case
for expenditures made prior to loan signing, would be eligible for
disbursement. Consulting services under technical assistance will be open to
international recruitment according to Bank guidelines. Terms of reference
and consultants to be hired would have to be acceptable to the Bank.   The
Bank loan is expected to have about four years committment and   about four
and a half years disbursement periods (para. 4.01).



- 23 -
F. Technical Assistance
4.06       CBB would hire a qualified professional acceptable to the Bank as
the manager of ICF. However, if a candidate could not be identified under
these conditions the Bank would finance from the proposed loan a consultant
for about two years. As a condition for this arrangement a permanent staff
member would be hired by CBB within the first year of operations and would be
trained by the consultant to take over the management of ICF as the
consultant phases himself out.  Terms of reference and CV of the ICF manager
and the consultant would be acceptable to the Bank. An amount of US$0.25
million will be allocated for consulting services to build-up ICF
capabilities. In addition, the loan includes an amount of US$224,000 that
would remain unallocated and could be used for other technical assistance to
the sector, to ICF, BDB or BNB to improve their operations (Para 4.02).
G. Project Benefits and Risks
4.07      The proposed project would maintain and expand industrial output
and exports by providing financing for about 100 subprojects. The project
would create about 1,000 new jobs (the cost per job created is expected to be
about US$15,000). The project would expand the channels through which term
financing can be provided to the productive sectors by using all existing
banks as intermediaries. This new mechanism would also help improve the
capability of participating banks to evaluate projects and do more term
financing.  In addition, the project is intended to build-up this capability
at CBB. The creation of a permanent Fund at CBB would ensure the
availability of term resources at all times for the industrial and tourism
sectors which will prevent crowding-out of these sectors at times of tight
liquidity.
4.08      The proposed project does not involve any unusual risks.  However,
because the proposed institutional arrangement is new and untried, some
initial delays in subloan processing by both the financial intermediaries and
ICF may occur. To minimize delays in project implementation Bank supervision
for assistance in project start-up would be more intensive during the first
year. Delays could also arise when commercial banks become more liquid.
They might then prefer to mainly lend short term from their own resources.
This risk should be mitigated by the attractive spread offered to banks
under this scheme with no maximum on the interest they can charge. In
addition, promotion with entrepreneurs and intermediaries and the simplicity
and absence of unnecessary delays in processing discounts should further
reduce that risk. Finally, the depressed economic situation and the possible
delays in business recovery could affect the level of demand for term
resources.  However, the built-in flexibility in the design of the project
that permits financing fixed assets or working capital needs depending on the
state of the economy would ensure that project resources will be used to
fulfill the specific financing needs as they arise (para 3.09).

BARBADOS
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
Industrial Credit Fund
Statement of Policies
A.   Objectives
The objective of the Industrial Credit Fund (ICF), established in the
Central Bank of Barbados, is to contribute, within the policies of the
Government of Barbados, to the industrial development of the country.
The ICF will provide, through qualified financial intermediaries, credit
to productive private enterprises to stimulate the economic development
of Barbados, create new employment and generate foreign exchange.
B.   Eligible Activities
The ICF will discount, through financial intermediaries, sound and
economically viable projects engaged in one of the following activities:
1.   agro-industry
2.   manufacturing
3.   fisheries
4.   tourism
5.   mining and quarrying, and
6.   enterprises providing services directly related to the above.
C.   Financial Policy
1.   The ICF will be established as a permanent fund.  To attain its
objectives it will operate in such a way as to maintain and, if
possible, increase its capital (or permanent resources). ICF will
invest its resources to obtain the maximum financial results consistent
with sound financial practices, and will maintain its financial
resources in separate and independent accounts.
2.   The ICF will operate with the following resources:



- 33 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 3
a.   its capital consisting of:
-    Government's contributions,
-    Central Bank's contributions,
-    profits derived from its operations,
-    such reserves as it establishes,
-    funds obtained as grants and transfers from other
sources;
b.   the proceeds of loans borrowed in Barbados or abroad.
3.   The ICF resources may be used to (a) fixed assets and technical
assistance required for new private sector enterprises, or the expansion
of existing ones including feasibility studies; (b) working capital for
existing or new enterprises; (c) cover its administrative costs; (d)
service and repay loans received.
4.   The ICF resources used to provide working capital not related to
fixed asset investments should not exceed 50% of its total resources.
5.   The ICF will maintain independent accounts and financial
statements, that will be audited at the end of each fiscal year by
independent external auditors.
6.   All subloans shall be expressed in BDS$.
D.   ICF shall encourage the participation of financial intermediaries,
and avoid a concentration of financing in any single one of them. To
this end the ICF shall, from time to time, set upper limits on the
participation by each particular institution.
E.   In order to be accepted as a participant, a financial intermediary
should meet the eligibility criteria of ICF and must be equipped to
appraise and supervise long-term loans and sign a participation
agreement with the ICF.
F.   The ICF shall finance a portion of intermediaries subloans as determined
in the operating procedures.
G.   The ICF's discount rate would be two points below the weighted average
commercial banks prime rate, this rate will be calculated quarterly and
adjustment may be introduced as necessary.  Financial intermediaries
lending rates to beneficiaries shall not be subject to any interest rate
ceilings or regulations.  The ICF discounts shall be exempt from the
reserve requirement.
H.   Maturity periods on subloans granted by the ICF shall be according to
the requirements of each subproject. Maximum maturity shall be 15 years
including grace period of up to 3 years. The maturity and grace period
will depend on the capacity to repay and other characteristics of the
particular project.
