REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO STOPANSKA BANKA, SKOPJE
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Stopanska Banka, Skopje, with the guarantee of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent of US$31 million to help
finance an agricultural industries project. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to agro-industrial combinats
and cooperatives (a) for their own investment for a maximum of 16 years,
(including a maximnm of five years of grace) with interest at 8-1/4 percent
per annum and (b) for on-lending to private farmers, who would also pay interest
of 8-1/4 percent, for 14 years (including three years of grace).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Yugoslavia in October/November 1972,
and a basic report on the economy of Yugoslavia is under preparation. A
report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Yugoslavia"
(R72-141) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 7, 1972.
Basic data on the economy of Yugoslavia are given in Annex I.
3.        Yugoslavia has had rapid growth and rising living standards during
the last decade, with total GDP at constant prices having increased at about
5-1/2 percent per year and per capita GDP at over 4 percent per year. Econ-
omic growth has proceeded in an environment of major institutional and organi-
zational changes, characterized by the decentralizing of economic management,
the creation of a market economy, and the opening up of the economy to inter-
national trade, with the objective of increasing economic efficiency and
improving the allocation of resources.
4.        The population growth rate has averaged 1.0 percent per year in
the last ten years, that in the less-developed Republics being 1.6 percent
and in the developed Republics 0.7 percent. There is little open unemploy-
ment. There is, however, some evidence of growing regional and occupational
imbalances in labor demand and supply. This results from the low mobility
between labor surplus less-developed regions and labor-scarce developed
regions, and a discrepancy between the skills needed in a fast-changing
economy and those supplied by the present education system.
5.        Economic growth in the less-developed Republics and Provinces has
been at about the same rate as that of the more developed, but their per
capita income has increased more slowly because of faster population growth.
Consequently, regional inequalities have widened. Yugoslavia has had an active



-2-
regional development policy for more than two decades. The policy aims
at reducing region alinequality by achieving a growth rate above the
national average in the less-developed Republics and Provinces, financed
by a transfer of resources mainly through the Fund for the Accelerated
Development of Underdeveloped Regions. In addition, Federal budgetary
grants are provided to the less-developed regions for current expendi-
ture for social purposes such as health and education.
Recent Developments
6.        Economic development since 1968 has been characterized by a
relatively rapid increase in exports and production (averaging 12 and 7
percent per year, respectively, during 1969-1972), the emergence of serious
infl2tionary pressures and substantial balance of payrents deficits
(averaging $220 million during 1968-71).
7.        To counter the rising inflationary pressures and improve the
external payments position, the Government since 1970 has adopted measures
aimed at restricting monetary expansion, limiting pub-Lic expenditures,
strengthening price controls and developing an incomes policy. In addition,
it has adopted a policy of frequent exchange rate adjustment in order to neu-
tralize the effect of inflationary pressure on the balance of payments.   After a
long period of unchanged rates, following a major devaluation in 1965, the dinar
was devalued by 16.6 percent in January l71. In the course of the inter-
national currency realignment -in December 1971, Yugoslavia devalued again
by 18.8 percent against gold and by 11.8 percent against the dollar. Fol-
lowing the more recent devaluation of the dollar, Yugoslavia adjusted the
gold parity of the dinar to maintain its parity with the dollar.
8.        Largely as a result of the policy measures undertaken, export
growth picked up, import growth declined, and the investment boom slowed
dona. In 1972, exports of goodls increased by 20 percent and imports by
about 5 percent and the trade dleficit was $1.1 billion dollars as coir-pared
to $1.4 billion in 1971. Workers' remittances increased by 25 percent to
$780 million in 1972.  Consequently, the current accoiunt showed a surllus
of about $190 million as compared to a deficit of about $320 million in 1971.
Foreign exchange reserves, which were equivalent to about one months' imports
in 1970 and 1971, have increased, and at the end of 1972 were equivalent to
nearly three months' imports. There has been some slowdown in the rate of
price inflation.  The cost of Living index incre.ased by about 11 percent during
tlhe year, as compared to 17 pe:rcent during 1971.
Prospects
9.        Real GDP is expected to grow by about 6 percent in 1973 (about the
same rate as in 1971) reflecting Government policies to control the expansion
of investment and consumption. The reduction of excess aggregate demand
together with the recent devaluations and continued economic growth in its
main trading partners is expected to lead to export growth of about 12 per-
cent. Reduction of tariffs in mid-1972 and a major import liberalization



program effective since January 1973 are likely to encourage import
growth of about 12 percent in 1973. Even with this anticipated increase
in import growth the balance of payments is expected to show a surplus.
Inflationary pressures are to be reduced by a continuation of price con-
trols and restrictive demand management.
10.       The 1971-1975 Social Plan, adopted in June 1972, aims at an
overall growth rate of 7.5 percent per year with gross investments growing
at the same rate as production, and private consumption and government
expenditure somewhat slower--7 percent and 6.5 percent per year, respectively.
Exports are projected to grow at about 11-13 percent per year and imports at
about 9-11 percent. Agricultural production is expected to grow at an
average rate of 3.2 percent per year as compared with 2.2 percent annually
during 1965-70. The acceleration of the growth is expected to come mainly
from an increase in the growth of output in the private sector farms from
about 1 percent per year in 1965-70 to about 2.8 percent per year during
1971-75. The Plan stresses the importance of achieving domestic stabiliza-
tion, improving resource allocation and increasing productive efficiency in
attaining these targets. It also stresses that an increase in the production
of electric power and the expansion of the transmission system are preconditions
for attaining the plan targets. Domestic savings rates are expected to be
maintained at present levels--around 22-24 percent of GDP, and would finance
about 80 percent of gross investment. The bulk of the projected external
resource gap would be met largely by rising workers' remittances.
11.       The prospects for continued economic growth in the medium term are
good. The endowment of natural and human resources, together with the prag-
matic and dynamic approach to the solution of economic difficulties, the
readiness to consider and undertake necessary institutional changes, and the
strong commitment to an open market-oriented economy, gives ground for a
favorable assessment of future prospects.
External Assistance
12.       Gross capital inflows have more than doubled in the last five years
reaching US$860 million in 1971, and an estimated US$930 million in 1972.
Most of these funds are medium-temn commercial credits, reflecting the
limited assistance coming from governments, and the liberalization of foreign
trade and borrowing regulations following the 1965 Economic Reform. The
inflow of suppliers' and financial credits has come largely from the United
States, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom. IBRD loans have
been the main source of long-term capital since 1968. Yugoslavia has, so far,
not been able to place public bond issues on the world's capital markets.
Howiever, three private placements (medium-term) of US$115 million have been
made in 1972 in the U.S., and other possibilities for raising long-term funds
are being explored. In October 1972, an agreement was reached with the USSR
for credits of 540 million clearing account dollars for investment financing
in the energy, ferrous and non-ferrous metal, cement and shipbuilding industries.



-4-
13.       The Government has tried to encourage private foreign investment
through special legislation in 1967, mnd by October 1972, 68 joint venture
agreements had been signed between local and foreign enterprises, involving
the investment of about US$100 million. The conditions for foreign partners
in joint ventures with Yugoslav enterprises have recently been further improved
in an effort to encourage a more rapid flow of foreign investment.
External Debt Managanent
14.       The pattern of capital inflow since the mid-1960's led to a
deterioration in the maturity structure of external debt.   The Government,
aware of the dangers in the unregulated growth of external debt, has embarked
on an active debt management policy. Since mid-1971 all foreign credits
have to be registered with the National Bank to ensure that contracted
credits remain within the ceil:ings determined by the Federal Government and
the National Bank, and that the terms of borrowing are appropriate to the
transaction and to the general economic situation. In connection with the Stand-
by Agreement with the IMF in July 1971, the Government decided to lit out-
standing short-tenn credits to 1970 levels, and medium- and long-terma loans
incurred or guaranteed by the banks to US$900 million, and has kept borrowring
withini these limits.  In April 1972, a newf system for regulating Pe:Lernal
borrowing was adopted which operates by influencirng the cost of external
borrowing through varying dinar deposit requirements.   Moreover, the National
Bank has been given authority to veto any credit arrangement without giving
its reasons. The Government has also embarked on a st.abllizaticn program
thav includes rescheduling or refinancing existing debts and containing
longer term credits.  The United States agreed to reschedule US$58,5 million
of debt payments falling due in 1971 and 1972, and It.aly, Germany, France,
Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to extend financial credit3
totalling US$277 million during 1972-1975 (Germany $1ii? million, Italy $75
million, Japan $30 million, France $20 million, Belgi-L $5 million, Hether-
lands $5 million).  The Government hopes to secure anoDther $50 mlI icn from
Western European countries during 1973-75.
15.       External public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding and
disbursed on December 31, 1971, was US$1,413 millon.    In addition, there
was US$1,351 million non-guaranteed externma debt cutstarding on that late.
Total debt service payments in 1972 are estimated to be about US$792 million,
mostly in convertible currencies. The service of total extemrnal debt in
1972 represented 18 percent of foreign earnings. Excluding debts and
ea3nings ir. non-convertible currencies, the ratio becomes 24 percent.  Debt
service is expected to remain -at about present levels during the next five
years. Taking into account Yugoslavia.'s debt service record and the new
measures for improved external debt management, Yugoslavia is credit-
worthy for substantial Bank lending.



- 5-
Local Currency Financing
16.       High priority projects in Yugoslavia, especially those designed
to improve infrastructure and accelerate development in the less-developed
regions, have relatively low foreign exchange components due to the
relatively advanced stage of Yugoslav industry and the competitive-
ness of Yugoslav contractors. Were the Bank to confine its lending to
the foreign exchange costs of projects, an adequate contribution to Yugo-
slavia's external capital needs could be made only by spreading the lending
over a large number of projects, including some of lesser priority. The
latter alternative would make excessive demands on Bank manpower and restrict
the Bank's ability to provide support for specific structural reforms. Local
expenditure financing is therefore justified.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
17.       The Bank has made 21 loans to Yugoslavia, totalling about US$660
million. The proposed loan would be the first specifically for an agricul-
tural project in Yugoslavia, although three previous loans (Loan 51-YU,
Loan 73-YU, both for Development Financing, and Loan 777-YU for Ibar Multi-
purpose Water Project, made in 1951, 1953 and 1971, respectively) also
contained agricultural components. Otherwise, Bank lending has been concen-
trated on infrastructure projects such as transportation (five highway loans
totalling US$150 million and three railway loans totalling US$155 million),
power (three loans totalling US$135 million) and telecommunications (US$40
million). Loans also have been made for industry (three loans totalling
US$45 million) and for tourism (two loans totalling US$30 million). IFC
has made six investments for total commitments of about US$53 million in
Yugoslavia. Its most recent investment (E133 million) in the Belisce/Bell
joint venture for manufacturing pulp and paper approved by the Executive
Directors in January 1973.
18.       Execution of projects under most loans has experienced some delays,
particularly under those for the Railway Modernization Program of FY65
(Loan 395-YUS, the Belgrade-Bar Railway Project of FY68 (Loan 531-YU) and the
Babin Kuk Tourism Project of FY71 (Loan 782-YU). Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as at March 31, 1973, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects with particular references to those which
are encountering delays in disbursement.
19.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are (a) to
accelerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; (b)
to promote structural refonrs in major sectors of the economy through



improved coordination, the strengthening of institutions and technical
assistance; (c) to help provide Yugoslavia with external capital at
long term and thus help redress the excessively short term character
of Yugoslavia's external borrowings; and (d) to help alleviate Yugo-
slavia's shortage of foreign exchange by financing foreign exchange
earning projects.  These objectives are basically the same as those
which guided lending in previous years, but efforts to give special
support to the less-developed regions are being strengthened, and a
high level of technical assistance will be provided in appropriate
cases.
20.       In furtherance of these objectives, loans for the construction
ofP a gas pipeline, further support for railway modernization, a tourism
project in Jaz (Montenegro), expansion of the port facilities of Bar,
river regulation, urban polluti.on control, roads and highways, and a
water and sewerage project (tourism infrastructure) in Dubrovnik are
envisaged during the next two years. Also planned for this period are
an industrial line of credit and two or three specific industrial pro-
jects of particular importance to the country. IFC is also currently
investigating several new investment opportunities.
21.       In addition to significant help with the preparation of
projects for Bank financing, the Bank's recent technical assistance to
Yugoslavia has included reviews of the power, tourism and transportation
sectors. Other current activities include assistance to a project
appraisal training institution, the training of some of its teachers, a
study of the Yugoslav capital market, and help in establishing a training
program for auditors in Yugoslavia's Social Accounting Service which
audits several Bank-financed projects.
22.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia averaged cloose tc US$100
million annually in the last three years. Although this represents
only a relatively small proportion of the country's needs for external
finance , it is equivalent to about two-thirds of the long-term
official capital inflow in convertible currencies. Assuming that Bank
lcnding were to continue at about the same level in the next few years,
tie outstanding debt to the Bank would rise from 10 percent of Yugoslavia's
tot-al external debt in 1971 to 15 percent by 1978.  Service on Bank loans
.-IS a proportion of total debt service would increase from 4 percent to 5
percent.



-7-
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
23.       In spite of the rapid development of the Yugoslav industry and
service sectors over the past 15 years, agriculture continues to be of
major importance, accounting for 21 percent of the national product, employ-
ing 43.5 percent of the active population and contributing 15-20 percent of
the Yugoslav exports.   While the relative importance of agriculture is
gradually declining, it continues to have substantial potential for further
development.
Sector Organization
24.       The agricultural sector in Yugoslavia is divided into two parts,
social and private.   This dual structure dates back to 1953 when, in a re-
versal of the 1945 policy of collectivization, the Agrarian Reform Law re-
established private holdings, reformed the cooperatives and provided land for
the development of a socialized sector within agriculture, based on socially
owned enterprises and cooperative farms.    This represented a simultaneous attempt
to strengthen the position of the peasants and to establish a basis for large-
scale market production based on modern technology.    In recent years, the
Federal Government has also sought to stimulate agricultural production through
a variety of other measures, including guaranteed minimum price support arrange-
ments, and interest subsidies on investment funds. As a result of the Constitutional
Reform of 1971, the responsibility for most of these measures has been trans-
ferred from the Federal Government to the Republic and Provincial Governments.
25.       The socialized sector, which contains a spectrum of lar e-scale
self-managed enterprises (including combinats,1/ and cooperatives_), is the
center of modern production technology and has provided a framework for the
development of the country's integrated food processing industry.     These enter-
prises own almost 30 percent of the total farm land (almost 15 percent of the
arable land).   In 1971 they employed 14 percent of the total agricultural man-
power and produced 20 percent of the agricultural share of the gross domestic
product (GDP) and 44 percent of market production (excluding that sold by
individual farmers on local markets).
26.       The private sector consists of 2.6 million individual holdings (each
with a legal maximum of 10 arable hectares), employes 86 percent of the total
agricultural manpower and supports about 50 percent of the total population of
Yugoslavia.   In 1971 private farms produced 70 percent of the agricultural con-
tribution to GDP and 56 percent of market production.     Private holdings vary
greatly in size; about 30 percent of holdings are 5 hectares or more and account
for more than 60 percent of total private farm land, while 40 percent of hold-
ings are less than 3 hectares and cover only 17 percent. In contrast to the
socialized sector where the average size of holding is increasing, fragmentation
of private farms has increased and average farm size today is only about 3.8
hectares.
1/   Combinats are socially owned and self-managed enterprises with vertical
integration of production, processing and marketing.
2/   Cooperatives vary in terms of ownership of land and other property from
those completely collectivized and those with individual ownership.



- 8 -
27.       The share of each sector in iaarket production of different goods
reflects partly comparative costs and partly the uneven distribution of recent
investment and technological innovation. At present, therefore, the two
sectors are more complementary than competitive in terms of product speciali-
zation. Labor intensive crops (e.g., vegetables and tobacco) and livestock
(i.e. , cows and sheep) are predominantly produced by the private sector, while
the social sector dominates the market production of cereals; both sectors are
active in the production of pork and poultry products.
Sector Performance
28.       Aggregate agricultural production grew at an average annual rate of
2.2 percent during the second half of the last decade, fluctuating around this
average from a decline of 4 percent in one year to an increase of 7 percent in
another, due almost entirely tc changes ir weather. Annual growth rates
differed only by small margins between regions, with a slightly higher growth
trend in the less developed regions. Yn eacih region, however, the modern
socialized enterprises are gradually increasing their role in supplying grow-
ing markets in cities and towns.
29.       The growth rate in the socialized sector was 6 percent between 1963-65
and 1968-70, while production in the private sector grew by only about 1 percent.
These differences were due to: (i) differences in investment rates, the social
sector enjoying about sixteen times more capital investment per hectare than
the private sector; (ii) differences in the available technical expertise,
with a substantial increase of university trained workers in the social sector;
and (iii) differences in production potential, since the social sector is rela-
tively more important in the valleys of motuntain areas and in the fertile
plains.  The rapid growth of productivity in the social sector has caused a wide
and growing gap between sectors.
30.       The Social Development Plan for the period 1971-75 calls for an
annual growth rate of aggregate agricuOltural production of 3.2 percent, composed
of an annual growth rate of 5.0 percent in the social sector and 2.8 percent
in the private sector. These planned growLh rates are ambitious in the light
of actual growth during the previous period, especially in the private sector;
however, the potential for expanding the output is large and the associated
marginal cost would be low due to the exrist:er!ce of underutilized resources.
Until recently, the private sector had no extension service, and there
exist no governmental agencies for rural d.evelopment in Yugoslavia.  In recent
years, cooperative and combinats have wlayed increasingly important roles as
suppliers of all services necessary for raising production and productivity in
the private sector.
A riculiusral Seccor in Macedonia
31.       Macedonia is one of the less d-eveloped Republics of Yugoslavia:  In
1971 Macedonia had an estimated per capita uross Material Product (GMP)I/ of
US$42h, compared with the national average of US$663.   Agriculture in Macedonia
employs 17 percent of the activre population and contributes 28 percent to the
"national product" of Macedoria,. Aggregate agricultural production, limited
in capacity and prinarily of subsistence character, has been growing only half
1/  GuMP corresponds to Gross Domestic Product minus output of the service
sector (excludr.g transpcirt and trade/corrierce) .



- 9 -
as fast as the Macedonian economy during the last several years. In view
of the limited rainfall, particularly in the season when it would most assist
agriculture, the lack of irrigation facilities is one of the major factors
limiting agricultural production in most of Macedonia. The relatively low
productivity of Macedonia agriculture can also be traced to a lower rate of
utilization of fertilizers, tractors and other modern inputs than elsewhere
in Yugoslavia.   In the private sector, consisting of about 160,000 farms, out-
put has grown at an annual rate of only about 2 percent in the past five years.
Output has grown about four times as rapidly in the 25 combinats which comprise
the social sector.    Although the social sector comprises only about 20 per-
cent of the total arable land, it accounts for 30 percent of the the total
agricultural output of Macedonia.
32.       As elsewhere in Yugoslavia, the initiatives for development of the
private sector in Macedonia have been left to voluntary cooperation between
the agro-industrial combinats and the private farmers, particularly in the
production of industrial crops, grapes and other fruits. However, this
arrangement has been inadequate to meet the needs of the private sector because
of the limited number and distribution of combinats and cooperatives as well as
the inherent limitations in scope and quality of such voluntary arrangements.
Increasingly, the Government of Macedonia has become concerned about the need
to develop the private sector more rapidly and has recently taken direct measures
to assist private farmers. Macedonia's current development plan (1971-75)
envisages total investment of about ND 2.4 billion (US$141 million) for agri-
culture, primarily for agricultural infrastructure and for projects sponsored
by combinats. In this plan, the government has, for the first time, set aside
funds (in the amount of ND 200 million, US$12 million equivalent, or about
8 percent of the Plan allocation for agricultural investment) to be used ex-
clusively for the development of the private sector. The Government also decided
in July 1972 to establish a system of government sponsored agricultural exten-
sion services for the private sector. The program is now being implemented by
the Secretariat for Agriculture and Forestry, but it will be some time before
significant field work can be started.
33.       The primary investment institution for agriculture in Macedonia has
been Stopanska Banka, which, in addition to its own resources, is the channel
for funds from the Federal Fund for Accelerated Development of Less Developed
Regions (Federal Fund) and the Investment Fund of the Macedonia Government. In
recent years, these Funds, which currently lend to Stopanska Banka at interest
rates of 4-1/2 percent and 2 percent respectively, have been the major sources
of investment capital. The Investment Fund has been used primarily for in-
vestment in irrigation, whereas Stopanska Banka lends to combinats and coopera-
tives only. Like all other Yugoslav banks, Stopanska Banka has not lent
directly to private farmers, since it is not equipped to handle a large number
of small-scale operations. Private farmers obtain credits, together with seeds,
fertilizers and services, from combinats and cooperatives under various forms
of cooperative arrangements. However, average investment per hectare in the
private sector has been low and only 1/28 of that in the social sector.



-10 -
34.       The lending rates for agricultural loans were subsidized by the
Federal Government until 1972,when the responsibility for interest subsidies
was passed on to the Republic and Provincial Governments. Since then the
Macedonian Government has set and maintained lending rates at 3 percent,
5 percent and 5-1/2 percent, respectively, for irrigation, on-farm mechani-
zation and other purposes.   For loans made out of the banks' own resources, the
Government provides subsidies sufficient to enable the banks to earn 8 percent
oni their funds.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
The proposed project; stemmed from the recommendations of an economic
missJon in 1970 and was formulated by a project identification mission in April
1971.   The project was prepared jointly by the Government of Macedonia,
Stopanska Banka and 15 agro-business combinats. After a Bank mission in April
1972 to assist in this preparation, the project was appraised during July/
August 1972 and a follow-up mission in November/December 1972.     The last
m:ission also reviewed the proposed merger of Stopanska Banka with two other
local banks and was satisfied that the merger would result in a larger financial
institution suitable for the project implementation and execution.     The newly
merged bank, also named Stopanska Banka, Skopje, is discussed further in
paragraph 42 below.    Negotiations were held during March 1973 in Washington,
D.C.   The Yugoslav delegation included representatives from all institutions
mentioned above and was led by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secretary
for Finance, and Mr. Trajan Ivanovski, General Manager of Stopanska Banka.
Project Description
36.       The project forms part of Macedonia's 1971-75 development plan and
would provide sub-loans for fixed investment and incremental working capital
to agro-tndustrial combinats and cooperatives to assist in modernizing produc-
t_ioii aind processing facilities, thereby increasing the competitiveness of their
fY-UOdut-LS in domestic and foreign markets and indirectly assisting private
racrser- The project would also assist in the development of private farms
rOIre dirtef tly by providing funds for agricultural credit to the private sector
t1irough tlie combinats and cooperatives; because this component of the project
,-epresents the first attempt to lend to the private farmers, it is experimental
In nat ;i-e anid thus limited in scope. In addition, considering the lack of in-
..roatiun oa this sector, the project would include studies necessary for
deovus-ing effect.ive means to improve the productivity of the private farmers in
Ma'wedoni-;
37.       More specifically, the project would provide for:
Financing to the combinats for:
- construction and equipping of five dairy farms (each with the
capacity for 1,000 milk cows), including procurement of 4,000
dairy cattle, four cattle fattening farms (each with feeding



- 11 -
capacity for 1,000 young cattle), four heifer rearing farms
(each with rearing capacity for 1,000 heifers), and two pig
farms (with annual production of 40,000 slaughter pigs);
- construction and equipping of a slaughtering and meat pro-
cessing plant, (with annual processing capacity of 12,000
cattle and 125,000 pigs), and technical assistance for en-
gineering services and staff training;
- construction and equipping of a wine processing plant (with
annual production of about 42 million liters of bulk and bottled
wine, brandy and carbonated beverages), and technical assistance
for engineering services and staff training;
- construction and equipping of two wine by-product processing
plants (with joint annual output of 10,000 tons of vinegar,
7,500 tons livestock feed and 3,000 tons of other by-products)
and technical assistance for engineering services and staff
training;
- development by 13 combinats of 1,600 ha. and 1,000 ha. vineyards
for wine grapes and table grapes, respectively (with annual
production of 28,000 tons of table grapes and 18,000 wine grapes);
- development of five carp fish ponds and three trout fish ponds
(with annual output of 1,500 tons of carp and 75 tons of trout);
and
- construction, including provision for engineering services,
of two cold storage plants for fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat
and poultry products (with capacity of 5,000 tons each), a
steel corn storage complex (with capacity of 5,000 tons) and a
concrete rice silo (with capacity of 2,500 tons).
b.  Financing to the cooperatives (including tobacco enterprises which
assist private farmers in the production and marketing of tobacco) for
construction and equipping of 150 tobacco drying sheds (each with an
annual capacity of 10 tons of flue-cured Virginia tobacco).
c.  Financing to the private farmers for the development or expansion
of vineyards and livestock and other types of on-farm improvements
(about 2,400 farmers are expected to participate in the credit
arrangement).
d. Technical assistance to the Government of Macedonia:
- to complete feasibility studies on several irrigation systems
and on an access road improvement program for the private sector;



- 12 -
- to conduct a market: study on the future demand and
supply of principal agricultural products in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia to help the Government formulate long-range
development programs; and
-  to conduct a comprehensive study of the private farm sector,
which would consist of (i) devising a system for monitoring
and evaluating the result of the private sector component of
the project, (ii) formulating priority needs for the develop-
ment of the private sector over the next ten years, and (iii)
preparing the second phase of a private farm investment
program.
38.       The project is expected to start in mid-1973 and to be completed by
mid-1978. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III. The appraisal
report, entitled "Appraisal of an Agricultural Industries Project - Macedonia"
(83a-YU dated April 30, 1973) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors.
Project Implementation and Management
39.       The proposed Bank loan would be made to Stopanska Banka, Skopje,
which, using the proceeds of the Bank loan together with its funds, would
make sub-loans to the combinats and agricultural cooperatives either for their
own investment or for relending to the private farmers. Within Stopanska Banka,
the Agricultural and Forestry Loan Department (AFLD) would have overall oDera-
tional responsibility for project management; it would (1) appraise the sub-
projects and make sub-loans in accordance with policies and procedures agreed
with the Bank, (2) coordinate and supervise procurement under the project, (3)
maintain technical and financial supervision over the execution of sub-projects,
(4) gather, analyze and evaluate information to study the effects of the
various sub-projects on the combinats, cooperatives and private farmers, and
(5) execute the technical studies by employing consultants within six months
of the signing of the loan agreement.
ho.        All the social sector investments under the project have been carefully
analyzed bv the Bank.    However, in order to verify and update financial and
economic, and particularly market;, information on the sub-project, and to examine
thle crecitworthiness of the sub-borrower, Stopanska Banka would undertake its own
appra4sal of each sub-project andl sub-borrower. For sub-loans over US$1.5
rillion, equIvalent, or those for sub-projects which have substantially changed
since appraised by t,he Bank, Stopanska Banka would submi.t its appraisal
renorts to the Bank for approval prior to making such sub-loans.    Appraisal of
sub--projects would include thorough technical and financial evaluation as well
as economic and market analyses. In particular, Stopanska Banka would examine
capital and labor-intensive alternatives for construction and production with
a view to ensuring that capital would not replace the more economic use of
labor in sub-projec-s.   It would also ensure that sub-projects generate suffi-
cient cash flows to cover debt service and a satisfactory financial rate of
return.



- 13 -
41.       For the private sector, Stopanska Banka would select qualified
agro-ijadustrial combinats and cooperatives to apply for agricultural credits
to be relent to private farmers. It would review the appraisal reports on
s?uch sub-projects sponsored by the selected combinats and cooperatives and,
upon approval of the sub-loans, would disburse against 100 percent of their
loans to the private farmers. In order to maximize the benefits to the farmers,
it would ensure that the approved combinats and cooperatives would (1) provide
adequate and continuing technical assistance to private farmers, (2) make an
adequate appraisal of each request for a sub-loan to ensure that sub-projects
generate sufficient cash flows to cover debt service and a satisfactory
financial rate of return, (3) provide a suitable market outlet at fair and
reasonnble prices for the bulk of the farmers' production, preferably under a
marketing contract, and (4) provide, if necessary, seasonal credits to realize
the full potential of the investment.
The Borrower
42.       Stopanska Banka, Skopje, was formed as a result of a merger in
January 1973 of the three leading banks in Macedonia:   Stopanska Banka, Skopje,
Commercial and Investment Bank, Skopje (CIBS) and Commercial and Investment
Bank, Bitola (CIBB). The combined assets of the new bank are ND 24 billion
(about US$1.8 billion), making it the fourth largest bank in Yugoslavia. It
has a staff of 1,200 and operates through 27 branch offices throughout Yiacedonia.
ihe operational policies of Stopanska Banka, particularly with respect to
finance, organization, administration and appraisal, are sound and satisfactory
to the Bank.
43.       The Agricultural and Forestry Loan Department (AFLD) of the bank
has remained unchanged through the merger and will continue to be responsible
or lending to the agricultural sector by Stopanska Banka. AFLD has a com-
petent technical staff of 25 and is divided into four main sections: live-
stock, crop production (primarily cereals, fruits, and vegetables), processing
(primarily tobacco and food) and irrigation. Although its project appraisal
procedures are generally good, AFLD would undertake more detailed financial
analysis under the project. Also additional expertise in food processing
engineering and food marketing (domestic and export markets) would be required.
It is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan that an experienced
senior food processing engineer and a food market expert would be retained by
Stopanska Banka.
Project Costs
44.        The total cost of the project is estimated at ND 1,054 million
(US$62 million) with a foreign exchange component of US$18 million, or about
29 percent of the total cost.   The social sector fixed investment is estimated
at 60.L percent of the total cost, the private sector fixed investment at 11.8
percent, the cost of three technical studies at 0.6 percent, incremental working
capita]. at 7.2 percent, and contingencies at 20.0 percent.   The estimates are
based on the feasibility studies submitted by the sub-project sponsors, with the
price level of July 1972. A physical contingency of 10 percent is applied to
the fixed investment costs and a cumulative price contingency of 19 percent assumes
over the five-year construction period, an annual price increase of 5 percent



for imported materials and anr.a<a -ricoe lncrses, decreasing from 12 to 6
percent, fc,r domestic materials..
f'inancing
45.       The proposed Bank loan of US$31 iaillion, equivalent, would finance
50 percent of the total project cost and -*^;ould cover the foreign exchange component
and about US$13 million of local costs (see raragraph 16).    The remainder of
the project cost would be fiaanz'ed as follows: 30 percent by Stopanska
Banka and 20 percent by the sub-borrow.ers.  The Bank loan would contribute
58 percent of the total fixed invastminnt costs of thle sub-projects and 50
percent of the three studies but wotuld not finance incremental working capital.
Stopanska Banka would utilize the Bank loan together with its own funds, to
finance 80 percent of the fixed investmcnt cost of the sub-projects. In
addition, it would provide, cut of its owTn resources, a maximum of C0 percent
of working capital requirements. Szopanska Banka, with a supporting guarantee
of the Republic of Macedonia, would guarantee financing of the local costs of
the project and any cost overrunas. The foreig-n exchange risk on the Bank loan
would be carried by the combinats and cooperatives for fixed investments, and
Stopanska Banka would assume the foreign exchange risk only for the funds for
technical assistance.
Lending Rates
46.       Under the project, st(jpanska 1;anka would obtain funds for on-
lending from the proposed Bank 'Loan (- out 63 percent), the Federal Fund
for Accelerated Developmenit of ihe Less Developed Regions (about 28 percent)
4nd its own resources (about 9 percent) with capital cost of 7-1/4 percent, 4-1/2
percent and 8 percent, respecti.A,ly.  Thus thle average cost of Stopanska
B3anks's funds would be 6-1/2 perc,cnt.  Stopanska Banka would lend to combinats
and cooperatives for their ouin :westmen- a. 8-1/4 percont interest ar.d would
mike funds available at the rate of 6       percent to combinats and cooperatives
for on-lending to the private faor-:e.rs T'Ol fixed iciveatment at 8-1/4 percent.
This would allow spreads for Sto   ns.  Bamk;. of 1- p/ percent and 1/h percent
for social and private -ector inve3+t,1en-c, r2spec.ively, and of 1-1/2 percent
for the combinats and cooperativas for 'Lxcd iviuvstments in the private sector.
These margins under the projett *_omoare r>vorably with the average spread in
recent years of h/5 percent for Sto5anska Banka Land 1-1/2 percent for CIBS.
Such margins would also compensat.e for the expansion of its operations to the
private sector; its additional adninlrat.ve cust would be small and the risks
of sub-loan default and foreign exc. .ange adjustment would be passed on to
combinats and cooperatives.    Seaao:'al anr other short-term loans would be made
available to combinats, cooperativfs an., private farmers at the interest rate
which would be 1 percent tigher t'han Stopanska Banka's capital cost for these
loans.
}7.        The proposed rabes represent ar! increase of 50 percent over the
current lending rates and largely eliminac, interest subsidies.     They mark



- 15 -
a notable step toward a policy of realistic interest rates.    In view of -the
decreasing rates of inflation expected ;and the Government intention to main-
tain the exchange rate of the dinar at its world market value, these lending
rates are expected to result in positive interest rates. The terms of the
sub-loans under the project would be related to the cash flow projections of
the investments but would not exceed 16 years, including a maximum grace
period of 5 years.
Procurement
48.       Procurement of plant for meat, wine, and wine by-product processing
would be through international competitive bidding under turn-key contract,
since these facilities constitute integrated units. The total contracts subject
to international competitive bidding would amount to about US$13.5 million.
Due to the limited availability of stock of suitable breed and high quality,
procurement of in-calf dairy heifers must be selective, and therefore would
not be suitable for international competitive bidding; about 75 percent of
these heifers (equivalent to US$3.1 million) would be procured internationally,
with quotations for the selected breeds from at least three countries. The re-
mainder (contracts equivalent to US$0.8 million) would be procured through
local bidding. The award of these contracts for livestock would not be subject
to the Bank's prior approval but Stopanska Banka would send to the Bank
analysis of the bids received and an explanation of supplier selection.    Pro-
curement for the livestock farms, storage units, the development of vineyards
and fish ponds, as well as equipment and material under the private farm
credits, would be through local competitive bidding whenever these items can
be grouped in contacts exceeding US$20,000 equivalent.    These small con-
tracts, with relatively small foreign exchange components and geographically
dispersed locations, would not be suitable for international competitive bidding.
The local bidding procedure practiced by Stopanska Banka requires quotations
from three bidders and evaluation of quality, and delivery schedule along with price.
Procurement of goods in contracts of less than US$20,000 would be through
commercial channels.
49.       Domestic manufacturers of materials and equipment would be accorded
a margin of preference, for purpose of bid comparison, which would be the
existing rate of custom duty applicable to competing imports or 15 percent of
c.i.f. costs, whichever is lower.
Disbursements
50.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against 67 percent of
sub-loan amounts disbursed by Stopanska Banka to combinats and cooperatives for
the fixed investments and for relending to the private sector. Reimbursement up to
US$300,000, equivalent, would be made to cover 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of foreign consultants or 50 percent of the cost of Yugoslav consultants for
the three studies. Disbursement requests for the social sector investments would be
supported by full documentation. Disbursements for the private sector sub-loans
would be made against statements of expenditures. No disbursement would be made



- 16 -
against working capital loans or for seasonal credits. Stopanska Banka's
disbursement to sub-borrowers would take about 4-1/2 years and the disbursement
of the proposed Bank loan is expected to take five years. A schedule of esti-
mated disbursements is given in the Loan and Project Summary (Annex III).
Justification
51.       The incremental annual production of primary products under the
proposed project at full development is expected to reach about 75,000 tons,
including for the social sector, over 4,000 tons of processed meat, 24,000
tons of milk, 18,000 tons of table grapes, 19,000 tons of wine and 1,600 tons
of fish, and for private sector 1,400 tons of tobacco, 3,000 tons of table
grapes and 4,000 tons of milk. Most of the incremental production would be
marketed within Yugoslavia where, with the economy expected to continue to
grow at a rapid rate and the continued develoPment of tourism, the market
prospects of these commodities are considered promnisng.    However,
some portion of the incremental production in meat (about 2,000 tont), table
grapes (2,000 tons) and wine (about 2 or 2.5 million litre) could be exported.
The financial rates of return of sub-project investments are estimated between
12 percent and 45 percent. Under alternative assumptions of investment costs
increased by 10 percent and net income reduced by 10 percent, these rates remain
between 11 percent to 43 percent and 10 percent to 42 percent, respectively.
52.       The project would generate additional benefits by creatin
about 1,150 jobs in the social sector. It is expected that these jobs would
be filled by the unemployed or underemployed, thereby alleviating underemploy-
ment and unemploymeng which is currently estimated to account for about 20 per-
cent of Macedonia's labor force. The direct benefits to the private farmers
would be two-fold.   The annual income of 2,h00 prlvate farmers participating
in the project is expected to increase on average from the present level of
ND 5,270 (US$310) to about ND 7,4OO (US$535) at full development. In addition,
it is expected that the private sector would supply one-sixth and one-fifth
of the additional input demand created by the plants for beef and wine processing
respectively.   The economic rate of return is estimated at about 21 percent.
53.       The project would have a major impact on the long-term development
of the combinats in Macedonia. The social enterprises would receive much needed
investment funds to modernize and expand their production and processing facilities,
thereby enabling them to improve their efficiency and competitiveness in both the
domestic and export markets.. The project would also help achieve an improved
resource allocation in the social sector through a better coordinated and a more
critical investment process.. A less tangible but by no means less significant
effect of the proposed project would be its imrpact on the long-term development of
the private farms in Macedonia. The project would support the Government of
Macedonia's effort to accelerate modernization of private farms through their
linkage with the social sector and more directly through the provision of small
development credits. The experiment with private farmers' credits and the
technical study of the private farmers to be provided under the project, would
furnish a basis for formulating a rational strateg;y for long-term development
of the private agricultural sector. One tangible result of discussions between
the Qovernment of Macedonia and the Bank staff is the recent establishment, within
the Republic Secretariat of Agriculture and Forestry, of the Directorate of Agri-
cultural Extension Services.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNMTS AND AUTHORITY
54.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Stopanska Banka,
the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a reso-
lution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.   The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern
for loans for agricultural projects.
55.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

r.   PROJECTS IN EI3fiUTION 1
Loan 395       Railway Modernization Program:  US$70.0 million Loan of
December 11, 1964; Closing Date: March 31, 1973.
The loan was fully disbursed on October 31, 1972, the Closing
iDate ihad been postponed from December 31, 1969. However, completion of the
project has been delayed to 1975, due to financial, planning and technical
difficulties.  After 1966 the Yugoslav Railways suffered a continuous dete-
rioration of their financial position mad liquidity for a number of related
reasons. Project C0ot estimates increased nearly threefold between 1963 and
1971 because of inflation, de-aluation of the dinar, revaluation of some
Suropean currencies and as a consequence of additional work following more
dietailed feasibility studies. Payments for railway freight services were
held back by the lack of liquidity in the whole economy. The five Railway
Transport Ehterprises which, under the Yugoslav system, are expected to
operate on a commercial basis, were restricted by Government regulations in
their ability to respond to changed market conditions. Furthermore, the
responsibility of the Federal Government to meet railway deficits has been
transferred to the Republican Governments, which only now are in a position
to assume it.
In order to be able to make proposals for dealing not only with the
difficulties with the Bank project, but also with the difficulties facing the
Yugoslav railways as a whole, it was agreed with the Government that the Bank
would undertake a thorough review of the railways' problems. Following this
review, which was carried out with the assistance of a consulting team, the
Bank discussed its findings with the Federal and Republic Governments and the
Railways. The response of the Governments and the Railways was very favorable
and they agreed to take concerted action to improve the railways' situation.
In view of this, and of the importance of solving the railways' problems to the
economy as a whole, the Bank agreed to consider making a further loan in fiscal
year 1973 or 1974 to assist completion of the 1964 modernization program, pro-
vided that certain conditions could be met. These are the clarification of
government responsibility for the railways and an overall plan of action both
for the Yugoslav railways as a whole and for each Railway Enterprise (including
clear marketing and related operational and financial objectives), a revised
tariff policy, investment and disinvestment proposals, and proposals for dealing
with labor redundancy problems and for improvement in management. The Govern-
ments and the railways are taking measures to meet these conditions, and a Bank
appraisal mission visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1972. Although the
final size of the proposed project is just now being determined, as Republics
clarify the availability of local resources, the Bank's financial assistance
would be concentrated on the completion of the 1964 modernization program of
miin lines begun with financing under loan 395-YU.
Any further delay in carrying out a minimal modernization program
could further jeopardize the competitve position of the railways in relation
to road traffic and would extend the period in which the economy would not
benefit fully from the large investments in the Modernization Program made
with Bank assistance since 1964.
1/        These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
The progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understandina that they do not purport
to present a b alanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 531        Belgrade-Bar Railway:  US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1973.
A delay of over one year in civil engineering work at the Kos
Tunnel was caused by the inefficiency of the contractor responsible for the
work. The contract has now been cancelled and it is intended to place a new
contract with another more efficient contractor already working for thne proj-
ect.  Construction of the permanent way is also behind schedule by about one
year due to the time required for the. preparation and plannin- work.    Comple-
tion of the project is now expected by mid-1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
is now estimated to be substantially above the original estimate.     The Bank
has asked for a revised estimat;e of the project costs to ascertain the funds
required to complete the project.    If additional fuands should be required,
the availability of these funds would be reviewed in conjunction with the
negotiations for the proposed i'ourth Railway loan.   jA supervision riission
is scheduled for mid May.
Loan 554        Industripl Projects - 1968:   US$16.0 million Loan of August 15,
1968; Closing Date: October 31, 1973.
Seven of the nine sub-projects under the loan hlave been comnpleted,
but two sub-projects have been delaye(d.   Sub-project l-lis (Electronic industries)
is hehind schedule up to two and a half years, due primnarily to delays; in
procurement,but is now expected to be completed shortly.    vTo production ex-
p.lision schemes under su'b-project Sevojno (Copper and Brass 4ill) were revised
witin ,,anl; approval and are now expected to be completed in December 1973 witil
six months' delay and about two years delay, respectively.    The Closing Date
was postponed on April 11, 197^3 from March 31 to October 31, 1973. Disburse-
ment of thc loan is in line with the revised sub-project completion schedules.
Loan 608        Third Highway:  US$3l9.  t mil:Lion1 Loan of June 5, 19699; Closing
Date: December 31, 1973.
Construction works under the loan have been substantially cor.pleted,
e,-cept for thle constnrction of the Karlovac bypass andi the access road in
agre,. lwhtich are expected to reqtire several alditional Plonths.  The Closing
)atc of the Loan wTas accoriingly postporiecd from Decemb er 31, 1972 to December
'1, 1S?3.  In view of increases in costs tthe disbursement percentage has been

Loan 654        Industrial Pro-jects-1970:    US$1Y8.5 million Loan of January 30,
1970; Closi7   Date:  June 30, 1973.
All three sub-projects under the loan are making satisfactory pro-
gress after experiencing delays of up to 18 monthas due to slow deliveries of
local and imported goods, and are now expected to be completed before the
Closin'-' Date. Disbursement is proceedin4 satisfactorily.

Loan 657       Telecommunications:  UJS$40.0 million Loan of FebruLary 20,
1970: Clopsn    9ate:  June 30, 1975.
Construction work is getting underway.  Although there was some
initial delay in procurement preparation and placement of orders, this is not
expected to delay the completion of the project since the deliverv of equip-
merit and materials is expected to follow the original schedule. Disbursement
is about 19 morths behind the appraisal forecast.
Loan 678       Fourth Highway:  US$40.0 million Loan of Say 28,, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1973.
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica sections because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily. The completion of the
project, however, is likcely to he delayed substantially beyond the present
Closing Date: the extent of this delay will be determined in the fall of 1973.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. The Federal Government
submitted a revised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 and
on the basis of this estimate the disbursement percentage has been revised
from 43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973. Disbursement is proceeding
in line with the revised projection.
Loan 751       Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971; Closing
Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about  eight months in fulfilling the conditions
for effectiveness of the loan, construction work is making satisfactory pro-
gress on all sections, and all are expected to be completed before ths Clos-
ing Date.  A 10 percent increase on the appraisal cost estinate is expected,
an,' the disbursempnt percentage would be revised. when more accurate revised
cost estin.ates are availalble.  Disbursement under the Loan is about one year
behind the appraisal forecast.
Loan 752       Bernardin Tourism:  US$10.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Implementation of the project is about a year behind schedule
due to delays in making the loan effective and in organizing the office for
project execution.  Work on programming of physical facilities and architec-
tural designs is making satisfactory progress. The construction of the hotel
complex is now expected to start early in 1974, and to be completed by early
in 1976. Disbursement is proceeding satisfactorily.

Loan 777       Ibar Multipurpose Water:. US$45.0 million Loan of June 30,
1971- Closii- Date:  December 31, 1976.
Implementation of the project has been delayed by about one year due
to delay in making the loan effective, and the only construction work under
way at present is the diversion tunnel for the main dam. Recently the two
largest contracts in the project (totalling US$48 mil'lion) have been awarded.,
Disbursement is about one year behind the appraisal forecast, and the complet-
ion of the project is now expected to be delayed by one year to the latter
part of 1976.
Loan 782       Babin Kuk Tourism:   US$20.0 million Loan of July 21, 1971;
Closing Date:  July 31, 1976.
Implementation of the project is about one and half years behind
schedule due to delays in making the loan effective and in appointing ar-
clhitcctural, engineering and mzmagement consultants. The construction of the
project was originally expected to start in early 1974 but there have been
delays in programnmi.ng of facil:ities and architectual designs due to the
reluctance of Priviedna BEnka, Zagreb, the local iank, to disburse its loan.
This problem appears to have been solved and design work is continuing.
The difficulty encountered in acquiring some of the land from an
auto camp located in the project area has threatened to delay further the
construction work of the project, since all planning and scheduling of con-
struction is base7 on the assumption of the availability of this site prior
to the enr1 of 1973. The Borrmqer has agreed to solve this problem immediately.
Loan 836       P ower Transmission:  US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This loan was declared effective on December 29, 1972. PreparationS
for bidl specificariojns and tender docuieints are mnder way withi consultants'
