AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT - MACEDONIA
SUMhARY
i.        This report appraises a project in the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia for agricultural development in the Republic of Macedonia. The
proposed IBRD loan of US$31 million (50% of total project cost) would cover
the foreign exchange component of about US$18 million equivlent (29% of total
project cost), as well as US$13 million of local currency requirements (21%
of total project cost), and would serve to mobilize an additional US$31 mil-
lion within the country to meet the total cost of the project--approximately
US$62 million. The proposed loan would be made to the Stopanska Bank (SBS),
Macedonia, w th the guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
ii.       The Republic of Macedonia constitutes about 10% of Yugoslavia's
total land area and has a population of 1.7 million which is about 8% of the
country's total population. Macedonia's agricultural sector employs about
47% of its population and contributes about 28% to its GNP. The social sec-
tor consists of socially-owned, self managed enterprises (combinats) which
produce mainly wheat, sugar, grapes, wine and livestock products. This pro-
duction is usually vertically integrated with the combinats own processing
and marketing facilities. The combinats account for only 20% of Macedonia's
total arable land but contribute about 30% of all agricultural income. The
private-sector accounts for the remaining 70% of agricultural income and
includes 160,000 private farmers, of whom 7,500 are organized into about 170
farmers' cooperatives.
{ii.      The average private holding is only 3 ha and the level of tech-
nology is low compared with the social sector. Private farmers procure
their inputs and market their produce either through their cooperatives or
through combinats with which they often have contracts to produce vegetables,
fruits, and other products which tend to be labor-intensive. A government
extension service has been established recently in Macedonia to provide
technical assistance to private farmers. In the past, such technical advice
was available only through combinats and cooperatives, an arrangement which
has been only partly effective.
iv.       The project would include both the social and private farm sectors
in the Republic of Macedonia. In the social sector, it would help finance
the development or construction of:
(a) livestock production--dairy cattle, beef cattle for fatten-
ing and rearing pigs;
(b) a modern meat processing plant with an annual production of
about 11,000 tons of fresh and processed meats;
(c) 2,600 ha of vineyards;
0



- ii -
(d) wine processing facilities--42 million liters production of
wine and carbonated drinks annually;
(e)  wine by-product processing facilities;
(f)  cold storage and grain silo facilities; and
(g)  fish ponds to produce about 1,500 tons of carp and 75 tons
of trout annually.
In the private sector the project would help finance:
(a) construction of about 150 tobacco drying sheds; and
(b) on-farm improvements--mainly for tobacco, table grapes and
dairy farms.
In addition, the project includes technical studies for private farm pro-
ductivity improvement programs.
v.        The procurement of the meat, wine and wine by-products processing
facilities would be subject to international competitive bidding for a total
value of about US$13.5 million equivalent. Heifer purchases, equivalent to
about US$3.1 million, would be obtained after receiving bid quotations from
at least three countries.  Local bidding would apply for other project in-
vestment items where the value of such items for any subcontract exceeded
US$20,000 equivalent. All remaining investment items under the project
would be procured through normal commercial channels.
vi.       The Agriculture and Forestry Loans Department of SBS would be re-
sponsible for carrying out the project. As IBRD has apprais~ed all subproj-
ects, SBS would grant subloans based on its own appraisal of subborrowers'
investment plans, forwarding to IBRD for review only those plans for sub-
projects exceeding US$1.5 million equivalent. SBS would be responsible for
the organization and administration of technical studies under the project,
and the foreign exchange risk on this portion of the proposed loan would be
assumed by SBS.
vii.      IBRD loan funds (US$30.7 million) would be supplemented with about
US$14.8 million equivalent of SBS's funds from other sources for onlending
to subborrowers to cover 80% of the fixed investment costs of subborrowers'
projects. Subborrowers would be expected to contribute the remaining 20%.
The IBRD loan includes no provision for working capital, and SBS would be
required to provide funds of about US$3.6 million equivalent for this purpose.
IBRD loan funds of US$300,000 would cover the foreign exchange costs of for-
eign consultants or 50% of the costs of Yugoslavian consultants for the tech-
nical assistance studies; SBS would finance the remainder.



- iii -
*            viii.      SBS would charge 8.25% on loans to combinats and cooperatives for
their investment programs. To meet the seasonal credit requirements for these
subprojects, SBS would make available adequate short-term loans at 1% margin
over the estimated costs of borrowings which currently are about 8%.
ix.       The three Macedonian banks which merged to form SBS in January 1973
have never lent i I-aTrc to the private lE--m seth-ut always through com-
binats and cooperatives. This practice would continue under the project.
For private sector investment loans, SBS would charge combifnats and coopera-
tives 6.75% and these funds would be onlent at 8.25%. Seasonal credit for
the private sector would be made available to combinats and cooperatives by
SBS at estimated cost, and would be onlent with a margin of 1%. The current
seasonal credit rate to subborrowers therefore would be about 9%. An assured
spread of 1.5% on investment loans and 1% on seasonal loans, together with
100% refinancing and the benefits from economies generated by a greater mar-
keting and processing throughput, would provide combinats and cooperatives
sufficient incentives to assist private farmers with the preparation of their
investment plans and the necessary on-going technical advice.
x.        The combinats and cooperatives would be required to assume the for-
eign exchange risk for IBRD's portion of sub-loans in both the social and
private sectors. The terms of the subloans would be related to the cash flow
projections of the investments but would in no instance exceed 16 years in-
cluding a maximum grace period of five years.
S            xi.        The estimated financial rates of return to subprojects would range
from 12% to 45%. The rate of return to the economy is estimated at about
21%. The project is suitable for an IBRD loan of US$31 million for a term of
20 years including a grace period of five years.

AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT - MACEDONIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
requested an IBRD loan to assist the expansion and modernization of agricul-
tural production and to construct facilities for processing agricultural prod-
ucts in the Republic of Macedonia.  The project would help finance subprojects
in both the social and the private sectors. In the social sector, integrated
agricultural industries enterprises--or combinats--would receive loans for the
expansion of their dairy and beef cattle and pig production; the construction
of a modern meat processing plant (with an annual production of about 11,000
tons of fresh and processed meats); the establishment of 2,600 ha of vine-
yards; the construction of wine-processing facilities to produce 42 million
liters of wine and carbonated drinks and 20,000 tons of wine by-products an-
nually; the construction of cold storage and grain silo facilities; and the
development of fish ponds to produce annually 1,500 tons of carp and 75 tons
of trout. Additionally, the social sector subprojects would provide expanded
markets for private farmers' production.
1.02      In the private sector, private farmers and farmers' cooperatives
(including tobacco enterprises) would receive loans for on-farm improvements,
including the construction of tobacco-drying sheds and the upgrading of cattle.
1.03      Although three previous IBRD loans included a small agricultural
component, this project would be the first for integrated agricultural de-
velopment in Yugoslavia. As of March 31, 1973, IBRD's total loans net of
cancellation amounted to US$660 million.
1.04      The project was prepared jointly by the Macedonian Government,
Stopanaka Bank and several agro-business combinats, and was assisted by an
IBRD preparation mission which visited Macedonia in April 1972.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission com-
posed of Messrs. E. Schertz, S. Bhatia and A. Stoneham (IBRD), and Messrs. A.
Brody, J. Daugherty, F. Hotes and H. Kordik (Consultants), which visited
Yugoslavia in July/August 1972. Additional contributions to this report were
made by Messrs. L. Helmers, R. Hanan and J. Bloom (IBRD).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.91      The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia covers some 256,000
km and comprises six republics and two autonomous provinces. The Republics



- 2-
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and the Province of Kosovo
are less developed than the Republics of Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and the
Province of Vojvodina. The present population of the country is about 21
million and is increasing at about 1.0% per annum. Per capita Gross Material
Product (GMP) has been growing by about 9% annually since 1968, increasing
from US$447 to US$584 in 1971. 1/ Agriculture (including forestry and fish-
eries) is the second most important sector in the economy, contributing about
22% to GNP, after mining and manufacturing which contribute about 36%.
2.02      The regional distribution of per capita incomes is uneven.  The
average per capita GMP of the less developed regions was US$270 in 1968 and
has grown at about 8% annually to US$346 in 1971, whereas that of the more
developed regions was US$540 in 1968 and grew at about 9% annually to US$712
in 1971. The Federal Government is mindful of this regional economic dispari-
ty and has followed a balanced regional economic development policy with the
objective of encouraging growth in the less developed regions by transferring
resources from the more developed regions.
2.03      From 1966 to 1969, producers' prices were quite stable, growing at
about 1.5% per annum. Inflationary pressures, reflecting both cost push and
excess demand factors, resulted in an accelerating rate of price increase in
1970 and 1971 (10% and 15%, respectively). To curb this inflation, Govern-
ment embarked upon a stabilization program, beginning in late 1970, includ-
ing price control, a restrictive monetary policy and the development of an
incomes policy. In addition, the dinar was devalued twice during 1971 for
an overall decline of about 38% against its main trading partners. The re-
sults of these measures have been felt markedly in the external accounts.
Exports increased by 20% in 1972 while imports increased only by 6%; the
large current account deficit has been replaced by a substantial surplus
and foreign exchange reserves have trebled. There was also some slowing
down in the rate of inflation during 1972. With the implementation of the
nevly completed incomes policy, a further reduction of inflationary pressures
can be expected.
2.04      The Republic of Macedonia covers about 10% of the total land area
of Yugoslavia; it is situated in the southeastern part of the country and is
bordered by Greece, Bulgaria and Albania to the south, east and west, respec-
tively. The present population of about 1.7 million (about 8% of Yugoslavia's
total population) lives mainly in rural areas. Macedonia's population growth
rate (about 1.4% per annum) is above the national average.  The largest urban
1/   GMP is GNP less the value of non-productive services; the figures are
expressed in current prices and exchange rates.

center in the Republic is Skopje, which is also the administrative, cultural,
political and industrial center. Other large urban centers are Bitola, Titov
V'eles, Kumanovo and Prilep. Macedonia's per capita GMP of about US$380 char-
acterizes the Republic as one of the less developed regions in Yugoslavia. 2/
B. Macedonia's Agricultural Sector
2.05      Macedonia has basically an agricultural economy with about 47% of
its population employed in agriculture, which contributes about 28%T to its
CNP. Industry ranks second in importance, contributing about 23% to GNP.
Aggregate agricultural production has been growing more slowly than the
economy as a whole during the last several years. The main causes of this
slow rate of growth are inefficient agriculture and undeveloped industry,
in particular food processing. A detailed discussion of Macedonia's agri-
cultural sector and food processing industry is in Annexes 1 and 2.
2.06      In Macedonia, as in other parts of Yugoslavia, agricultural produc-
tion is organized into the social sector and private farms. The social sec-
tor consists mainly of large-scale, self-managed enterprises with vertical
integration of production, processing and marketing (combinats). They are
highly capital-intensive, utilizing modern production technology, and are
well-managed. Their main activities are in wheat and sugar production, to-
bacco marketing, grape and wine production and poultry and livestock products
processing. There are about 25 such combinats, and their present land hold-
ings account for about 20% of the total arable land and contribute about 30%
of Macedonia's total income from agriculture.
2.07      The private sector (private farmers and farmers' cooperatives) oc-
cupies the remaining 80% of Macedonia's arable land and accounts for the
remaining 70% of agricultural income. While the social sector dominates the
production of capital-intensive crops, the private sector concentrates mainly
on labor-intensive crops such as maize and rice, tobacco, vegetables, grapes
and other fruits and livestock products. There are about 160,000 private
farmers in Macedonia, 7,500 of whom are organized into about 170 farmers' co-
operatives. The maximum legal size of a private farm is 10 arable ha,
while the average holding is about 3 ha. Due to a lack of irrigation facil-
ities, agricultural input supplies and extension services, and marketing and
credit bottlenecks, production in the private sector has been low. During
the period 1966-1970, agricultural output from the social sector increased
at the rate of 8.4% per year, while that of the private sector grew at a
rate of only about 2.3%.

Position and Prospects of Yugoslavia, IBRD report No. EMA-48a, May 26,
1972.



-4-
2.08      The lack of irrigation facilities is one of the major factors limit-
ing agricultural production. The annual rainfall of 300 mm in crop production
areas is inadequate and arrives mainly in the colder months, thus necessitat-
ing irrigation for crops during the hot and dry summer months. Government
has recognized the importance of irrigation and serious efforts are being
made to meet this deficiency. With proper irrigation facilities, Macedonia
would be in an excellent position to exploit some of its natural advantages
regarding soils and climate (it has a Mediterranean as well as a continental
climate) to produce such crops as tobacco, rice, cotton, grapes and early
fruit and vegetables more competitively than the rest of Yugoslavia.
2.09      The social sector combinats and farmers' cooperatives procure their
inputs, such as fertilizers, seeds and machinery, from enterprises or directly
from imports. Private farmers procure these inputs mainly from their coopera-
tives or from combinats. In those cases where combinats have contracts with
private farmers for the production of vegetables, fruits or other industrial
crops, the farmers receive the required inputs from combinats. Although
Yugoslavia produces sufficient quantities of fertilizer, fertilizer consump-
tion in Macedonia in both social (40 kg per ha) and private (about 10 kg per
ha) sectors is low, due to the dry climate and lack of irrigation facilities.
Similarly, farm mechanization is still at a very low stage of development,
compared to other republics in the country. In 1969, there were about five
tractors per 1,000 ha, while the overall ratio for the country as a whole was
about seven per 1,000 ha.
2.10      The private farmers can receive technical advice from either com-
binats or cooperatives, but in practice this arrangement has proved only
partly effective. Within the past six months, an extension service has been
established by the Government of Macedonia to supplement the technical as-
sistance the private farmers are currently receiving from combinats and co-
operatives. Having been established with an initial staff of agronomists
and economists, the service aims to help farmers with on-farm development
programs and technical assistance.
2.11      The combinats and farmers' cooperatives either market their own
produce or sell it to those social sector combinats that have the capacity
to process it. Some of the combinats have their own arrangements for export
marketing, particularly in the case of processed fruits, vegetables and wine.
This has created numerous problems in export marketing, such as a lack of
quality and standardization control. In order to centralize and coordinate
export marketing, in particular of fruit and vegetables, the Federal Govern-
ment is establishing export agencies in major European markets.
2.12      Due to the smaller scale of production, private farmers must rely
on the processing capabilities of combinates and cooperatives for their in-
dustrial crops. Due to the lack of marketing information and other adminis-
trative arrangements, private farmers have to rely primarily upon coopera-
tives and combinats for the marketing of their produce. A small percentage



-5-
of their production, mainly vegetables, is sold in the open market where
prices may be higher than those paid by cooperatives and combinats.
C. Agricultural Credit in Macedonia
2.13      The major source of agricultural credit is the Stopanska Bank (SBS)
which acts as an economic development bank for Macedonia and conducts about
95% of all banking business. This bank was formed in January 1973 as the
result of a merger between the original Stopanska Bank, the Commercial and
Investment Bank - Skopje (CIBS) and the Commercial and Investment Bank -
Bitola (CIBB). A detailed discussion of these banks and the merger is given
in Annex 3.
2.14      No banks have lent directly to private farmers, who obtain their
finance through various forms of cooperation with combinats or cooperatives.
SBS has been willing to make credit available through combinats and coopera-
tives for private farm improvements provided specific programs had been drawn
up. Its main activity, however, has been to lend for combinat investment
programs.
2.15      The share of agriculture, including forestry and agro-industries,
in SBS's total lending has averaged 15% (about ND 400 million) over the past
three years. SBS has 11 departments and the Director of its Agriculture and
Forestry Loans Department (AFLD) is responsible for agricultural loans.  The
present technical staff in the department totals about 25 and are all located
in Skopje. SBS does not require security for loans made but relies upon its
own evaluation of each project. The number of bad debts has been insignificant.
2.16      As a result of the merger, SBS has assets of about ND 24.3 billion
(US$1.4 billion), annual profits of about ND 150 million (US$8.8 million), a
staff of about 1,250, and operates from some 27 offices, branches and sub-
branches. Profits are low when compared with international standards, but
normal for this type of operation in Yugoslavia. SBS brought to the merger
its investment expertise, particularly in industry and agriculture, while
CIBS brought its investment experience in tourism, commerce and building,
and CIBB its local investment and commercial experience in the Bitola area.
The merger is further discussed in paragraphs 4.01 through 4.03.
D. Macedonia's Development Plan
2.17      Under guidelines drawn up by the Federal Government for the eco-
nomic development of the republics, the 1971-1975 Social Plan leaves the
responsibility for plans and execution mainly to the republics. Accordingly,
local governments have to carry the responsibility for their own social en-
terprises, and are not prepared to keep uneconomic units alive. The Plan
0



- 6 -
specifically states that an end must be put to the practice of duplicating
manufacturing capacities in almost every republic without regard to economic
considerations.
2.18      This theme is also reflected in Macedonia's development plan, which
stresses the importance of modernizing production techniques and increasing
the competitiveness of social enterprises. The plan envisages investments
of about ND 3.2 billion (US$188 million) per annum, 58% of which are to be
channeled to the industrial sector, including agro-industries, and 15% to be
used for agricultural infrastructure development such as irrigation and land
reclamation.
2.19      For the first time on a large scale, funds are also to be made
available for the development of the private agricultural sector. The funds
- about ND 200 million (US$11.8 million) for the period 1971-1975 - are to be
administered by SBS to private farms through combinats and cooperatives for
new plantings, mechanization, livestock production, improvements, etc.
2.20      As part of the exercise of drawing up Macedonia's -lan, all the
agro-industries combinats submitted their investment proposals to Macedonia's
Ministry of Planning and the appraisal mission reviewed all the plans for
which consultant studirs had been prepared. Based on an analysis of markets,
existing capacities and financial and economic returns, the projects would be
feasible in the fields of livestock and meat processing, grape and wine pro-
duction and fishpond cultivation. Also, private farm development appeared to
be well worth pursuing and a first phase credit project was prepared. All
these projects are further discussed in Chapter III.
2.21      Several combinats had prepared projects in the field of fruit and
vegetable processing and edible oil extraction which would be beneficial to
the private sector. However, analysis showed that Yugoslavia has ample capa-
city to meet the present demand and that further studies r-Lirding raw mate-
rial availability, available processing capacity and market projections need
to be undertaken. The proposed project includes provision for such studies.
2.22      The Government, furthermore, expressed a keen interest in providing
infrastructure projects for the private farm sector. The possibility of in-
cluding an access road (US$10 million) and irrigation development program
(US$44 million) was discussed, but since the engineering designs had not been
completed and no analysis had been made of the benefits that would accrue to
private farmers, these projects could not be appraised. The proposed project
provides for completion of the engineering and economic studies.

III.  THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The project forms part of Macedonia's development program by pro-
viding loans over a five-year period to the social sector for modernizing
production methods and facilities, increasing the competitiveness of the
social enterprises and increasing exports. Credit also would be provided
under the project over the same period to the private farmers for tobacco
growing and drying, table grape production, dairy production and other on-
farm improvements. Technical assistance would be provided for studies to
improve private farm productivity.
3.02      The borrower of the proposed IBRD loan of US$31.0 million would
be SBS under guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
SBS's Agriculture and Forestry Loans Department (paras 2.15 and 4.04) would
make the technical appraisals. SBS would administer and finance the local
costs for foreign consultants and 50% of total costs of Yugoslav consultants
for the technical studies provided for in the project (para 3.23).
3.03      The components of the project are summarized as follows:

B. Detailed Features
Project Areas
3.04      The primary production components financed by the project - vineyard
establishment and livestock development - would be located throughout central
Macedonia (Map) in the irrigated major crop-producing areas. The processing,
storage and fishpond facilities would be constructed near the production areas
of central Macedonia where resources and access roads are readily available.
The private sector on-farm development components would be located throughout
Macedonia.
The Subborrowers
3.05      Under the proposed project, loans would be made available by SBS to
22 combinats for specific investment plans and to about 2,400 private farmers
through combinats and cooperatives for farm productivity impcovements. Each
agricultural industries combinat is an independent economic eaterprise in
accordance with the general Yugoslav concept of decentralized economic con-
trol and workers' self management of social propetties. The Workers' Coun-
cil, elected by the personnel of the enterprise, acts as the top policy-making
body in much the same fashion as the board of directors of a corporation in a
non-socialist country. The Workers' Council appoints the General Manager,
who is the chief executive officer of the enterprise.  In general, the com-
binats are well managed and operate efficiently.  Problems in accounts and
audit are discussed in paras 4.12 through 4.16.
3.06      Assurances would be obtained during negotiations that regarding in-
vestment in the social sector, only those combinats can participate in the
project for which the investment plans have been analyzed    this report and
that the proceeds of the IBRD funds on-lent to such combin3ts can be used
only for those subprojects. Annex 4 presents a list of participant combinats
and subprojects to be executed by each of them. If for any reason SBS would
reject any of the proposed subprojects, assurances were obtained that SBS
would inform IBRD of the reasons for rejection. The IBRD funds that became
available as a result of these rejections could be used for other investment
projects in the social or private sectors provided that social sector projects
benefit the private farm sector and provided SBS submits to IBRD for approval
a detailed feasibility and appraisal report.
3.07      Little is known of Macedonian private farmers' specific credit
demands and needs since banks have not been lending directly to farmers
leaving such lending to the combinats and cooperatives. Moreover, they do
not have the staff resources to appraise and administer a large volume of
private farmers' credit. The proposed private farmers' credit subproject
must therefore be regarded as a first phase proposal for SBS, combinats and
Government to gain experience with farmers and their problems. The long-term



loans under this subproject would be made to the private farmers through ap-
proved combinats and cooperatives and are expected to be used mainly for to-
bacco, table grapes, dairy and on-farm improvements. The appraisal and lend-
ing procedures are further discussed in Chapter IV.
Livestock
3.08      Subloans would be provided to agricultural combinats to finance
construction of buildings and other physical facilities and to purchase
equipment and machinery for five dairies, four dairy heifer rearing opera-
tions, four cattle fattening facilities and two commercial pig production
units. Subloans would also be provided to purchase the basic herd for dairy,
heifer rearing and pig operations. Also included would be provision for en-
gineering services for design and construction assistance and technical as-
sistance for training management and workers in dairy and liv.'estock produc-
tion technology. Construction of the livestock components of the project
would be phased over four years.
3.09      Dairy Farms.  Each of the five project farms would have a herd of
about 1,000 milk cows. The basic herd initially would consist of Holstein
or Friesian in-calf heifers, about 76% imported and 24% domestic. Semen
from government artificial insemination centers would be used exclusively.
Calves would be sold at three months of age to heifer rearing or cattle
fattening farms. At full capacity, in project year 4, the five dairy farms
would sell annually about 24 million liters of milk, about 2,375 bull calves,
500 cull heifer calves and 1,875 heifers.  In addition, about 1,000 cull cows
would be replaced by in-calf heifers to maintain full capacity.
3.10      Cattle Fattening Farms.  Each cattle fattening farm would have
capacity for feeding 1,000 young cattle. Feeder calves would be purchased
at about 110 kg and after feeding about nine months would be sold at about
435 kg. Bull calves and cull heifers would be purchased from project dairies
with outside local purchases being used to maintain operating volume at ca-
pacity. Feed would be largely concentrates with enough roughage to prevent
digestive troubles. Each year some 5,280 fattened cattle from the four farms
would be sold for slaughter.
3.11      Heifer Rearing Farms.  To effectively utilize the improved dairy
breeding stock produced on the dairy farms, four heifer rearing and breeding
farms would be established under the project. Selected heifer calves would
be purchased from the project dairies at three months and would be artifi-
cially inseminated at 15 to 16 months of age. At 23 months of age, the in-
calf heifers (due to calve in one to two months)-would be used as replace-
ments for the project dairies or sold to individual farmers to improve pro-
duction and quality in the private sector. Non-breeders, about 10%, would
be sold for slaughter. Feed would consist of silage, alfalfa and grain
mixed with protein and mineral supplements. About 2,160 bred heifers and
240 non-breeders would be available for sale annually from the four farms
after full development.

3.12      Pig Farms.  Under the project, two farms would be established to
produce about 10,000 and 30,000 slaughter pigs each at full development.
The total annual production of about 40,000 pigs would be equivalent to
about 3,000 tons of pork meat. The total breeding herd of the two farms -
over 2,000 sows farrowing 2.3 litters per year - would consist mainly of
Yorkshire, Landrace and crosses of these breeds. This intensive system would
employ modern methods of pig production including artificial insemination.
Mleat Processing Plant
3.13      A subloan would be provided under the project to construct a meat
slaughtering and processing facility near the center of the Xivestock pro-
duction area, making available a livestock market for the social and private
sectors. Included would be provisions for facilities and equipment with a
capacity to slaughter and process 15 cattle and 100 pigs per hour on a single
shift basis. The plant would be designed to meet the sanitary standards im-
posed by major importing countries including the EEC and USA. The various
processes would be designed for maximum efficiency, utilizing economic com-
binations of fully automated and semi-automatic equipment combined with mini-
mum handling and straight-line flow. Plant design would provide sufficient
flexibility to efficiently slaughter and process animals during the usual
seasonal variations in livestock supply. Included would be provision for
engineering services dvring construction and for technical assistance to
train staff in modern meat processing techniques.  At full production about
12,000 cattle and 125,000 pigs would be processed annually, -roducing about
11,000 tons of fresh, cured, and canned meat and about 3,2CQ -ons of by-
products (lard, bonemeal, etc.). Investment and construction would be over
a two-year period.
Vineyards
3.14      Subloans would be provided to 13 Macedonian combinats for new
planting of 1,600-ha vineyards for wine grapes and 1,000-ha vineyards for
table grapes. At full development, production of fresh table grapes would
be about 22,000 tons annually of which 17,600 tons would be sold fresh and
the balance - 4,400 tons - processed into wine. Grapes for wine production
would reach 24,000 tons. New plantings would be phased over a three-year
period with full production being reached in seven years.
3.15      Included in the project would be simple sheds for protecting ma-
chinery and table grape crates and concrete spray mixing basins. In addi-
tion, some all-weather access roads to and within the vineyards would be
constructed. Technical assistance would be provided to train employees
abroad in vineyard ebtablishment and wine production.

Wine Processing Facility
3.16      A subloan would be provided for the construction of a wine processing
facility for producing about 38 million liters of bulk and bottled red and white
wines, carbonated wines and brandy. Also included would be processing capac-
ity for producing about 4 million 1 of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages.
The plant's total annual output would be equivalent to about 40 million 1 of
high quality wine. Provision would be included for engineering services dur-
ing construction and for technical assistance for training of staff in wine
production techniques. About 41 million 1 of crude wine would be bought from
combinats and small farmers' wineries for blending, aging, and stabilizing
into a similar quantity of high quality wine.
Wine By-product Processing
3.17      A subloan would be provided for the construction of a new wine by-
product processing facility for processing annually about 10,000 tons marc
(the pressed cake left over from grape pressing) and 2,000 tons lees (the
residue after fermentation of wines). Also, a second wine by-product proc-
essing facility of similar size would be added to combinat Tikves's present
wine processing plant where construction would be limited to one building.
Each of the two combinats would obtain its inputs from its wine processing
plants and from other combinats.
3.18      Funds would also be available for engineering services for con-
S           struction and technical assistance for training of staff.  After develop-
ment, output from both plants is expected to reach 10,000 tons vinegar;
7,500 tons livestock feed; 1,500 tons grape seed for edible oil extraction;
740 tons alcohol wine distillate; 560 tons tartaric acid and wine acid and
100 tons baking powder, for a total of about 20,400 tons of by-products.
Cold Storge Facilities
3.19      Subloans would be provided for the construction of two 5,000-ton
capacity cold storage plants. The facilities would be single story, insulated
structures divided into chambers for storing fruit and vegetables, dairy, meat
and poultry products. Provision for engineering services during construction
are provided under the project.
Grain Storage Facilities
3.20      Subloans would be provided for the construction of a steel five-
cell corn storage complex (5,000 tons) and a concrete rice silo (2,500 tons).
Included would be provisions for materials handling equipment, electrical
system and miscellaneous equipment necessary for the efficient receipt,
storage, and discharge of grain. Provisions would be included for engineer-
ing services during construction.

Fish Ponds
3.21      Subloans would be provided for development of five carp fish ponds
and three trout fish ponds. Included in the fish pond component are provisions
for constructing water supply channels and ponds for breeding young fish, fish
fattening, and mother fish for trout fisheries and ponds for the carp fisheries.
There would also be provision for technical assistance to train employees in
fish fanming methods. At full developrment, 1,500 tons of carp and 75 tons
of trout would be produced per year.
Private Farmers' Credit
3.22      With an annual tobacco production of 24,000 tons, mostly Oriental
type, Macedonia accounts for almost 50% of Yugoslavia's total production.
Recent trends have shown an increasing demand for Virginia type tobacco, of
which about 5,000 tons were imported in 1971. It is Goverrment's policy to
support the substitution of these imports with increased domestic production.
At full development, the project would generate 1,400 tons of Virginia tobacco.
Credit would be provided to the private sector individuals and cooperatives
as well as tobacco enterprisesl/ to construct 150 tobacco drying sheds (13m
x 8.5m) with a drying capacity of about 10 tons per year of fluecured Virginia
tobacco. The single story sheds would be divided into utility area and a
drying chamber. Heat would be forced through sub-floor ducts from the furnace
to the dryers. Credit would also be provided for the development of table
grape vineyards on both non-irrigated and irrigated land from which yields
are expected to be about 13 tons and 20 tons per ha, respectively. Credit
would be made available for expanding dairy herds and for improving breeding
stock. This would result in both increased milk production and sales of
fattened cattle. Other on-farm improvements for increasing crop production
would also be financed.
Technical Studies
3.23      With the social sector having tha bulk of the processing and mar-
keting capability, in addition to its own raw material production, and the
private sector utilizing about 80% of all arable land, the sectors are largely
interdependent and complementary (paras 2.05-2.12).  The l&vcis of technology
and productivity in the private sectcr, however, lay well sehind, and in order
to promote balanced agricultural development the Government envisages a spe-
cial effort to assist the private sector. Three separate studies will be
undertaken with the general objectives of providing a clearer understanding
of private farm operations and examining the opportunities for improving £arm
productivity as well as the potential for fostering inproved cooperation be-
tween the private and social sectors. These studies are: (i) an irrigation
study the purpose of which would be to detarmine what is needed to finish the
partially completed irrigation projects in Prespa, Strumiitsa, Tikves and
Bregalnitsa and what benefits these systems would provide to the private
sector; (ii) a study

in the production of private farmers' tobacco, by providing inputs, tech-
nical assistance and marketing facilities.

sector; (ii) a study to determine the potential markets, domestic and export
for food products and the desirability of ex-anding Macedonia's food process-
ing industries, including the benefits they would provide to private farmers;
and (iii) a study of the benefits of the first phase private farmers' credit
program financed under this project and, based on this information, a feasi-
bility study for a second phase credit project. Detailed terms of reference
for these studies are given in Annex 5. They would be supervised by SBS and
would be undertaken by contractors. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that these contractors would be appointed subject to IBRRD approval and
that contracts for the studies, also acceptable to IBRD, would be signed
within six months of signing of the Loan Agreement.
C. Cost Estimates
3.24      Estimated project cost, together with foreign exchange requirements,
are summarized in the table below (see Annex 6 for details). The estimates
are based on July 1972 prices. A 10% physical contingency has been added to
the fixed investment costs for the social sector and the tobacco dryers
credit. The 19% price contingency is based on a price increase of 5% per
year for imported materials and a gradually decreasing price increase from
12% to 6% per annum for domestically produced materials. The expected phas-
ing of project cost is shown in Annex 7.

Twenty percent of total project cost would be contributed by subborrowers and
30% from SBS.  The remaining 50% would be provided by the proposed IBRD loan
of US$31 million.
3.26      The IBRD loan would be made available directly to SBS and would
be used to finance 58% of project investment costs, excluding incremental
working capital, import duties and taxes. Under an agreement with the
Federal Government, the Republic of Macedonia would guarantee the provision
by SBS of counterpart funds for investments and technical studies under the
project, and to cover any cost overruns. Subborrowers would provide from
their own resources 20% of project investment costs including incremental
working capital (para 4.08). SBS would make available sufficient seasonal
and other short-term credit to meet the needs of all subprojects. These
financing arrangements were assured during negotiations.

E.  Procurement
3.27      International competitive bidding according to t-he Bank's guidelines,
and under the supervision of SBS, would be applied by the subborrower for the
procurement of the meat processing, wine processing and wine by-product process-
ing facilities. The processing plants would be procured under turnkey contract
since the facilities need to be integrated units. Specifications and tender
documents for the above subprojects would be submitted to the Bank for review
and approval before issue. Bids will be compared on the basis of c.i.f. prices
and domestic manufacturers will have a 15% margin of preference or the actual
duty whichever is less, in competing with foreign suppliers.  The bid awards
would also be subject to IBRD review and approval. The total contracts sub-
ject to international bidding would be about US$13.5 million (US$5.6 million
for the meat processing plant, US$4.0 million for the wine processing facil-
ities and US$3.9 for the two wine by-product processing facilities).
3.28      Procurement of in-calf dairy heifers according t_. -he Banks guidelines
for international competitive bidding would not be appropria;:e because the stock
needed to develop high production, basic herds are limited by breed and quality.
Due to limited domestic supply, about 75% of the heifers, equivalent to US$3.1
million would be obtained from abroad after receiving bid quotations from at
least three countries. The remainder, equivalent to US$0.8 million would be
procured locally. All purchases would be under the close supervision of the
SBS livestock and veterinary staff.  All purchase contracts between combinats
and suppliers would require the latter to ensure satisfactory arrangements for
delivery and be responsible for such cattle until received by project subbor-
rowers. SBS would submit to the Bank a consolidated summary showing the bids
received and selected together with a copy of the contract awarded to the
successful bidder.
3.29      International bidding would not be suitable for the other project
components. The facilities for the dairy, cattle fattening, heifer rearing
and pig farms are simple unintegTated structures consisting of many units,
widely dispersed throughout Macedonia, and could not be grouped into large
enough contracts to make international competitive bidding practicable. The
same dispersion is applicable to the vineyards where, moreover, the invest-
ment consists mainly of planting materials and trellises. Similarly, the
cold storage, silo, and fish pond subprojects are small and consist mainly
of civil works for which local contractors are more suitable. Finally, the
private farm credit components would not be suitable for international com-
petitive bidding since materials and equipment would be too diversified for
grouping. Procurement for these components would be through normal trade
channels and local bidding.  Subborrowers would follow SBSLs local bidding
procedures when the value of any subcontract exceeds US$20C000 equivalent.
SBS's procedures provide for solicitation of additional bids if less than
three are received initially and for evaluation of quality, delivery and
price.
3.30      The procurement of consultants for the technical assistance studies
would be in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for selection and use of
consultants.



- 17 -
3.31      During negotiations assurances were obtained that the procure-
ment procedures contained in paragraphs 3.27 through 3.30 would be followed.
F. Disbursement
3.32      Disbursement of the IBRD loan would be made against 67% of subloan
amounts paid out by SBS for approved fixed investments of combinats and private
farm development programs. Disbursement requests for social sector investments
would be supported by full documentation. For sub-loans to the private sector,
disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures, the supporting
documents and contracts for which would be retained by Stopanska Banka and
would be available for review during project supervision. IBRD loan funds of
US$300,000 would cover the foreign exchange cost of foreign consultants or 50%
of the costs of Yugoslavian consultants for the technical assistance studies.
IBRD would not disburse for incremental working capital loans or for seasonal
credits. Any savings would be reallocated to social or private sector
subborrowers who meet project criteria.
3.33      SBS's disbursements to subborrowers would take about 4-1/2 years and
disbursement of the IBRD loan to reimburse SBS is expected to take five years.
A schedule of estimated disbursements, by quarters, is given in Annex 8.
IV.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. The Proposed Lending Channel
4.01      As discussed in paras 2.13 to 2.16, the three major banks in
Macedonia merged in January 1973 to form the SBS. This is the proposed
lending channel for the project. The banks are more fully described in
Annex 3. IBRD was satisfied at loan negotiations that SBS's operational
policies have not changed substantially, particularly in respect of financial,
organizational, administrative and appraisal policies.
4.02      Furthermore, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
SBS's Agricultural and Forestry Loans Department (AFLD; para 2.15 and Annex
3) would continue to operate in SBS and that it would be responsible for all
loans under the project.
4.03      AFLD is headed by a Director and has a technical staff of 25.  There
are four main sections (see organigram attached to Annex 3): livestock;
production (mainly cereals, vegetables and fruits); processing (mainly food
and tobacco); and irrigation. There is also a small secretariat. AFLD staff
are well qualified, and loan appraisal and supervision procedures are very
good. Technical and financial analyses are thorough and realistic. Two addi-
tional senior staff would be required--an experienced senior food processing
engineer and a food marketing expert, familiar with domestic and export
markets--and their appointment would be a condition of loan effectiveness.



-18 -
B. Appraisal Procedures
4.04      SBS would make long-term loan funds available for combinat invest-
ment and private farm improvement programs. All social sector subprojects
have been analyzed in detail by IBRD. However, to take account of possible
changes in the economic and market environment as well as to assess the
creditworthiness of the subborrowers, SBS would appraise all social sector
subprojects. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that AFLD
would appraise subprojects as outlined in paragraphs 4.06 and 4.07.
4.05      SBS would forward to IBRD, for approval, investment plans for sub-
projects which exceed US$1.5 million equivalent or which have changed sub-
stantially since the time of IBRD appraisal. SBS would submit copies of
appraisals of all other social sector subprojects to the Bank. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations accordingly.
Social Sector
4.06      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SBS would
ensure that:
(a)  subprojects in the social sector were technically feasible,
financially viable and commercially sound;
(b)  subprojects would generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt
service, reinvestment and satisfactory financial rates of return;            0
(c) for the meat, wine and wine by-products processing plants,
appropriate long-term supply contracts had been signed
(para. 5.04);
(d) adequate technical and financial supervision of on-going
subprojects would be provided; and,
(e) loan agreements with subborrowers would include clauses
satisfactory to IBRD covering insurance, inspection, man-
agement and training.
Private Sector
4.07      SBS would make project funds available to the private farm sector
through combinats and cooperatives and would refinance 100% of the amounts
loaned by the combinats and cooperatives to the farmers. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that SBS:
(a) would satisfy itself that each of the participating com-
binats and cooperatives (i) would provide adequate and
continuing technical assistance to private farm subbor-
rowers, (ii) would make an adequate appraisal of each
request for a subloan and prior to approving such requests



- 19 -
would ensure that subprojects generate sufficient cash
flows to cover debt service and satisfactory financial
rates of return, (iii) would make available the neces-
sary seasonal credit each year to enable the full poten-
tial of the investment to be realized, and (iv) would
provide a suitable market outlet at fair and reasonable
prices for the bulk of the subborrowerst production,
preferably by a marketing contract; and
(b)  would make available to participating combinats and co-
operatives the necessary seasonal credit for onlending
to private farmers.
C. Lending Terms
4.08      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that subborrowers
both combinats and private farmers - would provide a minimum of 20% of the
investment cost, including at least 20% of their incremental working capital
requirements, from their own resources. Furthermore, assurances were
obtained that the combinats would be required to take the foreign exchange
risk on the IBRD portion of the subloans for their own investments; for pri-
vate farm improvement programs, the foreign exchange risk on the IBRD loan
portion would be borne by on-lending combinats and cooperatives.
4.09      Interest charged by SBS on investment loans varies at present from
3% for irrigation to 5.5% for general agriculture, and from 5% to 7% for
industry. Since 62.5% of investment funds would come from IBRD at 7.25%, 28.1%
from the Federal Fund for the Accelerated Development of Less Developed Republics
and Regions at 4.5% and 9.4% from SBS's own resources at a present average cost
of about 8%, the blend cost of funds to SBS would be about 6.5%. The following
interest rates would be applied by SBS to subborrowers for investment loans:
Social Sector   Private Sector
SBS to combinats and cooperatives for
their investments                                8.25%
SBS to comb/coop for relending to
private farmers                                   -                  6.75%
Comb/coop to farmers                                                   8.25%
Since the average cost of SBS's own funds may increase during the project's
disbursement period, an on-lending rate of 8.25% on loans to combinats and
cooperatives for their own investments should ensure a spread to SBS of at
least 1.5% to cover administrative, appraisal and other costs under the proj-
ect (Annex 3, Table 9). SBS would have only a nominal spread on loans to
combinats/cooperatives for private farm development programs (about 15% of



- 20 -
total project costs). This would be acceptable since SBS's administrative
costs would be negligible and the risk of subloan default and foreign ex-
change risk would not be carried by it. Combinats and cooperatives would
receive a spread of 1.5% for long-term funds on-lent to private farmers.
This would compensate them for administrative and technical assistance costs
as well as the foreign exchange risk. Since combinats and cooperatives are
presently unable to fully refinance loans to private farmers, the 100% re-
financing available under the project would provide a further incentive. In
addition to the 1.5% spread, the combinats and cooperatives would benefit
through economies generated by significantly greater throughput in their pro-
cessing and marketing operations. For social sector subprojects, SBS would
provide seasonal and other short-term loans, from their own resources, to
combinats at one percentage point over funds' costs. Initially, the estimated
rate to the subborrowers would be about 9%. The combinats and cooperatives
would obtain seasonal credit from SBS at the bank's cost of short-term funds
for on-lending to private farmers at one percentage point spread. During ne-
gotiations, assurances were obtained that SBS would apply the interest
rates exhibited above.
4.10      As discussed in Annex 3, interest on agricultural investment loans
in Macedonia is about 5.5% per annum. Thus, the rates proposed above would
result in an increase of 2.75% - an increase of 50% - which should be con-
sidered a first step toward a policy of more realistic interest rates. More-
over, the higher interest rates proposed, based on current blend cost of
funds, would permit elimination of interest subsidies which are currently
provided.  The trend of decreasing rate of inflation (para 2.03), coupled
with the full assumption of foreign exchange risk by subborrowers and Gov-
ernment's Intention to maintain a realistic exchange rate of the dinar, would
work towards positive interest rates for subborrowers.
4.11      The terms of the subloans under the proposed project would be
related to the cash flow projections of the investments (Annex 10). However,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that loans under the pro--
posed project would not exceed the following grace and repayment periods:

D.  Audit and Prolect Evaluation
SBS
4.12      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SBS would
maintain a separate project account. This would include disbursements made
under the project for all subloans and for technical assistance.
4.13      The accounts of Yugoslav enterprises are not audited in the strict
sense of the term. Once a year, the Social Accounting Service verifies the
cash balances and conducts a limited check review of the financial statements
for mathematical accuracy and comparisons with previous years. A more de-
tailed field examination is conducted at irregular intervals of between one
and ten years. The main purpose of the Social Accounting Service is to ex-
amine whether financial transactions comply with Yugoslav law. The methods
used do not meet generally accepted auditing standards as the Service does
not verify the validity of any accounts. In order to have Bank loans audited
in accordance with sound auditing principles, the Government and the Bank
presently are discussing an appropriate training program under which Social
Accounting Service staff would be trained in auditing methods consistent with
Bank requirements. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that in the
event that the Social Accounting Service is not able to achieve a consistent
and satisfactory standard of auditing, the borrower would retain at the
request of the Bank a competent, experienced and independent auditor or
auditing firm, selected by the borrower after consultation with the Bank.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the borrower would submit
to the Bank certified financial statements in a format acceptable to the
Bank within three months from the end of each fiscal year. The borrower also
agreed to submit these financial statements auit~ed in accordance with sound
auditing principles to the Bank within sjx_-i-nths from the 'end of each fiscal
year together with appropriate explanatory notes.
Social Sector
4.14      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the parti-
cipating combinats would submit to SBS certified financial statements of
their enterprises within three months from the end of each fiscal year. The
borrower also agreed that such combinats would submit to SBS these financial
statements audited by the Social Accounting Service or another competent and
experienced independent auditor in accordance with sound auditing principles
within six months from the end of each fiscal year. These statements are
primarily intended for use in SBS's management accounting and control, to
allow SBS to analyze the effects of the combinats' investments under this
project on their profits. SBS would make these statements and analyses avail-
able to the Bank upon request.



- 22 -
4.15      The financial statements would be prepared in accordance with
Yugoslav laws. In general, such statements differ from those prepared in
non-socialist countries in the concept of ownership, priority of obligations
of an enterprise and disposition of net income. They are, however, recon-
ciliable with the format commonly used in non-socialist countries. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that SBS would have such state-
ments converted to a format acceptable to IBRn upon request.
Private Sector
4.16      Under the technical assistance component of the main project,
funds would be provided for a contract with a university or consultant to
prepare a second phase private farmers' credit project (para 3.23).  Under
the terms of the contract, the study would include an analysis of the effect
of the proposed credit scheme on the private farm sector. Detailed terms of
reference are in Annex 5. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that a detailed eva uation study would be_ent to the Bank within four months
of the end of each calendar year effective for-calendar year 1974.
V.  PRODUCTITO, MARKETS, PRICES AND OPERATING RESULTS
A. Production
5.01      The incremental annual production of primary products under the
project at full development would be as follows:
Tons
Dairy Farms             - milk (24 million liters) 24,000
Cattle Fattening Farms - 5,280 head of cattle        1,280 (dressed weight) /1
Heifer Rearing Units   - 240 culled cows                60 (dressed weight) /1
Pig Farns               - 40,000 pigs                3,000 (dressed weight) /1
Vineyards               - table grapes for fresh   17,600
consumption
Wine                    - 19 million liters         19,000 /2
F1-._onds               - trout and carp             1,580
Private Farmers         - tobacco                    1,400
table grapes               2,800
milk                       4,noo
74,720
/1   Processed in the proposed meat processing plant.
/2   Produced from the vineyards' production of about 24,000 tons wine
grapes and 4,400 tons table grapes suitable only for wine making.



-23 -
0
In addition, the heifer rearing units would produce annually about 2,100
heifers which would be sold for breed improvement to project dairy combinat
farms or other farms. Furthermore, the wine by-product processing facilities
would produce about 20,000 tons of by-products, mainly vinegar and livestock
feed.
5.02      The processing units in the social sector (the meat processing plant
and the wine and wine by-product processing plants) would depend for their
raw material supplies on the project combinats as well as on other combinats
and the private sector. The total annual input of the meat processing plant
would be about 12,000 head of cattle and 125,000 pigs (equivalent to an out-
put of about 11,000 tons of processed meat) and therefore it would need to
buy from non-project sources about 6,500 head of cattle (about two-thirds
from other combinats and one-third from the private sector), and about 85,000
pigs (primarily from other combinats). As discussed in Annex 9, combinats in
Macedonia have substantially expanded their cattle and pig farms while the
private sector has always had difficulty in marketing its cattle and pigs;
thus, the meat processing plant would provide an outlet for the farm produc-
tion and should have no problem procuring the required numbers of livestock.
5.03       Similarly, the wine processing complex would need to buy about 21
million 1 of crude wine from other sources (about 13 million 1 from other
combinats' present production and about 8 million 1 from the private sector's
present production) for its annual output of about 40 million 1 wine equiva-
lent. The two wine by-product processing plants would require about 20,000
tons of marc and 4,000 tons of lees which would be procured from their own
wineries (50%) and from other combinats (50%). As the bulk of Macedonia's
wine production is in crude form which needs processing, the wine and wine
by-products processing plants would be adequately supplied.
5.04      Moreover, assurances were obtained during negotiations that SBS
would approve the subloans for the meat, wine and wine by-products processing
plants only if long-term phased delivery contracts had been signed by supply-
ing combinats to deliver annually by 1976, sufficient raw material to meet
minimum economic operating requirements.
5.05      It is estimated that more than 2,400 private farmers would make
use of the credit facilities, mainly for tobacco growing and drying, table
grape production and dairy production. Their incremental production is
estimated at about 1,400 tons of tobacco, 2,800 tons of table grapes and
some 4 million 1 of milk.
B. Markets and Prices
5.06      Most of the incremental production of the commodities financed
under the project would be marketed domestically. Yugoslavia's GNP is ex-
pected to continue to grow at a substantial rate. The annual influx of
tourists is expected to double within the next ten years. The major outlet
0



- 24 -
0
for Yugoslavia's agricultural production definitely appears to be the domes-
tic market. A detailed discussion of the market aspects of each project com-
modity is in Annex 9.
5.07      Although the bulk of the production ftrom subprojects would be mar-
keted domestically, prices would be competitive in world markets. Under the
project, it is expected that some small quantities of meat (about 2,000 tons),
table grapes (about 2,000 tons) and wine (about 2 to 2.5 million 1) could be
exported. The major market for fresh meat would be Italy, for canned meat
the USA and Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), for table grapes Austria and
FRG for wines the U.S., Austria and FRG (see Annex 9).
5.08      In the last five years, prices of meat and meat oroducts on the
world markets have shown a significant increase and this trend is expected
to continue in view of the world meat shortage. However, for the financial
analysis, the 1972 prices have been used in order to calculate the returns
conservatively.  Regarding the prices of the other commdodities, domestic
prices in Yugoslavia increased significantly between 1969 and early 1971,
but were stabilized due to Governmentts partial price freeze and are now iyI
line with world market prices. It is Government's policy to maintain this
competitive position. Although international prices are expected to increase
slightly in the future, the financial calculAtions have again been based con-
servatively on 1972 domestic and export prices, as discussed in Annexes 9 and
10.
C. Operating Results
5.09      Financial models for typical investments under the project are given
in Annex 10. The financial rates of return of the 17 models vary between 12%
and 45%. Also a sensitivity analysis was made: if investment costs were in-
creased by 10% the financial rates of return would vary from 11% to 43%; if
net income were reduced by 10%, the financial rates of return would fall to
between 10% and 42%.
5.10      A cash flow projection for SBS's participation in the project is
given in Annex 11. The projections show that subborrowers' repayments would
generate sufficient inflow to repay the IBRD loan within 20 years including
5 years grace and to cover a reasonable degree of slippage in repayments.
An,; surplus funds from loan repayments not required to service IBRD debt
would be relent on the same terms to subborrowers, who meet project criteria,
in the agricultural sector.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      About 20% of Macedonia's working population is at present either
unemployed or underemployed, and it is estimated that the social sector would
hire under the project about 1,150 additional workers.  It can be realistical-
ly assumed that the unemployed labor force would be correspondingly reduced.                _



*                                           - 25 -
Since, without the project, unemployed workers would have to depend on social
insurance benefits of about ND 1,700 per annum, the direct cost to the economy
without the project would have been about ND) 2 million per annum. The reduc-
tion in such benefits is, then, a surrogate for the value of the incremental
real production of these workers.  Taking into account this additional bene-
fit of the project the economic rate of return would be about 21%. The eco-
nomic rates of return of the prop3sed investments are higher than the finan-
cial rates of return mentioned in paragraph 5.09 because import duties and
taxes on investments are not censidered in the calculation and also because
the project would generate additional, mainly employment, benefits. Details
are presented in Annex 12.
6.02      The annual net incomes of the 2,400 private farmers participating
in the project xwould increase on average from ND 5,270 (US$310) to about
ND 7,395 (US$435).
6.03      As has been mentioned, the incremental production under the project
would be sold mainly in the domestic market.  I-However, some quantities would
be exported (para 5.07) and the foreign exchange earnings from these exports
would cover slightly more than the debt service (amortization and interest)
of the proposed Bank loan. Also, of course, a substantial quantity of project
production would be purchased by tourists. However, no attempt was made to
estimate what these indirect foreign exchange earnings would be.
6.04      With a high economic rate of return, and significant employment and
income distribution effects in the small farm sector, the project deserves
the high priority given to it by the Government of Macedonia and is suitable
for an IBRD loan of US$31 million, for a term of 20 years including a grace
period of five years.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreements were reached with the Republic
of Macedonia and SBS on the following principal points:
(a) SBS and the Republic of Macedonia would guarantee the
provision of counterpart funds and seasonal credit
(para 3.26);
(b) procurement procedures outlined in paras 3.27 through
3.30 would be followed (para 3.31);
(c) for combinat investment proposals, SBS would follow the
appraisal procedures specified in paragraph 4.06;
(d) for private farmers' investment programs, SBS would
follow the appraisal procedures specified in paragraph 4.07;
(e)  subborrowers would provide a minimum of 20% of the
fixed investment cost including at least 20% of their
incremental working capital requirements from their own
resources, and combinats and cooperatives would be



- 26 -
required to take the foreign exchange risk on the IBRD
portion of the subloan for their investments and private
farmer on-lending (para 4.08);
(f)  S]S would apply interest rates as exhibited in paragraph 4.09;
(g) a project account would be kept (para 4.12) and that
audit and project evaluation would be undertaken as spe-
cified in paragraphs 4.12 through 4.16.
7.02      It would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan that
two additiotal staff specialists had been appointed to AFLD (para 4.03).
7.03      The project is suitable for an IBRD loan of US$31-million to
Stopanska Bank, for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period.

YUGOSLAVIA
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT - MACEDONIA
Macedonia's Agricultural Sector
Climate and Soils
1.        Macedonia, the southernmost Republic of the Yugoslavian Federation,
stretches from 40° to 43° northern latitude and 21° to 230 eastern longitude.
It is bordered by the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia and the autonomous region
Kosovo on the north, Albania on the west, Bulgaria on the east and Greece on
the south. The total land area is about 25,700 km2.
2.        The country is mountainous with elevations up to about 2,800 m
above sea level. Agricultural production is concentrated mainly in fertile
river valleys and plains. The three dominant mountain ranges run north to
south. While two of these ranges, the eastern and central mountain chains,
consist mainly of granite and volcanic rock formations, the western part along
the Albanian border is made up of dolomites and marble.
3.        In the valleys and plains alluvial soils are piedoninant.  Delluvial
and terra rossa soils are common to the foothills. Soil erosion is a major
problem on steep, barren hills and mountain slopes. Cultivated soils are
usually well supplied with organic matter and potash, but poor in phosphates.
The pH ranges from acid to neutral in the central and eastern part of the
country, while alkaline soils are located in the western part.
4.        Climatically, two regions can be distinguished.  The eastern and
central part has a Mediterranean climate, which is characterized by relatively
mild winters and hot summers. Most of the rain falls in the autumn and win-
ter months while summers are dry. Temperatures range from -4°C to 37°C and
average rainfall is 500 mm. The northern and western parts of Macedonia have
a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Rain falls mainly
during the winter and spring months. Temperatures go as low as -14°C in
winter and up to 40QC in summer. Average rainfall is about 650 mm with
western mountain areas receiving up to 730 mm. Late and early frosts are
a common hazard to both climatic zones and so are hail storms.
Agriculture's Contribution to GNP
5.        In 1971, about 800,000 people or 47% of the total population of
1.728 million were employed in the agricultural sector. The high proportion
of agricultural population is partly due to the underdevelopment of the
industrial sector and the lack of alternative employment opportunities.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
6.        Macedonia's GNP amounted in 1971 to ND 9.538 billion (US$560 million),
to which agriculture and forestry contributed ND 2.675 billion (US$156 million)
or 28.1%. During the 1966-1970 period, the economy grew at a rate of 4.5%
annually, while the agricultural sector's growth amounted to 3.8% per annum.
Within the agricultural sector, development has varied. The largest growth
has been accomplished in fruit and wine production (10.5% annually), while
growth rates of traditional crops have been less impressive (1.4% annually).
Crop farming is still more important than livestock farming, with farmers on
average getting 55% of their cash incomes from crop sales and only 45% from
sales of livestock products.
Organizatioi of the Agricultural Sector
7.        Macedonia's land tenure system is characterized by 160,000 private
farms. About 7,500 farmers belong to farmers' cooperatives of wnich there
are about 170. Due to legal restrictions limiting maximum size of private
farms to 10 ha of arable land and traditional inheritance customs (splitting
farm units equally among children), the average holding is only 3.0 ha.
The total arable land held by private farms is about 470,000 ha or about 80%
of the overall total.
8.        The social sector consists mainly of agro-business enterprises
(combinats), of which Macedonia has 25, usually consisting of organizations
with vertical integration of production and processing.  Their industries
deal especially with wheat, sugar and wine processing. Combinat land - about
20% of the total arable land in Macedonia - usually has been acquired through
reclamation of swamps and flooded areas, expropriation of estates from big
landowners and lots bought from private farms. Due to efficient management,
the social sector's annual growth of output amounted to 8.4% during the
1966-1970 period. The private sector's growth during the same period reached
only 2.3% per annum.
Land Use
9.        Out of Macedonia's total area of 2.571 million ha, 1.367 million
ha or 53% are classified agricultural lands. The remainder is forest and
waste land. About 50% of the agricultural lands is permanent pastures
(689,000 ha), about 43% is arable (583,000 ha) and the rest is orchards,
vineyards and meadows (see Table 1).
10.       About 53% of the arable land is devoted to cereal production
(305,000 ha), followed by industrial crops (65,000 ha), vegetables (51,000
ha) and forage crops (29,000 ha). Vineyards have been planted on about
26,000 ha and orchards on 20,000 ha.  During the past 10 years, cereal
hectarage decreased by more than 18%, while hectarage devoted to industrial
crops and vegetables increased by 16% and 46% respectively. Permanent pas-
tures and meadows/leys decreased during the same period by about 16%.
.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Agricultural Crops
11.       Average crop yields are low (see Table 2), mainly due to insufficient
rainfall.  Average yields of the private sector are generaLly below those ob-
tained by the social sector, mainly due to a lack of technical experience and
limited use of modern inputs. This difference becomes most apparent in irri-
gated agriculture where the social sector is obtaining yields which compare
favorably with other countries while the private sector yields are up to 50%
lower.
12.       Macedonia produces a variety of agricultural crops.  Its most
important cereals (total annual production about 560,000 tons) are wheat,
maize and barley. In volume, the next most important crop is vegetables
with an annual production of about 440,000 tons. Industrial crops, such as
sugarbeets, tobacco and cotton account for about 219,000 tons annually.
Annual grape production is about 182,000 tons followed by other fruits with
112,000 tons.
13.       Wheat, barley and maize account for the bulk of cereal production.
Although hectarage has been reduced from the 1961-65 average of 256,000 ha
to 237,000 ha in 1970, production increased from 399,000 tons (1961-65 average)
to 478,000 tons in 1970. Average yields are still lower in Macedonia than for
the country as a whole (Macedonia 1.87 tons/ha, Yugoslavia 2.15 tons/ha), but
production is growing at a faster rate than in other parts of Yugoslavia.
14.       Production of vegetables, both fresh and for processing, is of great
importance to the private agricultural sector. In 1970 production reached
134,000 tons melons, 91,000 tons tomatoes, 82,000 tons potatoes, 80,000 tons
peppers and 44,000 tons onions. Macedonia accounts for about 30% of Yugos-
lavia's tomato and green pepper production. Other vegetables produced include
peas, beans, cucumbers, cabbages, leeks and eggplants. Despite favorable cli-
matic conditions, Macedonia has only a two to three week advantage in early
vegetable and fruit production over its competitors within the country. No
apparent advantages exist in regard to international competition from coun-
tries like Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria.
15.       All the industrial crops (sugarbeets, tobacco, sunflower and cotton)
are processed and marketed by the combinats, although most of these crops ex-
cept sugarbeet are grown by the private sector.
16.       Sugarbeet production started in Macedonia only in 1959 with the
installation of a sugar mill at Bitola. Hectarage under sunarbeet is about
4,400 ha, mainly farmed by combinats. Total sugarbeet output reached 165,000
tons in 1970 with an average sugar content of almost 20%. Due to concentrat-
ing production on the combinats' irrigated lands, average yields of about
37.7 tons/ha are the highest in the country.
17.       Macedonia grows about 50% of Yugoslavia's total production of
oriental tobacco and about 70% of production is exported. In 1970 about



ANNEX 1
Page 4
29,000 ha were under tobacco and total production was about 24,000 tons
dried leaf.  Production is primarily in the hands of private farmers who
sell to the social sector for processing. Rowever, in recent years, trends
in world demand for oriental tobacco have shown indications of a decline.
As a result, the planners in Macedonia are eneouraging the production of
Virginia-type over oriental types in those areas where water is available.
However, Virginia tobacco requires mechanical drying, while oriental tobacco
is, at present, mainly sun-dried. Since tobacco growing is the main occu-
pation of a large number of private farmers in Macedonia, efforts must be
made (by the provision of drying units, etc.) to revitalize and reorganize
the industry to meet world trade and domestic demands. The prices of botn
Virginia and oriental tobacco have remained stable in recent years.
18.       Due to low producer prices during the past years, sunflower pro-
duction was limited to about 14,000 ha in 1970 and the total output of sun-
flower seed produced was about 16,000 tons, with the social and the private
sectors each producing about equal quantities. A drastic producer price
increase (44%) announced in early 1972 will offer an adequate incentive to
hectarage expansion.  Due to the price increase, net returns on sunflower
production will improve and make it a more interesting crop than cereals,
especially maize.
19.       Macedonia's cotton production reached about 12,000 tons of seed
cotton in 1970 but yields are low because of climatic conditions. Macedonia
represents the most northern part of the cotton growing area in the world
and conditions are not favorable. The medium staple fiber is produced and
it finds a ready market in the country.
20.       Grapes are another important agricultural commodity.  Production,
both in terms of area and yields, increased about 8Z per year between 1969
and 1971.  In 1971 about 174,000 tons of grapes were marketed, of which about
one-third were sold as table grapes.  At present, the annua-l per capita con-
sumption of table grapes in Yugoslavia is about 12 kg. The major outlet for
table grapes is the domestic market and only about 3-5% of total production
has been exported in recent years, mainly to Austria and West Germany. The
major producing season is from late July to October, which coincides with that
of other major table grape - producing European countries. However, for
climatic reasons, the table grapes produced in Macedonia are of an excellent
quality and taste and Macedonia has the potential of increasing its share of
exports to Europe. Both domestic and export prices of table grapes have in
- cent years recorded slight increases and this trend is expected to continue
in the future. Macedonia has the potential of increasing the production of
table grapes both from the market and supply points of view and hence efforts
should be made to increase production in the future.
21.       In 1971, about 127,000 tons of wine grapes were produced by the
social sector (50,000 tons) and the private sector (77,000 tons) from which
about 60 million 1 of wine were made. Wine quality of a substantial part
of the production is not satisfactory, mainly because of a lack of blending
and storage facilities.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
22.       Among fruits produced, apples are the most important with 49,800
tons picked in 1970 followed by plum-prunes 30,100 tons, pears 12,900 tons,
peaches 5,400 tons and apricots 4,800 tons. Other fruits produced locally in-
clude cherries, sour cherries and quince. Production is mainly in the hands
of private farmers although combinats are now establishing apple and pear
plantations on a large scale.
Livestock
23.       As a result of the rising standard of living, the consumption of
beef in Yugoslavia of about 8.1 kg per person is expected to increase.
Similarly, the world demand for meat is also rising and in recent years there
has been a shortage of meat leading to a rise in international prices.
24.       In Macedonia, total beef production in 1971 was about 5,000 tons.
The per capita consumption of fresh beef was about 4.7 kg which was well below
the national average. Similarly Macedonia was also below tae national average
in per capita consumption of pork meat and other fresh and processed meats.
However, as projected in Macedonia's present five-year plan, the per capita
consumption of both meat and dairy products is expected to increase signi-
ficantly (an income elasticity of 0.85 for meat is calculated) and therefore
a greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the production of both meat
*        and dairy products to meet increased domestic and export demands.
25.       In 1971 there were about 288,000 head of cattle, mostly for milk
production, of which some 272,000 belonged to private farmers. However, the
social sector, with better breeding stock and improved technology, had a
much higher production yield (about 4,000 kg milk per cow) than the private
farmers (about 1,200 kg per cow) and is now expanding its herds rapidly.
In order to improve quality and increase production, a govern.ment - subsidized
artificial insemination service is now available to cow owners.
26.       Between 1966 and 1970, pig production in Macedonia varied between
101,000 and 83,000 head, which is normal for this industry. The 1971 in-
ventory was 106,000 head with about 78% of these in the private sector.
However, six combinates have already established new pig farms and it is
expected that production will double within the next few years. The 1970
production of pork was 5,000 tons.
27.       In Yugoslavia, sheep numbers have been declining since 1968, with
Macedonia showing a similar trend. In 1970, Macedonia had 1,863,000 sheep.
- about 21% of the Yugoslav sheep population. Sheep milk production was
39,000 tons and production of lamb and mutton was 8,000 tons. About 81% of
Macedonian sheep are owned by individual farmers.
28.       Large units, requiring a high degree of technical skill, charac-
terize the vertically integrated poultry operations of the combinats. Pro-
duction per hen is much above the farm flock in the private sector.  The
_        social sector has increased numbers from 262,000 to 638,000 between 1965 to
1970 and is continuing to expand, while private farmers have reduced poultry
numbers from 1,828,000 to 1,498,000. Production in Macedonia reached 216
million eggs and 2,000 tons of poultry meat in 1970.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
Fish Production
29.       The present production of fish in Macedonia is 911 tons (mainly
carp), which does not cover its consumption of about 3,900 tons. The present
per capita consumption of 2.3 kg is expected to rise to 2.7 kg by 1975. It
appears that an increase in production will be necessary in order to meet
increased levels of demand both in Macedonia and in other parts of the country.
Macedonia has suitable climatic conditions for the production of fresh water
fish and technology has already been developed which would permit further
increases in production without difficulty.
Marketing and Pricing
30.       Agricultural products in Macedonia are marketed through several
channels depending upon availability and pricing. The private sector may
sell its production directly to village or urban markets, either individually
or collectively. Alternatively, they may sell to cooperatives and combinats
who may process the primary products or market them fresh through their own
sales organization or other marketing enterprises as they do with their own
production. Some combinats and cooperatives have their own wholesale-retail
distribution systems (cold storage, warehouses, transport and retail outlets)
which may cover other republics and provinces. For export of some commodities,
the Federal and Republican Governments provide an organizational framework
to coordinate and control marketing.  Social sector enterprises in some cases            S
have their representatives in major export markets.
31.       Prices for agricultural products are determined by a mix of market
forces and governmental controls. These partial controls include: i) guar-
anteed support prices on, for example, wheat and rice; ii) minimum sale
prices for sunflower seeds, sugar beets, etc.; iii) ceiling prices on bread,
milk and sugar; and iv) subsidies of about 15X in certain circumstances on,
e.g., milk. Despite the above, many of these controls have no real effect,
as commodities are above support or minimum prices. Moreover, the trend has
been away from price controls and towards a free market; meat, for example,
has been completely de-controlled. Consumer prices are, for the great ma-
jority of products, set freely in the market, with reference to international
prices as well.
Irrigation
32.       In 1972 about 60,000 ha were under irrigation, as indicated in
the table below which summarizes existing and proposed irrigation project
areas:

33.       Surface irrigation is practiced on about 50,000 ha, while sprinkler
irrigation systems are used on about 10,000 ha of the presently irrigated area.
Construction of new or extended irrigation systems is underway on 49,200 ha.
Financing for these works has been arranged by the agencies concerned and the
Republic of Macedonia. Engineering studies have been completed on another
114,000 ha and it has been estimated by Macedonian consulting engineers in
the irrigation field that approximately 117,500 ha in addition to that men-
tioned already, could be irrigated.
34.       Eighty-eight percent of the presently-irrigated land (and 90% of
the total estimated irrigable land) is within the Vardar River Basin. The
Vardar drains southward into Greece and thence to the Aegean Sea. It is
known as the Axios River in Greece. Slightly over 6% of the land irrigated
now is in the drainage area of the Strumeshitsa River, which flows into
Bulgaria and thence to Greece and the Aegean Sea. Another 3% is tributary
to the Crni Drim, which drains north and west into the Adriatic Sea via
Albania, and the remaining 3% of the land irrigated is in the Lake Prespa
Basin which is landlocked with no surface outlet to any ocean or sea.

35.       The importance of the Vardar-Axios River Basin to both Yugoslavia
and Greece has caused the establishment by UNDP of a special study team
working in Macedonia and Greece to develop recommendations for an overall
master development plan for the stream system. Hydroelectric power, domestic
and industrial water supply and irrigation, and other water uses will be
considered. This study will be completed by 1976.
Supporting Services
36.       The social sector usually purchases all input requirements from
state enterprises or imports directly. The private sector can buy its re-
quirements such as seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and machinery at the exist-
ing 150 cooperatives or receive them from combinats or other state enter-
prises. Combinats having contracts with farmers for the production of veg-
etables, fruits, or industrial crops, usually supply services with required
inputs under the terms of the agreement.
37.       The combinats produce certified seed of good quality.  Part of the
vegetable seeds and vines for planting are imported, mainly from the USA,
the Netherlands and Italy. Fertilizer consumption is low due to small yield
responses as a consequence of the dry climate. While Yugoslavia's social
sector as a whole applied about 110 kg nutrients per ha in 1969, Macedonia's
combinats used only 40 kg per ha, with the bulk going to irrigated lands.
Private farms applied only 10 kg nutrients per ha in 1969.  All fertilizer
is produced in Yugoslavia. Use of pesticides is common practice in both
sectors, especially for protecting vineyards.
38.       Farm mechanization is still at a lower level in Macedonia than in
other republics of the Federation. In 1969 there were 5.3 tractors per
1,000 ha in Macedonia compared with 6.7 tractors per 1,000 ha for the country
as a whole. The use of combines has increased and in 1969 there were 5.3
combines per 1,000 ha in Macedonia compared to 8.0 per 1,000 ha as national
average.
39.       Contracting services to private farmers are provided by combinats
and cooperatives. Some private farmers have also gone into contracting
services, thereby making best use of equipment which would otherwise be too
expensive for their own small holdings.
40.       Until about six months ago, there were no Govern.2nt extension
services available in Macedonia. Combinats and cooperatives employ large
numbers of university graduates, agronomists and technicians who keep in
close contact with the agricultural university at Skopje and the various
research institutes, but this assistance to private farmers has not been
significant. The private sector, lacking adequate technical assistance,
is therefore still following outdated cultivation or livestock raising
techniques and is making little use of modern inputs.

41.       The importance of agricultural research for the further development
of the sector has been recognized by Government, which is supporting a num-
ber of highly specialized institutes. Work on basic research has been
assigned to the agricultural university at Skopje, while applied research
is handled by autonomous specialized institutes. The Agricultural Research
Institute, Skopje, with a substation at Bitola covers agronomic aspects of
cereal and vegetable production. Other research organizations are the Wine
Research Institute, engaged in vineyard and wine production research; the
Rice Station, Kocani; the Tobacco Institute, Prilep; the Cotton Institute,
Strumica; the Vegetable Oil Section, Titov Veles; the Fruit Research Institute;
and other separate organizations investigating problems of livestock produc-
tion and aspects of irrigated agriculture. Applied research work is mainly
oriented towards adaptation and breeding of new high yielding varieties.
Development of new improved cultivation techniques as well as fertilizer and
plant protection trials are given high priority. All institutes are well
equipped and staffed with qualified researchers.

YUGOSLAVIA
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT - MACEDONIA
The Food Processing Industry
A. Yugoslavia
1.        In Yugoslavia, as in many countries, accurate data on food processing
are unavailable. National statistics are not recorded for home and farm-pro-
duced foods, except for animals slaughtered for meat (Table 1). Large amounts
of fresh fruit and vegetables which have undergone only minimal classification
and cleaning move through private market channels. It has been estimated that
about half of all agricultural output is marketed through organized channels
and is therefore recorded in national statistics.
2.        Volume of Processed Food Production.  Data on processed food pro-
duction, from both industrial and reported private sector sources (Table 2),
indicate increases from 1968 to 1970 in most items that may be categorized
*       as having a relatively high value added.  They include:  bread and pastry,
biscuits and cookies, canned vegetables, other vegetable preparations, semi-
prepared and prepared foods, fresh meat, bacon and sausages, canned meat,
canned fish, margarine, edible oil, and alcoholic beverages. At the same
time, declining production was recorded for items exhibiting a lower value
added, including: rice, various fruit preparations, concer-rated soup, edible
animal fats, smoked and salted cured fish, butter, sugar and candy. Federal
Government data on the growth of Yugoslavia's food industry, using an index
with 1969 physical volume = 100, show 1968 = 92 and 1970 =111 (Table 3).
3.        Value of Processed Food Production.  The total value of processed
foods increased by over 50% between 1967 and 1970, when it was calculated at
over 22,000 million dinars (US$1.3 billion). This figure, however, includes
double accounting since the data for many raw materials such as flour and
vegetable oil appear again in the finished product. The greatest gains in
value (Table 4) were shown by: milk and eggs, preserved fruit and vege-
tables, preserved meats, meats, and the category "other food industries"
(e.g. yeast, coffee, glucose).  Within these categories, significant increases
were scored for fresh pork, lamb and mutton, bacon, canned meats, fruit syrup,
natural fruit juice, canned vegetables, dry baked goods and alcoholic bev-
erages. Except for fresh meat, these products again represent a relatively
high value added.
4.        Exports and Imports.  Exports of Yugoslavian processed foods are
significantly higher than imports, both in quantitative and value terms.
In 1970, meat exports totalled 127,000 tons (of which fresh meat 71,200
tons and canned meats 25,400 tons), processed fruit 44,200 m tons and
processed vegetables 12,500 m tons. Due to domestic shortages, however,
fresh meat exports were sharply curtailed in 1972. The major destinations



ANNEX 2
Page 2
of processed meat in 1970 were Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany,
with the United States taking a significant quantity of canned pork and
canned beef. Export data indicate a general diversity of small exports for
the other food products rather than a concentration on a limited number of
products exported in large quantities.
5.        Imports of processed fruits and vegetables in 1970 were about
13,000 m tons, primarily products such as fruit salad, pineapple, canned
tomatoes, pickled cucumbers and sauerkraut. Only 62 m tons of canned meats
and 440 m tons of sausage and other cured meats were imported.
6.        Processing Plants.  In 1970, there were in the social sector about
230 industrial enterprises which produced almost 900 million m tons of food
and 665,000 1 of beer for a total turnover of some 14,600 million dinars
(US$860 million). Among these social industrial enterprises were 77 abattoirs,
42 fruit and vegetable processing plants, 22 edible oil factories, 13 sugar
refineries and 28 breweries.
7.        Additionally, Yugoslavia has four metal can-making factories, none
of which are located in Macedonia, and three glass jar and hottlemaking facili-
ties, one of which is in Macedonia. The gross capacity of rijth industries
is sufficient to supply present and projected needs in the country. There
are also factories that manufacture laminations for flexible and semi-rigid
plastic, paper/plastic, paper/aluminum and foil/plastic packaging of thermally
stabilized food products.
8.        Meat Processing.  Over half the 18 million cattle, pigs and sheep
slaughtered in 1971 were slaughtered privately. The remainder were slaughtered
in about 1,700 abattoirs of which about 90 are industrial slaughterhouses,
about 400 small plants operated by enterprises and cooperatives and about
1,200 small private butcher shops. Lack of sanitary facilities, sufficient
space and adequate cooling capacity is a major problem throughout the industry,
particularly in the smaller plants. About 60 facilities are licensed for
export of one or more items.  Only eight have U.S. Departnent of Agriculture
approval, for some meats, and 31 have approval for European :.Larkets.
9.        Utilization varies from 50% to 90% with most plants operacing in
the range of 60% to 70% capacity on a one eight-hour shift basis. Only
Vojvodina and Serbia proper have sufficient livestock available for slaughter
uniformly throughout the year. Since the livestock supply in the other
republics and provinces is seasonal, 30 to 40% of the slaughter capacity is
required only during the 100 - 120 day peak periods. Several plants are re-
ported to have installed modern equipment for processing and packaging meats,
but installation is generally poor due to failure to integrate the equipment
into the total plant operations. Consequently, processed meat manufacture
is often more labor-intensive than warranted by the equipment present. Also,
plants are generally poorly designed for efficient throughput and expansion.
10,       Fruit and Vegetable Processing.  Most fruit and vegetable processing
plants are old and oriented towards highly seasonal crops or a very limited



ANNEX 2
Page 3
line of commodities.  Annual throughput averages only about 5,000 m tons and
the capacity of the plants is substantially larger. The item with the largest
volume produced by far is fruit juice, though less than half the country's
fruit and vegetable plants manufacture it. Normal procedure after extracting the
juice is to pasteurize and bulk store it at low temperature. Only when orders
are received is it repasteurized and canned, reflecting the limited canning
and thermal processing capacities of the canneries.
11.       Edible Oil Processing.  More than half the edible oil consumed in
Yugoslavia is of vegetable origin, and around half of the 170,000 m tons of
vegetable oil produced in 1971 (Table 5) was derived from imported soybeans
or crude soybean oil. A significantly larger sunflower seee crop was expected
in 1972, thus reducing the requirements for imports.
12.       Yugoslavia has a total of 23 fat and oil plants.  Fourteen of these
plants are equipped to crush almost 660,000 m tons of sunflower seed annually
on the basis of 24-hour production for 280 days; at a 42% extraction rate
this equates to 277,000 m tons of oil. In contrast to the extraction plants,
which in 1972 were expected to be operating at approximately 55% of capacity,
the refineries have been operating at between 80% and almost 100%. Refining
capacity has been increased in 1972 to 263,000 m tons annually, and based
on this figure the present production of crude oil will absorb about 65% of
the new refining capacity. Generally, both the extraction and refining plants
are rather old, some originally having been built over 40 years ago.  Only
five plants have hydrogenation facilities to manufacture solid shortening and
only five are equipped to manufacture margarine. Approximately 30% of the
edible vegetable oil manufactured is sold for industrial and institutional
purposes.
13.       Wine Processing.  The major portion of the raw primary wines is
prepared by both private farmers and social enterprises in small facilities
near the vineyard where grapes are pressed and fermented into wine. The
major wine processors outside Macedonia - Navip, Zupaki Tubin, Vino Zupa,
Slovenija Vino, Dalmacija Vino, Vinoprodukt and Istia Vino Export - procure
bulk raw wines throughout Yugoslavia for blending, stabilizing and bottling
under their brand for domestic and export sales. Between 1966 and 1970,
total wine cellar capacity in Yugoslavia increased from 320,000 tons to
400,000 tons. Most of the added capacity was large industrial type vessels
(up to 400,000 liters) which could be used for finalizing raw wines. In 1971
the total wine production in Yugoslavia was 555,000 tons. Although the nomi-
nal wine cellar capacity had increased to 450,000 tons in 1971, the effective
capacity was about 350,000 tons (about 30% of the total wine cellar capacity
is used for transfer stock and temporary in-process storage). Yugoslavia
exported raw wine to Austria, West Germany and U.K. for blending, stabilizing
and bottling.

14.       The Republic of Macedonia contains approximately 80-100 food
processing plants producing around 300,000 tons of food plus about 200 million
1 of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. In terms of volume, Macedonian
production of processed food products represents only 7.2% of food and 3.9%
of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages produced in Yugoslavia. The
M4acedonian food processing industry enjoyed an 8% annual growth rate from
1966 to 1970. In only one category, rice, does Macedonia dominate Yugoslavian
production and in only four sectors.-- ground paprika, bread and pastry, canned
vegetables and other vegetable preparations (e.g., pickles) -- does Macedonia
produce more than 10% of Yugoslavian output. Details on Macedonia's processed
food production are given in Table 6.
15.       Meat Processing.  In both Yugoslavia and Macedonia during the period
1968 thru 1971, meat production (carcass equivalent) has been erratic as
shown in the following table:

Yugoslavia's industrial abattoirs produce only about 46% of the country's
processed meat needs. In Macedonia, industrial abattoirs with a slaughtering
capacity of about 10,000 tons produced about 30% of the Republic's meat con-
sumption; the private sector and imports contributed the remainder. The pro-
cessing plants are small and generally need more modern facilities. The
average annual production per industrial abattoir in Yugoslavia is 5,300 tons
while, in Macedonia, the average annual production is only 1,100 tons.  Three
of Macedonia's slaughterhouses are registered to export meat to all European
markets except the U.K.: Klanica so ladilnik in Skopje, PK Strumica in Strumica
(lamb only) and Gorni Polog in Gostivar (lamb only).  In addition to the in-
dustrial slaughterhouses, Macedonia also has about 30 very small abattoirs
which only slaughter for local markets. Macedonia lacks sanitary and efficient
meat processing facilities which are large enough to economically produce the
product mix necessary to supply domestic demand for fresh meat cuts, canned
and cured meat products as well as sausages. In order to export canned pork
and beef products to the U.S. and the U.K., canning facilities have to meet
rigid sanitary standards which the one existing plant that has a canning line
does not satisfy. With the increase in cattle and pig production projected
without the project, by 1980 Macedonia would have a deficit industrial                    0



ANNEX 2
Page 5
slaughtering capacity of 11,000 tons; with production as a result of the
project, this deficit would increase to 15,300 tons. Thus, the additional
processing capacity proposed as part of the project is urge.tly required
(Annex 9). In 1971, due to the lack of adequate slaughtering capacity,
Macedonia exported live animals valued at about US$ 4.8 million rather than
value added processed meat products.
16.       Fruit and Vegetable Processing.  Fruit and vegetable processing
facilities in Macedonia are generally small and inefficient. Despite the
presence of some modern mechanized and even automated equipment, total
systems are not employed and consequently, entire lines are controlled by
the least efficient element in the line.  Factories contain large numbers
of relatively low capacity equipment in order to be capable of processing
snall quantities of many different products. Batch operation is common,
even when continuous processing equipment is present. Labor is used on
lines in place of the most elemental equipment, in sequence with automated
machinery -- i.e., lines are not completely equipped. Floor supervision
appears to be lacking, and quality of operation and product output is mediocre.
Inputs are neither well-handled nor closely controlled and scheduling of
raw material appears to be a major factor contributing to the low efficiency.
Handling of the finished goods is generally manual leading to damaged packages
_        and consequent losses beyond line inefficiencies.
17.       Macedonian fruit and vegetable processing facilities might be
described as operating on a hand-to-mouth basis responding to immediate de-
mands of agricultural production or of a specific customer with only secondary
regard for processing operations or for non-food input or final product output
inventorying and logistics. Because of a lack of adequate bottling facilities,
fruit juices are extracted, concentrated, pasteurized and nacked in small bulk
containers for storage until time is available on the packaging line. The
concentrate is then reconstituted, packaged and repasteurized, thus downgrading
quality. Uniform procedures appear to be applied for preparing all natural
juices, thus leading to a loss of character identity in the final product.
Fruit for jams appears to be handled in much the same manner with the textural
contrasts characteristic of European jams being totally absent from the
Macedonian products. Despite the presence of some thermal processing equip-
ment, overprocessing is the rule to assure safety. Although not clean by
European standards, fruit and vegetable processing operations appear to be
satisfactory from a sanitary standpoint.
18.       Six vegetable processing factories are listed in Macedonia and three
also process fruits. Average annual production from these plants in 1970 was
2,500 tons of canned vegetables, 265 tons of "other processed vegetables", 230
tons of fruit semi-preparations without sugar, 390 tons of fruit preparations
without sugar, 220 tons of fruit preparations with sugar and 690 tons of
natural fruit juices for a total average, for those plants producing all
products, of 4,290 tons. On a countrywide basis, average annual factory out-
put in 1970 was just over 5,000 tons.
19.       The largest fruit and vegetable processing factory in Macedonia is
Konservaexport located in Skopje. Konservaexport has a maiximum plant capacity



ANNEX 2
Page 6
of 13,800 tons per year of processed fruit and vegetable products, but has
an actual output of only 6,000 to 8,000 tons. This output is divided among
some 50 products with fruit and vegetable juices accounting for about a third
of the volume. The factory packs canned vegetables, pickles, tomato concen-
trate, jams, etc. About 20% of the production is exported, mostly peppers
and pickled products to Germany and Austria. The Grocka-Tetova plant is re-
ported to have an annual capacity of about 12,000 tons but has an output of
only 8,000 tons, principally vegetable products such as peppers, ajvar and
beans. The Zora-Gevgelija operation is reported to have an annual capacity
of 5,500 tons and production is estimated at less than 4,000 tons, primarily
tomato concentrate, peppers and other indigenous Yugoslavian foods. Zik-
Strumica has a capacity of 7,000 tons a year with an output and oroduct mix
very similar to that of Zora-Gevgelija. Bitola-Pelagonia is reported to have
an annual capacity of about 4,500 tons with production being less than 3,000
tons, mainly tomato concentrate, pickles and fruit compotes. The Gradinar-Ohrid
factory has a capacity of 1,500 tons per year for pickles, green peas, peppers,
beans and tomato concentrate. This plant did not operate i. 1971, however, due
to a shortage of raw material. In addition to these operat_ as, Kumanova pro-
duces the Sinalco soft drink under license from a German franchiser and the
Zik-Povardarie-Negotina wine cellar produces Tika, a fortified natural grape
drink, in its wine-bottling operation. The estimated capacity of the six
fruit and vegetable processing plants in Macedonia is about 44,000 to 45,000
tons annually. With an actual output of 26,000 tons, the factories are operating
at about 60% of capacity.
20.       Edible Oil Processing.  A single edible vegetable oil processing
plant, Prehrana, is in operation in Macedonia in Titov Veles. The plant was
originally built over 40 years ago and much of the crushing equiprent dates
back to prior to World Wiar II. Solvent extraction equipment, however, is
relatively sew and the refinery has been reequipped in the last several years.
The extraction plant and refinery report an output capacity  v,f 22,400 tons
of sunflower seed oil per year based on 24-hour-a-day extra cLion, 280 days
a year. With 1970 output at 17,258 tons the plant operated at about 77%
capacity. 1/  The plant has a new automatic packaging line for one14lter re-
turnable glass bottles, which is the standard consumer package in -much of the
country. The bulk line, however, is still very much manual despite being
houised in the new packaging building.
21.       In addition to the edible oil operation, Prehrana devotes a re-
modeled portion of the plant to the production of margarine in 150-g consumer
packages. Margarine output capacity is approximately one ton per hour on
relatively modern equipment. The plant uses very little of its fat and oil
otutput as raw material for margarine manufacture because it has no hydrogena-
tion capability. Management reported importing about 350 tons of hydrogenated
oil from Norway in 1971 for the manufacture of margarine.
1/ A plant in Urosevac, only 120 km distant andJust across the border in
Serbia, operated at only 63% capacity in 1971, processing both sunflower
seed and crude soya oil.

22.       Wine Processing.  In Macedonia, grape pressing and primary wine
fermentation facilities are generally small and lacking in sanitation and
technical expertise for producing quality wines. Most of the primary pro-
ducers belong to a cooperative enterprise (Makedonia Vino) which markets the
wines to processors in Yugoslavia and to importers in Austria, Germany, U.K.
and elsewhere. Four Macedonian raw wine producers also finalize and bottle
some of their better quality wines (about 2,000 tons yearly). Only one enter-
prise, Tikves, produces a significant quantity of finalized wine (about 12,000
tons) for domestic and export markets. Tikves' product mix has shifted from
50% bottled in 1969 to 70% in 1971, reflecting the increased demand for
finished and bottled wines. About 35% of Tikves' cellar capacity of 22,000
tons is required for processing finished wines, liquors and non-alcoholic
beverages. Due to the lack of an adequate sanitary and efficient central wine
cellar facility, the majority (65%) of the primary raw wines produced by the
private and social sector in Macedonia is marketed in bulk for processing out-
side the Republic.

Financial and Institutional Aspects
A. Background
Central Banking Policy
1.        The Yugoslavian banking system, which was revised early in 1972,
now has separate national banks which act as central banks in each of the
six republics and two autonomous regions, together with over 70 business
banks. Each national bank is free to determine its own sectoral priorities
and allocate its share of the funds.
2.        The 1972 revision included several ad hoc measur_s to increase the
regulatory role of the national banks and improve the position of business
banks. Stricter penalties are now imposed on any business bank unable to
meet its financial obligations, including limitation of credit expansion for
a specified period. Business banks are affected by measures designed to
force creditors to bear the full burden of risk, and debtors to assume full
responsibility for their obligations. Separate long- and short-term balance
sheets for business banks are no longer required, leaving them free to manage
their funds subject only to liquidity criteria specified by the Federal
National Bank. To encourage further private savings, the recent ceiling on
interest rates has been abolished.
The Business Banks
3.        The business banks consist of investment, commercial and "mixed"
(combined investment and commercial) banks. They are controlled by the
economic and socio-political organizations that have invested in their fixed
capital. Any group of such organizations may establish a bank, subject to
federal minimum capital requirements. Each participant is represented in
the bank's Assembly in proportion to its contribution to the bank's initial
capital. The Assembly is the bank's highest administrative organ, and must
have a minimum of 25 members, each having at least one vote. The maximum
voting power of any one participant is 10% of the total. A special voting
quota in the Assembly is reserved for the bank's staff, and is fixed in
the bank's constitution. The Assembly appoints a Board of Management and a
Managing Director to supervise the bank's day-to-day business. Requests for
loans are decided by a Loan Committee, consisting of members of the bank's
staff, in accordance with regulations approved by the AssembtIy. Participants
in the bank's capital are entitled to a share in the profits. There are no
legal provisions for the withdrawal of a capital contribution, but its rights
are transferable. Further capital subscriptions with proportional voting
rights may be made at any time, and the rights are recalculated annually.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        A bank's resources consist of:  its capital; sight, time and
savings deposits; funds acquired through bond issues and other securities;
government investment resources; and borrowings from the National Bank
and from abroad. Time deposits are 'usually made under a contract for a
minimum of three months, while some give the depositor voting rights in the
Assembly. Sight deposits come from economic and socio-political organizations,
while savings deposits come mainly from the public.  Savings deposits and
interest on them are exempt from taxes, and guaranteed by the Federal Govern-
ment. Bond issues, and trade in them, are regulated at federal level. State
investments are generally channeled through the investment sections of the
banks, with the government (federal or republic) retaining the right to
allocate them for specific sectors or individual projects.  Commercial banks
(and some economic organizations) are now permitted to borrow direct from
abroad, subject to regulations, and twenty operate foreign exchange departments.
Short-term rediscounting through the national banks, although subject to a
number of conditions and limitations, is available to all business banks.
5.        The share of state-generated savings in total savings has declined
from an average of 36% for 1960-64 to 21% in 1966 and 15% in 1970. The share
of the social sector increased from about 52% in 1960-64 to about 61% in 1968,
but declined to about 55% in 1970, due almost entirely to pressure on self-
managed enterprises to distribute more of their surplus in incomes. The
share of private sector savings increased from about 9% ir; 1960-64 to about
27% in 1966-70. Continuing efforts to mobilize private savings are necessary
to maintain the overall savings rate, and the recent abolition of the interest
ceiling on them has increased their attraction.
Resource Allocation
6.        The state's former role in mobilizing and allocating resources has
largely been taken over by the banks. During 1960-64, state financing
accounted for about 56% of total investment resources in the social sector,
but it declined to 15% in 1970. In the same period the share of investment
banks increased from 10% to 52%.
7.        The main channel for transferring resources to the underdeveloped
regions is the Federal Fund for the Accelerated Development of Less Developed
Republics and Regions (FFAD). The responsibility for financing it has re-
centl. been transferred from the Federal Government to the republics, which
nov have to find their own share of the total.  Each republic's quota is met
by compulsory loans from economic enterprises within it. These are passed
on to the FFAD as long-term loans over 15 years at 4% annual interest, and
relent to designated banks in the underdeveloped regions at 4.5%, the ad-
ditional 0.5% being a service charge levied by the FFAD. Previously, alloc-
ations from the Fund were grants to designated banks for on-lending to social
enterprises. The assets arising out of past grants from the Fund have been
transferred to the republics benefitting from them.

8.        A major objective of IBRD's current lending program in Yugoslavia
is acceleration of development in the less developed regions including
Macedonia, particularly through improved resource allocation. By increasing
interest rates to subborrowers (para 45), the proposed project would con-
tribute to this objective.
Banking Statistics
9.        Table 1 gives a summary of the consolidated balance sheets of all
banks in Yugoslavia at the end of the three years 1966, 1968 and 1970. Total
assets increased by over 40%, from ND 148 billion in 1966 to ND 212 billion
in 1970. Short-term and investment loans outstanding increased by over 60%,
from ND 106 billion in 1966 to ND 173 billion in 1970. The proportion of
investment loans in this total declined from 74% in 1966 to 61% in 1970. Over
the same period, savings and time deposits more than doubled.
10.       Voting rights held by the various types of organizations in the
banks' Assemblies at the end of 1970 were as follows:
Organization        Yugoslavia         Macedonia        Slovenia
------p-____------ per cent ---------- --
Economic                64.8               48.5             79.6
Socio-political         18.7              28.4              11.3
Others                  16.5               23.1              9.1
Total        100.0             100.0            100.0
In Macedonia, the share held by economic organizations is the lowest in the
country, and by socio-political organizations the highest. However, the
share held by economic organizations is increasing each year. The situation is
similar in other less developed regions, and contrasts with that in Slovenia,
the most developed republic.
11.       The total number of employees in business banks was almost 20,000
at the end of 1970, of which 1,200 (or about 6%) were in Macedonian banks.
The average monthly salary received per bank employee in 1970 was about ND
1,480 for Yugoslavian banks as a whole, and about ND 1,440 for Macedonian
banks.
The Accounting System
12.       Yugoslav financial principles for economic enterprises differ from
those generally applied in non-socialist countries in the concept of ownership,
priority of obligations, and disposition of net income. They do, however,
recognize the need to generate from revenue sufficient cash to cover all
operating expenses (including depreciation), to provide funds for debt service
and additional investments in enterprises and in social facilities for the
*           workers.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
13.       The current federal law on the Accounting of Working Organizations
became effective on January 1, 1969. While it does little more than oblige
every enterprise to keep an accurate set of business records using double-
entry bookkeeping methods, it severely limits the former legal authority
of both regional and central governments to call for accounts and reports.
Its primary purpose is to provide information to the management of each
enterprise to enable it to make decisions and exercise intetnal controls,
but it also provides limited information to the state. The fiscal year for
all enterprises coincides with the calendar year, but inventories do not
necessarily have to be checked on December 31, although an annual check is
mandatory.
14.       All accounts have to be kept in a form laid down by law.  The basic
outline contains about 170 control accounts, all coded, and these have to be
followed by all enterprises. The outline can only be changed by amending
the law. Nobody outside the enterprise has any legal authority to call for
any additional information, except the court during an official investigation.
Individual enterprises may subdivide any of the 3-figure coded accounts to
suit their own purpose, but must make out all reports in the official form
only.
15.       Accounts are not audited in the strict sense of the term, but are
verified once a year by the Social Accounting Service (SAS), and examined by
it in greater detail at irregular intervals of between one and three years.
The main purpose of the verification is to examine whether the financial
transactions comply with Yugoslav law.  Discussions are currently underway
among IBRD, UNDP and the Federal Government whereby 20 officers of the SAS
would be trained in international auditing principles. When qualified, these
officers would be used in the first instance to assist in auditing the accounts
of organizations and projects for which IBRD has provided finance.
Interest Rates
16.       As a result of the lifting of the ceiling on interest rates at
the beginning of 1972, mainly as an inducement to private savings, average
annual rates at business banks on deposits, which were formerly 6% to 8%,
have now increased to 7% on sight, 9% on 1 to 2 years, and 10% on more than
2 years. The rate at which the regional central banks will at present redis-
count short-term paper from the business banks averages about 6%. The rates
at ,1Ji   business banks on-lend to borrowers depend mainly on their source of
funas, but are generally 1 to 1-1/2% above the rates they pay on borrowed
funds. Lending rates vary considerably, but average from around 5% for long-
term development projects using state funds, up to about 11% for short-term
commercial loans. Rates for agriculture are discussed below.

B. Finance for Agriculture
Background
17.       The various types of agricultural enterprises are described else-
where in this report (Annex 1). Agro-industrial enterprises (combinats
and cooperatives) obtain their finance through the business banks. Through
various forms of cooperation with combinats or cooperatives, private farmers
obtain finance, goods and services such as seeds and fertilizer, sales and
marketing.
18.       The most widespread cooperation between private farmers and the
social sector is in the supply of services, such as land preparation, harvest-
ing, threshing, transport, and sometimes seasonal inputs, by agro-combinats
and cooperatives. Most services are given as a seasonal credit, with payment
in goods or cash at harvest. Thus, the social enterprises frequently serve
as processors or marketers of private farm products. The combinats usually
lay down technical standards. Under various joint production arrangements,
some combinats occasionally supply limited long-term credit to private farmers
for on-farm development.
Sector Finance
19.       Agriculture's share of total investment in Yugoslavia for the three
years 1967 through 1969 was as follows:
1967        1968          1969
---------- percent ----------
Economic
Agriculture                8.6          7.4           8.0
All other sectors         66.0         67.0          66.0
Subtotal    74.6         74.4          74.0
Socio-political                25.4         25.6          26.0
Total      100.0        100.0         100.0
20.       Over the three years, agricultural investment averaged 8% of total
investment or 11% of all economic investment. Most agricultural loans were
for planting or replanting of tree crops, land purchase and improvement, and
modernization and new capacity for agro-industries. They ranged from 30% to
60% of total project cost, depending on the nature of the project and the
policies of the lending bank. Loans for land purchase were usually repayable
in up to 20 years, but for most other purposes between 5 and 15 years, de-
pending on the financial return of the project.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
21.       Over the past five years, about three-fourths of all agricultural
investment has been in the social, and only one-fourth in the private sector.
In the social sector, about two-fifths has been for land, planting, replanting
and factory construction, and about one-third for equipment and its installa-
tion. About one-seventh of private sector investment has been for equipment
over this period.
22.       By far the largest source of investment finance for the agricultural
sector is the Yugoslav Agricultural Bank, Belgrade. Over the period 1966-71,
62% of its total investment credits disbursed were in the agricultural sector:
39% crops and livestock, 21% agro-industries, and 2% forestry. This was about
one-third of all agricultural investment during the period. At the end of
1971, its total resources were about ND 15.7 billion (of which fixed capital
was about 27%), making it the fifth largest bank in Yugoslavia.
Interest Rates
23.       The current interest rate policies of business banks have been
discussed above (para 16). Prior to the beginning of 1972, rates for agricul-
tural loans were subsidized by the Federal Government. For short-term loans,
the borrower paid 3%, the Government 5%, and the lending bank thus received
8%. On longer term loans, the Government gave a 3% subsidy, provided the bank
charged a maximum of 6% to the borrower, the bank thus receiving 9% maximum.
24.       From January 1, 1972, subsidized interest rates became the respon-
sibility of the separate republics and regions, and policy varies in each.
In Macedonia, the Government has made a clear distinction between funds on-
lent from bank's own sources and those from other sources. Agricultural
investment loans made from Government funds by business banks to borrowers
in the social sector are at the following rates:
Annual %
Irrigation               3
On-farm mechanization   5
All other purposes        5.5
For irrigation loans, the Government source is usually the Macedonia Invest-
ment F nd srhich lends to banks at 2%. For the other loans the source is
the .FAD (para 7), which lends to banks at 4.5%. Investment loans made to
borrowers in the social sector by business banks from their own resources
are at the same rates as above, but the Government provides a subsidy enabl-
ing the banks to earn 8%. For investment loans to the private sector, FFAD
funds are lent to agro-combinats and cooperatives at 5.5% and on-lent to
private farmers at 6.0%-6.5%. Investment loans to the private sector made
by business banks from their own resources are channelled through agro-combi-
nats and cooperatives at 6.0% and are on-lent at 6.5% to 7.0%. These loans
are often eligible for Government subsidies of up to 6.0%, reflecting a greater
risk in lending to the private sector.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
25.       The major source of funds for short-term loans is the business
banks' own resources, the current cost of which is, on average, about 8%.
These funds are lent by banks to the social sector at 5.0%-5.5% and where
they are on-lent to private farmers, the social sector usually adds a spread
of 0.5%.
C.  The Macedonian Banks
Background
26.       Prior to their merger into a single legal and operational entity in
January 1973, the three banks listed below were registered in Macedonia:
(a) Stopanska Bank, Skopje (SBS);
(b) Commercial and Investment Bank, Skopje (CIBS); and
(c) Commercial and Investment Bank, Bitola (CIBB).
They are more fully described below. Their share of the total assets and
liabilities of all Yugoslavian banks is slightly under 9%. Between them they
conducted, and the surviving Stopanska Bank is expected to continue to do,
about 95% of all the banking business in Macedonia, the remainder being hand-
led by subsidiaries of other Yugoslav banks.
Stopanska Bank, Skopje
27.       In this Annex, the pre-merger SBS is examined in greater detail than
the other two banks, because it contains the organization which will deal with
project loans under the merged bank and is the dominant partner in the merger.
SBS' main activities over the past five years have been as an investment bank,
although more recently it has enlarged its commercial banking section, parti-
cularly to obtain a larger share of private savings, in view of their increas-
ing importance as a source of funds (para 5). Most of its investment has been
in industry, including agricultural processing. It also operates a foreign
exchange section. It had no branches outside Skopje.
28.       SBS' constitution followed that for business banks set out in para-
graph 3 above. Its Assembly had increased from 54 members at the end of 1967
to 65 at the end of 1971, made up as follows:
0

Agriculture                      9
Trading and catering             8
Communications                   4

Socio-political organizations         2
Other (including SBS staff)           4
Total                65
On the same date the Executive Board consisted of 19 members, including the
Director General of SBS and a staff representative. Its Loans Board comprised
8 senior staff members, and the Director General as Chairman. In 1971 the
Loans Board held 59 meetings covering 571 loans and related affairs. There
were 23 members on the SBS Workers' Council.
29.       The bank's business was conducted through 11 departments, three
independent groups, an internal inspectorate and a secretariat. These
included an Agriculture and Forestry Loans Department, responsible for all
loans to the agricultural sector. The independent groups were concerned with
legal affairs, engineering and technical advice, and statistics. SBS staff
position at the end of each year, by educational standard, has been as follows:
1967    1968      1969     1970      1971
University             49        56       62        61       66
College                13        15       17        18       18
Secondary              82       83        79        83       98
Other                  47        47       45        48       50
Total            191      201       203      210       232
The most noticeable increase has been among university graduates, reflecting
lie desire of SBS management to increase its own quality and effectiveness.
The increase in staff at secondary level in 1971 reflects the enlargement of
SBS commercial banking activities.
30.       The Agriculture and Forestry Loans Department is divided into four
main sections and a secretariat, as set out in the attached organigram (chart),
and is headed by a Director and an Assistant Director. The main sections are:
livestock; production (mainly cereals, vegetables and fruits); processing
(mainly food and tobacco); and irrigation. There were 20 technical staff in
these sections as of December 1972; five additional staff joined the depart-
ment as a result of the merger.  Proposals for increasing the staff to cover
project requirements are discussed in the main report.



ANNEX 3

31.       Financial data on SBS are given in Tables 2 throuigh 5.  The figures
show that of its total assets of ND 11.4 billion at the end of 1971, about
80% was invested in longer term loans (over 2 years) for industry, mining,
agriculture and communications. They also show the decline in time and sight
deposits over the past three years. However, sight deposits at June 30, 1972,
show an improvement to ND 0.50 billion, reflecting the increased effort in 1972
to attract them. The share of agriculture (including forestry and agro-
industries) in SBS' total lending program has averaged 15% over the past three
years, as follows:
1967     1968       1969      1970      1971
------ % of total loans outstanding ------
Agriculture
Investment           6.1      8.3        12.4       10.8     16.2
Short-term           na       na          2.9        1.8      1.1
na       na         15.3       12.6     17.3
Most of the investment funds for agriculture over this period have come from
the FFAD.
32.       SBS' current interest rates were fixed in January 1971, at the start
of the current five-year development plan. They are given in Table 5, which
shows that rates for agriculture are currently less than for industry and for
commerce. Over the past three years the spread on interest rates (being the
difference between interest received and interest paid out) to recover the
cost of administration (including taxes, staff emoluments and prudent reserve
allocations) has averaged about 0.8% to almost 1.0% in 1971 (Table 3). Because
of higher staff salaries and administrative costs, it is estimated to be al-
most 1.25% during the last quarter of 1972.
33.       SBS makes loans for agricultural investment only to the agro-
combinats and cooperatives within Niacedonia. Loans for irrigation are rarely
for more than 10 years, and for machinery and most other purposes are for a
maximum of five years, with grace periods where given geared to the cash flow
of the investment. In accordance with the almost universal Yugoslav banking
practice, SBS does not ask for securities (in the accepted sense of the word)
for loans made, and neither the Federal nor Republican Governments provide
guarantees. In effect, SBS relies on its own evaluation of each project,
since this includes an estimate of repayment ability. These evaluations are
thorough, and in the agricultural sector they have proved satisfactory.
The 1972 revision of the business banks (para 2) has reinforced banks' ability
to obtain redress from defaulting creditors, and this has strengthened SBS'
position. SBS investment loans overdue by more than 24 months at the end
of the last five years have averaged about 0.8% of total investment loans
outstanding each year, which is very satisfactory.

Commercial and Investment Bank, Skopje
34.       CIBS was formed in 1956 with a single office in Skopje.  After
mergers with a number of smaller banks, mostly in 1968, its operations before
the merger covered most of Macedonia through 12 branches and 17 sub-branches.
It was not very active in the Bitola area, which was more completely covered
by CIBB (below, para 38). It did far more short term and commercial banking
business than SBS, and in investment was particularly active in the tourism
and building sectors. It also operated a foreign exchange division.
35.       CIBS' constitution followed that for all business (para 3).  At the
end of 1971 its Assembly consisted of about 50 members, and the Executive
Board 23 members.  Total staff was about 850.  The Managing Director was
assisted by two deputies and one assistant, together with 10 directors of
separate departments. Summarized balance sheets, and income and expenditure
statements are given in Tables 6 and 7. With total assets of about ND 11.3
billion at the end of 1971, CIBS was about the same size as SBS.
36.       A brief summary of CIBS operations for 1969 and 1970 is given in the
following table:
1969      1970

Total approved                             2.78      3.16
These figures show that short-term credit accounted for almost 70% of CIBS
business in 1970 compared with only 28% for SBS. As with SBS, overdue loans
are low relative to the total.
.



ANNEX 3
Page 11
37.       The following table shows that CIBS paid more ir.terest on its
borrowings, and charged more for its loans than SBS.

SBS                             3.05      2.90       2.78

SBS                             2.25      2.32       1.82
CIBS                            2.49       2.33      2.53
Average spread
SBS                             0.80      0.58       0.96
CIBS                            1.39       1.59      1.46
This is mainly because it relied to a much greater extent on the relatively
expensive short-term deposits as a source of funds than does SBS. Over the
three years SBS' average spread was about 0.8% compared with CIBS 1.5%. This
was due to the more commercial nature of CIBS business, which required more
staff than SBS (850 compared to 230 at the end of 1971), and thus a greater
spread to meet costs.
Commercial and Investment Bank, Bitola
38.       CIBB was a much smaller bank than SBS and CIBS, with total assets
of about ND 1.6 billion at the end of 1971, or only about one-seventh of those
of the other two. In addition to the head office in Bitola, it had six branches
in that area. Total staff was about 170. Around one-half of its funds came
from deposits, mostly sight, and much of its business was commercial short-
term. At the end of 1971, short-term advances outstanding were slightly over
one-third of its total assets. Its interest rate policy was similar to that
of CIBS.
D. The Merger of Macedonian Banks
Background
39.       Since 1965 the trend throughout Yugoslavia for business banks to
merge has increased. CIBS merged with a number of other banks in 1968. The
merger of SBS, CIBS and CIBB carried the trend to its logical conclusion in
Macedonia, since they were the only three banks registered in the Republic,
although there is one other bank operating in it through local branches.



ANNEX 3
Page 12
This is the Bank of Yugoslavia, registered in Serbia (Belgrade), but it does
only about 5% of all banking business in the Republic. The Yugoslav Industrial
Bank and the Ytgoslav Agricultural Bank also operate in the Republic, but
mainly through association with SBS, and they have no local branches.
The Merger
40.       The three banks are complementary, and their merger will not create
any new monopoly. SBS brings to the merger its development finance expertise,
particularly in industry and agriculture, while CIBS brings in its investment
experience in tourism and building, plus its commercial banking experience in
all areas except where CIBB operates. CIBB brings in its commercial and in-
vestment bankihg experience in its operating area.
41.       The three banks merged completely to form one new legal entity
in January 19t3. Table 8 shows what the combined balance sheet would have
been had the merger taken place on January 1, 1972. The combined assets
would then have been about ND 24 billion, making it the fourth largest bank
(in terms of assets) in Yugoslavia. According to an earlier SBS' estimate,
the relative amounts of share capital brought to the merger on January 1,
1973, were to be: SBS 49%, CIBS 44%, and CIBB 7%, confirming SBS' dominance
in the merger.
42.       Apart from the addition of five technical staff from CIBS and CIBB,
the Agriculture and Forestry Loans Department would rem2ain as formerly
under SBS. Most of the organizational changes are likely to be in those
departments more closely concerned with commercial banking.
Project Interest Rates
43.       SBS and CIBS participated almost equally in the merger.  Their
spreads, based on the past four years' operations, have been as follows (see
also para 37):
1969      1970       1971      1972/a
percent 
SBS       0.80       0.58      0.96       1.20
CTB8      1.39       1.59      1.46       1.65
Average   1.10       1.09       1.21      1.43
/a   Estimated.
44.       Assuming a contribution by IBRD of about 60% to all subloans (at
7,25%), a 30% contribution by FFAD at 4.5%, and 10% from the merged banks'
own resources, which presently cost about 8.0%, the blend cost of funds to
the merged banks would be just over 6.5% (Table 9).



ANNEX 3
Page 13
45.       The mission recommends that the interest rate payable by sub-
borrowers be 8.25% per annum. In addition to enabling elimination of Govern-
ment interest subsidies on SBS's own resources contribution, it would allow
for a possible increase in the cost of SBS's own funds, and at the same time
ensure a spread of between 1.6% and 1.7% to cover administrative, appraisal
and other costs under the project (Table 9). A spread of at least 1.5% is
considered necessary to provide sufficient incentive to the on-lenders of
project funds to carry out the aims of the project. An on-lending rate of
8.25% also provides for an increase of more than 50% in the current lending
rates, and as such would be a major step towards a more rational credit
policy for agriculture. Since financial rates of return on all subprojects
are well over 12% (Annex 10), a rate of 8.25% should not prove an undue
financial burden on subborrowers and should encourage a more efficient use
of scarce resources.

1/   Interest paid by business banks has been incroasing recently as these
banks have attempted to attract additional savings. Though the cost of
these funds is about 8.0% (A) at present, the alternative of 9.0%(B) is
given, illustrating that a spread in excess of 1.5% either to SBS or
combinats for on-lending to private farmers, would still be obtainable.

YUGOSLAVIA
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT - MACEDONIA
Production and Marketing of Project Commodities
*  1.     As discussed in Chapter V, the main products produced under the
project would be milk, beef and pork meat, table grapes, wine, fish and
tobacco. Table 1 summarizes lacedonia's present production of these products,
and the production and consumption projections for 1975 and 1980.
Milk
2.        Present production of dairy products in Macedonia is estimated at
about 103,000 tons (Table 1), which is expected to increase without the proj-
ect to about 107,000 tons by 1975, the main increase coming from cow milk
products. As mentioned in Annex 1, Government is increasing its efforts to
improve farm production and it is expected that the total dairy cattle herd
will increase from about 282,000 head in 1971 to about 320,000 head in 1975.
Sheep milk production is expected to decrease since the number of sheep have
been declining because of the reduced demand for sheep milk.
3.        Present consumption of dairy products in Macedonia is about 122,000
tons which is equivalent to about 72 kg per person per annum (Macedonia's
population is about 1.7 million at present), slightly below Yugoslavia's
average-of 80 kg per person. It is expected that the total consumption
would increase by about 3.5% per annum, since population growth is about
1.4%; and the consumption increase because of increased per capita income
would be about 2.0% (income elasticity is about 0.5% and per capita income
increase is estimated at about 4% per annum). Macedonia's present deficit
of about 19,000 tons of milk products is imported from neighboring republics
and would grow to about 26,000 tons by 1975 and to about 3i,000 tons by 1980.
The expected project production of 24 million 1 from the social sector and
4 million 1 from private farms, for a total of about 28 million 1 of milk
(equivalent to about 23,000 tons of diary products based on the same pro-
portion of consumption of products as present usage), can therefore easily
be sold on the Macedonia market or to other republics. Yugoslavia is a
net importer of about 19,000 tons of dairy products.
Fresh and Processed Meat
4.        Macedonia's present production of fresh and processed meat is
about 23,000 tons, while present consumption is about 34,000 tons, result-
ing in a deficit of about 11,000 tons. Production of slaughter cattle and
pigs is expected to grow substantially because a number of combinats have
established new farm units. The other types of meat are expected to in-
crease at a normal rate of about 3.5% per annum.



ANNEX 9
Page  2
5.        The present consumption of about 34,000 tons is expected to grow
to about 41,000 tons by 1975, representing a growth rate of about 4.9% per
annum. This growth rate is below the national average (about 7.0%) and has
been derived as follows:
(a)  Population growth                          1.4%
(b) A demand growth of about 3.5% based
on a per capita income growth of 4%
and an income elasticity of demand of
about 0.85%                                3.5%
4.9% per annum
By 1975, with a projected production of 34,000 tons, the shortage of meat
products without the project would therefore be about 7,000 tons (Table 1).
Under the proposed project the total incremental production of fresh and
processed meat would be about 4,300 tons 1/, and there would, tharefore, be
no difficulty in marketing the additional production in Macedonia. Never-
theless, because there is a world meat shortage, it would be advantageous
for Macedonia to export part of its production of high quality meats and
to import inferior quality types of meat, and it is expected that about
2,000 tons of the project's output would be exported.
6.        Yugoslavia as a whole exports about 127,000 tons of fresh and pro-
cessed meat or about 16% of its total production of 774,000 tons (Table 2).
Its major markets for beef, veal and pork are Italy, Greece, and Austria and
are further discussed below.
7.        Export Markets-Beef and Veal.  Currently, Yugoslavia exports beef
and veal mainly to Italy (75%) and Greece. It is expected that demand from
these countries as well as from others will continue to be strong. At pre-
sent, North America, the EEC and other Western countries are about 1.5 million
tons in deficit for beef and veal, and according to FAO projections, this
deficit is expected to rise to 3,024,000 tons by 1980. All of the increases
in demand have occurred and would continue to occur in the 'ace of rising prices
of beef and veal on the international markets.  The price --and continues
upwards with early 1972 prices already ranging from US$1,200/ton for boned
forequarters beef imported into Europe to over US$2,000/ton for baby beef
carcasses imported into France and over US$2,500/ton for baby beef special
cuts cif Italy.  As special cuts are the major fresh beef export under
the project, a price of about US$2,300 (fob) was used for model.
8.        Export Markets-Pork.  Yugoslavia exports at present about 48,000
tons of pork (Table 2), 60% of which is processed pork, mainly to Italy and
Austria. While world demand for pork has only grown slowly in the past, it
1/   The total output of the meat processing plant would be about 11,000
tons of meat; however, about 6,700 tons would be existi-ig production,
processed at present in an inferior way.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
is expected to increase more rapidly in the future because of the shortage
of beef and veal meat. The Western European increase in consumption in
recent years has been about 3%, which is expected to increase to 6% for the
period 1975-1980. Yugoslavia would be in a good position to increase its
share in the export markets for pork.
9.        Processing of pork enables the marketer to apply the classical
elements of product differentiation to his products and thus to target to
specific market segments. Thus, oversimplifying pork demand does not take
account of the apparently rising demand for boneless, low-fat, canned re-
frigerated ham and ham products. These products, exported from Poland, the
Netherlands and Denmark, and now from Yugoslavia, have commanded high prices
on the U.K. and U.S.A. markets.
10.       Since the proposed project facilities would meet all the inter-
national hygienic standards, Macedonia would be in an excellent position to
increase its exports, particularly of processed meat and pork products. Most
of Macedonia's meat products are transported in refrigerated trucks and the
trucking industry is well organized and has sufficient capacity to meet
future increases. The Federal Government is going to monitor Yugoslavia's
exports of meat products in order to control quality and will sell mainly
to commission agents in importing countries. It does not intend, as it is
doing for fruits and vegetables, to establish its own marketing agencies
since the commission agent system works well for meat products.
Table Grapes
11.       Macedonia's present annual production of table grapes is about
56,000 tons, the main part of which (31,000 tons) is sold outside the Re-
public. Macedonia's present consumption is about 10 kg per person per annum
(17,000 tons), which is lower than the national average of about 11 kg per
person per annum. Production in Macedonia without the project is expected
to increase at the rate of about 3.5% per annum, while consumption in Macedonia
would grow by about 3.2% per annum until 1975 (1.4% population growth, 1.8%
income demand growth) and by about 3.3% per annum from 1975 to 1980 (popula-
tion growth 1.3% and income demand growth about 2.0%). The surplus in
Macedonia's production by 1980 would be about 53,000 tons (Table 1). With
the project production of about 20,000 tons, Macedonia would have to market
about 73,000 tons of table grapes.
12.       It is expected that almost all of Macedonia's surplus would be sold
in the other Republics. Table 3 shows the supply-demand balance for Macedonia
and Yugoslavia as a whole for table grapes and grape juices. By 1980, Yugo-
slavia's total demand including potential exports would be about 277,000 tons
of grapes while total production including project production would only be
about 270,000 tons. This estimate is conservative because it has been assumed
that the production of table grapes in the republics other tnan Macedonia
would remain at the present level. In fact, the last years have shown a de-
clining trend in the other republics which is expected to continue because
farmers there have a comparative advantage in producing wine grapes and are
hence switching from table grapes. This trend is also occurring in countries



ANNEX 9
Page  4
such as Italy and Portugal and has occurred in Austria and West Germany which
presently do not produce any table grapes. Macedonia, with its excellent
climate and soils for table grapes production, will therefore have no difficulty
in marketing its surplus production.
13.       The total incremental production under the project would be about
20,000 tons (17,600 tons from the social sector, 2,800 tons from private
farmers), of which probably about 2,000 tons would be exported. By 1980,
grape exports from Yugoslavia would probably account for no more than 5% of
the country's total production. The reason that Macedonia would have a higher
export/production percentage is that its table grapes are in high demand for
their quality and taste.
14.       Yugoslavia's main export markets are Austria (about 70%) and West
Germany. Although Italy is the main supplier of these markets and is in an
advantageous position vis-a-vis West Germany because of its membership in the
EEC, it is expected that Yugoslavia will be able to keep its competitive posi-
tion. Yugoslav table grapes, and especially Macedonian varieties, have com-
peted very well in the export markets on grounds of price and taste. Also,
since the number of tourists visiting Yugoslavia account for a substantial
part of the demand for Yugoslav table grapes in their home countries and
since the number of Austrian and West German tourists to Yugoslavia is ex-
pected to double in the next ten years, Yugoslavia is expected to continue
to have good export markets.  In addition, the Federal Government is making
a conscientious effort to regulate the export market.  At present, the dif-
ferent republics in Yugoslavia are competing with each other and, therefore,
the Federal Government has decided to establish fruit and vegetable agencies
in the different European markets to coordinate exports from the country as
a whole.
15.       Most shipments of fruits and vegetables to Austria and West Germany
are made by refrigerated truck and the trucking industry is efficient. Class-
ification and grading of fruits for export is undertaken by the Federal Gov-
ernment inspection service at points of embarkation and grade standards are
in general similar to those in the U.S. If the fruits fail to meet the export
standards when inspected at point of embarkation, they are rejected.
16.       Seasonality is the strongest single factor in the price determina-
tion  . table grapes in export markets.  Prices in Western Europe are high
at the commencement of the off-season production period from January to early
July, fall sharply in late July and hit bottom in September/October when
supplies are at their peak. Macedonia, as has been mentioned, has no season-
ality advantage, and it can expect to receive only the average full-season
price, which in 1971 was about US$0.27 per kg fob border importing coun-
tries. Although this price is expected to rise slightly in the future, for
analysis purposes the 1971 export price and corresponding ex-farm price have
been used.

Wine
17.       Macedonia's production of about 59 million liters of wine accounts
for about 11% of Yugoslavia's total wine production of about 555 million
liters. It is not known how much of Macedonia's production is consumed in
the Republic, in other republics or exported, but it is known that Yugoslavia's
wine export is to a large extent based on wines of Macedonian origin.
18.       Yugoslavia as a whole exported in 1971 about 57 million liters of
wines, mainly to the U.K., Austria and West Germany. In the last four years
Yugoslavia's exports have increased by more than 20% per anxnum. One of the
main reasons for this increase is that tourists continue to consume Yugoslav
wines after they have returned to their home countries. As has been mentioned,
it is expected that the numbers of tourists to Yugoslavia would double within
the next ten years. There is no doubt that Yugoslavia, provided it could
produce it, could export substantially larger quantities in the future. How-
ever, domestic demand is also increasing at a fast pace and projections made
by FAO show that Yugoslavia's exports will probably decrease because of the
increased home demand (see table below).

19.       Macedonia's incremental production under the project would be about
19 million liters of wine, although the total production cef the wine processing
plant would be about 40 million liters. The reason for this difference is that
about 13 million liters of wine would be bought from other combinats' present
production, and about 8 million liters from the private sector's present pro-
duction. The cellar's incremental production would come mainly from the
crushing of grapes (about 28,400 tons) from combinats' new vineyards.
20.       The present percentage of Yugoslavia's exports to its production
is about 10%. Because of the strong home demand, it has been assumed that
Macedonia's exports under the project would not rise above this percentage
even though Macedonian wines are famous for their quality. Of the total
incremental production probably about 2 - 2.5 million liters would thus be
exported and about 16.5 - 17.0 million liters would be sold domestically.



ANNEX 9
Page  6
21.       Yugoslavia's wine prices, especially of bulk wine, have increased
slightly in recent years. For instance, between 1969 and 1972 the U.K. price
of Yugoslav bulk wine increased from ND 4.3 per liter to about ND 4.9 per
liter (cif), and this trend is expected to continue. However, for the
analysis in this report, 1972 prices (ND 3.77 liter fob Yugoslav border)
have been used in order to calculate the financial returns conservatively.
Wine by-products
22.       The total incremental production from the two plants would consist
of: 10,000 tons of vinegar; 7,500 tons of livestock feed, 1,500 tons grape
seed, 730 tons alcohol wine distillate, 560 tons tartaric acid and wine acid
and 100 tons& baking powder. There would be no problem in marketing these
quantities.  The livestock feed would be sold to the dairy cattle fattening,
heifer rearing and pig units. Regarding distillates, acids and baking powder,
Yugoslavia is importing substantially larger quantities than would be pro-
duced under the project. Regarding vinegar, no exact data are available
because the Federal Bureau of Statistics includes it in the group of non-
alcoholic drinks for which it has no breakdown. However, all market experts
are of the opinion that Yugoslavia is at present poorly supplied with vinegar.
For instance, many consumers use artificially produced wine acid instead of
vinegar.  Moreover, vinegar is also in increasing demand by the growing can-
ning industry.
Fish
23.       Macedonia's present production of 900 tons of fish accounts for only
a very smallI portion of the country's total production of 19,000 tons (of which
12,000 tons is carp). As indicated in Table 1, Macedonia has at present a
deficit of about 3,000 tons, which is expected to grow to about 3,400 tons by
1975 and 5,100 tons by 1980. Also the country as a whole has a deficit. Yugo-
slavia imported about 23,000 tons of fish and fish products in 1970 and exported
about 12,000 tons. The incremental production under the project of about 1,500
tons can, therefore, easily be sold.  The average sales pricct: ex-pond is about
ND 10/kg for carp and ND 35/kg for trout.
Tobacco
24.       Macedonia's annual production of about 24,000 tons (20,000 tons
Oriental type, 4,000 tons Virginia type tobacco) accounts for 48% of Yugo-
slavia's total production of about 49,000 tons. Macedonia and the rest of
Yugosiavia produce mainly Oriental and semi-Oriental tobaccos (about 40,000
tons) and rank fifth in world production of this variety. The remainder of
Yugoslavia's production, about 9,000 tons, consists of Virginia tobaccos.
Yugoslavia as a whole exported in 1971 about 19,000 tons of Oriental and
semi-Oriental tobacco and imported about 5,500 tons of Virginia tobacco
(about double that of the 1969 figure).
.



ANNEX 9
Page 7
Is        25.        It is expected that Yugoslavia will need to import more Virginia
type tobaccos since cigarette consumption is increasing at a high rate (by
about 4% per annum) and Virginia tobacco represents an essential part of the
cigarette blend. Moreover, the Virginia type of cigarette compared to the
Oriental type is increasing in popularity. As a result, Yugoslavia will
need some additional 1,000 - 1,500 tons of Virginia tobacco each year, of
which Macedonia would need about 20% since it accounts for this portion of
Yugoslavia's total tobacco products production.
26.       Macedonia, compared to the other republics, is in a very advantageous
position for growing Virginia tobacco because of its climate and soils, provid-
ed it has sufficient irrigation and drying facilities.  Under the proposed pro-
ject, the incremental production of Virginia tobacco on existing irrigated lands
at full development would be about 1,400 tons per annum for which dryers would
be provided. The increased annual production of Virginia tobacco would sub-
stitute for imports (valued at US$ 1.26 million equivalent, at the 1972 f.o.b.
border price). The prices of both Virginia and Oriental type tobaccos have
fluctuated in recent years, but have averaged about US$1.25 and US$ 0.90 per
kg f.o.b. border for Oriental and Virginia tobacco, respectively.
27.       Producer prices of tobacco were formerly supported by subsidies
from the Federal Government but these were abolished in September 1971. Since
then, tobacco prices have been placed under the guaranteed minimum price sup-
port scheme, whereby prices are determined by producers, cooperatives and
tobacco enterprises in line with market prices, subject to the minimum prices
set forth in the inter-Republic agreements.  In fact, the guaranteed minimum
price support has meant little in recent years, since prices bf tobacco have
been above the Government minimum price levels.

Operating Results
1.        The project would help finance subprojects in both the social and
the private sectors. In the social sector integrated agricultural industries
enterprises (combinats) would receive loans for: (i) the expansion of their
livestock industry by about 12,800 head of cattle--5,000 dairy, 5,300 fatten-
ing and 2,500 rearing--and by about 40,000 pigs; (ii) the construction of a
modern meat processing plant (with an annual capacity of 12,000 head of cattle
and 125,000 pigs); (iii) the establishment of vineyards (2,AOO ha); (iv) the
construction of wine processing facilities (with an annual pzoduction equiva-
lent to 40 million liters of wine and about 20,000 tons of wine by-products);
(v) the construction of cold storage and grain silo facilities (with a total
of 17,500 tons of static capacity); and (vi) the development of fishponds
(with an annual production of 1,500 tons of carp and 75 tons of trout). In
the private sector, private farmers would receive credit for (vii) on-farm
improvements, mainly for the construction of tobacco drying sheds (150 flue-
curing units), for table grape farm improvements, and for the upgrading of
dairy cattle.

3.        The principal assumptions used in the models are the following:
Dairying (Appendix 1)
4.        There would be five units, each having a herd of 1,000 cows.  The
major revenue would consist of milk sales, estimated at full development in
year 4 at 4.8 million 1 per unit, sold at a price of ND 2.6 per 1. Feed
(mainly maize, fodder and alfalfa) would form the major component of the
operating expenses and would be produced by each combinat. Further details
are in Appendix 1.
Cattle Fattening (Appendix 2)
5.        Each unit of 1,000 head (there would be four units) wouLd sell 1,320
head of fattened cattle per year since it would take about nine months to fatten
the cattle. The cattle would be bought at 110 kg per head for a price of ND
1,760 per head and sold at 435 kg per head for a price of ND 6,000 per head.
Major oper4ting expenses, in addition to calf purchases, are again the cost of
feed.
Heifer Rearing (Appendix 3)
6.        There would be four units.  Each unit of 1,000 head would sell per
annum 540 bred heifers and 60 non-breeders since the heifers would be bought
at 3 months of age, bred at 15-16 months and sold at about 23 months. The
sale price would be about ND 11,000 for an in-calf heifer. Feed is again the
mnjor componen-_ of operating expenses followed by heifer calf purchases.
Pig Breeding/Fattening (Appendix 4)
7.        The basic herd, which consists of 526 sows farrowing 2.3 times per
year, would provide about 10,000 fattened pigs per year for sale at a price
of ND 1,000 per head. Major operating expenses are feed. There would be two
units undeg this project, one of 10,000 head as mentioned above and the other
of 30,000 head. Because of economies of scale, the rate of return of the
larger unit would be better than that of the smaller unit.

Meat Processing (Appendix 5)
8.        The meat processing plant would produce, at full development in
year 5, about 600 tons of fresh special meat cuts for export (sale price
ND 40/kg), 1,300 tons of fresh meat for the local market (ND 22.50/kg),
1,800 tons of canned meat for export (ND 23/kg), and 7,300 tons of canned
meat for the local market (ND 20/kg), for a total of about 11,000 tons of
meat and 3,200 tons of by-products (hair, hides, edible lard, bone and meat
meal, etc.). Total number of cattle and pigs processed at full production
would be about 12,000 and 125,000, respectively. Details of the operating
costs are in Appendix 5B.
Vineyeards (Appendices 6 and 7)
9.        Ten combinats would participate in the vineyard program for a total
of 1,600 ha of wine grapes and 1,000 ha of table grapes. Total production
would be 24,000 tons and 22,000 tons, respectively. The major part (80%) of
the table grapes would be sold in Yugoslavia for local consumption; the wine
grapes and the remainder of the table grapes would be sold to wineries. Sales
prices have been conservatively estimated.
Wine Processing (Appendix 8)
10.       There would be only one plant under this project and its major pur-
pose would be to improve the quality of Macedonia's inferior type wines by
blending, aging and stablizing. The plant would buy wines from existing small
wineries. Its annual input would be equivalent to 60,000 tons of grapes and
its output would be equivalent to about 40 million 1 of wine (38 million I of
wine and brandy and 4 million 1 of carbonated drinks). The major operating
costs are the raw materials (grape purchase price ND 1.80 per kg). Sales
prices are indicated in Appendix 8.
Wine By-products (Appendix 9)
11.       There would be two units, each with different end products.  Inputs
in both cases would be 10,000 tons of marc (the pressed cake left over from
grape pressing) and 2,000 tons of lees (the residue after fermentation of
wines). Principal products--a total of about 20,000 tons ^;,: the two units--
would be vinegar, livestock feed, tartaric acid and its derivatives, baking
powder, and distillates. The Tikves unit has a higher rate of return than
the UACM unit because the investments would be incremental to its existing
operations.
Cold Store (Appendix 10)
12.       Two units would be constructed, each of 5,000 tons static capacity,
for extending the marketability of fruits and vegetables and dairy and meat
products. The revenues are based on a fee basis of ND 200 per ton per month
and a 65% utilization rate.



ANNEX 10

Grain Storage Silos (Appendices 11 and 12)
13.       Two units, one for corn (capacity 5,000 tons) and the other for
rice (capacity 2,500 tons), would provide storage for increased production
resulting from the on-going government irrigation schemes.  In the case of
corn storage, the combinat would save about ND 0.23 per kg on a total pro-
duction of 5,000 tons. In the case of rice storage, revenues are based on
a fee of ND 500 per ton per annum and a capacity utilization rate of 50%.
Fishponds (Appendices 13 and 14)
14.       There would be five units of 200 ha each for carp (eachi unit pro-
ducing 300 tons) and two units for trout (producing 15 tons and 60 tons,
respectively). Total production of all units would be 1,500 tons of carp
and 75 tons of trout.
Private Farmers--Tobacco Dryer (Appendix 15)
15.       The total number of tobacco drying units would be 150, each drying
about 10 tons of V.'irginia tobacco per year for a total of 1,500 tons. The
benefits would es,nsist of two parts:
(i)  the normal drying fee accruing to the operators                           0
(farmers' cooperatives) of ND 8.7 per kg of tobacco;
(ii)  the incremental production of farmers.  With the dryers
farmers can produce Virginia tobacco instead of Oriental
tobacco and thus produce about 650 kg per farm per year
additionally.
Private Farmers--Table Grapes (Appendix 16)
ib.       The rotal investments per ha would be about ND 43,C00  (US.'2,500).
At full development in year 6, annual production would be about 20 tons/ha
on irrigated land and about 13 tons/ha on non-irrigated land. Table grapes
would be sold at a price of ND 2.2 per kg (80%) and ND 0.8 per kg (20%).
Private Farmers--Dairying(Appendix 17)
i7.       liAn illustrative model has been drawn up for a 5-cow unit which
would produce about 12,000 1 per annum at a sales price of ND 2.6 per 1 for
a total gross revenue of ND 31,000 per annum. Major operating costs would
include feed costs. The net income would be about ND 14,000 per annum,
while total investment costs would be about ND 73,000.
