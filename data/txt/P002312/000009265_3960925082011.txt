PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
'his Project Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared for the
SEFICS Rail Transport Project for which Loan 2025-SE in the amount of
US$19.3 million was approved by the Board on June 23, 1981 and was
signed on September 30, 1981.   The original closing date of Decem-
ber 31, 1984, was extended by one year to December 31, 1985, and the
final disbursement was made on August 11, 1986.
This PCR was prepared by the Western Africa Region on the
basis of the information collected by the completion mission in May 1986
and the information available in the project files.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project
performance audit reporting, this PCR was reviewed by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED
staff. Tae draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments. The
Comments of the Ministry of Equipment is placed as an annex to this
report. The SEFICS management has replied that it has no comments to
make.

SEFICS RAIL TRANSPORT PROJECT, LOAN 2025-SE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
1.        The Government  of Senegal  in 1978  decided to  set up a fertilizer
manufacturing plant called the "Industries Chimiques du Senegal (ICS), with
the assistance of IFC and other aid agencies. The ICS factory needed reliable
and economic transport facilities to carry the imported inputs for the factory
(sulphur, fuel, etc.) from the Dakar Port and the phosphoric acid and the
fertilizer to t'ie port for exp.rt (para 1.01).  In order to fulfill this need,
a rail  transport operating  entity called  Societe d'Exploitation Ferroviaire
des ICS, SEFI0, was created. The principal direct objective of the SEFICS
project was to meet the trartsoort requirements of ICS in the most economical
and efficient manner without causing interruptions of the plant production
(para  2.05).   This  project  objective  was  fulfilled when  the  transport
services were made available to ICS within a period of 30 months from
start-up, in  time to transport the heavy industrial eq_-ent and the primary
construction inputs needed for the plant from the Port of Dakar to tLe
factory's inland site at M'Bao, located nearly 120 km from the Port.
Moreover, transport costs of SEFICS were roughly 252 below those of the only
logical alternative, the state-owned Regie du Chemin de Fer du Seneg.-l
(RCFS). The main indirect objective in the creation of the private sector
company SEFICS was to help streamline the state-owned railway into a more
efficient organization. This objective was achieved to some degree, probably
the best under the prevailing labor and political realities of Senegal.
Implementation Experience
2.        The creation  of SEFICS broke new ground in Senegal by privatizing a
significant segment of the rail transport industry and setting it up as a
private  sector   operating  entity   in  competition   with  the  state-ownel
monopolistic railway  company, RCFS.   This pioneering  step demonstrated th&t
the private  sector could maintain higher technical and financial standards of
operation and maintenance, higher staff discipline  and accountability,  and a
better record of safety than the state-owned RCFS (para 6.01).  It also opened
up the possibility to extend this concept to other activities of RCFS's
traffic and thereby restructure RCFS or induce it to become more efficient
(para 8.02).
3.        On the other hand, one lesson learned from the project is that, even
in the private sector, certain management deficiencies cannot be easily
eradicated. Such was the case of the tendency to overstaffing, which was
controlled in time, the difficulty in shedding the traditional public-sector
work attitude of insensitivity to productivity and in adjusting .:o a



commercially-oriented environment where least-cost solutions were required
(para 6.02).
Results
4.        No separate  computation of  the rate of return for this project was
made at appraisal since it was considered as an integral element of the
industrial project.   The ICS  project which  included the  SEFICS cost in its
overall economic computation estimated a rate of return of 13.5% for the whole
ICS  project.   The  average  cost  of  transport is 15.36 FCFA/t km in SEFICS
compared to 20.46 FCFA/t km of RCFS. On this basis a.d making a conservative
allowance for delays, accidents and other operating inefficiencies, the ERR
for SEFICS is about 13% (para 7.01).
5.        However, as ICS's production  volumes are  lagging behind forecasts,
SEFICS is carrying less traffic than its design capacity. As a consequence,
SEFICS's fixed costs are high. In order to spread the fixed costs of SEFICS
over larger traffic volumes, Bank missions tried to persuade Government to
throw open the national phosphate traffic to competitive bidding by SEFICS and
RCFS which most likely would have led SEFICS to win this additional traffic or
RCFS to improve operations and management substantially, or both. However,
due to severe labor union pressure and political deference to railway labor,
it was not possible to implement this proposal (paras 4.01 and 8.01). In
hindsight, it appears that it would have been prudent to have some built-in
safeguards against the contingency of a failure of the parent industrial
venture.
6.        SEFICS's  investments  were  strictly  controlled  by  ICS's  senior
management, in consultation with Bank missions, in ordex to keep investment
costs well below estimates. These measures were successful, and the need for
additional wagons, signalling, etc., was pruned down. Overall, there was a
saving of US$6.1 m despite the procurement of one locomotive above the
appraisal estimate (paras 3.08 and 3.09).
7.        Despite  lower  than  estimated   traffic  volumes   and  consequent
underutilization of its equipment, SEFICS has maintained a satisfactory
financial position because of its statutory right to recover full costs from
I-S, admittedly, to the latter's disadvantage (Chapter V).
SustainabilitX and Findinas
8.        Overall, the  project was  successfuls  (a) RCFS would not have been
able to provide ICS the desired levels of reliability and regularity of
service, at a significantly lower level of transport costs, as SEFICS has
done, without which ICS's operations would have been seriously affected
(para 1.02); (b) SEFICS's higher quality of technical management (despite some
weaknesses) has vindicated the decision to privatize this segment of rail
transport; and (c) the de-linking of the management of operations and
maintenance from the ownership of the track has opened the door (at least, in
principle, for the present) to private companies to operate container surnices
between Dakar and Bamako. This idea, now being discussed among private sector
interests, the Government of Senegal and the Bank, would, if implemented, also



- vi -
benefit land-locked Mali. This Project concept was probably ahead of its time
in 1981, as further privatization and/or restructuring of the RCFS are radical
changes which require a longer time-horizon to take root in Senegal and
therefore were not feasible within the project period.
9.        Postscript.  The objective of  raising RCFS's  management efficiency
and staff productivity has come closer to achievement than ever before
because: (a) in December 1986, the Government agreed with the Bank to limit
investments in RCFS to a mcdest program; and (b) RCFS is now more keen to:
(i) control  costs,  and  compete  with  SEFICS  to  recapture   ICS  traffic;
(ii) control    staff    indiscipline    and   thus   increase   productivity;
(iii) reorganize its international trarfic to Mali on the basis of closer
cooperation with Mali Railways; and riv) examine the viability of the
St. Louis branch line and close it, if proved to be uneconomical (paia 5.02).

SEFICS RAIL TRANSPORT PROJECT, LOAN 2025-SE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION AND PROJECT IDENTIFIC.TION
1.01      In  177,  the  Government of Senegal  (GOS) approached  the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to assist in setting up a
phosphoric acid/fertilizer project.  By 1978/79, the GOS, IFC and the
design consultants agreed that efficient and reliable transport was
crucial to the success of the fertilizer project and that the
state-owned Senegal Railways (Regie des Chemins de Fer du Senegal --
RCFS) was too inefficient and risky for this purpose. The IFC requested
the support of the Bank in designing and financing the transport infra-
structure, in view of the Bank's long involvement with, and knowledge
of, the rail sub-sector.
1.02      The Bank considered this opportunity crucial to the success of
its long-standing quest for higher efficiency in the management of the
railways.  By then, the Bank had financed three railway projects all
intended to address the issues of management efficiency and close
operational coorc.ination with Mali Railways.   For nearly  15 years,
during which these projects were under execution, the influence of the
Bank failed to make an impact on RCFS's efficiency and on the GOS's
awareness of the gravity of RCFS's inadequacies.  Consequently, it was
feared that if RCFS were to be given the responsibility for this impor-
tant industrial traffic, its management would either allocate undue
priority to this highlv visible operation with serious repercussions for
the traffic to land-locked Mali or handle it with habitual inefficiency
and thus affect  seriously  ICS's production.   A just-then concluded
study, which had revealed serious weaknesses in RCFS's management,
supported this judgment. The study had taken the view that RCFS should
gradually divest itself of its passenger services, hive off its phos-
phate traffic to a separate operating unit and create a bi-national
management to focus on the international traffic. RCFS and the GOS were
not expected to accept such radical restructuring of the railway alL at
onre, given the labor implications of these measures. The ICS project
was an enclave operation, and therefore, it was considered to be a
suitable vehicle to induce the GOS to take the first step towards the
eventual restructuring of the RCFS -- bv accepting the concept of
private ownership of. rolling stock and private operations on RCFS's
track. Since the Bank had an institutional interest in RCFS, simultane-
ously, it would provide an opportunity to protect and improve the
financial interests of RCFS by insisting on an equitable tariff for ICS
traffic.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The ICS project had engaged Entreprise Miniere et Chimique
(EZC) of France as  the project-design consultant.   For purposes  of
conceptual homogeneity, it was decided to entrust the detailed engineer-
ing of the transport component also to the same firm, who hired railway
specialists for this purpose.. The Bank's intimate knowledge of RCFS's
operations and track conditions was made full use of by the consultant
in his design of the transport component of ICS during late 1979 and
1980. In the meantime, IFC prepared itself to finance a segment of the
industrial elements of the ICS project.
2.02      The Project structuring with its implications for RCFS was the
key issue. The hope that RCFS could be relied upon to provide full rail
services to ICS was nullified by the Bank's documented evidence of
RCFS's poor performance and the consultant's misgivings about its
management capability. After considering various alternatives ranging
from full ownership to leasing of equipment by ICS, it was decided that
ICS sthould own and operate its own trains on RCFS's track, paying a
track-user charge.  This meant that ICS would have full responsibility
for its own transport requirements and would be able to minimize sub-
stantially the risks of serious accidents, as most of RCFS's accidents
were attributable to weak discipline among locomo,tive drivers -- a
problem which ICS would be better equipped to address through an effi-
cient system of penalties and incentives without running into resistance
from labor unions.   ICS would  also be responsible  for  the routine
maintenance of its locomotives and wagons.   In short,  the transport
operations would have all the benefits of relatively more efficient
private management.
2.03      The Project was appraised in early 1981 and was approved by
the Zoard in June 1981 on the basis of only a President's Report.
2.04      The Societe d'Exploitation Ferroviaire des ICS, (SEFICS) was
created as a railway operating company, functioning as a majority-owned
subsidiary of ICS.  SEFICS was the borrower and beneficiary of the Bank
lcan and was responsible for the project implementation and debt ser-
vice.   The  loan was g-iaranceed by GOS.   SEFICS was  to conclude  as
conditions  of  effectiveness:   (a)  a  Transport  Agreement  with  RCFS
covering charges for the use of its tracks; (b) a Tariff Agreement with
ICS covering the tariffs for the transport services rendered; and (c) a
Financing Agreement with RCFS in which RCFS would pay SEFICS the cost of
repairing its siding tracks which SEFICS undertook to supervise under
the project using RCFS's labor.  Importantly and unlike the Rail agree-
ment between Senegal and Mali, the Transport Agreement between SEFICS
and RCFS laid down (a) operating guidelines for traffic coordination;
(b) the conditions of service like number of trains, their punctuality,
tonnages, etc., to be honored by both sides; and (c) the apportionment
of damages in case of accidents and disruption of services.
2.05      Consultants EMC (para 2.01) prepared the statutes of SEFICS
and defined its financial and organizational structure.   It was, like
ICS, placed under the tutelage of the Ministry of Industries.   The
principal shareholder in SEFICS was ICS; RCFS held a small minority
participation to cover the cost of some existing siding tracks which



- 3 -
were taken over by SEFICS.  The technical manager was recruited from
PCFS and the financial manager was recruited from the private sector.
she train operating staff were hand picked from RCFS. ICS nominated one
of its senior managers as the General Manager of SEFICS. Except for a
technical  assistant  for  supervision  in  the workshop,  financial and
operating managements were entirely in Senegalese hands.
Project Objectives
2.06      The major direct objective was to provide efficient, economi-
cal and reliable transport for the raw materials, supplies and the
finished products of the ICS Fertilizer Project with the requisite
reliability and safety necessary to avoid disruption of the production
schedules  of the plant.   As an  indirect  objective  the project was
intended by the Bank to be a first step towards the liberalization of
the rail  transport  industry and eventual opening of  the doors  for
restructuring of RCFS through possible privatization of certain opera-
tions  in  order  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  the  rail  services  to
land-locked Mali.
Project Description
2.07      To ach:leve these objectives, the Project included: (a) upgrad-
ing and renewal of about 6 km of RCFS's siding track serving an existing
fertilizer plant, whi:h was to be rebuilt as ICS's new fertilizer
factory; (b) the-construction of rail terminals with loading and unload-
ing facilities at the phosphate mine/phosphoric acid plant, at the
fertilizer  plant  and  at  the  Port;  (c)  procurement  of  locomotives,
shunting locomotives, tank wagons, and hopper wagons, with adequate
spare parts; (d) construction and equipping of a small workshop to
maintain the locomotives and the wagons; and (e) signalling and telecom-
munications at the junction between the siding tracks and RCFS's main-
line.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01      The project was expected to be implemented between FY1982 and
FY1984.  The project became effective on 'larch 8, 1983.  The delav in
effectiveness was caused by the delay in the fulfillment of the condi-
tions of cross-effectiveness of the IFC loan with the large number of
co-lenders parrtcipating in the ICS project.  However, this delay did
not adversely affect SEFICS's start-up, as the procurement process
progressed on schedule and the suppliers were initially paid out of the
equity funds of ICS and later reimbursed from the project funds.
Project Implementation
3.02      The  project  was  implemented  largely  as  conceived  in  the
appraisal report, except for the procurement of one additional locomo-
tive (para 3.05). The implementation schedule ran almost as planned at
appraisal and the overall time over-run was no more than three to six
months on some individual items. However, these small over-runs had no



-4-
adverse effect on the implementation of the ICS fertilizer project,
which suffared bigger delays. SEFICS's capacity was thus ahead of ICS's
demand on Lt.
Project Costs
3.03      The project was implemented with a saving of US$8.1 m  (Ta-
ble 1). The savings are principally due to the favorable exchange rate
of the French franc and the CFA franc, most of the contracts being
payable in these two currencies (para 3.08).  There was also a small
reduction in the scope of the signalling and telecommunication compo-
nent; the wagon maintenance facility was dropped in favor of using a
private maintenance facility (para 3.09).  Most of the pre-operating
costs and the initial working capital provisions of the loan were not
utilized, as ICS absorbed these relatively minor costs in its
pre-operating and mobilization expenditures.
Reporting
I3. -v46    ICS's consultants provided satisfactory progress reports of
the implementation of the whole ICS project, including SEFICS. However,
this  report  covered  general  progress  only.   Detailed  progress  was
monitored through supervisions and special reports gathered during
supervision.
Procurement
3.05      Procurement posed serious problems at the beginning, as the
consultants were not familiar with the Bank's guidelines. Bid documents
for critical items like locomotives and special wagons were prepared on
the basis of known and preferred designs. However, they very soon fell
in line with Bank's ICB procedures. During this process, the Senegalese
managers were closely associated with the design criteria and bid
evaluation, and there was an appreciable transfer of know-how.
Revisions
3.06      The initial project design was based on the phosphoric acid
storage being located at Dakar Port.   The trains were scheduled to
operate on a very tight schedule called the "circuit court." According-
ly, SEFICS's traction requirement was estimated at 2.2 main line locomo-
tives 1/ and  three shunting  locomotives.   However,  as ICS's factorv
design evolved, the industrial consultant decided to shift the site of
the main phosphoric acid storage from the Port of Dakar to M'bao, the
site of the fertilizer plant, some 15 km west of Dakar.  Besides, the
number of weighbridges was reduced from two to one at M'bao. Both these
design changes made it obligatory for all trains in both directions to
pass through M'bao, adding some 26 km to a round trip of about 140 km.
In addition, ICS decided to base all of its loco running staff at Taiba,
on housing considerations and proximity to the maintenance facilities
and not at both extremities, as initially planned. As a result of these
1/   At 75% availability, this was equivalent to three locomotives.



- 5 -
changes, the "circuit court" became unworkable and the train scheduling
had to be recomputed.  Consequently, the mainline traction needs rose
from the original 2.2 locomotives  to 2.6 locomotives.   SEFICS  could
still have operated with three locomotives but should have maintained
85Z availability consistently, in order to have been able to do so. It
was considered impractical to maintain such a high availability in
Senegal, due to the long lead time needed for procurement of spare parts
and the rather low quality of workmanship generally available locally.
It was  acided to take advantage of the ICB prices to increaie the
number of main line locomotives from three to four but still expect
SEFICS to maintain 70% availability throughout the service life of these
locomotives (which, under West African conditions, wjuld be the highest
consistent  level  on  record).   This  additional  locomotive  was  also
justified on the the ultimate transfer of the phosphate traffic from
RCFS to SEFICS, which is a GOS commitment. However, this transfer has
still not taken place due to GOS's unwillingness to face labor unrest in
RCFS.
3.01      Initially, three shunting locomotives were considered adequate
for the three terminal points at 80% availability.  This meant some
time-sharing  between Dakar  Port  and M'bao.  However,  with  the new
traffic planning requiring all trains to pass through M'bao, the
time-sharing plan was -ot feasible and a fourth shunter was added to
provide "on-demand" shunting at the three terminals.  This additional
equipment cost US$1.1 million equivalent, which was found from the
savings in other categories.
Disbursements
3.08      Disbursements  lagged  behind  appraisal  estimates  because:
(a) SEFICS financed initial payments to suppliers from ICS equity funds;
(b) the dollars rose between appraisal (USS1 - CFAF 220) and the time
the equipment was purchased (USSI - CFAF 370); and (c) except for the
main line locomotives, all other equipment and works were performed by
French contractors, and during this period, the French Franc (FF)
reached record low levels vis-A-vis the US dollar.
3.09      The project had a net saving of US$8.0 million.  The reasons
for the savings were:  (a) sharp rise of the dollar and fall of the
French Franc; (b) non-utilization of the funds provided for signalling
and telecommunications, as the SEFICS staff were actually found to be
better disciplined and hence able to operate the three terminals at a
high level of safety, thereby rendering additional safety devices
redtnidant for the given level of traffic;  (c) deletion of the wagon
maintenance workshop; it was decided to contract with a private mainte-
nance workshop in Dakar for wagon maintenance; (d) considerably lower
cost of upgrading the siding tracks of RCFS due to use of some sec-
ond-hand materials which were deemed to be satisfactory; and (e)
non-utilization of a major portion of the loan allocated to pre-operat-
ing costs and initial work'ng capital.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
A. Traffic
4.01      SEFICS's hauling capacity was initially intended to carry some
800,000 t of traffic, the ultimate transport capacity of ICS. However,
considering the long growth. period of ICS and the depressed world
fertilizer market, SEFICS was in the end designed to carry only
650,000 t. This level was expected to be reached after the first three
years of operation of ICS. Actual traffic grew even more slowly than
this forecast. In 1986, SEFICS carried 535,000 tons, which is about 82%
of its design capacity (Table 2).
B. Operations
4.02      SEFICS's locomotives were admittedly under-utilized as they
ran only an average of 121 km/day (1986) as against 250 km/day for those
of RCFS (1985) (Table 3), but they were much better maintained than
RCFS'.s locomotives with an availability of 89% as opposed to 67% of RCFS
and about 69% in Cameroon, which is a well-managed railway by West
African standards. The workshops were adequate for all normal mainte-
nance up to "annual visits." The staff were better disciplined than
that of RCFS and used the spare parts and equipment prudently. The cost
of maintenance of a locomotive was FCFA 10 million as compared to FCFA
56 million in RCES (para 6.01).  Given that SEFICS's locomotives are
relatively new at present, this maintenance cost could rise to
FCFA 35 million in about five years but it would still be some 35% lower
than in RCFS. These were the significant effects of the private owner-
ship of the industry.
4.03      The availability of locotracteurs was 83% as against 65% of
RCFS and 68% in Cameroon. The wagon availability was 92% as against 74%
of RCFS and 85% in Cameroon (para 6.01).
4.04      The maintenance of wagons by a private contractor, Ateliers
Ferroviaires  de Dakar,  was  efficient.   The  conventional  fears  that
maintenance of rolling stock by an external agency would result in
operational constraints were not borne out in practice.  The cost of
maintenance of one wagon by this private company was FCFA 0.7 milLion
while RCFS, which systematically under-maintains its wagons, cost
FCFA 0.69 million per wagon (para 6.01).
4.05      Maintenance of the terminal tracks was also entrusted to a
private contractor.  The only other precedent is in Cameroon, and both
experiences confirm the feasibility and efficiency of privatized track
maintenance.   The quality of maintenance  is good, but precise cost
comparisons are not available.  Both wagon and track maintenance are
instances of successful utilization of the private sector in railway
maintenance, a powerful lesson for Senegal as well as for the developing
countries.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Income Statements
5.01      SEFICS's  financial  situation  is  intimately  linked  to  the
performance of ICS.  Therefore, SEFICS's performance during the first
two years of operation, 1984/85, essentially reflects the slow start-up
of ICS, as the tonnages transported by SEFICS for ICS have been signifi-
cantly lower than expected. The basic financial arrangements between
SEPICS and ICS had been devised with the objective that SEFICS would
neither incur book losses nor make profits, but still earn a reasonable
return on fixed assets.   ICS pays SEFICS exactly the full cost of
transport, including all working expenses, depreciation and amortiza-
tion, financial charges and provisions for renewal (set at 4% of the sum
of all other expenses). Tariffs are set at the beginning of every year
on the basis of SEFICS's budget; at the closing of the year, a comple-
mentary payment by ICS, or conversely, a drawback payment from IS, is
effected to balance exactly SEFICS's actual expense by income.
5.02      This formula, whereby SEFICS is guaranteed not to make any
losses, does not provide much incentive for SEFICS to become on its own
more efficient, or, conversely, does not impose any penalty for poor
productivity. On the other hand, SEFICS is, at least at the beginning,
much limited by its status of a quasi-operating department of ICS rather
than of an independent sub-contractor.   Recause of RCFS's dominating
position with a monopoly for all other freight traffic, SEFICS has not
until now been in any position to find other customers: SEFICS is thus
limited to one unique customer, ICS, and is thus dependent on the
fluctuations of ICS's demand, with little leverage for negotiations and
little flexibility.   Also,  as an organization,  SEFICS is very much
integrated in ICS's structure (including buildings, financial manage-
ment, administration, personnel management), which results in savings in
overheads but, at the same time, makes SEFICS's administrative efficien-
cy directly dependent on ICS's  efficiency.   Changing  the financial
arrangement between SEFICS and ICS would be justified only if SEFICS
could expand its operations to other traffic than the sole transport for
ICS.
5.03      SEFICS's income statements for 1984, 1985, and the first six
months of 1986, are summarized in the table which follows.  Detailed
income statements, comparing actual results with appraisal forecasts are
shown in Table 4.

Tonnage handled was 20% and 22% below forecast, respectively, for 1984
and 1985; total unit cost per ton was, respectively, 59% and 17% above
appraisal  forecast.   Variable  costs are more  or  less  in  line with
forecasts, but fixed costs are higher in absolute terms and are spread
over lower volumes of traffic. Because of the high fixed costs (which
represented 77% of total costs in 1985), of which little can be cut in
the short-term, SEFICS can hardly improve its results unless it trans-
ports larger volumes (either for ICS or other customers).  The results
have been improving in 1986 as traffic for the first six months in-
creased by 13%.  As traffic is still 30% below SEFICS's capacity, the
total cost per ton of transport is still about 26% above the forecast
cost at full capacity.
5.04      Overall, the actual traffic between 1984 and 1986 has been 21%
below  forecasts.   The gap between these actual and forecast  figures
reflects the gap between actual and forecast sales/production of ICS.
The projections of ICS's industrial consultants were too optimistic bv
underestimating starting difficulties of the industrial plant and market
downturns. In addition, SEFICS is burdened by the fixed costs (depreci-
ation and final charges) related to the acquisition of the fourth
locomotive.   As long as SEFICS cannot  find additional traffic,  this
heavy burden will be supported by the ICS traffic only. Unfortunately,
the willingness of the Government to allow SEFICS a share of the phos-
phate traffic from RCFS has been overestimated.   If no solution can be
found to increase SEFICS's traffic, SEFICS will have to find alternative
ways tc reduce its fixed costs, for example, by selling or leasing its.
fourth locomotive to RCFS.
Balance Sheets
5.05      SEFICS's actual balance sheets from 1982 to 1985, compared
with appraisal forecasts, are shown in Table 5.  On the basis of the
long-term financial arrangements between SEFICS and ICS, whereby the
financial burden is, in fact, borne by ICS, SEFICS has been from the
onset financed with a high debt-equity ratio of about 85:15.   While



- 9 -
total project cost was lower in US$ than forecast at appraisal, SEFICS's
total fixed assets expressed in FCFA, are uipon project completion about
20% higher. than forecast, because of large variations in the FCFA/US$
exchange rate. Current assets and current liabilities are substantially
higher than forecast. In particular, while cash was very low, accounts
receivables were very high, about 10 months of revenues as of Decem-
ber 31, 1985 due to ICS's difficult financial situation. Because of its
very tight cash situation, ICS delays as much as possible in payments to
SEFICS, and the latter makes short-term loans back to its parent company
using available  cash by delaying its payments  to suppliers.   As a
result, the financial covenant whereby SEFICS's cash should amount to at
least 25% of current assets was not fully complied with in 1985.
Improvement of SEFICS's working capital can be expected only after an
overall improvement of ICS's financial position.
ICS's Financial Situation
5.06      ICS's performance has been poor, leading to a critical situa-
tion after two years of operations, as cumulated losses reached
FCFA-23 billion (US$61 m) against a capital of FCFA 25 billion. Total
sales in 1985 reached only FCFA 25 billion, about 20% below forecast,
mainly because of much lower than projected sales price of phosphoric
acid due to the depressed world market. With little improvement in the
world market situation in 1986 and ICS's results 2/, a drastic financial
restructuring plan had to be proposed to ICS's shareholders and lenders,-
with a package of about US$100 m of additional equity, rescheduling of
existing loans, new loans, and reduction in energy charges for ICS.
Continuation of ICS's activities, which is critical for the Senegalese
economy, will be assured when this financial restructuring plan will be
accepted and implemented by the parties involved, hopefully in 1987.
Financial Targets and Covenants
5.07      Except for the covenant requiring SEFICS to maintain its cash
at not less than 25% of its current assets as explained above, SEFICS
has generally complied with the various financial covenants, i.e.,
current ratio of not less than 2.0, and debt-equity ratio of maximum
84:16, and minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.25.  The special
reserve for renewals is being built up at an annual rate of 4% of total
operating expenses, and working ratio remained in 1984-85 well below the
limit of 60%.
Audits and Financial Management
5.08      Audits were carried out regularly and generally within the
agreed time limits, and were satisfactory with the auditors providing an
unqualified opinion.  SEFICS's accounts are well kept in close collabo-
ration with ICS's accounting department; SEFICS's financial management
is de facto, controlled by ICS's staff.
2/   Net losses are estimated at FCFA 16 billion on sales of FCFA 23
billion in 1986.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      The  institutional  performance  of  SEFICS,  as  noted  under
Sections IV and V above, was better than that of the publicly-owned and
operated  RCFS.  Though  some comparative  figures  have  been  provided
earlier the following table provides a quick comparison of SEFICS and
RCFS in operational efficiency in 1985-86.

(viii) Average Cost of Transport (FCFA/t km)               15.36       20.46
/a RCFS's costs are lower because of insufficient maintenance.
6.02      The managers of SEFICS, as soon as they were exposed to the
work ethic in a competitive situation, adapted quickly to.the challenges
of the new situation and became more result-oriented than before. The
reasons were:  (a) better incentives;  (b) higher accountability in the
private sector environment; (c) higher staff discipline down the line;
(d) more  effective  authority  of  the manager over  the  subordinates;
(e) clearer definition of results expected; and (f) no union interfer-
ence. All these motivations were lacking in RCFS.
6.03      However, even with experienced and sensitive management of
this type, two weaknesses were apparent:  (a) tendency to recruit more
staff than necessary; and (b) inability to de-link past loyalties from
current  responsibilities.   However,  through  repeated  discussions,
management began gradually to appreciate the need for stricter control
on staff recruitment both in quality and quantity, and the need for a
watchful attitude towards the quality of operational coordination
obtained from RCFS.  But such a sensitization in respect of (b) above
was slow to take root. It was clearly seen in the manner in which the
rights of SEFICS, in day-to-day train operations, train punctuality and
priorities, accident enquiries, etc., were subordinated to the pressures
of RCFS. SEFICS managers are continuously learning on the job and their
exposure to commercial practices, management training in institutional
structure, flows of authority, negotiating techniques and personnel
management would help them to be better equipped to handle the problems
in a private sector company.
6.04      The workshop  staff  and  train drivers  benefitted  from  the
expatriate workshop supervisor who has established regular preventive
maintenance routines and trouble shooting practices.



- 11 -
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      Economic evaluation was not carried out at the time of ap-
praisal as this project was part of a larger program. However, a brief
economic evaluation has been carried out by comparing SEFICS's transport
costs with those which would have been incurred by RCFS if the latter
had been chosen to transport ICS's products. Admittedly, RCFS's costs
are not well documented and are therefore not susceptible to precise
breakdown. On the premise that either SEFICS or RCFS would have had to
incur the same investment costs and the same interest charges, the
economic evaluation would consist in comparing the variable costs per
t.km incurred by SEFICS with the incremental costs per t.km to RCFS had
the latter been asked to undertake this operation.  On the standard
assumption that RCFS's variable costs are  75% of total costs,  the
average variable costs per t.km is approximately 15.36 FCFA/t.km (in
1985) of SEFICS as opposed to 20.46 FCFA/t.km of RCFS.  After making
allowances for RCFS's costs being understated due to inadequate mainte-
nance, high accident costs (one locomotive and about five wagons per
year) and frequent traffic interruptions (about 30 days/yr), RCFS's
costs could increase to 26.6 FCFA/t.km.  Comparison with the adjusted
cost gives an ERR of about 13%.
VIII. ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      It was envisaged that the precedent set up by the establish-
ment of SEFICS would lead to progressive privatization of other streams
of RCFS's traffic. When SEFICS was well established and its operating
efficiency was no more in doubt, several attempts were made to open a
dialogue with the GOS to discuss the transfer of the 1.2 million t.p.a.
(average) phosphate traffic from RCFS to SEFICS, but the Ministry of
Equipment and the Senior Management of RCFS, in their anxiety to avoid
labor unrest in RCFS, have not responded positively. These inhibitions
entertained at the highest political level effectively prevented
SEFICS's management from bidding to the Phosphate Company for the
phosphate traffic in competition with RCFS, even though the Phosphate
Company was willing to evaluate the bids purely on a commercial basis.
8.02      While the privatization initiative has admittedly not proceed-
ed further, the transport sector dialogue has gained from this project,
as it has succeeded in demonstrating the large efficiency gains that can
be attained in the state-owned railway company if it were better run, as
well as in sensitizing the Government and the management of RCFS to the
stark reality that unless the RCFS's staff productivity and institution-
al efficiency are substantially increased in the short-term, financial
bankruptcv would be imminent even in spite of new investments to attract



- 12 -
traffic 3/. In the light of this new awareness, the dialogue took on an
urgency in 1986 in the context of the Structural Adjustment Loan and
Transport  Sector  Project  under  preparation.   As  a result,  the GOS
reached certain "landmark" agreements with the Bank in December 1986, on
(a) reduction of investments on track rehabilitation from US$88.0 m to
US$36.0 m; (b) abandonment of all new investments other than those
contained in an agreed investment plan; and (c) willingress to close
down branch lines, if pre-determined trials prove them to be uneconomic.
These are major changes in the GOS's rail policy, the like of which had
not been seen in two decades, and the origins of these far-reaching
reforms can be traced to RCFS's awareness of the gravity of its finan-
cial situation partly induced by the success of SEFICS as a competitor.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      Overall, this project was a success to the extent of provoking
the above-mentioned shifts in railway policy. Possibly, in the future,
the lessons learned from SEFICS may find a wider application in the
reorganization of international containe- traffic to Mali.  1Kowever,
that would require not only more time but much greater effort to bring
about a consensus in both railways for such innovative solutions like a
commercially mandated international transport company either wholly
private or with a significant private participation.
3/   On this crucial issue of privatization, the Ministry of Equipment
has made the following observation on this report: "The authors
have sought to demonstrate the advantages of privatizing the
railroads... However, it should be noted that comparison of results
cannot provide a convincing argument in favor of privatization...
These two enterprises (SEFICS and RCFS) are not of the same size,
do not have the same institutional framework and what is more, they
operate in totally different economic and social environments...
RCFS has to compete with the highway, despite personnel and
infrastructure costs, which are hard to reduce..." This comment
reflects the concerns and the position of the Government stated in
para. 8.01 above.

Comments on PCR
SEFICS Railroad Project
(Loan 2C25-SE)
The SEFICS Railroad Project PCR traceG the origins of the project
and describes its progress up to the present time.
The authors have sought to demonstrate the advantages of privatizing
the railroads, to make the authorities more aware of those advantages, and to
encourage them to orient their efforts to rehabilitate Regie des Chemins de
Fer du Senegal (RCFS) in that direction.
However, it should be noted that comparisons of the results of
SEFICS with those of RCFS cannot provide a convincing argument in favor of
privatizing, even less completely dismantling RCFS.
These two enterprises are not the same size, do not have the same
institutional framework, and, what is more, they operete in totally different
economic and social environments.
SEFICS is a small subsidiary of ICS, with new equipment, and,
moreover, the monopoly of an assured and profitable market, while RCFS has to
compete with the highway, despite high personnel and infrastructure costs,
which are hard to reduce.

ANNEX I
Page 3 of 3
The profitability of SEFICS is closely linked to that of ICS; a
slump in the world fertilizer market could seriously endanger the life of this
entity, regardless of the competence of its managers.
Ho1aver, it is gratifying to note that the Senegalese authorities
are reluctant to transfer phosphate haulage from RCFS to SEFICS, and that they
have signed an agreement with the World Bank to redefine the railroad's future
role, based on a study whose findings should lead to a compromise on the
social and commercial concerns of the different parties.
