I.       Introduction
Hebei Province will seek US$ 150 million from the World Bank to develop the Hebei
Urban Environmental Project, which includes water supply projects in Tangshan and Handan
cities, and wastewater treatment projects in Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Handan cities. The total
investment is RMB 2,6 billion, of which US$150.0 million will come from the World Bank loan,
while the rest will be raised by corresponding host cities. Table 1 summarizes the basic
information of the project components.

Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Handan are located in the Hai River Basin. The Hai River
syst:em is experiencing serious water pollution due to large amount of wastewater discharged
directly to watercourses without treatment. The water pollution control plan for the basin has
been enlisted in the Comprehensive Water Pollution Control Plan for Three Rivers (Huai River,
Hai River and Liao River) and Three Lakes (Chao Lake, Tai Lake and Dianchi Lake), issued by
the State Environrnental Protection Administration (SEPA) of China.
Based on the Circular on Strengthening Environmental Impact Assessment Management
for Construction Projects Financed by International Financial Organizations (Huanjianzi [1993]
No.. 324) and requirements of the 'Operational Policy 4.01: Environmental Assessment
(OP4.01 )', the PMO of the Hebei Urban Environmental Project required that the sub-project host
cities entrust environmental assessment institutions to compile environmental impact assessment
reports for the individual sub-projects. The PMO has also entrusted the Center for
Environmental Assessment (CEA) of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences
(CRAES) to compile the Environmental Impact Assessment Report of the overall Hebei Urban
Environmental Project (HUEP).
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for Tangshan urban environmental
project were compiled by the CREAS, and the EIA reports for Shijiazhuang and Handan urban
environmental projects are by the North China Civil Design and Research Academy (NCCDRA),
in accordance with TOR for EIAs approved by State Environmental Protection Administration
(SF,PA). The EIA for individual sub-projects are categorized as Class B. TORs of the overall
EIA has passed technical review and approval of SEPA. The category of the overall EIA of the
Prcject is determined to be Class B.
The overall EIA report (draft) was compiled on the basis of the EIA reports of the
individual sub-projects and submitted to the World Bank mission for reviewing in Oct. 1998.

The EIA report (final version) bas been approved by the SEPA in November 1999, in which
significant attention was paid to the concerns of the World Bank missions.

III.         Baseline Data
Shijiazhuang City:
Shijiazhuang city is the capital of Hebei Province, and one of the key industrial bases in
North China with major industries in textile, construction material, coal and metallurgy.
4



The Futuo and Xiao Rivers are two major water courses near by the urban area. The Xiao
River flows eastward through the south of urban and converges into Fuyang River at Aixin
village site downstream of Handan city. The Xiao received municipal and industrial wastewater
from the counties and cities along its course. Wastewater in Shijiazhuang urban area is almost
entirely discharged into the Xiao through the Dongming channel, Ximing channel, and the
master drainage channel. The Xiao has become a de facto wastewater discharge channel.
Artificial channels in this area are the Shijin channel, Dongming channel, Ximing channel,
Ximing channel Yuanmingcun channel and the master drainage channel, all of which are a part
of the combined system. Monitoring data collected during the period of 1994A1996 show that
water quality of the Xiao is not in compliance with Class V with water quality parameter of DO,
CODcr, BOD5, volatile phenol and oil. However, the concentration of heavy metals meet
standards for Class V. The monitoring data collected at the section between the master drainage
charnel and Shiban bridge on the Xiao River from November 1997 to March 1998 confirms this.
There are four drainage systems serving urban areas, the West Bridge sewerage system,
East Bridge sewerage system, Changan sewerage system, and the North drainage system of
Shijin channel, none of which are completely separate system. The total length of open channels
amount to 37.443 kin, and flood-proof dikes amount to 32 km. There are 20 sewage pump
stations.
Tangshan City
Tangshan is one of the largest industrial cities in Hebei Province. The hydrologic region
of TIangshan is divided into the Luan River basin, Shadou River basin and Jiyunhe Canal
collective respectively. The Douhe river crosses the central area from north to south, and flows
into the Bohai Bay. The main stream length of the river is about 121.5km and the collective area
is 1.340 km2.
The Douhe reservoir was built on the upstream of Douhe River some 22 km away from
central Tangshan. The storage of the reservoir is about 515.2 million m3 with a collective area of
446 km2. While the effective capacity is about 73.8 million m3. The Douhe reservoir mainly is
filled by the Panjiakou and Daheiting reservoirs via the water conveyance system from the
Daheiting reservoir to Douhe reservoir. Currently, the Douhe reservoir is the major water supply
source, which was designated to be the drinking water protection zone for Tangshan City in
1994. Water quality is good meeting standards for Class II, except for pH and CODM" which is
slightly higher than standard at times. Heavy metal contents are comparatively low, and Hg, As
and Cr'+ are all below detection limits. Volatile phenol, total cyanide (toxicology parameters)
arid oil concentration are also below detection limits. However, the excess quantities of nitrogen
and phosphorous are leading to eutrophication in the reservoir, due to the unlimited development
of box-fishery in the reservoir during last years.
Qinglonghe Stream is a seasonal stream without base flow. The inner urban reach is
highly polluted as inadequacy of wastewater treatment capacity in the western part of the central
city. The collective area upstream of the inner urban reach is 18.26km2. The monitoring data
collected downstream of the urban reach in 1995 show that concentration of CODcr, BOD5,
NH3-N is 106mg/l, 266mg/l and 22mg/l respectively. Also, the monitoring data collected in
5



April 1998 indicates water quality is poor, not meeting the standards for Class V, however, the
contents of heavy metals are lower, as no heavy metal sources are in the area.
Since the 1980's, due to overdraft and the increased drainage in the mine pits, the
groundwater level is depressed year by year. In urban districts, the maximum annual rate of
decline was 6.5m, and current groundwater level is as deep as 60 m below ground in central
urban area.
The wastewater drainage of Tangshan central is divided into the east separate sewerage
system and the west separate sewerage system. The east sewerage system serves for the east part
of the central Tangshan, while the west sewerage system serves the western sections.
The newly constructed secondary treatment plant with capacity of 150,000 tld (East
Suburb WWTP) serves the east collection system. Also, the secondary treatment plant under
construction with capacity of 150,000 t/d (North Suburb WWTP) will serve for the east sewerage
system. Both raw wastewater and treated wastewater in the east system are discharged into the
Douhe River.
The West Suburb WWTP with capacity of 36,000 t/d is serving for the west part of central
Tangshan. Wastewater volume in the west drainage system is about 90,000tld and is expected to
reach 155,200 t/d by the year 2005. The wastewater is all discharged into the Qinglonghe
Stream.
Handan City
The industry of Handan focuses on coal, metallurgy, power generation, building material
and textile. The city GNP ranks 4th in Hebei province in 1996.
Fuyang River originates from the West. Mountains of Handan, and flows through Handan
urban area from south to north. The total length of Fuyang river is 403 km, with the watershed
area at 20,539kM2. Downstream of the Handan urban district, the Zhe River, Qin River and
Shuyuan River converge into the Fuyang River. Dongwushi reservoir is located on the upstream
of Fuyang River with storage of 152 million m3 and is used as a water supply for Handan
industry and irrigation. The average annual inflow of the reservoir is about 366 million m3. Qin
River is a tributary of Fuyang River, and flows into the urban area from west and then converges
into Fuyang River at the site of Contai road in the city. The total length is about 35.9km with a
watershed area of 147 km2. Currently, Qin River is highly polluted.
Yuecheng reservoir is located at the middle stream of Zhang River, on the border of Hebei
Province and Henan Province, with a watershed area of 18,1 Ookm 2. The storage of reservoir is
about 1.22 billion m3, while the effective capacity is about 673 million m3. Yuecheng reservoir
is used as flood control, irrigation and municipal water supply, as well as aquaculture. It
provides water to Handan city and Anyang city, and irrigates a crop area of 1.56 million Mu.
The inflow water is Zhang River, which originates from Taihang Mountain and Taiyue Mountain
of Shanxi Province. Downstream Yuecheng dam, the river converges with Wei River which
drains into Bohai Bay. The length of Zhang River is about 179 km. The average annual flow is
about 1.99 billion m3 upstream of the Yuecheng reservoir. The quality of Yuecheng reservoir is
6



quite good, meeting Class II standards. However, the excess quantity of non-ion ammonia
occasionally occurs as it did in 1996A1997. Water quality of the Zhang River upstream of the
Yuecheng reservoir was effected by the wastewater discharges from the townships and small
industries, sometimes falls into Class IV or class V standard. Through pollution control efforts,
water quality of the Zhang River upstream of the Yuecheng reservoir complied with Class III
stan(lards in 1997.
The existing machine-drawing wells are generally mining groundwater in a mixed
approach. It is estimated that the comprehensive recharge volume for the Quaternary layers is 40
million m3/year. Currently, the annual exploitation volume is 32 million m3.
The inner city rivers are highly polluted, and fail to meet the standards for Class V, caused
by a large amount of untreated wastewater discharge into the river courses. The major pollutants
are CODMn, BOD5, volatile phenol and oil. The quality of Fuyang river upstream the inner urban
reac;h fall into Class IV-V standard, and is not suitable for drinking water purpose.
There are 3 municipal water plants (No. 1, No.2 and No.4 water plants) pumping
groundwater with a total capacity of 24,500m3/d, and one plant intake for water from the Fuyang
River (No.3 water plant) with a capacity of 120,000m3/d. Due to the backward status of
equipment, No. 1 water plant was shut off in June 1998.
There are two separate drainage systems in the Handan urban areas. One is Tiedong
drainage system, serving for the area bordering by the Jingguang railway, Remin road and
Fuyang River, including industrial wastewater and sanitary sewage. The existing East WWTP,
with capacity of 100,000 t/d with triple-oxidation ditch process, serves this system. Current
treatment volume is about 60,000 t/d.

IV.    Environmental Impacts
The analysis and assessment of the overall EIA report focused on the major potential
envilronmental impacts . For municipal water supply projects, the EIA focused on the reliability
and safety of the drinking water source, both water quantity and quality. The EIA for wastewater
treatment projects focused on the impacts of odor, sludge disposal, and the improvement of the
inner urban rivers. The potential adverse impacts during construction period were analyzed as
wel l. No additional effort was spent on collecting the existing environmental quality data of the
project areas. However, to clear up some ambiguous description in the individual EIA reports,
the on-site investigation and discuss were carried out in order to provide a comparatively
accurate and definite description for the overall EIA report. Table 5 to 9 summarized the major
environmental issues of all project components.

The EIA report indicates that all project components are priority projects in the host cities.
The project implementation will improve the conditions of urban water supply, wastewater
collection and treatment to a considerable extent, consequently, improve environmental
conditions and the quality of life. The project will helpful for the cities to achieve sustainable
development socially and economically. The project will relieve the tight status of municipal
water supply, improve urban hygiene conditions and environmental quality. It will also benefit
the protection of groundwater resources and recovery of surface water body, and improve the
living conditions and drinking water safety of the urban residents. The treated wastewater could
be suitable for irrigation application in the downstream areas. The proposed projects in the three
cities are major components of the "Blue Sky, Clear Water and Green Land" program in Hebei
9



province during the "Ninth Five-year Plan", and will provide a solid foundation for the
improvement of open image of the three cities and the realization of sustainable economic
development. The positive impacts are summarized in Table 10.
Water quality of the Douhe reservoir (in Tangshan city) and Yuecheng reservoir (in
Handan city) complies basically with Class II of surface water quality standard (GB3838-88).
Water quality in Panjiakou and Daheiting reservoirs upstream of the Douhe reservoir fully
complies with Class II of GB3838-88. The Douhe reservoir is experiencing eutrophication.
However, the reservoir would be in middle eutrophication by strengthening environmental
man-agement as anticipated in the specific EIA report. Requirements on the protection measures
for the water source sites are presented in the overall EIA report. It is predicted that water
quality of Douhe and Yuecheng reservoirs would not make it worse than its current comndition,
and eutrophication will be alleviated with the implementation of environmental management
measures. Municipal water supply capacity from Douhe reservoir and Yuecheng reservoir is
limilted within the regional water allocation quota. The proposed Tangshan water supply project
will not have impacts on agricultural water supply and other water users. However, Handan
urban water supply project would cause the impacts on irrigation water applications both
downstream and upstream of Yuecheng dam. It is suggested that the strategy of water resource
application for Zhang river should be adjusted to balance the requirements of water users by the
Handan Government. Measures such as increase agricultural input and water-saving irrigation
technologies are needed to solve the problem of water scarcity for irrigation.
All proposed sites of water treatment plants and WWTPs are in compliance with land use
of the urban master development plans. Noise would be limited within the plant borders. Sludge
from water purification plants would be transported to municipal sanitary landfills with
dewatering, and used as covering material. The majority of sludge from WWTPs would be
disposed of in a municipal sanitary landfill, while a small portion would be used as soil additives.
All sanitary landfills built with leachate treatment facilities. It is also suggested that a
comrprehensive sludge utilization plan should be prepared as early as possible.
The impact in construction phase is generally limited within the construction areas and
could be minimized by the rational arrangement for construction activities with mitigation
measures, but there would be insignificant effects on the living of residents and agricultural
production. The implementation of HUEP will not involve large scale relocation of residents.
The permanently acquired lands, as well as damage to a small patch of orchards and some
dismnantled facilities will be compensated through one-time payment. Compensation for
temporary land occupation of crop fields and/or trees chopped down during pipe laying is also
being arranged. Public participation indicated that the majority of people consider the adverse
effects caused by construction activities to be acceptable.
In the overall EIA report, requirements on audit and monitoring of industrial wastewater
discharge within the service area are raised to ensure that influent wastewater to the collection
system would be in compliance with CJ1 8-86 standard without adverse effect on operation of
WWTP. There are various industrial pollution sources within the service area of Shijiazhuang
East Bridge WWTP and Handan West WWTP, and thus audit and monitoring on industrial
wastewater are of special importance. The adverse effects and the proposed mitigation measures
are summarized in Table 11.

V.       Alternatives
Implementation of the HUEP project will enhance urban water supply and
wastewater treatment, improve urban environmental quality and life quality of the
residents. After implementation of the project, water supply capacity in Tangshan, and
Handan city will be raised by 150,000m3/d and 1OO,OOOm3/d respectively, and wastewater
treatment capacity in Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and Handan will be raised by 500,000
m3/d, 120,000 m /d and 100,000 m3/d respectively. Priority for urban water supply is a
fundamental strategy in China; extension of urban wastewater treatment capacity is the
major component of mitigating urban water pollution; promoting balanced or
synchronized increase of water supply and wastewater treatment capacity is the basic
policy of the Word Bank in supporting urban infrastructure construction.
For the individual water supply projects, Tangshan and Handan are facing an over
exploitation of groundwater, serious groundwater recession in urban area and
groundwater pollution to different extents. Groundwater pumping should be limited for
sustainable use, instead of further exploitation. Therefore, an alternative for satisfying
the sustainable increased demand for municipal water supply is to develop surface water
supply capacity.
Within the proposed wastewater treatment service areas of Shijiazhuang, Tangshan
and Handan, the major portion of the wastewater is municipal sewage. Sole dependence
on industrial pollution control will not solve the urban water pollution completely. The
improvements of the water quality of inner rivers and the public health rely on the proper
wastewater collection system and adequate wastewater treatment facilities. Also,
wastewater reuse is an most important issue in water management for the future since
Hebei Province is a water scarce area. The proposed secondary wastewater treatment
plants will provide a solid foundation for these cities to achieve such targets. Therefore,
the construction of WWTPs in the three host cities is the best way to handle urban water
pollution and wastewater reuse.
The alternatives for the selection of scale, site and process have been addressed in
respect of the actual situation in the pre-feasibility studies and EIA documents. The
proposed schemes in the pre-feasibility studies are the optimized using technical,
economic comparison, and the environmental impacts..
VI.      Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
The construction period of the Project is about 6 years. Based on construction
contents, the major engineering of water plants and WWTPs would be separated into
three phases of ground leveling and land excavation, construction of buildings, and
equipment installation and adjustment. The environmental reports should be submitted to
the local environmental protection agencies according to the engineering phases of plant
construction and pipe laying. The report should include engineering schedules, major
engineering contents and methods, the implementation status of mitigation measures and
actual environmental impact.
16



For water supply projects, monitoring will focus on the quality of the reservoirs.
The monitoring items include normal monitoring parameters in GB3838-88 and
eutrophication items (TN, TP, turbidity, chlorophyll a and Suspend Solids). The
environmental management will emphasis on protection in the water source area and
strict implementation of Management Rules on Drinking Water Conservation Zone. The
local government and the environmental protection organizations will be able to
implement this responsibility.
For wastewater treatment projects, monitoring during the operation period includes
air quality (H2S, NH3), influent and effluent (volume, CODcr, BOD5, SS, TN, TP,
volatile phenol, cyanide and coliform group, etc.), sludge (volume, water content and
heavy metal) and water quality of the receiving rivers (Xiao river, Qinglonghe stream,
Shuyuan river and Fuyang river). The wastewater auditing is a key component of
management measure to ensure the effective operation of the wastewater treatment
plants. It is recommended in applying proposed prevention and mitigation measures in
the overall EIA report, that registration and recording of wastewater discharge volume
and quality and pretreatment facilities of all discharge units within the service area should
be done, and service contract s be signed between the wastewater treatment companies
and the discharge units to stipulate wastewater discharge volume and quality and raise
specific wastewater auditing and monitoring requirements. During the operation, the
environmental management organization should provide an annual environmental
monitoring report before the end of January of the next year.
VII.    Public Consultation
The public consultant for EA took place at the sub-project level by individual EA
units with the methods of request forms, discussion meetings and random interviews.
The results indicated that governmental agencies, experts and the residents in the related
areas had a clear understanding of project benefits and potential adverse effect. Most
think the adverse effects are tolerable and favor project construction on the whole.
From the suggestions and comments collected, the public was especially concerned
about the following issues:
* Water price and wastewater treatment fee;
* Water supply quality and protection of the water source;
* Funding for the proper operation of WWTPs and efficiency of WWTP;
* Wastewater reuse;
* Whether the projects could be finished as scheduled;
* The compensation on land requisition and occupation.
The above information indicated that environmental awareness of people in the
project area is fairly well developed. Questions regarding project cost, water price,
wastewater treatment fee has been conveyed to the owners and feasibility study
institutions of the sub-projects. Issues regarding water quality, protection of water
sources, wastewater treatment results, treated wastewater use and compensation on land
17



occupation have all been addressed in EIA reports of the sub-projects and the overall EIA
report to different extents.
VIII.   Conclusions
Environmental impact analyses indicates that the proposed water supply and
wastewater treatment projects have priority in the host cities. The implementation of the
1]LUEP project will improve municipal water supply and wastewater treatment capacities,
upgrade urban environment and living conditions of residents and provide an improved
investment environment in these cities to a considerable degree. Also, the
implementation of HUEP will provide a proper background and strong support for the
social and economic development in these cities. The environmental and social benefits
are significant. The implementation of HUEP will also provide solid support to achieve
the environmental target of Hai river basin issued by SEPA of China.
Impacts during constructions phase are generally limited to the construction period
and construction sites. Such impacts can be minimized through rational construction
arrangement and proper protection measures, and there will be insignificant impact on
living condition of the residents or agricultural production in the project areas. No large
scale of resettlement is connected with the proposed project. Affected persons are
limited. Compensation for permanent and temporary land occupation are already
arranged. Public consultant indicated that the most of inquired person considered the
temporary impacts during construction period are acceptable.
Site selection of the water plants and WWTPs are in compliance with the master
urban development plans in related cities. Noise will be limited within the plant
boundaries. Sludge from water purification with dewatering will be transported to urban
landfill sites for use as covering soil. A large portion of sludge cake from wastewater
treatrnent plants will be disposed to the landfills, while some of will be employed as a
soil amendment.
For the water supply projects, the water sources are basically in compliance with
Class II standard of GB3838-88. To maximize project benefits and ensure drinking water
safety, environmental management for Douhe and Yuecheng reservoirs should be
strengthened according to Water Pollution Prevention and Management Regulation on
Drinking Water Sources.
The proposed water supply volumes of Tangshan and Handan cities are in
compliance with the regional water resource allocation agreements signed by the state
council, without effect on the other administration. Tangshan central water supply
projects would have no impact on irrigation or other water users. However, the
implementation of Handan water supply project would cause some adverse effects on
irrigation water supply upstream and downstream of Yuecheng dam during extra-dry
year. Investment and attractive policies should be given to develop water-saving
irrigation in these areas by the local government.
18



Public consultation indicated that the inquired governmental agencies, independent
experts and the majority of the residents considered that the proposed project would have
significant benefits in improving living conditions of the residents, perfecting urban
appearance and promoting economic development, and thus they are in favor of
constructions of the HUEP project.
The following summarizes the major suggestions:
I Environmental management should be strengthened in the water source areas, and
responsibilities for related agencies should be clarified. It is suggested that Handan
municipal government make a cooperativr agreement with Anyang city and the
authority of Yuecheng reservoir to build a protection zone and enforce environmental
regulations for drinking water sources of the Yuecheng reservoir.
2 The implementation of Handan water supply project will cause limited adverse
effects on the irrigation areas upstream and downstream of Yuecheng dam. It is
suggested that Handan government should adjust the strategy for water resource
application of Zhang river over time, and develop an attractive policy to support
development of water-saving irrigation to minimize adverse effects on irrigation.
3 The upgrading of wastewater collection systems should be implemented with the
construction of wastewater treatment plant to ensure the wastewater in service areas
would be drained into the wastewater treatment plant on time.
4 Strengthen monitoring on influent to the WWTP and stress management of the
automatic control equipment and instrumentation with a countermeasure plan for
abnormal influent cases.
5  Strengthen wastewater auditing and monitoring in the service areas to ensure the
influent complies with the standards of CJ16-86;
6 Sludge should be disposed of in a sanitary landfill timely. A sound plan for
Shijiazhuang WWTP's sludge utilization should be carried out as early as possible for
reducing the landfill volume occupation. It is recommended that the proposed
sanitary landfill of Handan be built prior to operation of the proposed wastewater
treatment plant. It is suggest that the capacity of composite fertilizer manufacture of
Tangshan be designed as large with the technical and economic feasibility for
reducing the landfill volume occupation. Also, for Tangshan WWTP, the raw sludge
should be treated with lime before land fill.
