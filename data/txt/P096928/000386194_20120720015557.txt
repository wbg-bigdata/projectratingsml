F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The specific development objectives of the PRSC 4-6 series were to support the acceleration of real
growth and a reduction in the incidence of poverty in Benin through three pillars:

 (i)   improving the policy environment for private investment and infrastructure;

 (ii) pursuing progress toward the MDGs by improving access to basic services and ensuring greater
      efficiency of public expenditures on human capital formation; and,

 (iii) promoting better governance through financial management, civil service and justice reforms.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The PRSC 4 to 6 series was approved in May 2007 and provided support over the period
2007-10. The series was designed to support implementation of the Government’s second PRSP
(SCRP II), which was adopted in April 2007 and covered the period 2007-2009. The reform
policies supported by PRSCs 4-6 were embedded in and closely aligned with Benin’s SCRP II.
In the fall of 2010, Benin suffered its worst flooding experience in 50 years. In response to the
floods, a Supplemental Financing to PRSC-6 was provided and this ICR covers that operation as
well.

The series was set in a context where Benin’s macroeconomic performance had been
broadly on track over the past years, but economic activity had been recently adversely
affected by major external shocks arising in 2004. Real GDP growth had averaged 5 percent
over 2000-03 (compared to 4 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa more broadly). However, in 2004-
2005, poor performance of the cotton sector given declining international prices and more
vigorous efforts by Nigeria to reduce unofficial imports from Benin led to a slowdown in
economic growth (3 percent growth in 2004 and 2005) and a decline in exports. Economic
growth recovered to 4.1 percent in 2006 reflecting a rebound in cotton and services sectors.
Inflation was broadly contained, averaging 2.9 percent over the 2003-2006 period, and while
inflation was low, Benin’s competitiveness had weakened due to appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate, as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar against the Euro to which
the CFA is pegged, and delays in the implementation of key structural reforms.

Despite a 10 percent decrease in export volumes and higher oil prices, the external current
account deficit (excluding current official grants) had narrowed from 8.6 percent of GDP
in 2003 to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2006 as a result of lower formal sector oil imports and weaker
capital goods imports. Consequently, the overall balance of payments improved slightly from
0.4 percent of GDP to 4.7 percent of GDP over the same period.

Fiscal consolidation had been a major achievement through the early 2000s. Fiscal revenue
had been consistently increasing and in 2006 was approximately 16.8 percent of GDP. Over the
same period, total government expenditure had also been slowly increasing and reached
approximately 20 percent of GDP due to the increase in poverty-reducing outlays in line with the
implementation of the initial SCRP. As such, fiscal discipline was broadly maintained, with the
overall budget deficit (excluding grants) contained to about 4 percent or less of GDP annually.

During 2000-2006, in line with PRSP priorities, the Government had progressively
increased the budgetary allocation for basic services. The share of total budget appropriations
allocated to basic education, health and rural water increased from 26.0 percent on average in
2000-2002 to 28.7 percent over 2003-2005 and reached 30 percent in 2006. However,


                                                1
constraints faced by sector ministries in budget execution, namely long delays in procurement
processes and resultant cuts in public investments, limited the full implementation of sector
programs. The 2007 budget, the budget adopted immediately prior to PRSC-4 approval,
reflected SCRP II objectives and pursued overall reforms in public expenditure management,
making a special effort to raise the level and quality of social expenditures, increase absorptive
capacity, and enhance resource management in these sectors.

Looking forward at that time, the Government’s macroeconomic framework over the
period 2007-09 was perceived to be consistent with the objectives of accelerating growth
and reducing poverty. Under the assumption that the Government was going to be successful
in deepening institutional and policy reforms and tackling difficulties in the cotton sector and
other structural problems, economic growth was expected to progressively recover from 3.4
percent in 2004-2006 to 5.1 percent in 2007-2009 while inflation was expected to remain in line
with WAEMU convergence criterion at less than 3.0 percent on average.

It was thought that economic growth would be driven by a rebound in cotton production
initiated by the completion of the reforms in the sector, higher trade volumes with Nigeria
following a progressive lifting of trade restrictions, and by an increase in transport
activities underpinned by a resumption of traffic at the Port of Cotonou as new investments
helped restore the port’s regional competitiveness. Growth performance was also seen to be
sustained by an ambitious public works program that would bring the investment-to-GDP ratio to
22.0 percent over 2007-09 from 18.9 percent in 2004-06. The external current account deficit
was projected to narrow from 7.4 percent of GDP on average over 2004-06 to 6.0 percent on
average over 2007-09. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) was expected to widen from
3.6 percent of GDP on average over 2004-06 to about 4.3 percent of GDP over 2007-09 due to
implementation of social and development expenditures in the context of SCRP II. Total
government expenditures were seen increasing by about 2.0 percentage points of GDP over the
period under review, supported by higher revenue and MDRI resources.

In March 2003, Benin qualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Debt cancellation under the HIPC initiative and a prudent
borrowing policy helped the country to maintain its external debt situation on a sustainable path.
The external debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 58 percent in 2000 to 42 percent at end 2003.
Benin was also one of the first 19 countries to graduate from the HIPC Initiative and received
100 percent cancellation of their eligible debt under MDRI, effective as of July 2006. Benin’s
MDRI eligibility reflected its satisfactory economic performance, progress in implementing its
Poverty Reduction Strategy and improvements in public expenditure management. Total debt
relief from IDA, the IMF and the African Development Bank amounted to approximately
US$1.1 billion or 23.2 percent of 2006 GDP (60 percent of which was provided by IDA). MDRI
reduced total public debt to 13 percent of GDP at end-2006.



                                                2
External financing requirements at the time were estimated to be US$217 million in 2007,
resulting in an estimated total financing gap of US$112 million after projected debt relief. This
gap was expected to be more than fully covered by disbursements from the Millennium
Challenge Account (MCA) and annual disbursements from multi-year budget support programs
from the African Development Bank (US$21.4 million); the European Union (US$20.9 million),
and other development partners (USS19.5 million). The US$40 million equivalent for PRSC 4
constituted part of IDA’s contribution to filling the remaining gap.

As was the case with the first PRSC series, the second series was intended to cover one
PRSP cycle and be synchronized with the Government’s budget cycle. The PRSCs were
seen as providing an anchor for the Bank’s overall support to Benin’s policy and institutional
reform and public expenditure priorities. Each individual PRSC was to be put in place and
disbursed on the basis of the up-front completion of a set of prior actions that demonstrated
satisfactory progress on the country’s social and structural reform agenda in support of its
poverty reduction strategy.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The overall objective of the PRSC series was to support implementation of Benin’s SCRP
II. The first series of PRSCs for Benin (PRSCs 1-3) had focused on improving economic growth
and governance through reforms in the business environment, justice, agriculture and
infrastructure, and through public expenditure management reforms in key sectors, such as
health, education and water. The second series was intended to deepen the focus on improving
the policy environment for private investment, including supporting completion of the reforms in
the cotton sector, and infrastructure. The series also supported the Government’s measures to
pursue progress toward the MDGs by improving access to basic services and ensuring greater
efficiency of public expenditures on human capital formation and to promote better governance
through financial management, civil service and justice reforms. This responded to requests
from the public in Benin for improved quality of public services and more transparency in the
use of public resources, as well as from donors in need of strengthened fiduciary standards to
facilitate continued budget support. The PRSC 4-6 series was complemented by other more
specific investment credits in the areas of competitiveness and growth, energy, rural
development, environment and forestry.

The specific development objectives of the PRSC 4-6 series were to support the acceleration
of real growth and a reduction in the incidence of poverty in Benin through three pillars:

   (i)     improving the policy environment for private investment and infrastructure;
   (ii)    pursuing progress toward the MDGs by improving access to basic services and
           ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures on human capital formation; and,
   (iii)   promoting better governance through financial management, civil service and justice
           reforms.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

These development objectives remained consistent throughout the entire series and were not
altered in the development of subsequent operations in the series.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Several reasons underpinned the choice of policies to be supported by the PRSC series. The
focus on improving the policy environment for private investment reflected the findings of the
Investment Climate Assessment, and the 2007 Doing Business Report. These reports highlighted
specific weaknesses related to the business climate and heightened the authorities’ awareness of
the main impediments to private sector growth and the need to address them. In addition, a
Diagnostic Trade Study provided additional insights on reforms needed to raise Benin’s
competitiveness, reduce economic vulnerability and diversify the economy and exports. The
continued focus on social services reflected Benin’s goals on progress toward the MDGs and the
need to increase poverty reduction efforts by strengthening the effectiveness and equity of
service delivery through results-based management and institutional capacity building. The
continued focus on governance was intended to help improve transparency, accountability and
efficiency in budget processes, enable decentralized structures to generate resources
commensurate with their mandate and enhance medium-term planning visibility for sectoral
program budgets.

More specifically, the first in the series, PRSC-4, was designed to support the government’s
efforts at promoting better governance through financial management, civil service and
justice reforms by including the following prior actions: (a) submit the 2007 budget law to the
National Assembly in line with revised MTEF ceilings and PRSP priorities; (b) achieve the
targets set in the 2006 program-budgets in priority sectors/programs; (c) submit to the Council
of Ministers the Procurement Code and the application regulations revised in compliance with
UEMOA Directives No.04 and 05/2005/CM/UEMOA regarding public procurement and
assignment of public services; (d) submit to the National Assembly the 2002 draft “Loi de
Réglement? and complete verification of the 2003 draft “Loi de Réglement?; (e) adoption by the
Council of Ministers of the “Référentiel de Hauts Emplois Techniques? (upper level
management position reference repertory) and the monitoring mechanism, designation of the
members of the monitoring body and submission of nominations to the Council of Ministers;
and, (f) recruit 40 additional judges and 30 additional court clerks and have such 40 judges start
their training at the ENAM.

At the time of PRSC-4 preparation the focus of PRSC-5 was seen as: continuing to support
the above reform areas through the following measures: (a) submission of the draft 2008 Budget
Law to the National Assembly in line with revised MTEF and PRSP priorities; (b)
implementation of the 2007 budget programs for priority sectors including the monitoring and



                                                4
evaluation actions; (c) set up of the integrated public procurement management system SIGMP);
and, (d) submission of the 2003 and 2004 central budget audit reports to Parliament.

In preparing PRSC-5 the program document noted that PRSC-5 would support the private
sector development agenda in improving the business climate and raising the
competitiveness and diversification of productive sectors, complemented by components in
infrastructure services. As in PRSC-4, the proposed operation would support policy reforms,
strategic planning and program budgets in the water, health, and education sectors, and promote
progress toward reaching the MDGs. It was also noted that PRSC-5 would continue to cover
budget system reforms and public sector governance as a means of reinforcing program budgets,
fiduciary standards, and results-oriented expenditure management. This was in response to
private sector requests for greater stability in the regulatory framework, from the public for
higher quality social services, and from the Government for support in building the capacity to
master reforms designed to increase efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources.

The PRSC-6 program document noted continued support for the private sector
development agenda in improving the business climate and raising the competitiveness and
diversification of productive sectors, complemented by components in infrastructure
services. As in PRSC-4 and 5, the proposed operation would support policy reforms, strategic
planning and program budgets in the water, health, and education sectors, and promote progress
toward reaching the MDGs. PRSC-6 would also continue to cover budget system reforms and
public sector governance as a means of reinforcing program budgets, fiduciary standards, and
results oriented expenditure management.

As noted, PRSCs 5 and 6 remained in-line with the originally conceived development
objectives as identified at the outset of the series, and largely in-line with originally
considered policy areas, though some minor modifications to triggers and prior actions were
inevitably introduced into the series in response to the evolving economic, social and political
environment. In addition, follow-up actions in the justice sector were dropped from the PRSC-5
and 6 programs although the prior action pertaining to this sector in the PRSC-4 was met. These
modifications are noted in the following matrices.
1.5 Revised Policy Areas, Prior Actions and Triggers
As the series moved from PRSC-4 through to PRSC-6 the main policy areas remained
largely as originally designed. There was some modification to originally indicated prior
actions and triggers though these were not significant and did not represent substantive
divergence from the originally envisioned actions and triggers. Table 1 presents the policy areas,
prior actions, triggers and indicators and illustrates how they evolved as the series progressed
from one operation to the next. Divergence from original action and triggers are noted in Table 1
in bold type, are numbered in footnote style for ease of reference, and the rationale for changes
in prior actions from originally noted triggers are explained in the paragraphs that follow the
table.

In PRSC-5 some modifications to prior actions were made from the triggers noted in PRSC-4.
These are explained as follows (and refer to the superscripts in Table 1):

   1. The change to this prior action was introduced to improve clarity and to provide more
      specificity to the action. The change did not imply a significant change in policy
      direction, an accommodation to government under-performance or other significant
      modification to original policy intent.

   2. In this case the original trigger was met in late 2007 – earlier than expected. The new
      trigger was formulated to support the next steps in the reform agenda in the electricity
      sector.

   3. The revised measure better reflected the phased transfer of shares in SONAPRA’s
      industrial assets to private control. At the time of PRSC-4 preparation the privatization
      process was not fully detailed and the revised prior action in PRSC-5 thus better reflected
      the decided course of action

   4. This minor change was required to increase clarity and did not represent a meaningful
      change.

   5. The original trigger consisted of two separate actions, the evaluation of the teacher
      redeployment plan and continued teacher recruitment. The evaluation of the
      redeployment plan in ENI was delayed due to capacity constraints and was removed as a
      prior action in PRSC-5, while the action concerning ongoing recruitment was retained as
      originally formulated.

   6. The original trigger considered during PRSC-4 preparation (submission of the 2008
      budget law), was completed prior to PRSC-5 preparation and as such, the revised
      formulation of the prior action in PRSC-5 (submission of the 2009 budget law) reflected
      the timing of PRSC-5.

   7. Similar to the previous modification, the original trigger (implementation of 2007 priority
      sectors budget), was completed and the revised formulation (implementation of the 2008
      priority sectors budget) reflected the timing of PRSC-5.

   8. The revised measure (submission of audit reports to the Supreme Court instead of to
      Parliament as in the original trigger) more accurately reflected the required stages of the
      external audit process.

   9. Final adoption and implementation of the procurement code took longer than originally
      anticipated and hence the revised measure was modified to address one of the main
      bottlenecks in the procurement process while awaiting final passage of the procurement
      code.




                                              12
Similarly, eventual prior actions for PRSC-6 varied from those originally envisaged, but again
the changes did not represent significant policy changes or under performance on the part of the
Government. They are summarized below:

   10. The revised prior action more appropriately emphasized the fiscal decentralization aspect
       of the reform, which was the original intention, rather than the more narrow local level
       NGO contracting aspect of the original trigger.

   11. This revised measure reflected the onset of the 2009 global economic crisis and the need
       to adjust budget expenditures in response to this exogenous shock.

   12. The revision to this prior action reflected the adoption of the Procurement Law by the
       National Assembly and the need for further actions in order to ensure effective
       implementation and functioning of the SIGMP system.

1.6 Other significant changes:

There were two significant changes in addition to the relatively minor policy modifications noted
above; the addition of a Supplemental Financing to the PRSC-6; and modifications to the results
indicators.

1.6.1 Supplemental Financing:

The first significant change was the Supplemental Financing to PRSC-6 in the amount of US$22
million in response to the late 2010 floods. In late 2010 Benin suffered its worst floods in over
50 years. This led to significant losses in terms of economic and social infrastructure, such as
roads, schools and health clinics, serious losses in housing, and large agricultural losses, both to
crops and livestock. Total estimated damages and losses were over CFAF 127 billion (US$ 250
million), with about CFAF 29 billion of the losses and damages being in agriculture, nearly
CFAF 8.5billion in housing, and over CFAF 33 billion to other infrastructure. The Supplemental
Financing provided direct budget support to the Government of Benin in order to augment their
resources as a result of the increased budgetary demands arising from the flood disaster. Without
external financing to cover a significant portion of the flood related financial demands, the fiscal
position could have deteriorated further putting in jeopardy not only the IDA-supported program
under the PRSC-6, but the IMF program as well. Achievement of several performance indicators
under the PRSC-6 would clearly have been at risk in the absence of a rapid and comprehensive
response, including indicators related to: education outcomes, health outcomes, agricultural
production, and access to safe drinking water. While these indicators were, in all probability,
negatively affected by the disaster regardless of the adequacy of the response, a financial
response from the Bank was intended to limit under-performance and more importantly, reduce
the medium and longer term negative impacts that might be exacerbated by a prolonged crisis.




                                                13
1.6.2 Changes to Results Indicators:

A second change was that some expected results selected at the inception of PRSC-4 were rather
quickly observed to be ahead of established targets and some targets were exceeded in the first
year of the series. This arose not primarily as a result of the actions supported by the PRSC
series, but because of favorable global economic conditions and other factors well beyond the
scope of the PRSC series. In proceeding with the subsequent PRSCs 5 and 6, while the task
team desired to maintain the original targets, this was deemed inappropriate as maintaining the
original targets would have resulted in an operation having targets that were below the baseline
and thus already achieved. Furthermore, studies undertaken over the timeframe of the PRSC-4
resulted in different baselines, making it difficult to forecast target numbers in progress and the
need to change originally stated baselines in some instances.

This led to a restating of expected results for PRSCs 5 and 6. Given that the original results
appeared to be well in-hand, the new results were now significantly more ambitious.
Unfortunately, as rapidly as results were surpassed in the case of PRSC-4, they then quickly
began to lag. Again, this was clearly due to factors exogenous to the series, including the food
and fuel price crises, the global financial crisis and in 2010 the devastating floods. The evolution
of results is explored more fully in the next section.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance:

The PRSC series had clearly identifiable and measureable outcome indicators associated with the
policy areas, individual triggers and prior actions. As can be noted in Table 2, results were
mixed with six expected results being achieved, one substantially achieved and four not
achieved.

In assessing program performance and the attainment of these outcomes it should be recognized
that the period covered by this series, 2008-2010 was a period of considerable global economic
instability. This included important fuel and food price crises leading up to this period; crises
which peaked in 2008, the first year covered by the series. Perhaps more consequential was the
global financial and economic crisis, which had a significant impact on Benin in 2009 and 2010.
As such, it is difficult to disentangle the impact of these important negative exogenous shocks on
the achievement of outcomes from the impact of the reforms supported under the PRSC series.
Even set within a benign global and economic environment it can be arbitrary to attribute results
to specific measures, a specific PRSC, or to the program as a whole. In a period of considerable
external shocks attribution becomes near impossible.

This is thus further complicated in this case given the fact that several of the indicators were
considerably removed from the actions undertaken. The linkages between prior actions and
expected results, while certainly evident and logical, were nonetheless rather weak or subject to
considerably more important external influences. For example, prior actions relating to the
implementation of the PSD strategy, tax/customs reforms and land markets reform have a logical

                                                14
link to increased private sector investment, but there are clearly a number of other factors that
could conceivably have as great or indeed a greater impact on this indicator. Similarly,
SONAPRA reform could logically lead to increased cotton production, but again the diversity of
other influences on cotton production (world cotton price, weather, availability of inputs, prices
of competing agricultural commodities, local food situation, etc.) would seem to dwarf the
impact of this single reform. On the other hand several indicators were appropriately targeted
and these tended to be those that were achieved. The case of linking the procurement code,
procurement training and the establishment of an integrated public procurement management
system to a decrease in the time taken to undertake procurement is not only relevant and logical,
but also direct and meaningful.

Furthermore, some of these reforms were simultaneously supported by other complementary
Bank investment operations and donor activities and efforts, and there was active coordination of
the PRSC measures with these other related investments. Many operations were seen as
mutually reinforcing, with measures included in the PRSC series specifically intended to
strengthen and reinforce complementary Bank and other donor activities. As such, this further
complicates attribution, yet fosters mutual accountability, coherence and cooperation.

In this sense, while the achievement of expected results was mixed, the PRSC series clearly
provided value added as a successful instrument in: (1) fostering alignment of Bank support,
across more than just the PRSC instrument, with the Government’s strategy for poverty
reduction; (2) promoting Government ownership and improved coherence between Government
policy and resource allocation with stated PRSP objectives and related action plans, i.e., linking
PRSP priorities to actual policy actions and resource allocations; (3) maintaining policy dialogue
between the Government and the Bank on key economic, sectoral and institutional issues,
including facilitating other donor engagement at the policy level; and, (4) providing a framework
for coordination with development partners, including the IMF through its Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), as well as with other bilateral and multilateral budget support
donors.

Regardless of the difficulty in attributing results in such a mutually dependent and economically
uncertain and unstable environment, the PRSC program did contribute significantly to
reinforcing Government efforts to implement its PRSP and achieve the results noted therein.

Outcome indicators as noted in the original PRSC documents are noted in Table 2 (changes in
outcome indicators as the series progressed are noted in bold type). Individual indicators as
realized and tracked over the period are noted in Table 3.

Progress as noted in the documentation as the series progressed is summarized in the sections
that follow.

2.1.1 Progress Under PRSC-4

Progress under PRSC-4 was achieved in a number of areas. Under PRSC-4, the Government
undertook several reforms in tax administration, notably in the customs area. The reforms,
designed with participation by the private sector, served to broaden the revenue base, strengthen
the macro framework and improve an important element of the business climate. These and
other reforms, such as improvements in land tenure rights, served to launch implementation of
the Private Sector Development policy. The cotton inter-profession was strengthened, allowing
it to play a critical role in subsequent negotiations over the sector’s regulatory framework. The
institutional framework for managing the rural road strategy was adopted, and several studies
were completed to inform choices on specific modalities for organizing its financing.

A model scheme for pooling donor funds for the water sector was set up using the decentralized
budget system for executing the pooled fund. Investment in new waterpoints remained on track.
In the health sector, the inventory of private health facilities allowed documentation of progress
in health service utilization, vaccinations, and attended deliveries, while expenditures from the
Health Fund made services more accessible to the poor. Progress in the education sector
included the recruitment of a significant number of new teachers (beyond the PRSC-4 target)
leading to an improvement in the student teacher ratio and a significant increase in the primary
education gross enrollment rate from 93 to 98 percent.

Under PRSC-4, the Government also succeeded in reducing expenditures by exceptional
procedures to less than 6 percent of total spending. A PEFA diagnostic undertaken in April 2007
documented Benin’s continued progress in instituting program budgets and computerizing
budget systems. The new procurement code was adopted by the Council of Ministers and was,
along with related implementing legislation, submitted for approval to the National Assembly in
2007. Unfortunately, a long delay on this dossier in the National Assembly stalled the follow-on
reforms in procurement. These developments highlighted procurement as a major weakness in
budget execution capacity that has affected program implementation in many sectors. Ex-post
budget audits remained significantly behind schedule, but the delay was reduced from five years
to four. In the justice sector, the first cohort of newly recruited judges neared completion of their
training while the second cohort began training. In addition, the adoption of the upper level
management position registry contributed to de-politicization of the civil service.

PRSC-5 preparation and implementation was delayed following a slowdown in the
implementation of structural reforms seen as vital to economic growth. In early 2008, the
Government laid out a series of objectives for reform in the cotton and infrastructure sectors and
by October 2008 the Government was on track to meeting these objectives. The contract selling
a controlling interest in the industrial assets of SONAPRA, the cotton ginning parastatal, was

                                                 18
approved by the Council of Ministers on October 2 and signed on October 10, 2008. A plan for
stabilizing the finances of the national electricity company was implemented and plans were
developed to adjust electricity tariffs. At the port, arrangements were agreed to provide for
private management of the new facilities built under the MCA. Finally, important reforms were
undertaken in the telecommunications sector, along with the first concrete steps to sell the assets
of the national telephone company. The broadly satisfactory progress made in the advancement
of structural reforms warranted continued IDA support through PRSC-5. Overall, leading into
PRSC-5, the PRSC-4 program was considered to have been implemented in a satisfactory
manner despite temporary difficulties encountered in certain sectors.

2.1.2 Progress Under PRSC-5

Under PRSC-5, progress continued in a number of areas. The Government undertook important
reforms in several domains in order to implement the Private Sector Development policy,
including reforms in tax administration. These reforms, designed with participation by the
private sector, served to broaden the revenue base, strengthen the macro framework and improve
the business climate. Specifically, the Government established the rural electricity fund and
adopted the implementing regulations, which provided regular resources for the fund and helped
extend electricity access to more underserved populations. Furthermore, the Government took
the first difficult step in the phased transfer of SONAPRA assets from the public company to a
new public-private entity, SODECO, which became 33 percent privately owned. The
completion of this phased transfer of an eventual 51 percent of SONAPRA's assets to private
control was completed in October 2009. The Government also simplified administrative
procedures and implemented tax measures to facilitate the creation of companies, import and
export of goods, and the development of the microfinance sector. However, the investment
climate in Benin is improving less quickly than in other countries, and Benin’s ranking in the
2009 Doing Business Report declined (and the 2010 ranking showed no improvement). Benin
remains mired near the bottom of the Doing Business rankings at 170 out of 183 countries and
even slipped to 175th out of 183 countries in 2012.

Progress was made in strengthening private sector participation in water delivery and water
supply systems management, especially in rural areas. At least 30 percent of the village piped
water supply systems were managed under a local Public Private Partnership arrangement. The
development of PPPs between the local private sector and communities contributed to an
increase in access to potable water in rural areas, rising to 50 percent in 2008. As a result, Benin
was on track to meet the MDG related to access to potable water. In the health sector, progress
was mixed. Positive trends realized under PRSC-5 included the free provision of some health
care services for women, in particular free caesarian deliveries. The coverage of children under
five and pregnant women sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets also improved. Worrisome
trends at the time, and continuing today, include the decrease in the utilization rate of basic
health services by children under-five, immunization coverage and the stagnation in the
proportion of attended deliveries. In the education sector, significant progress was achieved in

                                                19
improving access, but quality and disparities in coverage remained as key challenges. The
primary education gross enrollment rate increased from 98.5 percent in 2006-07 to 104 percent
in 2007-08 as a result of the free basic education policy. Under PRSC-5 the Government
responded to the increase in school enrollment by recruiting a significant number of new
teachers, which helped maintain the student to teacher ratio at 47:1. The poor quality of
education was reflected in a decrease in the completion rate to 61 percent, compared with a
PRSP target of 70 percent (although this was due in part to the sudden increase in the schooling
population) and the increase in the repetition rate.

Under PRSC-5 the Government also made progress in implementing the procurement reforms
with procurement training being provided in all priority ministries. In addition, the new
procurement code was adopted by the National Assembly and promulgated in 2009, paving the
way for the implementation of the follow-on reforms. The Government also completed the audit
of the electronic public expenditure systems and prepared a comprehensive action plan to
strengthen public finance management based on the findings of the 2007 PEFA. Use of
exceptional procedures continued to be limited, although it increased slightly to 12.3 percent of
total expenditures in 2008. Under PRSC-5, the backlog on external audits was reduced.
Progress was also made in the areas of internal and external audits with the implementation of a
"harmonized" program of audits by internal oversight structures and the preparation of an action
plan to reduce the backlog in budget execution laws.

Despite these positive steps, further improvements were needed to strengthen the performance of
PFM systems. In particular, budget execution procedures needed to be streamlined, public
procurement capacities strengthened and effectiveness of internal and external audit institutions
increased. In response to the global financial and economic crisis, the government accelerated
and expanded its public investment program as a stimulus to the economy, but the increase in
expenditures in an environment of dwindling receipts required a sharp contraction of public
spending in the second half of 2009 in order to maintain the fiscal deficit within broadly
acceptable limits. This reduced budget execution rates as expenditures had to be better matched
with available receipts – a phenomenon that continued into 2010 and has resulted in very low
budget execution rates.

Overall, the program of reforms supported by PRSC-5 was implemented in a satisfactory manner
despite significant economic difficulties. Expected results however, were largely not as
envisaged, due to the influence of a number of significant external factors.

2.1.3 Progress Under PRSC-6

Similar progress was achieved under PRSC-6. In essence all the prior actions were undertaken
and meaningful reforms continued to be implemented. There were considerable advances in
structural reforms, including the privatization of the national wood company, the national cement
company and a couple of publicly owned hotels. Reforms at the port proceeded with the

                                               20
construction of two new quays, a new container terminal, and their subsequent operation by
private interests. The Guichet Unique was also implemented at the port and a private-public
partnership was set up to operate it. Benin Telecom proceeded through a privatization exercise
though this was not completed as the Government was not satisfied with the eventual winning
bid, considering it to have significantly undervalued Benin Telecom. Efforts to privatize the rail
company, OCBN, were also begun, but have been complicated by the fact that OCBN is a joint
Benin-Niger undertaking and Niger has not yet been willing to fully engage in the process,
though the process and negotiations are continuing.

Supported prior actions in public financial management, procurement and public auditing were
successfully undertaken and have been extended in several areas with continued support from the
Bank and a number of other donors. The Government has been implementing its Action Plan in
Public Financial Management though progress has been slower than expected and slower than
hoped for. Annual joint donor reviews of progress and achievements, during which the
Government agrees to undertake a number of actions and reforms, indicate that typically only
about one-quarter of planned reforms are actually fully implemented within the agreed
timeframe, half are partially implemented, and the remaining one-quarter are not undertaken at
all. Budget execution rates continue to be very low, particularly for investment expenditures,
though this perhaps reflects the need to match expenditures to lower than expected revenues as
much as weakness in public financial management practices. Greater emphasis on public
financial management reform is needed in order to achieve results in other areas where it is clear
that performance is jeopardized by weak government implementation of programs and delivery
of services.

Management of the wage bill and the need for fundamental civil service reform arose as a
pressing need over the PRSC-6 period in addition to further public financial management
reforms. Low wages, poor incentives, on-going strike actions, and a ballooning wage bill all
highlighted the need for civil service reform. This subsequently became all the more imperative
as a 25 percent wage increase for public servants was agreed to in August of 2011. The need for
civil service reform has now become paramount.

In the social sectors covered by PRSC-6, namely water, health and education, performance was
positive in the water sector where supported decentralization efforts continued to demonstrate
very positive results, though performance in health and education sectors somewhat stagnated.
While quantitative indicators have noted modest improvement over the very recent past, after
showing some backsliding during the PRSC-5 period, qualitative indicators have not shown such
improvement. Budget allocations to these sectors have increased, a stated objective of the PRSC
series, and these sectors now account for an increased share of the budget. However, budget
execution rates in these so-called “priority sectors? have been low and indeed lower than the
overall budget execution rate, which again highlights the need for improved public financial
management and civil service reform.


                                               21
Cotton sector reform and agricultural reform more broadly has unfortunately languished, as has
resultant performance of the agriculture sector. Some of this underperformance can be attributed
to a variety of external factors, but much rests with the inability of the Government and the
Ministry of Agriculture (MAEP) to proceed with its reform agenda. Adoption of the Strategic
Program for Agriculture Sector Recovery (PSRSA) has taken far too long and still remained to
be officially adopted. Reorganization of MAEP has similarly been on the books for some time
but has not progressed. Cotton production, which was expected to rise, reached only 40 percent
of the established target.

Again, much of this underperformance can be explained by adverse external factors, including
the serious floods, the protracted global economic crisis, continuing effects of the food and fuel
price crises, and recent subsequent return to high prices for these commodities, etc., but some has
to do as well with less than optimal government performance under the circumstances.

2.1.4 Progress Under the Supplemental Financing to PRSC-6

Given that this was a supplemental financing to the existing PRSC-6, no additional or modified
prior actions or conditions could be entertained and the results during this period are summarized
as above under PRSC-6.

2.1.5 Overall outcomes of the PRSC 4-6 Series

Pillar 1: Improve the regulatory environment and policy framework for private
investment and infrastructure.

Overall progress towards indicators in this area related to levels of private sector investment and
access to electricity. Private investment levels increased initially but fell back at the end of the
period and access to electricity showed slow steady improvement, with neither meeting their
expected target. General consensus would be that improvement in the regulatory environment
and the policy framework for private investment was minimal over this period. Doing Business
indicators were stagnant over the period and Benin remains well ensconced at the bottom of the
rankings (170th out of 183 globally in 2010). As such, it cannot be said that the regulatory
environment facing the private sector has improved, nor has the broader private sector
investment climate. Admittedly however, the PRSC series did not focus on the regulatory
environment as measured by the Doing Business Report and did not directly focus on
government actions related to these measures or related to directly improving these measures.
Nonetheless, these results do indicate that improvement in the broad private sector enabling
environment has been minimal.

Some progress was made however, in structural reforms related to the private investment and
infrastructure regulatory environment and policy framework. Privatization in the cotton and
public utility sectors did move forward. The cotton ginning company was privatized in 2008, a
new agency was established for the centralized purchase of fertilizers in March 2009, and a new

                                                22
global strategy to reform the cotton sector was adopted. The concession for operation of the
container terminal at the Port of Cotonou was awarded in September 2009. The cement
company was privatized/sold to a strategic private investor in March 2010 as was the wood
company (Industrie du Bois du Benin -- IBB). The privatization of Benin Telecom was launched
though not completed. SBBE was also strengthened through two tariff increases (July 2009 and
April 2010) and a restructuring of the company’s debt (March 2010). Consideration of models to
permit private sector participation in the electricity industry and the development of an enabling
regulatory environment is progressing. Land tenure reform is proceeding, though slowly.

Progress was made in access to electricity as access improved from 22% in 2006 to 27.4% at
end-2010, though this remains below the target of 30%. This may be partially explained by
severe reductions in planned public investment over 2009 and 2010 due to the impact of external
economic factors noted earlier and resultant lower than expected government revenues. It can be
noted that access to electricity was on target through the first two years – fully achieving the
25% target by end-2008, but then lagged following the severe cuts in public investment over
2009 and 2010. Nonetheless, the actions supported have helped create a more positive enabling
environment for the electricity sector going forward and should be considered a more positive
development than the measured outcome may at first suggest.

While reform in the cotton sector proceeded, cotton sector results as expected in the results
indicators identified in the PRSC series were disappointing -- though admittedly these indicators
were probably not an ideal indicator of results in this area. Results achieved had as much, or
more, to do with weather conditions and external market forces, as they did with government
regulatory and policy actions.

It should also be recognized that during the PRSC 4-6 period the political environment for
passing and implementing meaningful reforms was difficult.              The President and the
administration did not enjoy a majority in the National Assembly and there was a need to
constantly manage shifting coalitions within the National Assembly in order to pass various
reforms. The situation become increasingly more difficult to manage over the period as the
Spring 2011 Presidential and Parliamentary elections approached and opposition candidates and
parties began to stake their positions. A prime example was the delay encountered in obtaining
Parliamentary approval of PRSC-6, which necessitated an extension to the effectiveness
deadline. To a considerable extent this political situation led to less meaningful reforms than
might have otherwise been achieved over the period and perhaps less rigor in their
implementation.

Pillar II: Pursue progress towards the MDGs by improving access to basic services and
ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures on human capital formation.

PRSC supported decentralization efforts in the water sector were very successful. Funds were
transferred from the center to local communities and were effectively utilized in the provision of

                                               23
potable water services to local populations. PPPs were fostered and there is now significant
private sector participation in the delivery of water with over 30 percent of village water systems
managed under PPP arrangements. Targets for access to potable water in rural areas were
exceeded, while targets in urban areas were basically met – both now over 50 percent. This is
one area where Benin is likely to meet its MDG target.

Progress in education and health were largely commendable. The notable progress achieved in
2007 and 2008 on key health sector outcome indicators were mostly sustained in 2009 and 2010
though not improved upon. The utilization rate of basic health services by the general population
slightly improved, from 45.6 percent in 2008 to 46.5 in 2010, while the utilization rate by
children under-five improved from 76 percent to nearly 85 percent in 2010. Immunization
coverage for children under 11 months stagnated, going from 94.2 percent in 2008 to 94.6
percent in 2010. The proportion of deliveries attended by health personnel remained stable at
about 80 percent. C-sections increased from 4% of deliveries in 2007 to 5.2% in 2009/10 -- a
result of the free c-sections policy implemented in April 2009.

In relation to the outcome targets established at the commencement of the series, PRSC-4, the
indicators for both births attended by a physician and visits to health care facilities by children
under 5 were fully met. However, indicators were made more ambitious under PRSC-5 and the
more ambitious target for assisted births was not met.

Nonetheless issues remain, health workers have spent many days on strike, sometimes without
providing emergency care. More generally, the issues facing the health sector continue to be in
the following areas: (i) persistent management capacity weakness within the MoH at the central
and decentralized levels; (ii) poor quality of services provided in public health facilities; (iii) lack
of skilled health personnel in poor/remote areas; (iv) lack of equipment, pharmaceutical and
medical consumables needed to improve the health status of the population especially in poor
areas; and (v) poor governance in the sector. On a positive note, the MOH has decided to extend
the hygiene and basic sanitation marketing approach, supported on a pilot basis under the PRSC-
6, to the twelve departments of the country; the ultimate goal being to help prevent the recurrent
upsurge of diseases such as cholera and diarrhea that particularly effect children under five. The
coverage rate of household latrines reached 44.4 percent in 2010, against a government target of
37 percent, while the coverage at school level stands at 77.0 percent, against an objective of 66
percent.

In education, enrollment has increased markedly over the last few years, but there has been a
decrease in the primary completion rate. Pre-school enrolment also increased, from 4.5 percent
in 2006-07 to 10.3 percent in 2010. The gross enrollment rate in primary education increased
from 98.5 percent in 2006-07 to 110.6 percent in 2010, following the free basic education policy.
Girls’ participation improved from 92 percent to 106.9 percent. Gender parity is progressing
with girls representing 46.2 percent of total primary education enrolment compared to 44.4
percent in 2005-06. Despite this progress in access, the primary completion rate (PCR)

                                                  24
decreased from 66 percent in 2006-07 to 64 percent in 2010, lagging behind the target of 67
percent. For girls the PCR in 2010 was 57.3 percent against the stated target of 56.0. In line
with SCRP priorities and PRSC outcome indicators, the Government has continued to allocate an
increasing share of its budget to the sector and to implement its free primary education policy
adopted in October 2006. In sum, progress in education has been notable, particularly from a
gender perspective, though challenges remain in ensuring high quality in the provision of
education services while concurrently expanding access.

Pillar III: Promote better governance through public financial management, civil service
and justice reforms.

The Government made progress in strengthening public financial management. A new
procurement code was adopted by the National Assembly though the regulatory framework
rendering the new code effective had yet to be fully implemented. During the PRSC 4-6 period,
the Government completed the audit of electronic public expenditure systems and prepared a
comprehensive action plan to strengthen public finance management based on the findings of the
2007 PEFA. The use of exceptional procedures was reduced as was the backlog on external
audits. Progress was also made in the areas of internal and external audits with the
implementation of a "harmonized" program of audits by internal oversight structures and the
preparation of an action plan to further close the backlog in budget execution laws, which are
now being executed according to an agreed schedule.

Despite these positive steps, further improvements in these areas are needed. In particular,
budget execution procedures need to be streamlined, public procurement capacities strengthened
and effectiveness of internal and external audit institutions increased. While the Government has
instituted a number of measures and reforms intended to improve PFM, the overall perception is
that a great deal more progress is still required. Many of the outcomes, in terms of budget
execution rates, procurement delays, audits delays, cumbersome payment procedures,
transparency in accounts, budget preparation difficulties, and alignment of the budget with the
SCRP, the MTEF, and the PAP continue. The challenge on this front remains largely as it was at
the outset of PRSC-4. It is apparent that the passage of codes, decrees and regulations as
supported by the PRSC series were insufficient to effect meaningful change. Accompanying
actions of a more administrative, managerial or institutional nature, necessary to ensure full
implementation and application of these measures, were not undertaken and followed through
on.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

External Factors

Disentangling the impact of these numerous and not insignificant external factors from the
impact of the PRSC 4-6 series on outcomes is difficult if not impossible. This is complicated by


                                               25
the fact that the outcome indicators were pitched at a level where attribution is difficult to begin
with.

Benin was subject to a number of external factors over the PRSC 4-6 implementation period,
which negatively affected performance. These external influences were not evident at the outset
of the series, were not expected and would have been difficult to predict. These external
influences included the food and fuel price increases of 2007/08, the global financial and
economic crisis (which began in 2008 and continues today), trade policy changes in neighboring
Nigeria, the mid-2010 Ponzi scheme scandal in the microfinance sector, and most recently, the
late 2010 floods. These factors had a considerable direct impact on outcome indicators.

For example, cotton production levels were influenced considerably by global food prices,
encouraging a shift away from cotton toward food commodities. High global petroleum prices
increased the cost of agricultural inputs, most importantly fertilizer prices, and further reduced
yields and planted area in 2008 and 2009. Finally, serious flooding in 2010, despite an increase
in cotton acreage planted, further reduced cotton production.

Private investment levels were also included as an indicator in the series, which in a weak global
economic environment fell over the period. While admittedly the business environment and
investment climate did not improve markedly over the period it would have been very difficult to
experience an increase in private investment even under ideal domestic conditions given the
rather unfavorable external economic environment.

As a final example of the negative influence of these external factors, taken together these factors
lowered economic growth, significantly reduced trade volumes, particularly as a result of
changes in trade policy in Nigeria, and contributed to significantly lower revenue collection than
anticipated. After an early 2009 fiscal stimulus in response to the global economic crisis,
recognition of the lower than expected revenue collection then led to a serious contraction in
government expenditure. Given the persistence of the global economic situation, expenditure
restraint continued into 2010 and 2011. Although this action represented responsible fiscal
management in the midst of a difficult period, the drop in expenditures led to significant under-
performance on many indicators – including indicators tracked and monitored under Benin’s
PRSP and in many of the social indicators monitored under the PRSC 4-6.

Political Factors

As noted earlier, Benin’s political environment over the PRSC 4-6 implementation was less than
ideal for implementation of an ambitious reform effort. While very democratic, Benin’s political
system is characterized by numerous political parties based largely on local affiliations and with
local interests being the main driver of politics. As such, achieving a national vision and
obtaining adherence and commitment to reforms firmly rooted in the national interest is
problematic. Over the PRSC 4-6 implementation period the President and the administration did
not enjoy a majority in the National Assembly and were constantly trying to establish and

                                                26
manage fragile coalitions in order to proceed with their agenda. This limited the scale and scope
of reform efforts. The difficulties encountered in building and maintaining coalitions and
gaining support across parties became more pronounced over the period as Presidential and
parliamentary elections approached in the Spring of 2011.

Following the elections in March and April 2011, the President now enjoys a working majority
in the National Assembly and a number of meaningful reforms have been undertaken in the few
months immediately following the elections. This is perhaps indicative of the constraints that
were operating throughout the PRSC 4-6 period as several reforms that had been languishing
during this period were suddenly passed following the elections and supported by the National
Assembly. These include important reforms such as: Anti-Corruption legislation; a new
agricultural strategy; a new LOLF; implementation of the import verification program; etc. The
political difficulties that were encountered should not be underestimated.

Donor Coordination

While no donors were directly involved in the operation, donor coordination in Benin over the
period was well developed. As all donors were supporting the PRSP process in Benin there were
reviews of PRSP progress undertaken annually. In 2010 this process was moved from
September to June in order to allow for better alignment with the budget process, i.e., so that the
review process could be undertaken in time to inform the next year’s budget preparations. Each
annual review included reviews of each sector and each sector review had a lead donor agency to
assist in coordinating the review process with the authorities. This review process ensured
common messaging to the Government from the donor community.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and evaluation was undertaken largely in a joint-donor context. There is a well
developed annual PRSP performance review process in Benin that is undertaken jointly by the
donor community. This involved annual sectoral reviews across all sectors such as agriculture,
energy, health, education, etc., and culminates in a higher level week long review where
performance across all aspects of the PRSP is reviewed, progress against indicators are
evaluated, additional measures and corrective actions are considered, discussed and determined
and a joint aide memoire is prepared.

The Bank fully participated in this process and allowed for the full integration of Bank PRSC
reforms and considerations into the broader donor engagement process. This led undeniably to
greater coordination and coherence with other donor and other Bank operations and activities
and facilitated policy dialogue among donors and with the Government in a single undertaking.

It also allowed for the monitoring of a common set of indicators and agreement on common
targets and level of ambition. Furthermore, by setting it within the common PRSP review
process it ensured that not only were PRSC objectives, indicators and targets consistent with

                                                27
other donor activities, but that PRSC metrics were completely consistent with Benin’s own PRSP
monitoring framework and process.

Another interesting aspect of this review process is that it brought together senior level
representatives of sectoral/line ministries and central ministries. This facilitated exchange of
information between different line ministries so that not only could they could learn from each
other, but they often presented a common front in addressing concerns to central ministries and
agencies. It appeared that this review process was one of the few opportunities for such cross-
ministry engagement.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

Given the rather moderate and uneven performance under PRSC 4-6, this series was followed by
a single tranche PRSG-7 that was intended to demonstrate clear commitment to a more ambitious
and more meaningful reform effort on the part of the new Government. The satisfactory
performance under the PRSG-7 triggered the ongoing preparation of a new PRSG 8-10 series.
The PRSG-7 and the new series will incorporate the lessons learned from this previous series as
noted in this ICRR.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

The prior actions and triggers supported were directly relevant to the development challenges
facing Benin and the Government’s efforts to address these challenges. The PRSC 4-6
objectives, design and implementation were consistent with Benin’s development priorities as
outlined in the report “Benin: Vision 2025? and the Government’s Second Growth Strategy for
Poverty Reduction adopted in 2007. The reasons behind the selection of policies supported by
the PRSC 4-6 series included, among others: (i) the findings of recent analytical reports
pinpointing the weaknesses of business environment in Benin as evidenced by the deteriorating
rank of Benin in the “Doing Business? report, the findings and recommendations of the
Diagnostic trade study performed in 2007 and the Country Economic Memorandum completed
in 2009; (ii) the need to accelerate efforts in order to meet the MDGs as Benin at that time was
likely to meet only one of the targets (primary school enrollment); and (iii) weak governance at
the central and decentralized levels was an impediment to effective budget planning and
execution, mainly due to corrupt fiduciary practices within the public administration. The series
was also designed as an integral part of the Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
endorsed by the Board of Directors in July 2003. The CAS identified key non-lending activities
aiming to strengthen the fiduciary environment in Benin (PEMFAR, CPARs, etc.) which
informed the reforms designed in the series

The PRSC 4-6 series was a follow-up to the previous PRSC 1-3 series and was designed to
deepen initiated reforms and finalize supported reforms in the cotton sector and infrastructure.
                                               28
The PRSC 4-6 series was also complementary to investment projects and programs in the private
sector, human development, energy, water, decentralization and in public sector reform (public
procurement and financial management reforms essentially).

However, while supported actions and triggers were relevant in and of themselves, they
addressed a rather broad swath of issues, including: PFM; agriculture; health; education; water;
justice reform; and private sector development. In hindsight it is clear that better results may
have been achieved if the supported reforms went somewhat deeper rather than being so broad.
Furthermore, the supported actions did not necessarily represent a coherent series of actions
where reforms in one area complemented and reinforced reforms in other areas. As such, the
supported actions and triggers present as a series of rather independent stand-alone actions rather
than a well-designed coherent set of actions jointly contributing to common objectives.

The series design and implementation could also have benefited from the establishment of
targets and indicators that were set at a level more directly aligned with and attributable to the
supported actions. As examples, annual cotton production and the level of private sector
investment in Benin is influenced by factors far, far beyond the actions supported by the PRSC
series. Finally, the restatement of outcome targets half way through the series was also less than
ideal.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives:

The overall development objective of the series was to support the acceleration of real growth
and a reduction in the incidence of poverty in Benin. Real growth unfortunately over the period
did not accelerate (3.8% in 2006, 4.6% in 2007, 5.0% in 2008, 2.7% in 2009, 2.6% in 2010, and
3.1% in 2011). Poverty data however, showed some progress – 35.2% of households below the
poverty line in 2009 compared to 37.2% in 2006. Female headed households appear to have
done better – 30.4% in 2009, improving from 36.1% in 2006.

Of course, this period 2007 through 2011 was a period characterized by significant negative
external growth shocks, including the fuel price crisis in 2008/09, the food price crisis in 2008,
the general global economic downturn and global financial crisis which began in 2008 and is
continuing, and the 2010 floods, the worst floods in 50 years. Set in this highly unfavorable
external environment, while these high level results appear marginal, one could clearly have
envisaged much worse outcomes. Achievement of these modest results in this context can quite
possibly be commended.

While the ultimate objective was to increase growth and reduce poverty, attribution at this level
is clearly limited. The following subsections detail the achievement of those development
objectives that are more directly attributable to the PRSC series.

Improve the Regulatory Framework and policy environment for private investment and
infrastructure (Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory)

                                                29
In broad terms it would be difficult to say that the policy environment for private investment and
infrastructure improved over the course of this PRSC series. Benin remains mired near the
bottom of the Doing Business Indicators ranking though this is admittedly a less than perfect
measure of the investment and business environment. Recent developments in 2011/2012
suggest more positive prospects and the efforts and dialogue undertaken over the PRSC 4-6
period and continued in subsequent series may finally be bearing fruit. The institutional
framework was strengthened in 2011 with the staffing of the Presidential Investment Council
(CPI) with qualified experts and the adoption of an action plan for improving DB indicators. A
one stop shop for starting a business was established in March 2012 and fees for starting a
business were restructured and reduced. The Government is preparing a Public Private
Partnership Law with Bank support and the dialogue platform between the public and private
sectors is being enhanced with technical support from the World Bank Institute. Parliament
adopted a new Code for civil, administrative and social procedures in 2011 and the new Code
was implemented in March 2012. The new provisions include, among other things: (i) a new
procedure to request enforcement of past judgments; (ii) the introduction of a Managing Judge
("Juge de la Mise en Etat") in charge of supervising cases at early stages of litigation; and (iii)
introduction of an Enforcement Judge ("Juge de l'Exécution"). In addition, the traditional way of
serving a defendant with a summons has been complemented with the possibility for the plaintiff
of introducing a complaint by submitting a request to the court. The Code of civil, administrative
and social procedures has also set a one-month time limit for decisions rendered pursuant to
summary proceedings.

Additional court professionals, such as registrars and judges, have been hired who will be
assigned to newly created commercial divisions of the Court of First Instance. In parallel, Benin
has continued to computerize its courts in order to enable case management and faster delivery
of judgments. A new court was also established in Allada, easing the workload of Cotonou’s
Court. These new developments will accelerate the process of enforcing contracts in Benin, one
of the weakest areas for Benin among its Doing Business indicators. In sum, efforts may have
finally resulted in significant change and the policy dialogue and foundation laid in the PRSC 4-
6 series may have contributed to this new-found reform momentum and commitment.

However, the results of this series indicate that to render the policy environment fully effective
and to generate a private sector investment response requires more than just the passage of
decrees, strategies and policy measures. It requires effective implementation and supporting
complementary actions by the Government and others. A PRSC series can only go so far in
meeting this demand and must itself rely on synergies and coherence across its supported actions
and on complementary Bank, donor and Government activities.

In the energy sector, some improvement was noted thanks to the financial and operational
restructuring of the public electricity company (SBEE), which posted a profit in 2011, after
decades of financial losses and dependency on public subsidies. The latter were curtailed and it is
expected that energy tariffs will be stabilized at a level that maintains SBEE profitability. A new

                                                30
regulatory framework was also established in January 2012. Accordingly, a new pricing
mechanism based on oil prices, exchange rate, inflation and energy supply from abroad was
implemented and will likely prevent recourse to public subsidies in the future. As noted earlier,
access to electricity increased over the program’s time period, initially as expected, but then at a
rate lower than expected following severe cuts in public investment resulting from the need to
reduce public expenditures following a period of lower than expected revenues.

The prior actions and triggers supported by the series and which focused on this development
outcome were appropriate and timely (see Table 1), though perhaps being somewhat diverse and
less than fully focused and coherent across actions and triggers. As such, while individually the
actions were in themselves advisable and well-targeted on important, meaningful and timely
policy issues, as a comprehensive set of mutually reinforcing actions aimed at a single objective
they may have lacked some coherence and synergy. Furthermore, policy intentions were
certainly admirable and the actions supported represented critical policy measures that needed to
be undertaken and that may now be resulting in significant results. However, implementation
was sometimes weak, slow and exposed capacity constraints that led to less than fully
satisfactory attainment of expected results within the timeframe expected.

Cotton reform provides an example. PRSC-4 included the following action: “Implement
remaining reforms in the cotton sector, which include: (a) ex-post analysis of the first campaign
under the regulatory framework; (b) consolidation of all the cotton producers’ associations; (c)
start a gradual removal of restrictions on cottonseed exports; (d) define the roadmap for the sale
of the industrial assets of SONAPRA to a new company made up of the private sector, the
producers, the workers and the State, indicating the participation of the bidders to the process,
begin roadmap implementation, and confirm the termination of the previous privatization
process.? PRSC-5 followed with: “establish a new public-private mixed corporation with the
ginning assets of SONAPRA and in partnership with a private operator that owns at least thirty
three percent (33%) of the shares of this new corporation.? PRSC-6 completed the actions by
supporting: “completion of the phased transfer of shares of SONAPRA to private control.?
However, while all of these prior actions were completed, implementation and ongoing
developments in the sector did not go as originally planned and the mode and manner of
SONAPRA privatization eventually diverged considerably in the end from the original plan. The
PRSC-5 prior action requiring establishment of a public-private entity with at least 33% private
ownership was fully completed as required. Unfortunately, the Bank’s complementary Cotton
Sector Reform Project ended four months prior to the privatization of SONAPRA and significant
on-going TA and capacity building support throughout the on-going process did not continue.
As a result, the public-private company very quickly evolved into a fully private company with
essentially all the ginning assets controlled by a single operator, which simply established a
private monopoly in place of a public monopoly with little net benefit to cotton producers.




                                                31
Other policy measures intended to contribute to the attainment of this objective experienced
similar evolution. The PRSC-5 prior action to “institute a single tax identification for individuals
and legal entities? was a laudable and important reform. This action was completed and TINs
were available, but the process of obtaining a TIN was not fully rolled out and mandated to
ensure maximum effectiveness and impact. As of 2011, the TIN (tax payer identification
number), while existing, was still not even applied to public servants on the public payroll. It is
presently being rolled out at border crossings where all importers are now required to have a
single TIN and all new businesses beginning in 2012 are issued a TIN together with their
business registration documentation. So progress is now eventually accelerating.

As another example, the idea of establishing a “zone franche? to encourage export oriented
industries was again a supportable idea, and was included in PRSC-4. The zone franche was
established and demarcated as required by the prior action, and some businesses have located in
the zone. However, the delivery of services to the zone such as the provision of water and power
lagged significantly and while the zone remains open and functional, it is vastly under-utilized
because necessary accompanying services such as water and energy access are still not fully
available.

In sum, achievement of this development outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The prior
actions supporting this development objective were important and they were fully completed.
They were clearly necessary to effect an improvement in the policy environment for private
investment and infrastructure, but they were notably insufficient to make substantial progress in
strengthening the business climate over the timeframe envisaged and they lacked necessary
supporting and complementary actions. Positive results in the electricity sector over the program
period and more recent developments in the broader business enabling environment indicate that
efforts undertaken in the PRSC 4-6 series are now belatedly having a positive impact.

Pursue progress towards the MDGs by improving access to basic services and supporting
greater efficiency of public expenditures on human capital formation (Rating: Satisfactory)

Some progress has been made toward attaining the MDGs in Benin. In terms of those areas
supported by this series (water, health and education), significant progress was made in meeting
the MDG related to water and this remains currently one of the few MDGs that Benin is likely to
fully meet. Prior actions to support decentralization in the provision of water services by having
water systems built and managed by local communities under PPP arrangements (PRSCs 4 and
5) and by encouraging local communities to partner with local NGOs (PRSC-6) proved very
effective in situating water services decisions closer to the populations affected by such
decisions. This improved not only access to water services, but ensured greater efficiency in
service delivery. Involving local communities through support for decentralization resulted in
improved investment decisions, greater oversight, increased local ownership and improved
accountability for water-related decisions and management of available resources. This was a
marked success.

                                                32
Health outcomes were also positive. Both health indicators met their original targets, though not
the revised targets. Unfortunately, while some progress was made efforts to decentralize health
services as supported by the PRSC series did not achieve the same high level of success as did
similar efforts in the water sector. Institutional arrangements in the two sectors are different and
may account for much of this difference. Nonetheless progress was made.

Education outcomes were mixed. Significant progress was made in extending access to an
increasing proportion of school age children, including girls, but completion rates did not
improve as much as desired. In 2010 the gross enrollment rate had increased to 110.6% from
93% in 2006 and for girls from 85.9% to 107 percent. Completion rates stagnated at 64% in
2010 from 65% in 2006, though improving for girls from 54.3% to 57.3% over the period. There
is an apparent trade-off between access and the quality of education services (measured by
completion rates) as extending access by hiring many new, inexperienced teachers and stretching
resources perhaps too thin has resulted in far greater access, but a decline in quality of education
services offered. The prior actions included in the series focused on the recruitment and
engagement of primary school teachers, which was accomplished and thus improved access
markedly. However the indicator chosen to measure results was quality of education based
(completion rates) and as such appears not to be attained – though it was attained for girls.
Nonetheless, the engagement of a significant number of new teachers (in excess of 1,300) did
dramatically improve access, particularly for girls.

In sum, this broad development objective could be considered as achieved at a satisfactory level;
very positive results in improving access to water, solid improvement in access to health services
and significant gains in access to education services, though quality the of educational services
did not improve as expected.

Promote better governance through public financial management reforms (Rating:
Satisfactory)

Continual and steady, if unspectacular, progress in public financial management was made over
the PRSC period. PRSC supported prior actions in budget management and accountability, in
particular in aligning the annual budget with the MTEF and the PRSP, were successful in
improving the budget planning process and raising awareness of the need for a more rigorous
budget planning process. The annual budget process now incorporates the MTEF process and
program-based budgets are prepared by sectoral ministries, though the consolidated budget is not
presented as a program-based budget. While budget planning has improved, as supported by the
PRSC prior actions, budget execution has made less progress. The procurement measures
supported by the series have improved procurement performance in terms of reducing
contracting times, though transparency and accountability in procurement processes remains
problematic. In addition, while the passage of a procurement code was a necessary and
important action, other supported actions related to procurement training and a public


                                                33
procurement information management system, although no less critical, were weaker and subject
to greater implementation risk.

Furthermore, given the significant external economic and natural shocks that arose over the
period and the pressure this put on government capacity to maintain macro stability in the face of
lower than anticipated revenues, increasing public sector wage pressures and social demands,
implementation of public financial management reforms did not receive the necessary ongoing
attention that was expected at the beginning of the series. Management of the food and fuel price
crises, the global financial crisis, the 2010 floods, the Ponzi scheme scandal in the microfinance
sector and the social unrest caused by public sector wage demands diverted government attention
from its reform program. Nonetheless, all outcome indicator targets were met despite the
challenging circumstances.

Civil service reform made little to no progress as Government commitment was lacking and
responsibility for civil service reform was diffused across several ministries, particularly the
Ministry of Finance and the Civil Service Ministry. Without a champion, without a central
institution responsible for planning, designing and implementing the reform measures and
without high level political commitment, progress in this area was very limited. The measure
supported by PRSC-4 was a single independent action that was not followed up by subsequent
actions and did not form part of a broader civil service reform approach supported in subsequent
operations.

Similarly, in the justice sector, the recruitment and training of 40 judges and the recruitment of
30 additional clerks was a one-off measure and no additional reforms measures were further
supported under the PRSC5-6 regarding the justice sector. While the country continues to benefit
from other donors support in the justice sector, under the Support to Justice Sector reforms
project, the overall judicial system is still very weak, failing to improve the governance
environment in Benin. While a lack of judges was a constraint in the judicial system, there were,
and are, many additional constraints in this area that would need to be simultaneously addressed
in order to make meaningful progress.

More recently, Parliament adopted in October 2011 the Anti-corruption Law, which had been
under preparation and discussion since 2006. The authorities are now preparing for adoption the
implementation Decrees and a National Anti-Corruption Authority should be created and
functional in 2012.

Finally, the political situation was such that the President did not enjoy a parliamentary majority
over much of this period. Over the President’s mandate 2006 through 2011 he was able to
manage shifting coalition majorities in Parliament over some periods. This occurred to a greater
extent earlier in the mandate as compared to later in the mandate. As a result greater reform
progress was possible, and was indeed evident, earlier in the series than later. As the mandate



                                                34
progressed, maintaining political coalitions became increasingly difficult and toward the end of
the mandate and this series, Parliament posed a significant roadblock to many reforms.

As a result, achievement of this development objective could be considered satisfactory,
particularly in light of the difficult political and external environments. An outside observer
would note steady and moderate improvement in public financial management over the period,
though little to no improvement in civil service reform.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating is based on relevance and PDO achievement. While the PRSC series was very
relevant to the economic, political and social context at the moment of implementation, a series
of significant external shocks and political developments affected the achievement of
development outcomes. Prior actions and triggers were modified over the series to account for
some of these dislocations, but the influence of these external factors was such that development
objectives became very difficult to attain. It is recognized that the influence of this, or any,
PRSC series on high level development objectives can be dwarfed by the influence of factors
external to the series and can be difficult to overcome regardless of Bank or Government efforts.
The counterfactual is of course difficult to assess, i.e., how much worse performance might have
been in the absence of the PRSC series and the related ongoing policy dialogue. The relatively
moderate impact of these sizeable external shocks on Benin’s macroeconomic performance, its
performance relative to some of its regional neighbors and continued progress in some areas
despite the impact of the shocks, provides some evidence that performance was perhaps better
than results may at first reflect. Hence, the moderately satisfactory rating.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The PRSC 4-6 series supported key reforms which had a significant impact on household
revenue in Benin. The reforms in the cotton sector aimed to increase productivity in the sector
and cotton households are predominantly poor. The authorities also removed school fees in
2006, and school grants, which are mainly used for operating costs, have become more important
and constitute the main source of school budgets. In 2011, the FTI-FCB program transferred
grants to all preschool and primary schools to procure learning materials. Authorities also
adopted in 2011 a free health care for children and pregnant women with malaria policy, which
will contribute together with the removal of school fees to address non-income dimensions of
poverty. The Bank is currently preparing a poverty assessment which will provide more insight
on those impacts.




                                               35
Over the period covered by the series significant improvements were made on gender issues,
including in areas directly supported by the series. At the broad level, poverty among female-
headed households dropped significantly. Access to health services for women improved,
caesarean services were offered free of charge, access to education for girls increased markedly
and primary school completion rates for girls also improved. The considerable achievement
under the series in improving access to potable water also had a likely important impact on
women, though this has not been quantified. A poverty assessment is currently being undertaken
and should provide greater insight into gender issues and the conditions facing women over this
period.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening:

The institutional development impact of the policy reforms actions implemented under the PRSC
4-6 series was substantial. Specifically, capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to
identify and monitor key policy reforms across sectoral ministries was strengthened. Also, the
series supported important institutional changes with the involvement of private sector in the
cotton and port sectors and the acceleration of the decentralization process, which improved the
delivery of basic social services at the local level.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Political conditions for implementing sensitive reforms (Ports, Cotton, Civil service, etc.) in
Benin have improved markedly. The President now enjoys a coalition majority in Parliament
and in his final mandate appears to be clearly committed to effecting meaningful and permanent
change. Reform momentum in many of the areas covered by this PRSC series has increased.
Subsequent series will build on some of the measures supported by PRSCs 4 to 6 to consolidate
gains. However recent developments (Spring 2012) in the cotton and Port sectors, the main
drivers of growth in Benin, are of concern and may jeopardize recent gains and reform
momentum.

The external environment continues to pose substantial risk to the attainment of objectives.
Global economic conditions remain weak. Although Benin is not necessarily significantly
directly affected by economic conditions in Europe, as financial sector links are minimal and
trade linkages become less important as Benin continues to expand trade with developing and
emerging market countries, Benin does rely heavily on trade with Nigeria and economic and
policy changes in Nigeria can have a large impact on Benin. Thus to the extent that global
economic conditions necessitate policy changes and affect economic performance in Nigeria this
will affect Benin.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The identification and design of the PRSC4 --6 series were firmly grounded on government
development objectives embedded in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSC
series was well conceived, focused on important and timely reforms and was very well aligned
with Benin’s PRSP, the Bank’s CAS and was complementary to and supportive of other Bank
operations in Benin. Risks were well identified: political risks (lack of parliamentary majority)
and political resistance to reforms; external economic risks; and capacity constraints. These risks
in the end had a large bearing on eventual outcomes and performance. As the series progressed
each successive operation attempted to accommodate recent developments and the developing
risks by modifying prior actions and triggers.

The Bank’s response to the 2010 floods by providing timely Supplemental Financing to the
PRSC-6 was important in helping the Government manage the fiscal burden associated with the
floods and addressing the associated social and humanitarian needs.

However, as noted previously the series could have been more focused in order to strengthen
effectiveness and in this regard could have supported a reform program that went deeper rather
than broader. Furthermore, there was little coherence across the various actions and this also
may have led to less than optimal outcomes. Finally the results framework could have been
better identified by identifying results indicators and expected outcomes that were more
attributable and situated closer to the actual prior actions and supported triggers.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Actual supervision could be considered highly satisfactory. There was a well established process
for evaluating performance, following up on the Government’s reform program and regular
policy dialogue around the reform measures included in the series. The review process involved
the broad donor community and ensured coherence and coordination across various donor
activities. This included both annual reviews of broad SCRP (PRSP) performance, but also as-
needed sectoral reviews to review progress.

Furthermore, in the preparation of subsequent operations, i.e., in preparing PRSC-5 following
PRSC-4, there was clear dialogue with the authorities around progress to date on those measures
included in the prior PRSC-4 operation. The series was consistent in focusing on specific reform
areas across operations and therefore, preparation of subsequent operations necessitated and

                                                37
included review and supervision of the prior operation. As such, supervision and preparation
activities are somewhat indistinguishable between individual operations.

Unfortunately, in this context supervision activities were not always formally identified as such
and within the documentation it is difficult to disentangle supervision from preparation across
the individual operations. Despite this inability to directly access supervision documents, it is
evident in BTORs, PRSP reviews, joint donor reviews and in PADS that supervision was
ongoing and comprehensive. As such, while supervision was well done, a better job could have
been done in documenting the supervision activities.

Finally, altering the targets in mid-series once there were initial positive results was perhaps not
advisable. It would have been preferable to maintain the original targets established at the
inception of the series and it is unfortunate that this was deemed unacceptable at the time PRSCs
5 and 6 were prepared.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This rating reflects high relevance and good quality at entry, an appropriate response to changing
circumstances in subsequent operations, if perhaps insufficient to overcome difficult external
forces, incorporation of an effective response to the 2010 floods, as well as sound supervision.

5.2 Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government, through the technical unit in charge of budget support operations at the
Ministry of Economy and Finance, ensured an adequate follow-up of policy matrix
implementation. As such, the Government actively engaged in effective policy dialogue around
the supported reforms at the central ministry level and made progress on triggers, with some
minor deviation, as the series progressed. However, involvement of sectoral ministries around
the dialogue on supported reforms was somewhat limited and recurrent cabinet changes in Benin
over the period also did not allow for a fully sustained policy dialogue.

As noted earlier however, Benin was subject to important external shocks that may have diverted
the attention of the authorities from the full implementation of some of the measures and
certainly in following up with complementary reforms that, though not part of the PRSC series,
would have led to greater realization of stated objectives. Given capacity constraints within the
Government and the need for the Government to respond to important exogenous shocks,
performance could be considered satisfactory despite the fact that results were only partially
attained.



                                                38
For example, lower than expected trade related revenues over the period and increased wage
pressures constrained non-wage recurrent expenditures. As such, this created an environment
where results were difficult to achieve, such as primary school completion rates as student
enrolment rates increased rather markedly, yet expenditures were constrained. In spite of these
difficult circumstances some progress was made and triggers were largely respected over the
course of the series.

Again, the counterfactual is difficult to quantify, i.e., in light of the difficult circumstances would
results have been even worse if not for relatively strong Government performance, or conversely,
would results have been fully achieved if not for the effect of negative exogenous shocks. These
questions cannot be satisfactorily answered and one must rely on a rather subjective assessment.
Given that results were not fully achieved, recognizing the difficult external environment and yet
noting that the Government could have conceivably supported stronger implementation a
moderately satisfactory rating seems most appropriate.

6. Lessons Learned

There are a number of lessons that can be learned from the PRSC 4-6 series. These include:

Primary Lessons Learned:

   1. Stated objectives and monitored results indicators need to be realistic and focused
      on indicators that are attributable to PRSC supported actions. Some of the
      indicators in the series were situated at a level where attribution was difficult, if not
      impossible, and where a variety of exogenous factors weighed far more heavily on the
      achievement, or non-achievement, of results than supported actions. Results need to
      closely follow from supported actions and the desire to include results that are more
      properly situated at the development impact level needs to be resisted. Furthermore,
      shifting targets in the middle of a series should be undertaken with care and considerable
      thought, as early results, either to the upside or downside, may reflect the impact of
      temporary external factors and may not justify changing the level of ambition.
      Furthermore, the urge to force targets, particularly in subsequent operations in the same
      series, to always exceed baseline figures should be resisted. There clearly may be sound
      and justifiable reasons to have outcome targets that do not exceed or improve on
      outcomes, particularly when such indicators are subject to significant annual variation.

   2. It is clear that policy actions are often not enough to effect significant and
      sustainable change. While specific policy actions may be necessary to create an
      environment conducive to change, additional enabling interventions are also frequently
      required. Over this PRSC series it was found that greater impact was achieved by
      increasingly focusing prior actions and triggers in those areas where there was significant
      Bank complementary action in terms of investment operations or TA operations, or in

                                                  39
      some cases complementary donor activities that were closely aligned with PRSC areas of
      focus. Lending for development policy should not rely on conditionality alone to
      catalyze and affect reform. To be fully effective, the policy dialogue must be supported
      by other instruments that can identify institutional weaknesses and help build country
      capacity.

   3. An additional lesson learned may be that a PRSC series will be more effective if the
      reform agenda supported by the series goes deeper rather than broader. In addition
      to including key policy actions in the operation, it may be beneficial if supporting actions,
      those related to implementation measures or second generation reforms associated with
      the initial policy action, are also included in the operation in order to ensure increased
      effectiveness of the initial policy action. Focusing on fewer areas, but ensuring more
      fulsome and meaningful reform in those areas can lead to greater effectiveness. The urge
      to use a PRSC series as the primary tool to carry the reform agenda across all sectors
      should be resisted.

   4. Coherence across prior actions and triggers is also important to ensuring the
      effectiveness and sustainability of supported reforms. Prior actions and triggers
      should be designed as a coherent, mutually reinforcing package of reforms that together
      contribute to intended results rather than as a disparate number of individual actions each
      with its own individual targeted result. Synergy between actions can be important to
      strengthening outcomes and ensuring sustainability.

   5. Civil Service Capacity: Public administration capacity to design and effectively
      implement policy reforms is weak in Benin. The PRSC 4-6 series would have benefited
      from technical assistance (in coordination with other partners) to support the ambitious
      reform package (especially in the area of improving the private sector environment).

Secondary Lessons Learned:

   6. It is helpful if the provision of the credit/grant could be closely aligned with the budget
      cycle. The fiscal constraints imposed by declining and uncertain revenue streams
      required that expenditures and revenues be closely matched in order to avoid burgeoning
      budget deficits. As such, the provision of donor budget support, including PRSC
      resources, late in the fiscal year can, and did, lead to delays in important priority
      expenditures, particularly in public investment projects. Ensuring release of PRSC funds
      early in Benin’s fiscal year (first quarter) would better ensure implementation of priority
      expenditures and investments.

   7. The series benefited from significant donor cooperation and coherence and this mutually
      strengthened donor influence with the Government and allowed for more effective
      engagement with the authorities. It also eased the burden on Government as coordinated,
      joint reviews allowed for single undertakings on the part of the Government.

                                               40
   8. Strong links to the Government’s SCRP were critical to ensuring local ownership of the
      reform agenda and successful implementation of individual reforms supported by the
      operation. Experience with this series serves to confirm that local ownership is a key
      determinant to the effectiveness of policy operations. Those areas that were clearly and
      closely aligned with the SCRP, and were fully reflected in the Government’s budget,
      realized greater success.

   9. Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change and lack of capacity should not be
      underestimated. Selectivity and simplicity of design are essential to the success of the
      operation in such environments, as are attention to and realism about the scope and pace
      of reform. OPCS-guided DPL consultations in Benin (March 2009) also confirmed that
      to ensure that program design responds to Government capacity and priorities, extensive
      consultations are needed with a broad range of stakeholders.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

The comments received from the Ministry of Economy and Finance can be summarized as
follows:

The reform program implemented throughout the PRSC 4-6 series allowed for tangible progress
in the following areas:

   (i)     Improved access to safe water in rural areas due to progressive management of
           piped water systems under public-private partnership arrangements;

   (ii)    Improved access to basic education with the introduction of the policy of no-fee
           pre-school and primary education supported by massive recruitment and training of
           teachers after the reopening of teacher training schools;

   (iii)   Reform of the cotton sector thanks to the effective privatization of SONAPRA’s
           industrial assets to SODECO (Cotton Development Company), a semi public
           company;

   (iv)    Reform of the public procurement process with the adoption of a new procurement
           code and its implementation decrees; and

   (v)     Improved reporting of annual public accounts by catching-up on accumulated
           delays regarding the preparation of annual public accounts.

Despite the recorded progress above, poverty remains widespread (from 33.3 percent of poverty
incidence in 2007 to 35.2 percent in 2009) due to weak real economic growth. Following a
sustained increase in growth from 2.9 percent in 2005 to 5.0 percent in 2008, real GDP growth

                                             41
fell to an average 2.8 percent in 2009-2011. This is the reason behind the Government’s
commitment to further pursue reforms launched under the PRSC series, with a focus on
economic growth inducing measures, such as the recovery of the agriculture sector and
improvement of the business environment. In addition, support should be provided to improve
public financial management systems and the Government has adopted an action plan which is
under implementation in this area.

(b) Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society):

Comments were received from two developments partners: the European Union and the Embassy
of the Netherlands (respectively the current and former chairs of the macroeconomics and public
finance management thematic group). Both highlighted the effective coordination of the Bank’s
program with other partners providing budget support and their respective activities. Donors
were consulted and expressed their appreciation in receiving the policy matrix during the
preparation process of Bank’s budget support operations. They found the policy matrix
measures to be relevant and consistent with the Government’s strategic objectives outlined in the
poverty reduction strategy papers. However, they stressed that the Bank should re-engage in
civil service reform in Benin, being the most credible institution able to push forward reforms in
this important area.

Finally, they suggested that the Bank regularly share the implementation status of the policy
matrix measures with other partners in order to ensure a more objective assessment of the Bank’s
budget support operations in the future.
