B.       THEREQUEST

4.       Asstatedabove,thisisthe secondRequestsubmittedfor thesameproject.The
         Panel receivedthe first Requeston December14, 1998 and decided,after
         conductingsite visits,consultationsand interviewswith locallyaffectedpeople,
         that an investigationwas not warranted.The Panel did note, however,that
         beneficiarieshademphasizedtheneedfor technicalandmanagerialassistance,
         as wellasworkingcapital,to facilitatethesustainabilityof theproject.ThePanel
         also statedthat its conclusionwas reached"onthe basisof the introductionof
         improvedrevisedtermsof the loans,"which, accordingto Bank Management,
         shouldincludea "20-yearrepaymentperiodwiththreeyearsof grace,anda fixed
         interest rate of 4%."4         In addition to that, the Panel was informedthat a
         subsidizedworking capital line of credit would be made available to the
         beneficiaries.

5.       The new Requestis substantiallybasedon similarclaimsof actualor potential
         harm to the beneficiaries.The new Requestis supportedby complementary
         documentation,whichthe Requestersclaimis new evidenceor circumstances
         thatwerenotknownto themorto the Panelat thetimeof thefirst Request.The             5

         Requestersare basicallythe same as those who submittedthe first Request,
         namelya groupof NGOscollectivelycalledF6rum Nacionalpara a Reforma
         Agrdria e Justi9ano Campo(NationalForumfor AgrarianReformand Rural
         Justice,hereinafterthe "Forum"or "Requesters"),who representruralpoor in
         Brazil. In addition, the new Request contains many signatures from
         representatives of civil society organizations, the Church, professional
         associationsand 23 Membersof the Congress(13 Senatorsand 12 Federal
         Representatives).

6.       Specifically,the Requestersreiteratethat the project (a) failed to achieveits
         objectiveof combatingpoverty;(b) isnotbeingimplementedas apilotproject;(c)
         does not allow its beneficiariesto pay the debt contractedwhenjoining the
         project; (d) is forcing up land prices in the respectiveregions;(e) is being
         implementedas an alternativeratherthana supplementto landreformthrough
         expropriation;and (f) did not make provisionfor proper consultationand
         informationin termsof the beneficiarygroupsand its representatives.Although
         the Requestersdo notexpresslylist the Bankpoliciesandproceduresthat they
         believe are being violated, the foregoing allegations, if confirmed, could
         constitute,inter alia, violationsof provisionsof OD 4.15 on PovertyReduction;
         OD 13.50on ProjectSupervision;and BP 17.50on Disclosureof Operational
         Information.

C.   THE MANAGEMENTRESPONSE

12.   On November 15, 1999, the Panel received the Management's responseto the
      new Request ("new Response"-- Annex 2). The Response was due on October
     28, 1999. Management claims that "the delay was due to misunderstandingsof
      internalprocedures"and expresses its regrets.

13.   Fundamentally, the new Response reiterates the points already made in the
      Response to the first Request for Inspection, stressing that this project is
     considered well designed, "rated by the Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
     as one of the two best practice operations in Latin America and Caribbean
      Region." In particular, Management "disagrees that any adverse impacts have
     occurred or that any Bank policies or procedures have been violated."
     Management also states that the new Request contains no new evidence or
     circumstances not known by the Requesters at the time of the first Request.
     Since the reasoningunderlyingthe new Request is basically the sameas the first
     one, Management has elected to focus on the problemsrelated to the properties
     listed by the Requesters,attachinga copy of the first Responseas a basis for the
     analysisof the substantivearguments.

14.  Management denies that project funds are being used to purchase unsuitable
     farmlands, although it recognizesthat, because it operates in the poorest regions
     of Brazil, the project may include areas with "use restrictions." Management
     affirms further that, such restrictions notwithstanding, the project has been
     designed to provide adequate conditions to generate incomes sufficientto repay
     the contracted debt and substantially increase the income and quality of life for
     the beneficiaries.

15.  Management does not deny that there might be cases in which "unproductive"
     lands were acquired under the project. Managementnotes, however,that, under
     Brazil's legal system, "unproductive" lands mean under-utilized lands, and not
     lands that have no productive potential.8 On this issue, Management Response
     says that "the large majority" of the farms could not be expropriated under the
     traditional land reform program, but notesthat "[t]he original design of the project
     did not exclude the possibility of purchasing lands that could be expropriated.
     Subsequently, however, at the beginning of this year, it was agreed that no
     purchasing process would be initiatedfor any property that could be potentially
     expropriated."

16.  Management also dismisses any allegations that the affected communities are
     paying inflated prices for the farms. According to the Response, land prices for
     the properties acquired under the Project have been significantly lower, in

7.      To supporttheir claims,the Requestersattacheda copy of the documentation                     x
        that was sent by the National Instituteof Agrarian Reform (INCRA)to the
        Brazilian Senate in late April 1999. According to the Requesters,these
        documentsconstitutenewevidencethat wouldsuggestthat somebeneficiaries
        sufferadverseimpactsas a consequenceof Bank'sallegedfailureto followits
        own policiesand procedures.The Requestersalso claimthat,whenthe Panel
        firstvisitedBrazil,BankManagementwasawareoftheexistenceandcontentsof
        thesedocumentsandfailedto disclosethemto thePanel.

8.      The documentsattachedto the new Requestare mainlytechnicalevaluation
        reports,knownas laudos,that are producedby the project'sregionalTechnical
        Units to evaluate the suitabilityof the lands availablefor purchaseby the
        participantcommunitiesandto establisha priceceilingforeachproperty.These       6

        attachedlaudosreferto some30 farmsthat havealreadybeenpurchasedand
        are beingdevelopedunderthe project.Thereare also writtenstatementsfrom
        state-levelofficialsonthegeneralconditionsof projectimplementation.

9.      The Requestersclaimthat the attachedlaudosdemonstratethat manyfarms
        purchasedunderthe projectwere either non-productiveor very large.These
        properties, it is argued, would qualify for expropriationby the Federal
        Governmentunderthetraditionallandreformprogramat a muchlowercost.The
        Requestersclaimfurtherthatsomeof thefarmshaveseverelimitations,suchas
        inadequatesoil,lackof accessto water,erosionand otherproblemsthatwould
        renderthemunsuitablefor development. It is also contendedthat the project
                                                     7

        thepricesof ruralpropertyinsurroundingareas,issaidto benegativelyaffecting
        theborrowingcommunities.

10.     The Requestersalso allegethat the terms of the loans offeredto the project
        beneficiarieshavenot improvedsincethe lastPanelfieldvisit.Underthecurrent
       conditions,theycontendthatit wouldbedifficultfortheaffectedfamiliesto repay
       the loans.More specifically,the Requesterssay that the affectedpeoplehave
        not been granted access to PROCERA-                a highly subsidizedmicro-credit
        programdesignedto assist poor rural communities-               and that the contract
        providesfor interestratesrangingfrom4% to 6%.The Requestersbelievethat
       debtservicingmayprovetoocostlyforthebeneficiaryfamilies.

11.    Accordingto the Requesters,manycommunityassociationswereformedwith
       the encouragementof localpoliticalleadersmerelyto fulfilthe requirementsof
       project conditions. To illustrate these allegations, the Requestersquote
       documentsandotherofficialstatementsbyState-levelauthorities.

          duringthe Panel'svisitearlierthisyearexpressedtheopinionthattheirlivelihood
          security has increased significantlyunder the project. The Panel also
          interviewedBank officials in Washingtonand consultedwith the Executive
          DirectorrepresentingBrazil.

21.       The Inspectorwas asked by the Requestersto interviewsome specialistsat
          Universityof Campinas(UNICAMP),who carriedout an independentmidterm
          evaluationof the projectcommissionedby the Bankand the Government.The
          evaluationcovered52percentof the223farmspurchasedduringtheinitialstage
          of projectexecution.The independentresearchersdiscussedtheirmainfindings
          withthePanel.In substance,theyassertthatit istoosoonto makeanydefinitive

          in all cases the incomegeneratedby farming activities is projectedto be
          sufficientto cover the beneficiaryfamilies'subsistenceneedsand to allowfor

          receivedseparatesummariesof the midtermevaluationpreparedboth by the
          Federal Governmentand the Requesters.These summariesby and large
          confirmtheinformationreceivedinCampinasbythePanel.

22.       Paragraph9 of the 1999Clarifications mentionscertain"technicaleligibility

          is no assertionin the requestthat the new subjectmatterhasbeenbroughtto
          Management'sattentionby the Requestersand that, in the Requesters'view,

facilitatingthe Panel's work and for his comments and guidance. Finally,the Panelwishes to thank the
Requesters,especiallythe Executive Secretaryof the Forum,members of the Congresswith whom it met
in Brasilia,the Brazilian Minister of Agrarian Reformand researchersat UNICAMPfor their comments.
14 The 1999 Clarifications to the Resolution are contained in the "Conclusions of the Board's Second
Reviewof the InspectionPanel" dated April20, 1999.

        aggregate,than the present-valueequivalentpaid for expropriatedproperties.              9

        Managementalso notes that, "when small price differenceswere observed,
        specificconditionsprovidea satisfactoryexplanation[forsuchpricedifferences]."
        In thosecasesinwhichthe Requesterssaythatthepricesaremuchhigherthan
        market prices, Managementcontends that such conclusion is based on
        erroneousinformationprovidedby the stategovernment.Managementargues
        that such evaluationswere later rejected by the beneficiary communities
        preciselybecauseof excessivepricing.

17.     On the termsand conditionsof the loan,Managementaffirmsthat the project
        beneficiariesnow enjoythe sameconditionsofferedto the beneficiariesof the
        Bancoda Terraproject,whichprovidesfor interestratesof 4%forloansupto R$
        15,000.00.10  Sinceall loansunderthe projectare underthis threshold,the 4%
        rate applies to everybody.These terms and conditions are said to be an
        improvementif comparedwiththe previouscontractsandwill applyretroactively
        to all beneficiariesbeforethefirst installmentis due. Managementalso states
        that projectbeneficiariesare eligiblefor creditunderPRONAF,the programthat
        replacedthe PROCERA.

18.     Finally, on the issue of community participationin project design and
        implementation,Bank Management asserts that it is satisfied that this
        requirementhasbeenfully met.Accordingto the Response,"thedesignof the
        Projectplacesbeneficiariesinthedriver'sseat,andits successdependsentirely
        on their active participation."" Managementattachesa list containingsome
                                         1

        beneficiaries'opinionsontheproject.

19.     Managementalsoaddressesthe questionof Banksupervision,whichis implied
        in the Request.The Responseassertsthat "some82 staff weekswereusedin
        Projectsupervisionover a 27-monthperiodwith morethan 70%of supervision
        timeprovidedby staffof theBank'sBrasiliaandRecifeOffices."

D.      ELIGIBILITY

20.     The Panel proceededto determinewhetherthe Requestmeetsthe eligibility
        criteriaset out in paragraphs12to 14 of the Resolution.To thisend,the Lead
        Inspectorof the Panelfor this project,EdwardS. Ayensu2 on behalfof the

23.     On this eligibilityquestion,the Panelnotesthat the Requestershavespecified
        theactionstakento bringtheissueto theattentionof Management asfollows:15


        (i)    The Requestershavesentto thePanelthetranscriptsof a publichearing
        held in the BrazilianCongresson June23, 1999,to discusscertainaspectsof
        the project.'6 Accordingto the transcripts,the BankCountryDirectorfor Brazil
        wasinvitedto attendthe congressionalhearing.In a letterthat was readduring
        the session, the country directordeclinedthe invitation,explainingthat the
        Bank's Articles of Agreement expressly prevent any of its officers from
        participatinginpoliticalmeetings.

        (ii)   The transcriptsof the sessionshow that some congresspersonsthat
        signedthe Requestwerepresentat thecongressionalhearing,as weresomeof
        theForum'smemberorganizations.

        (iii)  The invitationto the congressionalhearingswas made by the Brazilian
        Congress,andnotby theRequesters,whoparticipatedinthesession.

        (iv)   The Panel is not satisfied, therefore, that the invitation for the
        congressionalhearing constitutes sufficient evidence that the Requesters
        broughtthesubjectmatterto Management'sattention.

        (v)    The Requestersdid not providethe Panelwith anyother evidencethat
        they had soughtto discusstheir concernswith Managementbetweenthe first
        andthesecondRequests.'    7


        (vi)   Managementhasprovidedthe Panelwithevidenceto indicatethat,after
        repeatedwritten and telephoneinvitations,the Requesterschose not to meet
        withManagementto discusstheproject.

        (vii)  The Requestersstatedthat suchinvitationsweredeclinedbecausethey
       were not involvedin the designphase of the projectand were not provided
        sufficientinformationto makea meetingmeaningful.In thePanel'sopinionthese
        claims to support a refusal to discuss these matters with Managementin
        advanceof the Requestdo not constitutecircumstancesthatwouldexemptthe
        Requestersfrom the consultationrequirementsset forth in the Resolutionand

        Emprimeirolugar.o pedido de inspec,o do F6rum tinha comobase argumentos
suficientespara demonstrar problemas serios que comprometemqualquer sucesso do
projetoe naoobje,ces filosoficasde qualquer natureza. Por outro iado, esta equivocada
a afirma,coda Administra,code Operac6esdo Banco de que a op,ao por uma politica
de "reforma agraria clieniercado"se restringe a uma "...opljo politica do Goi'erno " e
naodiz respeito a "..irnplemenftaqdoapropriada do Baico de sitas projprias politica* e
procedimentols`(p. 2, item 6 da resposta do Painel encaminhadoao F6rum). Essa
afirma,co da Administrac,o         nega abertamente as pr6prias decis6es e
responsabilidadesdo Banco Mundial sobrea politica adeotnd;.            um

       De acordocom a Estrategia de Assistenciaao Pais (CountryAssistanceStrategy
- CAS),relatorion.° 16582-BR,de 12 dejunho de 1997,no seu capitulosobre "OPapel
do Gnrpo Banco Mundial: Desetw'ohvime'nto Social", afirma "O Banico tamnbnt vai
con7siderarnova assistincia nioqufe diz re.speilo a refornia agorria, iniciando com urn
projeto. piloto. Esse testara   urm niodelo com maior cutsto-beneficio, de facil
implernentaqio e direcionado ao nercado para reassenlar fanilias. Se obtiver su,cesso,
o Banco apoiara urmprograma de reforma agrciria em irmaescala maior." (Item 57 da
CAS).Portanto,o pedido do F6rum e baseadoem questionamentosnao apenasdas
decis6esdo Governobrasileirode criar um ou mais projetosde "reforma agriria
de mercado",mas das decisoes e estrategiasadotadas pelo Banco Mundial para o
Brasil.

       Em segundolugar, a afirma,co da Administra,code Opera,ces do Banco de que
as entidades do Forum Nacional de Reforma Agraria, signatAriasdo pedido, nao
representam os interesses das pessoas afetadas e, no minimo, uma tentativa de
ingerenciapoliticado Banco sobre as organiza,ces da sociedadecivil brasileiras.
Alemde desconsideraras pr6prias regras do Banco - as quaisdao o direito a qualquer
grupo ou entidade solicitar a inspe,ao - esse tipo de argumentoe um desrespeito a
hist6riapoliticadas entidadese movimentosque representammilhoesdetrabalhadorese

PrezadosSenhores,


       OF6rumNacionalpela ReformaAgraria e pela Justigano Campo, enviou,
no dia 10de dezembrode 1998,ao Painelde Inspe,co do BancoMundial,um pedidode
inspecaodo ProjetoPilotode ReformaAgrariae Alivio da Pobreza(projeto n.° 4147-
BR), popularmentedenominadopor "ProjetoCedulada Terra".

       Opedidode inspecaoera baseado, entre outros argurnentos,no fato de que o
projeto nao atinge os seus objetivos de combate a pobreza; nao esta           sendo
implementadocomoumprojeto piloto e, esta sendo implementadocomouma alternativa
e nao um complementoa desapropria,ao por interesse social para fins de reforma
agraria.

       O Forum argumentava tambem que as condic6es de financiarnento nao
possibilitavamque seus beneficiarios pagassem a divida contraida com a adesao ao
Projeto. Argumentouaindaque o processo de implanta,ao, contrariandoabertamenteas
normas de projetos do Banco Mundial, nao possibilitou a participacao da populacao
beneficiariae seusrepresentantes.
       OBanco Mundial, atraves da Administracaode Operacoes, apresentou a sua
resposta ao Painel de Inspesao, no dia 08 de rnarvo desse ano. Para a surpresa do
F6rum, a partir deum pressuposto te6rico de que o projeto 'foi muito bem desenhado"
e, comoprojetopiloto, "apresenftva bom reslitados", a Administra,code Operacoesdo
Banconao se restringiua respondertecnicamenteaos questionamentos.Fez,na verdade,
uma tentativa de deslegitimarpoliticamente o F6rum Nacional de Reforma Agraria.
afirmandoque 1)o pedidode inspesaoera baseadoem "argumentosfilos6ficos"e 2)
os signatirios do pedido nao erani legitimos representantesdas pessoas e grupos
atingidospeloCedulada Terra.

        Essasnovas informacoes,obtidas atraves dos documentosoficiais,comprovama
pertinenciados argumentos anteriormente apresentados. 0 F6rum Nacional pela
Reforma Agraria e pela Justica no Campo esta, portanto, encaminhando um novo
Pedidode InsDecioao Painel do Banco Mundial.Acreditamosque esse novo pedido
de inspecao se constitui numa oportunidade para avaliar os graves problemas
constatados,oferecendoinclusiveao pr6prioBIRD,a chancede revero equivoco de sua
posicaooriginal,em absoluta assimetriacom os padroes de austeridadee seriedadeda
instituiqao.

        E necessarioesclarecerque o F6rum de ReformaAgrariae Justicano Camponao
esta recusandonenhumaajuda as milharesde familiasde trabalhadorese trabalhadoras
rurais que lutam pela reforma agraria. As organizacoesda sociedadecivil, filiadas ao
F6rum, reconhecema importanciado Banco Mundialfrente aos desequilibriosgerados
pelosistemaecon6mico.Os recursos que serao atribuidosaoProgramaBanco da Terra.
portanto,deveraoser destinadosaos credito agricolapara as familiasassentadas,criando
recursospara viabilizara permanencianaterra, aerar empregoserenda no meio rural.

        Segundo a Resolu,co BIRD n.° 93-10/AID 93-06 (que estabelece crit6rios de
funcionamentodo Painel de Inspecao), o grupo do Painel esta autorizado a aceitar
pedidosde inspecaoreferentes a determinada questao em relacao a qualja tenha feito
suas recomendacoes.Essa resolucao afirma que um novo pedido e justificado pelo
surgimentode novas evidenciasou circunstanciasdesconhecidasao tempo do pedido
anterior (Paragrafo 14D). 0 F6rum entende que os documentos apresentam novas
evidenciasque configuramdesvio de finalidade do projeto Cedula da Terra. dando
elegibilidadetecnicapara essa nova solicitacao.

        Diantedisso,e ainda, face o conhecimentode novosfatos.todos de fonte oficial,
e incluidosno documento anexo, reivindicamosnovamente a instalagao do Painel de
Inspecao sobre o projeto em consideracao, com base na resolucao do Banco Mundial
que estabeleceo Painel.

        De acordo com o proprio Presidente da Rep6blica, Senhor Fernando
HenriqueCardoso,em audienciapublicacom liderancasdo F6rum,no dia de 08 julho
de 1999,o senhorMuriloPortugal,representante do Brasiljunto ao Banco,foi instruido
a se opor veementementea instalacaodo Painel. Essa decisao,segundoo Presidente,nao
esta baseadaem pressupostostecnicos, mas no fato de o governobrasileironao admitir
ingerenciasdo BancoMundialsobrea politicanacional.

        0 F6rum compreende que o Banco Mundial, diante de tais circunstancias,
contrariaas suaspr6priasnormasrelativas a proibicaode atividadepolitica,estabelecida
por seu convenioconstitutivo.Segundo essa norma "o Banicoe seusfinciotndrios niio
podem intervir iiasquestlespoliricas de qcalquer menibro tiem tampoucodevem eles
ser influencialos enmsuas cdecisoespelo card/er politico cLomenmbroo0 nienibros

                                                                         s    7?rlvir os
prop6sitos deternfinadosno Artigo I" (BIRD, ConvenioConstitutivo,Art. IV, Secao
10).

        Diante disso, a expectativa do F6rumrera de que, tanto o Diretor Executivo
brasileirocomoo Painelde Inspecao,enquanto instanciaintegrantedo BIRD, estivessem
subordinadoas norrnasdo Convenio Constitutivo, preservando-sede toda e qualquer
influencia politica dos governos membros. 0 Painel cumpriria, assim, o prop6sito
fundamentalde ser um espa,o independente, ao qual podem recorrer is popula,coes
adversamenteafetadas por projetos do Banco Mundial, garantindoque esse atue de
acordo comas suaspr6priaspoliticase procedimentos.

        Por outrolado,no dia 06 de maio de 1999,foramencaminhadosaos gabinetesda
Senadora Heloisa Helena e do Deputado Federal Valdir Ganzer, documentos do
processo deimplanta,codo Cedula nos cinco (5) Estados.Esseprocedimentoaconteceu
em respostaaos Requerimentosde Informacao dessesparlamentares,encaminhadosao
Sr. MinistroExtraordinariode PoliticaFundiaria, RaulJungman,no dia02 de marco de
1999. E importantedestacarque os referidos documentosnao foram apresentadospelo
Governo ao Painel de Inspecao e tampouco foram consideradosna resposta do Banco
Mundial.

        Comoja era esperado, esses documentos comprovamas denunciasdo F6rurn
sobre os problemas do Cedula da Terra, explicitando,inclusive, fortes indicios de
corrupcao, super-avaliacoese favorecimentos no processo de implantacaodo Cedula.
Esses documentosexplicitamtambemdivercenciasentre afirrnac,esdo BancoMundiale
do Governo brasileiro sobre a implantacao do projeto. Apesar da Administrac,o de
Operacoesdo Banco, por exemplo,afirmar que terras improdutivasnao estao incluidas
nos neg6cios de compra do Cedula. o processo de implantacaonao faz qualquer
restric,aoa esse aspectoe, pelo contrario,varias areas passiveisde desapropriacaoforam
adquiridas.

        Alem dos questionamentos feitos anteriormente relacionados com a nao
participac,o da sociedade civil organizada no processo implantaqaodo Cedula e da
inviabilidade econ6mica do projeto, os documentos apresentados pelo Ministro
Extraordinario de Politica Fundiaria possuem fortes indicios de favorecimento e
corrupcaonaimplantaqaodo projeto nos diversos Estados.

                 1. Considerasoessobre os procedimentosdo Painelde Inspeaio

        Em primeirolugar,chamamosa aten,co para o fato de que os procedimentosoperacionais
 do Painel deInspecaoforammodificadospelo Conselhode Diretoresdo BancoMundialno decorrer
 do periodo de analiseda solicita,co de inspe,co encaminhadapelo Forum em 10 de dezembro de
 1998.

        Portanto, a solicitacaofoi aceita oficialmentede acordo comos procedimentosoperacionais
 do Painel de Inspe,co deAgostode 1994e dos esclarecimentosde outubrode 1996,masfoijulgada
com base nos seusnovosprocedimentosprevistosna segundarevisaodo Painele instituidosem abril
 de 1999.

        Essa mudan,a trouxeprejuizos para o processo, especialmenteporaue o Painelnao realizou
 estudos previoscomvistasa indicarou nao a investiga9ao,comodeterminavamas regrasde 1994. 0
Painel apenasjulgou a elegibilidadeda solicita,co, com basenos seusnovosprocedimentos.

        Alemdisso,o Painel,por meio da visitade algunsde seusmembrosa unidadesdo projeto, no
Brasil, 'avaliou' o projeto, apenas a partir de questoes genericasfeitas coletivamentejunto aos
beneficiariosdas associa,6esvisitadas,tentando por essa via, procederao cotejoentre as realidades
sociais e econornicasdas pessoas,anterior e posterior ao projeto. A1lmdainconsistenciadesse tipo
de aferic,o, deixou-sede lado a questao central a ser investigada:a compara,ao da situa,io dos
beneficiariosa partirdos objetivospropostos pelo projeto.


                         2. Comprade ireas passiveisde desapropriaaio

        Em primeirolugar,o documentoafirmacategoricamentequeo BancoMundialconsideraque
no emprestimotratadoe emfuturos emprestimosnao foram e nao seraoincluidasfazendaspassiveis
de desapropria,co parafinsde reformaagraria(item 18- p. 5).

        Apesar dessa afirma,ao taxativa, feita pelo Banco e assumidapelo Painel, os documentos
oficiais do MinisterioExtraordinAriode Politica Fundiaria, encaminhadosa CamaraFederal e ao
Senado, demonstramque essa afirnacao nao e endossada pela govemo, para o qual, o 'Cedula'
admite a comprade areasindependentede serempassiveisde desapropria,co.

        De acordo com o Ministerio Extraordinario de PoliticaFundiaria"Nao existemrestri,ces
quanto a aquisicao de terras desapropriaveis, embora em sua maloria, as areas adquiridas
correspondam a propriedadesconsideradas produtivas e/ou de tamanhoinferiorao caracterizado
como desapropriavel"(p. 7). Essa afirma,co deixa claro que o Painelassumiuum discurso que nao
se materializanaimplanta,codo Cedula da Terra.

        Aindade acordo com o pr6prio Ministerio Extraordinariode PoliticaFundiaria"0 Projeto
Piloto 'Cedula' da Terra' nao preve vistorias pelo INCRA. E um projeto executadopelos Estados,

indicandoa ocorrenciasde serios desvios de finalidade na execucaodo Projeto 'Cedula da Terra',

solicita,caode investiga9Aodo referido projeto. Entre os argumentosarrolados,destacamosque:

-   naopossibilitavaque seusbeneficiariospagassema dividacontraidacomaadesao aoProjeto;

       No dia 27 de maio do corrente ano, o Painel de Inspe,co apresentourelat6rio ao Conselho

        Como respeitomerecidopelos membrosdo Painel que analisaramo caso, o F6rum entende
que as falhasobservadasnos procedimentosde instru,co do processo, conformesera demonstrado,
na sequencia, refletiram-se diretamente no conteudo da resposta apresentada aos diretores

         Varias organiza,ces e entidades da sociedade civil executaramuma serie de projecoes, a
partir das condicoesde financiamentoapresentadas pela resolu,co do Banco Central e concluiram
 que a divida e impagavel.As planilhas revelaram tambem a dificuldadedas organizacoes,mesmo
assessoradaspor tecnicoscompetentes, em chegar a um resultadocomumquanto a prestacao que o

         Assim,nasproje,6es, partindo de um desenhocomum(umfinanciamentono valor de R$ 15

             3. Problemas e irregularidades no processo de implantasao do Cedula

               0 Acordode Emprestimo, firmado.entre o Govemobrasileiroe o Banco Mundial,
estabeleceu algumas clausulas que permitem ao Banco cancelar o emprestimo. Entre essas
condicionalidadesconsta "(c) em qualquer epoca, o Banco determinar, em relacao a qualquer
contrato a serfinanciadocom o produto do Emprestimo,que representantesdo tomador ou de um
beneficiariodo Emprestimotenham se envolvido em praticas corruptasou fraudulentasdurante o
periodo de aquisic,esou durante a execucao do referido contrato..."(Art. 10,Secao 1.01,Alinead,
item c, p. 4)

        Conformedito antes e, em seguida demonstrado, os documentosenviados pelo Ministro
Extraordinario de Politica Fundiaria adicionam elementos que permitem a constatacao de
irregularidadesirrefutaveisno processo de implanta,co do Cedula da Terra. Esses fatos indicam
desvio de finalidadedo projeto, o que segundo o pr6prio contratode financiamento,ja justificariao

        Aindanessadirec,o, o Oficion.°372/99, de 7 de abril de 1999,da Gerenciade Planejamento
e DesenvolvimentoEconomico do Estado do Maranhao dirigido ao Coordenador Executivo do
NEAD/MEPF, afirma que nao houve vistoria previa nas cinquentapropriedades adquiridas no
Estado, mas que pelos dados coletados, "oito propriedades eram passiveisde desapropriacao por
interessesocial"(p. 1). Isso significaque quase20% das propriedadesadquiridasno Maranhao eram
passiveisde desapropria9aoparafins de reformaagraria.

        A dispensade vistoria,principalmentepelo INCRA, ademaisde constituir-seem estimuloAs

              2.2 - Participaafioda sociedadecivil na implementacaodosprojetos

        ORelat6rio do Painel de Inspecao afirma que o Banco Mundial mostrou evidencias de
esfor,os com vistas a informar e a consultar os potenciais beneficiarios(item 20c, p. 6), o que
demonstra uma desconsidera,co Asdiretrizes do Banco Mundial em rela,ao Aparticipac,o da

        Ooficiodo 6rgao do governodo Estado do Maranhao, mencionadoacima,deixa claro que
"as representag6es dos trabalhadores rurais nao estao formalmente envolvidas nas instancias
colegiadas do Cedula da Terra" (p. 3 - item 7.2). 0 mesmo acontece nos demais Estados,
demonstrando que nao ha uma participacao efetiva da sociedade civil na implementacaodesse

                            2.3 - Condis6es de pagamento das terras

pagamentodaterra para melhor,fixandoo prazo para 20 anos comtres de carenciaejuros de 4% ao
ano (item 22 - p. 6). Essa afirma,ao carece de fundamentacao,pois, ate esta data, o Governo

                       4. 0 custodo Cedulada Terra e o prop6sitode "aliviara pobreza"

                De acordo com a avalia,co do Painel, "tanto o Requerente(o Forum) como a Resposta (o
        Banco Mundial) concordam no objetivo geral do projeto - redu,caoda pobreza rural - mas
        discordamnosmeiosespecificospara alcancaresse objetivo"(item9 - p. 3)'. Essa interpretacaonao
        esta correta, especialmenteporque os questionamentosdo F6rum ao projeto se referem, acima de
        tudo, sobre os seusobjetivos.

                 0 F6rum continua afirmadocategoricamente que o resultado do 'Cedula' sera um maior
        empobrecimentodas popula,ces e apelapara que o BIRD considereessacompreensao,pois estamos
        nos referindo a pessoas que se encontram nos limites da miseriae que somente a insensibilidade
        humana pode julgat-lascom capacidadede pagamento desses creditos oferecidospara compra da
        terra, financiamentoda produ,co, servi,os e infra-estrutura.

                Por outro lado, o F6rum entende que a pobreza deve ser erradicadaatraves de programas
        econ6micose sociaisque construam a cidadania, onde sobressai, em importancia,a realizacao de
        uma verdadeirareformaagraria.

                Ademais,o Paineltambem nao atentou para a denuinciade aumentodo preco da terra em
        fiunco do Projeto 'Cedula' daTerra'. No entanto, maisuma vez, as informac,esencaminhadaspelo
        Governo ao Parlamento reforcam indicios anteriormente encontrados. No Maranhao, diz o
        documento anteriormentecitado, "os pre,os medios das avaliac6esrealizadas pelo INCRA no
        exerciciode 1998,situavam-sena faixa de R$ 82,00, enquanto as aquisitoes do 'Cedula' atingiram,
        emmedia,R$ 152,00por hectare"(item7.1 - p. 3).

                Essa constatacao, realizada pelo pr6prio organismo responsavel pela implanta,co do
        programa no Estado do Maranhao, ao encarecer o custo da terra questiona a viabilidade do
        programa ao penalizareconomicamenteas familiasbeneficiadas.

                A constata,co acima,demonstrao equivoco em que se houveos protagonistasdesse projeto,

                               C. ESTADO DO MARANHAO

        Segundo as informacoesenviadas pelo Ministro Jungmann,foram adquiridas50 areas pelo
Programa Cedulada Terra(total deR$ 5.242.678,99),para beneficiar1.591familias.


                           0 Cedula da Terra elevou os precos da terra

        os pregos medios por hectare praticados pelo Cedula superaram os precos medios das
avalia,ces realizadaspelo INCRA no exercicio de 1998. Segundo o Relat6rio do governo, as
desapropriacoesdoINCRAse situaramna faixa de R$ 82,00/hectare,enquantoqueas aauisicoesvia
Cedula da Terra atingiramem media R$ 152,00/hectare, ou seja, 185% superior aos pre,os das
desapropria,ces (verrelat6rioanexo).


                      Nao ha creditopara produgio nem assistenciatecnica

        2. as familiasbeneficiadasnao tiveramacesso ao PROCERAe assistenciatecnica. Segundoo
relat6rio estadual,37 a7reasforam habilitadas para receber o PROCERA,mas nao houve qualquer
liberacaoate 7 de abrilde 1999.Tambemnao existe um programaoficialde assistenciatecnica, nem
aloca,co de recursos especificospara essa assistencia, visando atender as familiasassentadas nos
projetos.


                          Ausenciada participacAoda SociedadeCivil

        3. nao houve participacao da sociedade civil organizada no processo a implantacao do
'Cedula' no Maranhao.Segundoo pr6prio relat6rio, as representa,6esdos trabalhadoresrurais nao
estao formalmenteenvolvidasnas instancias colegiadas do Cedula da Terra, entretanto, alguns
sindicatosdemandame acompanhamos trabalhos em niveldecampo.


                                      Associacoes de ocasiao

        4. muitas associacoesforam formadas apenas para cumprir as formalidadesdo 'CeduIa'.
Pelas informacoesoficiaisfornecidas, 14 das 50 associac6es registramum tempo de existenciade
apenas I ano. A faltade organizacaocompromete seriamenteas possibilidadesde sobrevivenciadas
familiasbeneficiadas.

exemplode Areaonde se constata, pelo menos, baixa produtividade.Segundoo laudo de avaliacao,
 1.408 hectares eram de pastagens naturais, ou seja, 54,09% da sua area total (2.602,7 ha),
significando,pelo menos,baixa produtividade.Alem disso, 369 hectareseram de area aproveitavel
nao utilizada,caracterizandoa naoprodutividadede, pelomenos, 14,18%da area total.

        8. A FazendaValeda Boa Esperan,a, mencionada acima,segundoo laudo de avaliacaoem
anexo, tinha 230 hectaresde pastagens naturais, ou seja, 20,28% de sua area total. Tinha tambem
 197 hectaresde area aproveitAvelnao utilizada(17,73%). 0 restanteda area (total de 1.134,00 ha)
eram de 480 hectaresde pastagemartificial(42,32%) e 227 hectaresde preserva,co legal(20%). Na
melhor das hip6teses,a Areade pastagemartificiale a AreaaproveitAvelnao utilizada,ou seja, 38%

                                 E. ESTADO DO CEARA

       E importante observar, em primeiro lugar, que o ProQramaCedula da Terra exigiu a
Hipotecado Im6velAdquiridocomo garantiado financiamentodacompradasterras.

(p. 2 do documentoderesposta)(anexo 1)

       2. Em quepeseo 6bviootimismodo agente publico emrela,Aoas perspectivasdo Cedulada

       5. Dos 97 im6veisadquiridos,47 tem ate 500 ha, 32 de 500 a 1000ha, 14 de 1000 a 2000
ha, e 04 acima de 2000 hectares. Mais da metade dos imoveis, portanto, estao acima dos 500
hectares. Ha, pelo menos,dois casos em que o mesmo proprietariovendeu maisde um im6vel ao
Cedula da Terra. A Sra. MariaMirtes Pessoa vendeu dois im6veisno municipiode Acarau e outro

                          D. ESTADO DE PERNAMBUCO

       0 Programa Cedulada Terra adquiriu 28 propriedades ate mar,o de 1999 no Estado de
Pernambuco. Segundoo relat6rio,vinte e um (21) sao im6veisde tamanho"medio" e sete (7) sao
grandes areas, sendouma (1) "propriedade improdutiva" (p. 2). Grande parte dessas areas foram
adquiridasno segundosemestrede 1998e primeirosemestrede 1999(anexo1).

       Em primeirolugar,chamaa atenc,o que os im6veisadquiridosno Estado tiverarnum preco
medio por hectare (R$ 359,02) muito superior aos demais estados. Por exemplo: RS 138,06
(38,45%) no Ceara,R$ 195,86(54,55%) em MinasGeraise R$ 231,88(64,58%)na Bahia.

Reforma AgrAria."(p. 3 do documentoresposta)(anexo 1).

       8. Neste caso,a pressa em defendero Programalevou o agentepublicoa afirmarinverdades
que se comprovamna analise dos laudos anexos a sua resposta fantasiosa.Em primeiro lugar, o
pr6prio MinisterioExtraordinarioda Politica Fundiariaadmite a possibilidadede compra de terras
passiveisde desapropria,conas informac,es gerais, demonstrandoa inconsistenciado argumentodo
carater supostamentecomplementare auxiliardo Cedulada Terra.

       9. Em segundolugar, os laudosnao permitem a afirmacaode que as propriedadenao eram
suscetiveis de desapropriacao. A analise dos laudos deixa claro que nao foram realizados os
procedimentospara avalia,co da produtividadedos im6veiscomo, por exemplo,a determlinacaodo
GUT (Grau deutilizacaoda Terra), etc. Semestes dados a afirma,codo agentepublico transforma-
se em infundadae irresponsAvel.

       10. Por fim,a analisede alguns laudos permiteperceberindiciosfortes de foram adquiridos
im6veis passiveisde desapropriacaopelo nao cumprimentoda fun,ao social.A Fazenda Esperan,a
II, no municipiodeParamnb,por exemplo,tem uma area total de 1.421hectares,dos quais 70% sao
solos das classesI-III, portanto, com bom potencial de explora,ao. 0 laudo atesta, no entanto, a
distribuic,o das areasdo im6veltinha 200 hectares de pastagensnaturals(14% da Areatotal) e 932
hectaresde Areaaproveitavelnaoutilizada.A Fazendatinha 65,58%de suaAreatotal completamente
improdutiva,caracterizandouma situac,o passivel de desapropria,ao para fins de reforma agraria.
(anexo 4)

       11-Nao sou raros casos desta natureza, o mesmo acontece,por exemplo,com a propriedade
Condado, vendidapelo Sr. Jose de Carvalho Melo, localizadano municipiode Quixerarnobim.0
im6velpossui2.065 hectares, sendo que 1.282 hectareseram de area aproveitAvelnao utilizada,ou

                       Participacao e organizacao das familias beneficiArias

       13.Quantoao perfil das associa,6es, percebe-se que vAriasdelasforam constituidaspara a
compra de terras. Isto fica claro em alguns laudos que afirmam categoricamente que: "A Associacao
Comunitaria nao demonstrou experiencia em trabalhos coletivos". como          ao caso dos im6veis
Arvoredo e Massape no municipio de QuixadA. Em vAriosoutros casos afirma-se que a comunidade
se encontra e "estagio inicial de organizacao".

 resettling families. Should it be successful, the Bank will support an land reform program on a
 large scale." (Item 57 of the CAS).However,the request submittedby theForumis basedon
 queries challengingnot only decisionstakenby the BrazilianGovernmentto set uponeof
 more "marketland reformprojects",but also the decisionsand strategiesadoptedbythe
 World Bank forBrazil.
 Second, the affirmationby the OperationsAdministrationDepartmentof the Bankthattheentities
 in the NationalLand ReformForum thatsignedthe request do notrepresenttheinterestsof the
 persons affectionis at the veryleast anattempt by the Bank to wieldpoliticalcloutoverBrazilian
 organizationsin civil society.In additionto ignoringthe rulesof theBankitself- whichendow
 anygroup or entitywiththe rightto requestinspection- this typeof argumentshowsacomplete
lack of respect for the politicalhistoryof entities andmovementsrepresentingmillionsof workers,
particularlyrural workers,farmersandfarmfamilies, as well as othersegmentsof thepopulace
striving for survivalin ruralpartsof Brazil.
On May 27 this year, the InspectionPanel submitteda report to theBoardof Directorsof the
World Bank which,althoughacknowledginglegitimacyof the requestandthe broad-ranging
representativityof the signatoryentities,didnot recommendthat aninvestigationbeundertaken.
This decision was consideredby therepresentativesof the BrazilianGovernmentandthe Executive
Director for Brazil of the WorldBankas a confirmationof the excellenceof theProject.
Despite the thanks of thePanelGroupfor the commentsand guidanceof the Forumandthose
requesting aninspectionof the Project,duringits visit to Brazil (ReportandRecommendation,page
3, footnote, item 5), the contentsof thereply suggestedthe conclusionof thePanelas basedlargely
on the commentsand adviceof Mr. MuriloPortugal.The reply also suggestedthethat the
informationfrom civil servantsworkingfor State Governmentsandresponsiblefor the
implementationof the Cedulada TerraProject, who were alsothanked inthe document,are
accepted to the detrimentof the argumentsanddocuments presentedby thoserequestingthe
inspection.
As publiclyknown, sincethestart of theprocess in question,the ExecutiveDirectorforBrazilhas
been systematicallytakingup a conservativestance against the Requestfor Inspection.Hehasurged
the implementationandexpansionof the financingproject for the purchaseof land,despite
irregularitiesand the negativeimpactsof such implementation.
Accordingto the Presidentof Brazil,Mr. FernandoHenrique Cardoso,at apublichearingwith
Forum leaders on July 8, 1999,Mr. MuriloPortugal, theBrazilian representativeto theBankwas
instructedto vehementlyopposetheestablishmentof the Panel. Accordingto thePresidentof
Brazil,this decision is basednot on technicalassumptionsbut rather on the factthat theBrazilian
Govemmentdoes not allowWorldBankinterventionin nationalpolicy.
The Forum understandsthat undersuchcircumstances,the WorldBankwouldrun countertoits
ownRules regardingthe banon politicalactivityestablishedin itsArticlesof Incorporation.
According to this Rule "the Bank and its employees may not intervene in thepolitical issues of any
member, nor should they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or
members involved. Only economic considerations should be relevant in their decisions, and these
considerations should be weighed impartially, in order to achieve thepurposes stipulated inArticle
1". (IBRD, Articlesof Incorporation,Art. IV, Section 10).
In viewof this, the expectationsof theForum werethat both the BrazilianExecutiveDirectorand
the Inspection Panel as therepresentativeof the IBRDwould besubject to theRulesin theArticles
of Incorporation,immunefromall politicalinfluenceof the memberGovernment.ThePanelwould
thus fulfill the keypurpose of beinganindependententity to whichcommunitiesadverselyaffected
by World Bankprojects couldhaveturn,ensuringthat it acts in accordancewithitsownpolicies
and procedures.

Dear Sirs,

On December 10, 1998,theNationalForum for LandReform and RuralJustice(F6rumNacional
pela Reforma Agraria e pela Justi,a no Campo) forwarded to the Inspection Panel at the World
Bank a Request for Inspectionof theLandReformand PovertyAlleviationPilotProject(Project
N°. 4147-BR), commonlyknownas the Cedulada Terra Project.
Among other arguments,thisRequestfor Inspectionwas basedon the fact that thisProjectwas
failing to achieveits objectiveof combatingpoverty;it is not beingimplementedas apilot project
but rather as an alternativeandnot a supplementto land expropriationfurtheringsocialinterestsfor
the purposes of landreform.
The Forum claimed that the financingconditionsdid not allowits beneficiariestopaythedebt
contracted whenjoining the Project.Itwas also arguedthat the implementationprocessopenly
breaches the WorldBankProject Standardsby not allowing the participationof thebeneficiary
populaceand its representatives.
Throughthe OperationsAdministrationDepartment,the WorldBank presenteditsreplytothe
InspectionPanel on March8 thisyear.To the surprise of the Forum,basedon atheoretical
assumption that the Project "was very well designed" and as a Pilot Project "was presenting    good
results", the OperationsAdministrationDepartmentof the bank didnot merelyreplyto thequeries
in technicalterms.In fact,it attemptedto underminethe politicallegitimacyof theNationalForum
for Land Reform andRuralJustice,statingthat 1) the Requestfor Inspectionwas basedon
"philosophicalarguments"and 2) the signatoriesof the request werenotthe legitimate
representativesof the personandgroupsaffected by the Cddulada TerraProject.
Initially, the Requestfor Inspectionforwardedby the Forum was basedon argumentsthatwere
sufficientlyvalid to demonstratethe seriousproblemsunderminingthe successof thisProject,
rather thanphilosophicalobjectionsof anytypewhatsoever.Additionally,thestatementby
OperationsAdministrationDepartnent of the Bankclaimed that the choiceof a "marketland
reform" policy is restricted to a "...Government policy option" rather than the "...appropriate
implementation by the Bank of its own policies and procedures" (page 2, item 6 of the reply
forwardedby the Panel to theForum).Thisstatement fromthe OperationsAdministration
Departmentopenly contradictsthedecisionsand responsibilitiesof the WorldBankregarding
the policy adoptedforBrazil.
Accordingto the CountryAssistanceStrategy(CAS),ReportN0. 16582-BR,datedJune 12, 1997,in
its chapter on "The Role of the World Bank Group: Social Development", it states "The Bank will
also consider fresh assistance with regard to land reform, launching a pilot project. This will test a
model with a higher cost/benefit ratio that is easy to implement and slanted towards the marketfor

 Project in five Stateswereforwardedto the offices of SenatorHeloisaHelenaandFederal
 CongressmanValdirGanzer.Thisprocedurewas in response to the Requestfor Information
 forwardedby theseMembersof Parliamenttothe MinisterExtraordinaryforLand-Ownership
 Policy, Raul Jungmann,on March2, 1999.Itis important to stressthat thesedocumentswerenot
 submittedby the GovemmenttotheInspectionPanel andnor weretheytakenunderconsideration
 in the WorldBank reply.
 As was to be expected,thesedocumentsprovedthe claims of the Forumregardingtheproblemsof
 the Ce'dulada TerraProject,andalsoclearly outlinedmarked indicationsof corruption,over-
 evaluation andfavoritismin theprocessof implementingthe Cedulada TerraProject.These
 documentsalso clearlyhighlighteddiscrepanciesbetween the statementsmadeby theWorldBank
 andthe BrazilianGovemmentregardingthe implementationof thisProject.Forinstance,although
the Operations AdministrationDepartmentof the Bank statedthat non-productivelandis not
includedin the purchasenegotiationsof this Project, the implementationprocessplacesno
constraints on this aspect,andin fact,variousareas openfor expropriationhavebeenacquired.
In additionto the queriesmentionedaboveregarding the non-participationof organizedcivil society
in the process of implementationof the Cedulada TerraProject anditslack of economicfeasibility,
the documents presentedby the ExtraordinaryMinisterfor Land-OwnershipPolicyofferstrong
indicationsof favoritismandcorruptionduringthe implementationof thisProjectin variousStates.
This fresh information- whichwas obtainedfrom officialdocuments- provesthepertinenceof
the arguments submittedpreviously. The National Forumfor LandReformandRuralJusticeis
thus forwarding a fresh RequestforInspectionto the Panel of the WorldBank.Webelieve
that this fresh Requestfor Inspectionoffers an opportunityto assessthe seriousproblemsnoted,
while alsoprovidingtheIBRDwithachanceto review the errors in its originalstance,whichare
certainly notin keeping withthestandardsor austerityand probityof thisinstitution.
It is necessaryto statethat theForumfor Land Reform and RuralJusticeis not refusinganyhelpto
the thousands of familiesof workersandrural workers strugglingfor landreform.Organizationsin
civil societythat aremembersof theForum acknowledgethe importanceof theWorldBankin view
of the imbalancescausedby the Brazilianeconomic system.However,resourcesearmarkedfor the
Land BankProgramshouldbe assignedto agriculturalcredits for settlerfamilies,creatingfunding
that assuresthe feasibilityof theirlong-termsettlementon the land, generatingjobs andincomein
rural areas.
Accordingto IBRD ResolutionN°. 93-10/AID93-06 (whichestablishesthecriteriaforthe
functioningof the InspectionPanel), the Panel Groupis authorizedto acceptRequestsfor
Inspectioncovering specificmatterson whichit has alreadyissued itsrecommendations.This
resolution statesthat afresh requestis justified by the appearanceof new evidenceor circumstances
unknownat the time of the originalRequest(Paragraph 14D).TheForum feelsthat thedocuments
present new evidencewhichreflectsdistortionsin the purpose of the Cedulada TerraProject,
endowingthis requestwithtechnicaleligibility.
In viewof this, andas new factshavebecomeknown, all fromofficial sourcesandincludingthe
attached document,we once againrequestthat anInspection Panel beestablishedfortheProject
underconsiderationbasedon theWorldBankResolution that establishedthisPanel.
We would alsolike to advisetheDirectorsthat the Forum is forwardingarequesttothe Brazilian
Ministryof Justice for aninvestigativeprocedureanalyzingthe irregularitieslistedabove.

          1.      On September28, 1999,theInspection Panelregistereda Requestfor Inspection
          concerningthe above-referencedproject. The ManagementResponseaddressesall issues
          raised inthe Requestandthe claimsof non-compliancewithBankpoliciesand
          procedures. Weregretthe delay insubmittingthis Responseduetomisunderstandingsof
          internalprocedureswithin Management;we areputting in placecorrectivemeasuresin
          orderto avoidthis happeningagain.

          2.      Managementbelievesthat the BrazilLand ReformandPovertyAlleviationPilot
          Projectis averywell designedoperation,and that the Bankhascompliedwith all of its
          policiesandproceduresin respect of this Project. As a pilot,the Projectis being closely
          supervised,studiedandfine-tuned. The Project is alreadyyieldingsignificantresults on
          the groundfor a largenumber of poor rural familiesinthe Northeastof Brazil,andshows
          excitingpromiseas a cost-effective,expeditiousandnon-conflictivemeansof achieving
          a redistributionof landassets.

          3.      Managementfurther believesthat the Requestersdonot demonstratereal or
          potentialharmto anyProjectbeneficiaries.The informationpresentedin the Request
          does notconstitutenew evidencenor does it changethe conclusionsreachedinthe First
          ManagementResponse. Bank Managementhas an openpolicywithNGOsand would
          have likedthe opportunityto reviewwiththe Requestersthe improvementsalready
          introduced,as well as to have beenable to reviewwiththem the claimspresentedin the
          SecondRequestbeforetheir appealto the InspectionPanel. Differencesin the
          interpretationor analysisof the samebasic informationcouldhavebeen clarifiedhad
          those discussionstakenplace. However,the Requestershavenotacceptedanyof the
          Bank's repeatedinvitationsto have a discussionon these issues.

 2.2    Theclaimsregisteredby the Panel include:

        1.    Theterms of the loansfor land purchaseshavenotbeenimproved;
       2.     Thereis alack of adequatelines of creditto supportprojectbeneficiaries;
        3.    Theprojectpays inflatedprices for landthat couldbeexpropriatedat alower
              cost;and
       4.     The qualityof the landpurchased is poor.

 Managementis respondingto the four principalclaims listedabove,andtotwo additional
 claims:the firstrelatedto land evaluationprocessing(paras.2.12and2.13 below),which
 accordingto the Requestersmay have affectedthe price andqualityof landsacquiredunder
the Project;andthe second,that CdaT has in the past financedthe purchaseof properties
 eligiblefor expropriationandthat this fact was withheld fromthe InspectionPanel (para.
2.16). As apilot,the Project has been closely supervised,and lessonshavebeen learnedand
 incorporated(para.2.17andAnnex B).

2.3    ClaimNo 1: The termsof the loans for land purchaseshavenot been improved.
The Requestersclaimthat the conditionsof the loansfor landpurchaseshavenot been
improved3 as indicatedby the Panel (INSP/R99-4, para. 22) andthat, as a consequence,the
beneficiarieswouldnot beable to repay their loans. The BrazilianGovernmentthroughthe
Ministerof AgrarianReform,indicatedto the Panel andto theBank,andthis was in turn
reflectedinthe firstManagementResponse (paragraphs4.9 and4.10),that the loan
conditionsforthe Bancoda Terra(BdaT) wouldbe extendedto thebeneficiariesof the CdaT
project, andthat the retroactiveadjustmentsto loan termswouldbemade beforethe first
repaymentsof anyProjectbeneficiariesfall due in 2001. TheMinisterhas also conveyed
this decisionto theparticipantstatesand these inturn have informedthe beneficiaries.

2.4    In arecentcorrespondencefromthe Ministerof AgrarianReformto the Bank's
CountryDirectorfor Brazil(AnnexD), informiingthe Bankaboutthe releaseof fundsfor
land purchasesand forproductiveinvestments(tocompletetheprojectandto benefit some
10,000additionalfamilieswiththe CdaT),the Ministerindicatesthat allthese land loansare
providedwithBdaTfundsunderthe terms approvedfor thisprogram(para.2.5 below). In
addition,the Ministerreiteratesthat land loans made previouslyunderthe CdaT project
wouldbe retroactivelyadjustedtothe BdaT conditions.

2.5 As indicatedby the Requesters,the loan conditionsapprovedfor theBdaT projectare
variableaccordingtoloan size. Sinceall loansof CdaTbeneficiariesareless than R$15,000
per family,the applicableloanconditions includea 20-yearrepaymentperiodwiththree
years of grace,andan interestrate of 4% (as stated in the firstManagementResponsepara.
4.10, andexplainedto the InspectionPanel). In addition,the rulesof BdaTdeterminethat, in
the poorestareas,beneficiarieswould receivea discount of 50%of the nominalinterestrate
and arethus in an evenbetterpositionthan assumedin the firstManagementResponse.



3Fromthe originalCdaTterms with loansfor 10years, includinga three-yeargraceperiodand an interestrate
based on theaveragecostof long-termborrowing(TJLP),to the morefavorabletermsof a newprogram
(ComplementaryLaw93) knownas Bancoda Terra with loanterms includinga 20 year repaymentperiod,
three yearsof graceand a fixedreal interestrate of 4%.

 1.1     Thisdocumentis Management'sResponseto the SecondRequestdated August27,
 1999 for Inspectionofthe BrazilLand Reformand PovertyAlleviationPilot Project,                  --
 known as Cedulada Terra(CdaT) -- presentedby theNationalForumfor AgrarianReform
 and JusticeinRuralAreas (knownas the "Forum" and referredto              inthisResponseas the
 "Requesters"). TheSecondRequestwas submittedafter the InspectionPanel,respondingto
 the First Request,conmmunicated       to the Boardon May 27, 1999that "thePaneldoes not
 recommendaninvestigationof the mattersalleged inthe Request."

 1.2     Asthe Panelindicatesinits Notice of Registration,the SecondRequestcontains
 substantiallythe sameallegationsas the originalRequest. Onthebasis ofwhat              the
 Requestersdescribeas new informationfrom a sub-setof 39 properties2            (alreadyacquired
 andoccupiedpriorto thefirst Request),the Requestersreiterateclaimsrelatingto              credit(for
 the purchaseof land,andother linesof creditfor on-farm investmentsandotherpurposes)
 andissuesrelatingtothe price of purchased land andits quality,when comparedto              the
 expropriationalternativepracticed by the Government. Dueto the similarityof            the claims
 betweenthe two Requests,Managementis attachingthe originalManagementResponse for
 referenceabout project backgroundand detailedresponsesregarding Bankcompliance
 with BankPoliciesandProcedures,and has concentratedthisResponseon the                 analysisof the
 claimsrelatingto thepropertieslisted in the SecondRequest.

            ChapterII: Responseto the Claimsof AdverseImpactsof the Project

 2.1   The Requestdoesnotrefer to violationsof specificBankpoliciesandprocedures,but
 makes anumberof generalclaimsof adverseimpactsof theproject.                TheRequestersalso
 claimthat whatthey defineas new informationwas notpresentedby               Governmentto the
 Paneland wasnot consideredin the first ManagementResponse. TheNotice of Registration
points to four substantiveclaims,andto OD4.15 on PovertyReduction,OD                 13.05on Project
 Supervision andBP 17.50,on Disclosureof OperationalInformation,that               couldhave been
violatedif the Requesters'allegationswere correct. We vish to makeclearatthe              outset, (as
we did in our originalResponse)that we disagree that anyadverseimpactshave occurredor
that anyBankpoliciesor procedureshave been violated. Theinformationpresentedis
substantiallythe sameused for the preparationof the First ManagementResponseanddoes
not representnew evidencein light of the previous Request. Theinformationwas examined
in detail by Bankstaffinthe field, and does not changethe conclusionsreachedin             the First
ManagementResponse. Managementcontinuesto believethat theclaimsarenot
substantiated.




  The LandReformand PovertyAlleviationPilotProject is financed inpartby  Loan4147-BRfor US$90
million. It wasapprovedby the Bank's Board on April22, 1997and becameeffectiveon   September12, 1997.
The Project ispartof the Bank's Rural DevelopmentCompact and wasratedby   the QualityAssuranceGroup
(QAG) as one of the twobest-practiceoperationsin the Latin Americaand theCaribbeanRegionin 1997,in
terms of qualityat entry.
2The Requestersalsopointto two otherpropertieswhere they claim beneficiarieshaveorganizational issues.
These projectaspectswere coveredinthe firstResponse.

2.9    ClaimNo 3: The projectpaysinflatedpricesfor landthatcouldbe expropriated
 at a lowercost. TheRequestersreferto specificpropertiespurchasedunderthe project as
examplesof the highpricespaid by projectbeneficiariesas a resultof the project. The
informationon landpurchasepricessubmittedwith the SecondRequestis based on the same
data base andis consistentwiththe analysisin the first ManagementResponse,whichshows
that, in aggregate,landprices forthe properties acquiredunderthe Projecthavebeen
significantlylowerthanthe present-valueequivalentpaidfor expropriatedproperties.6 As
stated inpara.4.33 of the first ManagementResponse,landpricespaid by the Project are
about27% lowerthanthe presentvalue of initial INCRAexpropriationpricesin the
Northeast.7 Thisdifferenceis greatlymultipliedwhenthe costsofjudicial rulingsin
expropriationcasesare added. Accordingto a recentMinistryof AgrarianReformofficial
document:"Thecostof the landobtainedfor agrarianreformis basicallydeterminedby the
judicial systemthat adjudicatesapproximately50% of all expropriations."Accordingto this
samedocument,in a widesample of analyzedcases,multiplicationfactorsresultingfrom
judicial rulingsrangedfrom 1.20inthe Southto 14.64in the Southeastwith4.93 for the
Northeastand5.01 for Brazilas a whole.8

2.10 Withinthe aggregatefindingof lowerlandprices underthe Project,there are notable
differencesfromstateto state, withrespect to boththe levelof landprices andthe difference
betweenlandpricesobtainedunderthe projectand compensationpaidby INCRAfor
expropriation. Specifically,landprices obtainedin Pemnambucoarethehighest amongthe
five projectstatesdueto more favorableclimaticconditionsinthe ZonadaMata andAgreste
Regionsofthe state. Whileland pricesare higher in Pernambuco,the relativecostadvantage
of the Projectcomparedto expropriationis also higher(59% lowerpricesper hectare
comparedto 27% for all states). In the case of Maranhao,the informationpresentedby the
Requesterswasbasedon erroneousinformationprovidedby the Statewhichincludeddata on
propertieswhosepurchasewas subsequentlyrejected,preciselybecauseof excessiveprices.
Thecomparativeinformationon INCRAexpropriationexcludedthecompensationpaid for
land improvementsandthereforeunderestimatedthe actualpriceINCRApaid.

2.11 Withinstates,agro-climaticandmarket conditionsdifferconsiderablybetweenmicro-
regions,municipalitiesandareas withinmunicipalities,thus affectinglandprices. Price
differenceswithinanarea do not necessarilyconstituteirregularitiesandcanoften be
explainedby differencesin location,soil,accessto water andotherfactors. Thirty three of
the 39 propertiesmentionedby the Requesters,and all the propertieswherethe Second
Requestsuggestsanomaliesinthe purchaseprice, have beenvisitedby Bank staff. In most


6Since the dataforthe first ManagementResponsewere prepared at a slightlydifferenttimethan the data
presented inthe SecondRequest(Annex11,Table2.2), there are marginaldifferencesin individualfigureswith
respectto the propertiesincluded.Withrespectto average landcostsper family,the informationpresented in
the SecondRequestshowsslightlylowercosts of land under the Projectthanthe datashowninthe first
Response.
7A morerecentstudy(Raydonand Plata 1999) comparedland pricesat the state,micro-regionand municipal
level and showsthatpricesobtained underthe Projecthave also been consistentlylowerthan the pricesof
markettransactions,asrecordedby Bank of the Northeastand FundacaoGetulioVargas.
sFor a subsampleof 46properties citedin the samereport publishedat end-September1999,and for which data
on landholdinginhectareswasavailable,the averageprice per hectarebeforejudicial action was about R$424
(currentvalue)comparedto a post-judicialactionprice of R$5,573perhectare,morethana ten-foldincrease.
A majorityof landownerscontestingINCRAprices achievesignificantprice increasesthroughjudicial rulings.

 2.6 In analyzingprojectbeneficiary abilityto repaytheir landpurchaseloans,the
 Requesterspresentedfinancialprojectionswithassumptionswhichleadto results
 substantiallydifferentfromprojectionspresentedby the Bank. In particular,the projections
 presentedby the Requestersassumea loan amountof R$15,000,eventhoughthe average
 actualloanamountof the Project has been R$4,847,the figurewhichunderliesBank
 projections. Underthe revisedloan conditions,annualper familyinstallmentsfor the
 averageloanwillrangefromR$200-570 in real terms. Previousstudies(seeBox 1of
 previousManagementResponse)and morerecentfield visitsconfirmthat beneficiarieswill
 be ableto makerepaymentsand substantiallyincreasetheir faznilyincomes. As a reference,
 cultivationof onehectarewith beansis typicallysufficientto generatethe incomefor the
 loan installments. Theaveragefamilyplot acquiredunderthe projectis about27 hectares,
 andmanybeneficiariescultivateat least somearea withhighervaluecrops. Whilethe failure
 of an individualsubprojectas a result of the culminationof unfavorablecircumstances
cannot becategoricallyexcludedin a projectof thisscale, ongoingevaluationsand frequent
field visitshavenotrevealedany such case.

2.7 ClaimNo2: Thereis a lackof adeguate linesof creditto supportproject
beneficiaries. TheRequestersclaimthat the lack of adequatelinesofcreditfor project
beneficiarieswillnot allowthem to cultivatethe land andrepaytheirloans. In the original
Request,the Requestersclaimed that Project beneficiarieswouldnotbeable to financetheir
start-upproductiveactivitiesthroughPROCERA(aspecialcreditline for landreform
establishedinJune 1986to complementthe NationalAgrarianReformProgramof October
 10, 1985). Thisis notthe case. CdaTbeneficiariesbecameeligiblefor PROCERAcredit
throughINCRA Portaria567 of November 20, 1998. In the interimbetweenthe two
Requests,the Governmenthas substituted PROCERAwith anothercreditline, the National
Programto StrengthenFamily Agriculture(PRONAF). Thischangeequallyaffects
beneficiariesof the Projectand beneficiariesof thetraditionallandreformprogram.The
beneficiariesof CdaThavebeen specificallyincludedas beneficiariesof this specialcredit
line andare intheprocess of receivingthis creditin the samemanneras beneficiariesof
Governmentexpropriationprograms. In the Minister's letterreferredtoin Annex D,he
statesthat, as establishedin the OperationalManualof PRONAF,CdaTbeneficiariesqualify
to receivecreditforworking capitaland investmentsfromthisprogramunderthe same
conditionsas otherlandreform beneficiaries.4

2.8    Projectbeneficiariesdo receive communityinvestmentsandstart-upgrants,and
thereforehavesupportduringthe installationperiod.5 Whileaccessto creditbeyondthis
initial periodis important,andthe Project financialprojectionsdo indeedassumesome credit
access,thePRONAFprogram providessuch credit. The heavilysubsidizedterms of the now
extinctPROCERAwerenotessentialfor financialviability.




4It shouldbe notedthat there isan overallscarcity of credit in Brazil. As a result,thereis a high demandfor
creditby landreformbeneficiaries,and not all of this demand,whetherfrom beneficiariesof CdaT or rNCRA
expropriation,canbe satisfied.
5Thisyear's fiscalcontrolmeasures causeddelays in the releaseof fundsforcommunityinvestmentsand start-
up grants. Theproblem isnow resolved(see AnnexD).

                                                      5

 unfavorableagro-climaticconditionsandrestrictions intermsof sustainablelanduse. The
 Project is targetedatthe poorestfamilies. Ittherefore alsooperatesin unfavorableareas
 affectedby periodicdroughtand water scarcity. Thepredominantproductionsystems inthe
 semi-aridareasareadjustedto the restrictionsof this zoneandincludelargeareas for the
 grazing of livestockplus smallerareasof subsistenceand somehighervaluemarket crops.
 Under theseconditions,it is expectedthat many propertieswouldincludeareaswith use
 restrictions. TheProjectwasdesignedsuch that all economicactivitiesof a community
taken together,includinglivestock,subsistenceand marketcrops,providesufficient
 conditionsfor generatingthe incomenecessary to repay contracteddebtandsubstantially
 increasethe incomeandqualityof life of the beneficiaries. Allanalysisandevaluationto
 date suggestthatthe Projectis succeedinginthis respect, oftencreatingtheprospectof
multiplyingpre-projectincome,alreadyaccountingfor landloanrepayment.

2.16 A relatedissueraisedin the SecondRequestis that CdaThas inthepast financedthe
purchaseof propertieseligiblefor expropriation. It is allegedthat thisfactwas withheld
fromthe InspectionPanel. Thisallegationis not correct. TheManagementResponse(as
well as the materialfromthe Federal Governmentsubmittedwiththe SecondRequest) states
that the large majorityof theproperties acquiredunderthe Projectcouldnothave been
legallyexpropriatedbecausethey do notreach the minimumsizerequiredfor expropriation
(seefirst ManagementResponse,para. 4.31) or were productiveproperties. The original
design of the projectdidnotexcludethe possibility of purchasinglandsthat couldbe
expropriated. Subsequentlyhowever,at the beginning of this year,it wasagreedthat no
purchasingprocesswould beinitiatedfor any propertythat couldbepotentiallyexpropriated.
This has beencompliedwith. In addition,the Annual OperatingPlans(POA)for the
remainderof 1999(thatwouldbenefitsome 10,000additionalfamilies),specificallyexclude
any expropriablepropertyfromthe Program.9

2.17 Theimplementationof the pilot Project has been aperiodof learningduringwhich
importantlessonshavebeenlearnedthroughintensivesupervision,internationalandnational
seminars,studiesandworkshops,andincorporatedin the Project. Thisapproachis an
integralpart ofthe Projectdesign. TheProjeci is part of the Bank's Compactfor Rural
Developmentandhas receivedmore than the average supervisionsupport. Some82
staffweekswereusedin Project supervisionovera 27-monthperiodwithmorethan 70%of
supervisiontimeprovidedby staffof the Bank's BrasiliaandRecifeOffices.(For more
detailson supervisioncoverageandimprovementsintroducedinthe Project,seeAnnex B).

2.18 Finally,as is oftenthe case,it is the voices of the beneficiariesthemselveswhichbest
expresshowthey feel aboutthe prices paid and qualityof the landtheyboughtas well as
their sense of thebenefitsof the Project and its impacton their lives. Examplesof those
voicesfollowinBox 1.




9Specificexceptionscouldbe consideredonly afterreview and approvalby boththe StateCouncils,on which
civil society organizationsarerepresented,and the Officeof the Ministerof AgrarianReform.

of the projectsitesvisited,priceswerenot onlylowerthan the averageof observedmarket
prices, but alsolowerthan thosepricessuggestedby INCRAas indicativefor those specific
municipalities. In the few caseswheresmall price differenceswereobserved,specific
conditionsprovidea satisfactoryexplanationfor the price differencesobservedin land
purchasedocumentation(seeAnnexA). In most propertiesvisited,Projectbeneficiarieshad
consideredalternativepropertiesbeforedecidingto purchasethe onethey nowown. In
addition,mostof them declarenow that they would not bepreparedtoselltheir land at all,
and mostcertainlynotfor the pricethey originally paid.

2.12 A relatedpoint raisedby the Requestersrefersto the landpurchasepriceevaluation
forms (laudos). TheRequestersclaimthat the laudosrelatedto thepropertieslisted indicate
problemswiththe evaluationsystemon prices andqualityof the landandthat furthermore,
many of themwerenot signed. The laudos are preparedby the stateProjectTechnicalUnit
to assistthe communitiesin thenegotiationprocess for purchaseofthe property- providing
informationon location,naturalresourcesand improvements- andto supportstate reviewof
the negotiatedpurchaseprice. Eventhoughthe laudois describedin the Operational
Manual,it has no formallegalrole inthe land acquisitionprocess,whichis basedon the
negotiationof that land betweenthebuyer and the seller. In practice,onlyrarely doesthe
evaluationof the laudocoincidewiththe actual purchasepricewhich,in themajority of
cases, is lowerthan the price statedin the laudo. It shouldbe clarifiedthatthe laudo is only
mandatoryinthe case of expropriationfor public use, or for socialinterestsfor purposesof
agrarianreform,sinceit dealswith aunilateralaction by the Government,andis usually
challengedin thejudicial system. In the case of CdaT,the negotiationis openand adeal is
onlyconsummatedwhen the two partiescome to an agreementonprice.

2.13 Unfortunately,in someof the documentationtransmittedto the Requesters,the original
signedlaudowasnot included,butBankstaff verifiedinthe field that all thedocumentation
for completedlandpurchases(withtheBank of the Northeast)includesthe signedlaudos. In
the case of MinasGerais,wherethe Requestersimply irregularitiesdueto the existenceof
two laudosper property,the Statehas, in fact, adopted anadditionalprocessingstep. The
first laudo(laudode avaliacao)is produced to guide beneficiariesin thepurchaseof the land,
andthe second,atechnicallaudo(laudotecnico), is producedafterthe beneficiariesare on
their land, forthe purposesof orientingproductive activities.

2.14 ClaimNo.4: The qualityof the land purchasedis poor. TheRequestersrepeata
claimfromthe originalRequest,that most land purchasedby ruralworkersandsubsistence
farmersunderthe Projectis of poor quality. In fact, the evidencestronglysuggeststhat
lands acquiredunderthe Project are generallyof good quality. In specificcasesof properties
listed as new evidenceby the Requestersandvisited by Bankstaff,thisis alsothe case, and
examplesof theproductivecapacityof these properties are includedin AnnexA. The
Requestersclaimthat the Projectis purchasing"unproductive"land.As apoint of
clarification,the conceptof "unproductive"implies under-utilizedlands(as defined inBrazil
forpropertiesthat couldbe subjectto expropriation),not landsthat haveno productive
potential.

2.15 Manycommunityassociationshave acquiredlandsin themostfavorableareas of the
projectstatesandshowexcellenteconomicprospects. It needsto berecognized,however,
that this Projectoperatesin thepoorest region of Brazil,whichincludesmanyareas of

3.1    Managementconsidersthat the BrazilLand ReformandPovertyAlleviationPilot
Projectis alreadyyieldingsignificantresults on the groundfor alarge numberof poor
ruralfamiliesin theNortheastof Brazil, and showsexcitingpromiseas a cost-effective,
expeditiousandnon-conflictivemeans of helping to achievearedistributionof land
assets. Ithas notandwould not replacealternativeapproachestolandreform suchas
expropriation,andspecificrules havebeen introducedinthe 1999AnnualOperating
Plansto ensurethatpropertiesthat couldbe expropriatedarenotpart of the Project. New
loanconditionsfor landpurchaseshave been introducedto ensurethateven farmers
locatedinthe moredifficultagro-climaticconditionsof the semi-aridzonescouldrepay
their loans.

3.2    TheRequestersdo not demonstrateactual or potentialharmto Projectbeneficiaries.
Theydo notdemonstrateviolationsof the Bank's policiesandprocedures. The new
informationpresenteddoes not representnew evidencein light ofthe previousRequest
anddoesnot changethe conclusionsreached inthe firstManagementResponsein
relationto theclaimsregisteredfor the SecondRequestby the InspectionPanel. As a
pilot project,severalimprovementshave alreadybeen introducedonthe basis of close
andregularsupervisionand ongoingevaluations. BankManagementhas an openpolicy
withNGOsandwouldhave liked tohave the opportunityto reviewwiththe Requesters
the improvementsalreadyintroduced,as well as to havebeen ableto reviewwiththem
the claimspresentedinthe SecondRequestbeforetheir appealto the InspectionPanel.
Differencesinthe interpretationor analysisof the samebasicinfornation could have
beenclarifiedhadthosediscussionstaken place.However,the Requestershave not
acceptedanyof the Bank's many invitationsto have a discussionon these issues(see
AnnexC).

3.3 Managementandstaffcontinueto make use of all opportunitiesto discussthe
Projectwithlocalfarmers' organizations,beneficiary communitiesandwithindividuals
relatedto organizationsthat are part of the Requesters(seeAnnexC). Therefore,
Managementandstaffcontinueto be optimistic that a fruitfuldialoguewiththe national
organizationsthat arepart of the Requesters' Forum, canbe developedinthe near future.
We remainopenfor dialogue,open-mindedon the substanceandreadyto take valid
suggestionsandconcernson board. Managementbelievesthat theparticipationof the
nationalorganizationsrepresentedinthe Requesters' Forumwill enhancethe
transparencyandthe alreadyimportantbenefits broughtaboutby theparticipationof
communityorganizationsandlocal entities inthe Project.

           ANNEXB: ProjectSupervisionandImprovementsIntroduced&-

 1.    Theimplementationof the pilot Project has been a periodof learningduringwhich
important lessonshavebeen leamedthroughintensivesupervision,internationaland
national seminars,studiesandworkshops. The Project is part of theBank's Compactfor
Rural Developmentandhas receivedmore than averagesupervisionsupport.Some 82
 staffweekshave beenused inProject supervisionover a 27-monthperiod,wellabovethe
averagefor otherprojectsin Brazil,andwithmore than 70%of supervisiontime
providedby staffof the Bank's Brasiliaand RecifeOffices. Besidesformalsupervision
from BankHeadquarters,projectstaff inthe field officeshavemade some30 visitsto
participatingstatessincethe projectstarted. The Project has alsobeenvisitedby the
Brazil CMU Director and other Bank Directors -- including from the Africa Region --
and by the RegionalVice Presidentfor LatinAmericaandthe Caribbean. In addition,the
Project has beendiscussedin three major seminarswith extensiveparticipationfrom
Govemmentandthe Bank,theprivatesector/civilsociety,NGOs,academia,intemational
specialistsandmultilateral/bilateralorganizations.Therehave alsobeen anumberof
workshops involvingthe StateTechnicalUnits withthe associationsineach state,the
latestonewithall 50 associationsof the State of Pernambuco. In addition,the Project
has been evaluatedby privateconsultantsanduniversities. Theresultof allthis activity
has been aseriesof lessonswhichhave been or will be incorporatedas changesor
adaptationsinthe existingprojectandthe designof the follow-up,AdaptableProgram
Loan. Theseinclude:

(a) Access to Land. A centrallesson learnedand the messagebeingreceivedfrommany
    organizationsandthebeneficiariesthemselves,is that thetargetpopulationfor land
    reformwants accessto land in a rapid,participatoryandless conflictivemanner,even
    thoughtheyknowthe land mustbe paid for. Proof of thiswas thehugedemandfor
    purchaseof landwhichexceeded40,000 familiesby the endof the firstyear of
    Projectimplementation.Themarket-basedapproachpilotedundertheproject
    expeditesthe settlementof landlessrural families,with landacquisitionfrom
    identificationtopurchasetypicallytaking less than 90 days. Further,projected
    householdincomes(fiveyearsafter land acquisition)rangefrom3 to 10timesthe
    pre-projecthouseholdincomeandpermitthese householdsto servicetheir land loans.
    To date,familieshave generallychosenfairto good qualityland acrossthe diverse
    agroclimaticconditionsprevailingin the Project area at coststhat representsavings
    relative totraditionalmethodsof landreform andwithout exertingupwardpressure
    on landprices.Targetinghas been effectiveand efficient,thevastmajorityof
    beneficiarieshavingcharacteristicsconsistentwith the targetpopulation.

(b) Sizeof BeneficiaryGroups: Ithas been observedthat groupsshouldhave a
    minimumof 10 familiesand a maximumof 30 to 35 for optimalperformance.
    Groupssmallerthan 10familiesare likelyto have difficultyformingan association
    board,whichis a conditionof eligibilityfor land; and,the resourcesavailableto a
    very smallgroupare likelyto be insufficientto make certaininvestments,eitherdue
    to costas inthe case of rural electrification,or to under-utilizationof purchased
    equipment,in the caseof a tractor. For groupsof over 50 families,experiencehas

' An updatefrom a similarannexin the original ManagementResponse.

     shownthat managementof a ruralpropertyby alarge groupcanbedifficultandthat
    the tendency,demonstratedintraditional,i.e. expropriation-basedlandreform
    settlements,where 100,200 or more families are settled,is for suchgroupsto
    ultimatelybe sub-dividedinto smallergroupsof around50familieswhichthen create
    their ownassociations.

(c) CommunityInvestments:Experienceof land reformovermanydecadeshas shown
    that toavoid out-migrationandkeep familieson their land,conditionsmustbe
    createdfor them to establishthemselvesin the area immediatelyafterlandis
    acquired. In the case of themarket-basedpilot, a mechanismwasintroducedby
    which,immediatelyafterland acquisition,the TechnicalUnitcalculatesthe amount
    of communityinvestmentto whicheachbeneficiary associationis entitled,plus aid in
    the amountof US$1,300.00for the cost of establishingeachfamily. TheTU
    authorizesthe Bancodo Brasilto draft a single contractwiththe association,with
    investmentsubprojectresourcesbeingblocked in eachassociation'saccountuntil
    subprojectproposalsare approvedby the TechnicalUnit,at whichpointthe resources
    arerapidly unblockedanddisbursed. This streamlinedmechanismhasbrought many
    advantagesto beneficiaryfamilies,permittingthem to immediatelyusethe aidmoney
    to moveinand get established.The certaintyof beingable touse resourcesfor
    investmentsinthe landacquired,withoutthe need to workas paidlaborersto support
    their families,is an incentivefor beneficiariesto establishthe propertyrapidly and
    startfarming.

(d) Organizationsof Associations: Althoughmany beneficiaryassociationswere
    formedseveralyearsagoand arewell-organized,otherswereformedonlyvery
    recently.Experiencehas shownthat these more recentassociationscantend to lack a
    set of agreedprinciplesto guideinterpersonalrelationshipsbetweenthe groups
    formed,and anunderstandingof public policies andbasicnotionsofplanning,which
    areneededto make settlementssustainable. Theseissueshavebeendiscussedat
    lengthwithparticipatingstatesandthe Nucleus of AgriculturalStudiesand
    Development(NEAD),andrecommendationshave beenadoptedforthe proper
    trainingof settlersto efficientlyimplementandstart settlementactivities,creatingthe
    foundationsfor the settlement'ssustainability. This modelfor buildinghuman and
    social capitalwill alsobe a featureof the proposed follow-upProject,shouldthe
    Bankgo ahead withits financing.

(e) TechnicalAssistance: Studies/observationsduringthe firstyearof project
    implementationindicatedthat officialtechnicalassistance(TA)has fallenshort of
    expectationsinboth qualityandtimeliness.The Projectcallsfor TA fundingfor the
   preparationand implementationof communityinvestmentsubprojects.However,
    communitiesneed moreeffectiveand efficient TA in planningfamilyfanning
    activities,i.e.,the productionof crops andtheir processing,storageandmarketing.
    Duringimplementationof thepilot, alternativeshave beendiscussedwiththe States
   to improveTA for beneficiaryfamilies,especiallyin the firstthree yearsof
    settlement. The amountallocatedfor the communitytopurchaseTAhas been
    increasedduringthe landpurchaseprocess and subsequentproductionplanningover
   the firstthree yearsafter installationto help ensure increasesin productivityand
    incomes.

(f) FinancialCharges: Whenthe Project was prepared,the Long-TermInterestRate -
    TJLP - wasselectedby the Governmentto apply to thecreditsobtainedby
    associationsto purchaselandsandto define the financialchargesfor each loan. The
    paymentperiodas definedwas up to 10 years, withup to 3 years' grace. Studies
    doneby the Nucleusof AgriculturalStudiesand Development(NEAD)indicated
    that, in someregionssuchas the northern litoral (coastalregion)ofBahia andCeara,
    landsacquiredby associationscouldbe paid for in the periodstipulated.In other
    regions,however,principallythe semi-arid,whichis subjectto frequentdroughts,
    familiescouldfindit hardto fulfiltheir repaymentobligationsinyearsof drought. In
    addition,withthe risinginterestrates,the TJLP rose significantly,becoming
    burdensomefor small farmersbenefiting fromthe Project. The TJLPis no longer
    used to definefinancialchargesstemmingfromthe loanandhas beenreplacedby the
    loan conditionsof the Bancode Terra, which includea fixedrealinterestrate of 4%
    p.a. and apaymentperiod of 20 years. Thesenew chargesandtermswillalso be
    appliedretroactivelyas a refinancingof current land loans. Therewillbe no loss to
    Project beneficiaries,sinceno portionof the loanscontractedhas yetexpired.

(g) BeneficiaryParticipationand ConsultativeCouncils: Thedesignof the Project
    placesbeneficiariesin the driver's seat, and its successdependsentirelyon their
    activeparticipation,throughcommunityassociations,in all stagesof theProject
    cycle. Experienceto date has beenvery positive at the communitylevel,withthe
    associations(manyof them pre-datingthe Project) showingstronginterest,initiative
   and activeparticipation.At the sametime, the Projectalsoenvisagedthe creationof
    a ConsultativeCouncilin each State,comprising representativesof Governmentand
   organizedcivilsociety,includingchurches,unions (of ownersandworkers)and other
   non-governmentalorganization(NGOs). In contrast tothe activegrassrootslevel
   communityassociations,the Councils' performanceinthe firstyearof
   implementationhas beenbelow expectations. The Governmentis reviewingthe
   functions,compositionandproceduresof the Councilstoidentifywaysto increase
   their effectiveness.The formalphilosophicalposition of someof theRequester
   organizations,againstmarket-basedland reform,is a complicatingfactor,but the
   Governmentis inthe processof renewing effortsto obtainparticipationby these
   groups.

               AnnexC: Effortsto Communicatewiththe Requesters

Bank managementand staffhaveconsistentlydemonstratedopennessanddesire for
frank andseriousdirectcommunicationswith all groups of society. In thisspirit,
managementandstaffhave continuedto work closelywiththe beneficiarycommunity
organizationsand withgrass-rootbranches of the nationalorganizationsinvolvedin the
Request;havewelcomedopportunitiesto meet withindividualsrelatedwith someof the
nationalorganizationsthat comprisethe Forum of the Requesters,in aneffortto establish
bridgeswiththem (seeparas.1-5 below).Managementand staffhaveso farnot been
successfulintheir effortsto comrnunicatedirectly withthe Requesters(paras.6-8 below).

1. A meetingbetweenBankstaffworking withthe Project,BankNGO liaisonstaff and
   a representativeof the BrazilNetwork (RedeBrasil), oneof the organizationsof the
   Forum,tookplacein Washingtonon June 3, 1999. Thiswas aninformalmeeting
   gearedto abasicexchangeof information. The discussioncenteredon the Forum's
   oppositionto the Bank-fundedLand Reform PilotProjectandthe effortsthat boththe
   Bankandthe Governmentwerewilling to make in ordertoactivelyengagenational
   civilsocietyorganizations(CSOs)in project implementation.

2. On August5, 1999,headquartersand Bankcountry staffworkingwiththe Project and
   BankNGOstaffmet in Natal, RioGrande do Norte,withrepresentativesof state-
   levelfederationsof ruralworkers(FETAGS)of 8Northeasternstatesanda
   representativefromthe NationalConfederationsof RuralWorkers(CONTAG)part
   of theRequesters'Forum (andof which FETAGare the statebranches).The
   discussionwasan informalexchangeof views betweenFETAGandthe Bankon the
   pilotproject.

3. Duringameetingon August24, 1999with leadingCSOsin Salvador,Stateof Bahia,
   Bankstaff,includingthe RegionalVice Presidentfor LAC, BrazilCMUDirector,
   andBankNGO liaisonstaff, dialoguedwith the Presidentofthe BahiaFederationof
   RuralWorkers(FETAG). At that time,the Presidentstated,"TheFederationis not
   againstthe Bankfundingagrarianreform in Brazil,and locallandlessfarmershave
   welcomedthe program." He furtherstated that now thatthe movementhad lost the
   battleto havethe Cedulada Terrablocked (they werenotawarethat the Second
   Requestwas presentedto the Bank),he hopedthat theycouldtry to influenceit in
   orderto allaytheir concernsregarding farmer indebtedness,andto improveits
   implementation.

4. On September29, 1999,duringthe Bank's AnnualMeetings,theDirectorfor the
   BrazilDepartment,arepresentativeof the LAC VicePresident'soffice,the regional
   andBrazildepartmentNGO liaison officers,regionalandBrazildepartmentexternal
   communicationsstaff,aBank-widelead specialiston AgrarianReformissuesand
   BankDirector,representativeof the Legal Departmentandall staffworkingwiththe
   CdaTproject(bothfromheadquartersand inthe field)met withamemberof the
   BrazilLandlessMovement(MST),accompaniedby representativesof three NGOs
   fromthe Washingtonarea. Duringthe meeting, Bankstaffreiteratedtheir open door
   policywithNGOs andBankstaff willingness andopenmindto discuss/reviewall
   aspectsof the CdaTprojectandits proposed follow-up,theBancoda Terra.The

   importancethat the Bankattributesto the participationof nationalorganizationsin
   the Projectwas alsoreiterated. Bankmanagementrequestedthe intermediationof the
   MSTmemberfor the organizationof a meetingwiththe Requesters'Forum. No
   responsehas beenobtainedto date.

5. Duringthe recentannualLatinAmericanmeetingof regionalNGOswithBank
   regionalmanagementlast October,Bank staffworkingwiththe Projectmet with a
   memberof oneof the organizationsrepresentedin the Forum(RedeBrasil)to discuss
   andreviewthe Bankposition expressedon all previousoccasions.

6. An invitationwasmade inearly-June 1999to the Requesterstomeetin Brasiliawith
   the BrazilCountryDirector andBankcountry staffworkingonthe Project,to discuss
   resultsof Projectmonitoringandevaluationstudies,improvementsalready
   incorporatedinthe Project, reviewany concernsthat the Forumhadwiththe Project
   andexploredifferentpossibilitiesfor involvementof the nationalorganizationsof the
   ForuminProject implementation.The Forumdecidednotto meetwiththe Bankat
   that time(seeattachedcopiesof lettersdated June 4, 1999andJune 10,1999fromthe
   BankandForumrespectively).

7. TheBrazilCountryDirectorand countryandheadquartersstaffworkingwiththe
   Project extendeda secondinvitationto the Requestersto meetin earlyAugust 1999
   to discuss,again,ways to includetheir organizationsin projectimplementation.
   Aftercarefulnegotiationof a date for the meeting,the Requesterscancelledjust hours
   beforethemeeting(seeattached copyof letter datedJuly 30, 1999).

8. On September14, 1999,ajoint invitationwas extendedto the Requestersby the
   Ministerof AgrarianReform andthe Bank's Brazil CountryDirectorto review
   evaluationsof the CdaTproject, all aspects of its implementationandimprovements
   alreadyintroduced. This invitationwas turneddown by theRequesters. In the
   invitation,bothinstitutionsreferredto the multiple invitationsthat independentlyhad
   beenmadetothe Requestersandto the interestandbeneficialeffectthat the
   participationlcontributionof the national organizationsincludedinthe Requesters
   Forumwouldhavefor the CdaT project andits proposedfollow-up,the Bancoda
   Terra. In theirresponse letter,the Requestersindicatedthatthey havepresenteda
   SecondRequestfor the installationof the InspectionPanelfor the CdaT,were
   awaitinganofficialposition fromthe Bankregardingthe requestandthiswould
  make it unnecessaryto discussthe topic at that time. In addition,theyreferredto a
  Bankreportpointingto the impactof neoliberal policiesin deepeningpovertyand
  misery,especiallyin ThirdWorld countries,andthat they consideredcontradictory
  the Bank's effortsin Brazilto have a meetingto push forwardthe CdaT,a program
  absolutelybasedon neoliberalassumptions(seeattachedcopiesof lettersdated,
  respectively, September14, 1999and September21, 1999).

Bankmanagementand staffwill continuetheir open-doorpolicy andtheir effortsto
engagethenationalorgaizationsin Project implementation.

On behalf of theNationalForum for AgrarianReform andRuralJustice,I appreciateyour

Dear Sir,

      World Bank Support to the Agrarian Reform Program of the Government of Brazil

In accordancewiththe decisiontaken by the NationalForumfor AgrarianReformandRural
Justice andcommunicatedto us todayby you, it was notpossiblefor the Forumto have the
meetingpreviouslyscheduledbetweenthe Forum andthe WorldBankto discussWorld
Bank supporttothe AgrarianReform Programof the Governmentof Brazil. We regret that
it was notpossibleto havethis meeting,given that since Mayof this yearwe have been
trying to schedulea meetingwiththe Forum to discuss thisissue.

The objectiveof today's scheduledmeeting waspreciselyto discuss,in afrankand open
manner, thecriticismsanddoubts that the Forum has aboutthe programsfinancedby the
Bank, includingapparentquestionsrelated to data from INCRAregardingthe resultsof the
Cedula da Terra(LandReformandPoverty AlleviationPilot)Project. Weunderstandthat
the Forum is preparinga documentwhich analyzesthese data,andas suchwe await receipt
of this documentinorderto betterunderstandyour concerns. I believeit is usefulto inform
you that evaluationreportsfundedby the Bank of the PilotProject,suchas a listing of all
propertiespurchasesby communityassociationscan be foundon the Internet
(www.dataterra.org.brandwww.nead.gov.br) andas suchthesereportsare widelyavailable
to the Forumandotherentitiesof civil society. A first independentevaluationof the Cedula
da TerraProject,conductedby UNICAMP(Universityof Campinas,SaoPaulo,Brazil),is
nowbeing concludedandthis report will alsobe availableshortly.

 I shouldreiteratethat the WorldBankconsidersthe participationof civilsocietyin the
 Cedulada TerraProjectto be important,sincethis can playa strategicroleto organize
 associationsof settlers,providetechnicalassistanceandmonitorthe resultsof the Project.
 The activeparticipationof beneficiariesand localsocial movements(unions,churches,
NGOs) is alreadyoccuring,butit willbe importantthat nationalorganizationsalso
participateinthe Project,offeringin a complementarymannertheiranalyticalcapacityand
technicalassistance.

In this vein,the Governmentof Brazil,withthe help of the WorldBank.recentlytook
variousinitiativesandmeasuresto improvethe performanceof theCedulada Terra Project
andencouragetheparticipationof civilsociety. Someof thesemeasuresweretaken in
responseto suggestionsfrom entitiesrepresentedby the Forum. Theseinclude:

 1. A decisionthat,fromnow on, no landthat is potentiallyexpropriablewill be financedby
    the Cedulada TerraProject, exceptwiththe approvalof the StateCouncilwiththe
    participationof civil society;

2. Extensionof theterms of the loansand reductionof the interestratesfor repaymentof
    land purchasesequalto the conditionsrecentlyapprovedfor the LandFund (Bancoda
    Terra);

3. The participationof civil societyand socialmovementsinStateCouncilsfor the
    monitoringof Projectimplementation. We understandalsothat the Governmenthas
    invitesmembersof the Forumto participatein theNationalCouncilofthe LandFund, in
    whichvariousStateMinistersparticipate.

4. Availabilityof resourcesfor groupslinkedto the Forum to conducttechnicalstudies
    seekingwaysto improvethe traditionalprogram of agrarianreform.

In closing,we informyou that we arecontinuingthe processof negotiatingwiththe
Governmenta newloan for the Land Fund (Bancoda Terra)Projectwiththe same
characteristicsmentionedabove. We hopethat these negotiationswill be concludedin the
near future. A the sametime,we remainopento discusspendingdoubts andwaysto include
the activeparticipationof the entitiesof the Forum in the Project.

      Mr. Director,

      Regardingthe communicationsignedjointly by yourselfandthe        ExtraordinaryMinister
for Land Policyinvitingthe entities of this Forum toparticipateina  meetingto discussaspects
relatedto the operationalizationof theprogram CeduladaTerra,we      consider:

       1.    Weremindyou that the Forum recentlypresentedto the IBRDa       secondrequest for
installation of the Inspection Panel for the referred program,      based on documentation
substantiatingand attesting to numerous irregularities in itsexecution. This means that the
entities of the Forum are awaiting an official position from  the Bank regarding the request,
which makesunnecessaryany discussionon the topic at this      time in parallel with the formal
process;

      2.    A few days ago,the WorldBank disseminatedaReportpointingto         a deepeningof
poverty and misery,especially in third world countries, as a result ofthe effects of neoliberal
policies imposedby the rich countries. In this regard, we   consider contradictorythe Bank's
effort in Brazil to have a meeting to push forward the Cedulada   Terra,a program absolutely
based on neoliberal assumptions and therefore incompatible       with effective development
strategiesfor poor countriesaccordingto the Bank itself;

      In viewof the above,and manifestingthe alignmentof the Forumwiththe        sectors of the
Bank whichhaveconcludedabout the inequity of the neoliberalproject,we       emphasizeto you
our full interest in discussing collaborative actions with      your institution to eradicate
underdevelopmentin Brazil for which, in the case of the   agrariansector,we do not envision
any otheralternativebutthe promotion of an effective andmassiveagrarianreformpolicy.

This authorizationisbeinggivenat the sametime that we have committedapproximatelyanotherR$40
million fromtheBancoda Terra(LandFund) inorder to ensureneededBraziliangovernmentcounterpart
funds for the financingof land acquisitions,in accordancewith the abovereferencedloan agreementwith
the World Bank.

These two amountswill guaranteeassistanceto more than 10thousandfamilieswho,when addedto the 8
thousand alreadyassisted,will bring thetotal, alreadythis year, to 18thousandfamilies(assistedbythe

As mentioned inthepast,I would liketo reiterate that the same financingrulesapprovedforthe Banco da
Terra Program,will beappliedinthe consolidationof the Cedula daTerraProgram,thus assuringthe

Certain of the full successof the Cedulada Terra Program,I ratifiedmy enthusiasmon the importanceof
the project tothousandsof families, withoutwhich,they would not havetheopportunityto produce, take
their sustenancefromthe land,and generate incomeandjobs in thecommunitieswherethey live.

Attentively,

  1.1     The Request for Inspection concems the Brazil Land Reform and Poverty
 Alleviation Pilot Project, financedin part by Loan 4147-BR, for $90 million,which was
 approved by the Bank's Boardon April 22, 1997and becameeffective on September12,
  1997. This was the first market-based land reform operation approved after a Board
 Seminar in July 1996that haddiscussedthe benefits of this approach. Forthisreason,and
 because of its innovativeaspects,the Project was considered under Regular Procedures
 (i.e., full discussion)at therequestof one ExecutiveDirector.'

  1.2.    The Project is testinga market-basedland reform mechanismwherebybeneficiary
 associations obtain financingto purchase agriculturalproperties which theyjudge to be
 suitable and for which they negotiate directly with willing sellers. It seeks to benefit
 15,000 poor rural families in Northeast Brazil. Implementation,originallyplanned for
 three years, is far ahead of schedule: some 8,000 familieshave alreadyreceivedland and
 titles, the remaining7,000 havenegotiated land purchases and will receiveloansshortly,
 and the demand for Project support has been so strong that another 28,000 familiesare
 currently waiting for approval of pending proposals. Pre-project economic analysis,
 supported by case studies of actualpropertiesand on-farminvestmentactivities,-suggests
 that the Project is leadingto substantialincreases in beneficiaryincomes. The Brazilian
 Government wishes to expandthe pilot and to involve other states within andoutsidethe
 Northeast. Managementassessesthat this expansionis welljustified by theresultsto date,
 and preparation work is advancedfor an Adaptable Program Loan. The Brazil pilot
 Project is also attractingstrong interestfrom other countries, both in Latin Americaand
 other regions. The Bank is facilitatingcross-countrydisseminationof results,withsimilar
projects underpreparationin LatinAmerica,Africa andAsia.

 1.3.    The Request, as defined by the Inspection Panel in the Notice of Registration,is
dated December 10, 1998. The Requestorsargue on philosophicalgroundsthat "punitive
expropriation,'2 is the only legitimatemeans for achieving land reform in Brazil.For that
reason, they do not seekimprovementsin the design or executionof the Project;theywish
to stop the pilot and anycontemplatedexpansion. The Request doesnot referto violations
of specific Bank policiesor procedures,but makes a number of generalclaimswhichare
cited in the Notice of Registration: (a) the Project is not achieving its objectives;(b) the
Project is not being implementedas a pilot; (c) beneficiarieswill be unableto repaydebts
entered into under the Project;(d) the Project will lead to increased pricesof agricultural
land available to rural workers; (e) the Project is an alternative/substituteinstead of a
complement to Brazil's Constitutionally-mandatedland reform program; and(f) the Bank
failed to consult andadequatelyinformproject-affectedpeople and theirrepresentatives.


    The Project is part of the Bank's Rural Development Compact and was rated by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) as one of the two best-practice operationsin the Latin
America and CaribbeanRegionin 1997,interms of qualityat entry.

2   Seequotes in paragraph3.1.

 1.4.   In a separate letter dated December 21. 1998 from one of the Requestors,it is
 alleged that the Projectviolates ODs 4.15 (Poverty Reduction)and 4.01 (Environmental
 Assessment),BP 17.50(Disclosureof Operational Information),and GP 14.70(Involving
 Non-GovernmentalOrganizationsin Bank-SupportedActivities). The Panelregisteredthe
 claims regarding OD 4.15 and BP 17.50. The Notice of Registrationmentions only the
 December 10, 1998Requestsignedby eight organizations and 853 individuals.We note
 however, that in draftingits Notice of Registrationthe Panel has actually drawnmaterial
 from the December21, 1998letteras well. Managementwill addressin this Responsethe
 contents of both theRequestandtheletter, andall claimsof adverseimpactsandviolations
of Bank policiesandprocedures.

 1.5.   The ManagementResponseincludes the present Chapter I (Introduction);Chapter
II (The Bank's Involvementin Land Reform in Brazil and Loan 4147-BR);Chapter III
(The Nature of the Request and Some Considerations on its Eligibility); Chapter IV
(Response to the Claimsof AdverseProject Impacts and Violationsof Bank Policiesand
Procedures); and ChapterV (Conclusions). These are followedby a seriesof supporting
Annexes; particularattentionis drawnto Annex A, whichincludesa Matrixof the Request
for Inspection andManagementResponse. Finally, Managementis alsomakingavailable
for consultation by the Panel written materials it has received, includingsignatures,six
videotapes and threeaudiotapes,presentingdirectly the views ofseveralthousandProject
participants and indicating,moreeloquentlythan any Bank report couldever hope to do,
their knowledgeof, participationin, commitmentto, and deepest hopes for the successof
the Brazil LandReformandPovertyAlleviationPilot Project.

 The Context: Bank Involvementin Land Reform Issues in Brazil

 2.1     Managementconcursfully with the Requestorsthat unequal accessto land assets is
 one of the root causes of rural poverty in Brazil. As such, efforts to address land issues
 deserve high priority and the full support of the Brazilian Govemment and intemational
 partners like the WorldBank. However,Managementdisagreeswiththe Requestors'position
 that the only legitimatemeansto pursuelandreform is through"punitiveexpropriation."

 2.2     The Bank has sustained a long-term partnership with the Brazilian Governmentto
 address income and human development issues in the Northeast of Brazil, the region
 containingthe largest concentrationof rural poor in Latin America. Landissueshavefigured
 prominently in this agenda. In the early 1970s, the Bank launched a major collaborative
 research undertakingwithlocalinstitutionsto developan analyticaldata baseandidentifythe
 main causes of poverty in the Northeast.         An interim Bank report in 1975 (Rural
Development: Issues and Options in Northeast Brazil, Report No. 665a-BR)and the final
published research study in 1981 (The Agricultural Economy of Northeast Brazil, Johns
Hopkins University Press) clearly linked excessive land concentration to rural poverty.
Recommendations urged rapid initiationof land redistribution. In response, undervarious
rural developmentprojects the Banksupportedthe establishment/strengtheningof State Land
Institutes, settlementand landtitlingactivities. In the late 1970s,the Bank-financedParnaiba
Valley DevelopmentProjectin the State of Piaui (Loan 2015-BR)includedpurchaseof about
200,000 ha of land for redistributionby the Govermment,with active participationof rural
syndicates. In 1985, the Bank financeda larger-scale regional program (Loan2593-BR)to
prepare a technical cadaster,acquirelands and settle families,and strengthenthe State Land
Institutes in nine Northeast states and northern Minas Gerais. Around 900,000 ha were
acquired through purchase and expropriationfor settlement. While someof these effortsof
the 1970sand 1980swere successful,there were also many weaknesses. TheBank and the
Government continuedto searchfor more efficient and effective instrumentsto addresswhat
remained a very seriouslanddistributionissue.

2.4     Since the early 1990s,a shift towards demand-driven community-baseddevelopment
programs generally in the Northeast(v. state-administeredefforts throughpublicinstitutions)
has yielded significant results. Emerginglessonsbegan to influence thinkingas well on new
ways to tackle land issues. The 1995 Brazil Poverty Assessment (ReportNo. 14323-BR)
contributed to the debate, suggestingthat stabilization, falling land prices and low inflation
were creating an environmentin which promotion of efficient land markets couldimprove
access of the poor to land as an importantanti-poverty instrument. Meanwhile,reflectingon
worldwide experience, a 1996BankLand Policies Paperreviewed the costs,inefficiencyand
conflictive nature of administrative instruments (expropriation, land purchases and re-

 distribution by governments)to achieve land reform. and recommendedexperimentingwith
 market-based mechanisms.A BoardSeminaron this paper generallyendorsedthefindings.

 2.5     In 1996,the Bankandthe BrazilianGovernmentdecidedthat the timewasripetotry           a
 new approach to landredistribution.To seizethe moment andact quickly,a       smallcomponent
 was developedwithinthe ongoingCeara Rural Poverty AlleviationProject (Loan3918-BR).
 The State governmentsupporteda land acquisitionprogramled directlybyruralcommunities,
 benefiting about 700 families,withcomplementaryon-farm investmentsfinancedthroughthe
 community-baseddevelopmentportionof the Project. Communityresponsetothe experiment
 was extremely enthusiastic;it was executed rapidly and at relatively low cost comparedto
 traditional expropriation and other state-administered methods of land reformn.The State
 reported that about the same numberof families obtained access to land in only a 12-month
 period, as had over the previous two decades. These findings prompted the Federal
 Government to seek Bank support for a broader pilot in five Northeast states. The Bank
agreed, and the June 1997CASfor Braziland CAS Updateof May 1998citecommunityand
market-based approachesto landredistributionand rural infrastructureas keyelementsof the
Bank's rural poverty strategy.

Brazil LandReformandPovertyAlleviationPilot Project(Loan4147-BR)

2.6     The Land Reformand PovertyAlleviationPilot Project (Loan4147-BR;$90 million),
known in Brazil as Cedulada Terra(CdaT),was approved by the Boardon April22, 1997
and became effective September12, 1997. Following on the successfulCeara experiment
(para. 2.5), the Project targetspoor rural laborers and farmers who are eitherlandlessor have
insufficient land for subsistence, in the Northeast states of Bahia, Ceara, Maranhao,
Pernambuco and Minas Gerais. The Project seeks to increase the incomes of 15,000 such
families by assistingthemto purchaseland andobtain complementaryinvestmentsto raisethe
productivity and outputof thepropertiesthey acquire.

2.7     The Project is completely demand driven, with the government facilitating and
assisting decisions made by rural laborers and farmers organized into community
associations.

* The association searches for suitable land, negotiates a purchase with willing sellers,
   presents the proposed purchaseto the State Land Institute and requestsconfirmationthat
   the title to the land is clear and no other conditions threaten the transaction,and that the
   negotiated price is consistentwithmarket conditions.

* The communitythenpresentsits landpurchase proposalto the StateTechnicalUnit(STU)
   of the State RuralPovertyAlleviationProject, which verifies beneficiaryeligibility.

* Upon clearance by the STU, the community receives a loan, funded by Federal
   Government budget resources and administered by the Bank of the Northeast, and
   completes the transactionwith the property seller. The associationmembersdecidehow
   to divide the land among themselves and each individual's correspondingrepayment
   obligation.

  * The community associationalso presents to the STU proposals         for complementarysub-
      Projects and technicalassistanceto help members establish themselveson        the property
      and improveits productivityand output. Typical communitysubprojectsincludephysical
      and social infrastructure,productivefacilitiesand equipment. Communitylaborand land
      constitutethe counterpartcontribution.

  * The State govenmmentauthorizesthe transfer of      funds for the sub-projectsdirectly from
      the State sub-accountsof the Loan41>47-BRSpecialAccountat       theBankof Brazil,to the
      account held by the community association, which       can then draw the resources to
      implementthe sub-projects.

 2.8     Project implementation,originallyplanned to benefit 15,000familiesoverthreeyears,
 is running well ahead of schedule. At end-January 1999, some       8,000 familieshad already
 received land and titlesto a totalof 204,000 ha, or about 25    ha per family. The remaining
 7,000 families have negotiatedland purchases and will receive      loans shortly. Demand is
 running far ahead of the Project, with another 28,000     families currently in the queue for
 approval of purchase proposals totaling about 808,000     ha. The Federal Governmenthas
 advanced financingfor landpurchases(which it had      expectedto provideonlyin the final 18
 months of the Project)to maintainthe rapid pace   of executionset by the beneficiaries.Bank-
 financed sub-projectinvestmentsare also now moving       rapidly after initial delays, as STUs
 adjusted to the sheer volumeof investmentproposals from     the communityassociations.The
Bank has disbursed $29 million of Loan 4147-BR,       and an additional $12 million is in the
pipeline for which the Governmentwill soon be      requesting reimbursement.With the recent
approval of the 1999 Federal Govemment        budget, it is expected that the Project will  be
completed relatively quickly.The first 18 months    of implementationhas been an important
period of learning, and the findings are discussed    in Chapter IV. The immediate lesson,
though, is that the clientsof agrarianreform -   landless rural families- stronglydesirerapid
access to land in aparticipatoryandnon-conflictivemanner.

2.9     In the face of extraordinarydemand for access    to the Cedulada Terraprogram, the
Brazilian Government wishesto expandthe pilot      Project on a much larger scale and involve
other states outside the Northeast. Based on results   of the pilot, Managementassessesthat
the Bank should support Brazilin expandingthe      program, and processingis well advanced
for an Adaptable ProgramLoan. The APL was ready        for appraisalandnegotiationswhen the
Request was received. In the circumstances,processing      has been haltedpendingPanel and
Board consideration of the merits of the Request.          However, while the Government
understands the reasonfor this delay, it is causing anxiety on the part of communitieswhich
have made the effort to organizeand identifyproperties, and    are awaitingthe resourcesto be
able to proceed.

                       Chapter III: The Nature of the Requestand
                          SomeConsiderationson Its Eligibility


 Nature of the Request

 3.1     Management considers that the Request is essentially an effort to present a
 philosophical positionwith respectto landreform. The basic thesis of the Requestis that
 "punitive expropriation"is the onlyjust and constitutionallysanctionedapproachto land
 reform in Brazil. TheRequestorsare notseeking to improve the designor executionof the
 Project or proposing changes to help ensure better compliance with Bank policies and
 procedures. The objective is to stop the operation and any contemplatedexpansion,
 because the Requestors do not believe that the Govermnent should be pursuing a
 voluntary, market-basedapproachto achieveredistributionof land assetsinBrazil.

     "Expropriationmeanspunishing (in accordance with current legislation)the owners
    of large tracts of land who keep them in unproductivestate and/orfail tofulfill the
    socialfunction stipulatedinthe country's Constitution." (Source. theRequest)

     "The central motivationfor our condemnation of the pretense of 'market-based
    agrarian reform' is not based on its burdensome means for transferring land to
    settlers: rather we are defending,in the Brazilian case, expropriationand resulting
    redistributionfor thepurposesof landreform...as the best wayto repairthemoraland
    ethical deviations which have generally characterized the history of private land
    ownership inBrazil." (Source:Supplementalletterto the Request)

3.2     Managementacceptsthe legitimacyof other viewpointsregardinglandreform,and
recognizes this to be a highlyemotivesubject of debate in Brazil. It doesnot suggestthat
the approach piloted under Loan 4147-BR should supplant all other land reform
instruments availableto theBrazilianGovernment. It does believe,however,that it would
be iriiprudent for a country with estimates ranging between 1.0 and 2.5 million landless
farmiliesliving in acuteruralpovertynot to be actively testing alternativemeansto achieve
swift and cost-effectivechangesinthe distributionof landassets.

3.3     Bank staff and Managementhave attempted to engage in discussionproponentsof
what might be described as the "expropriation only" approach but, as with many other
disputes founded on philosophicalconsiderations, it is not always possibleto bridgethe
void through informationandfacts.The followingexcerpt from a letterfromthePresident
of the Brazilian AgrarianReformAssociation, one of the organizationalsignatoriesof the
Request, to a Bank staff member in February 1999 reflects the tenor of some of these
exchanges.

    "If the Federal Governmentwishesto have a dialogueon land reformit mustwithdraw
  from the agenda andfrom its land strategy 'market-basedland reform'. On this we
   have nothing to say or discuss:we are totally opposed...The WorldBankknows...that it
   has intentionally entered into a national (even an international)strategic debate...the
   WorldBank has enoughwisdomto understand the scopeand delicacyof thisthemeand
   the internationalrepercussionswhichit will incur if itpersists withthisfinancing."

 Some Considerations on the Eligibility of the Request

 3.4      Contrary to the requirements set forth in the Inspection Panel Resolution and
 Operating Procedures,3the Request does not demonstrate actual or potential harm to
 Project beneficiaries. The sum and substance of the Requestors' complaint goes to a
 policy choice of the Brazilian Governmentin the area of land reform, rather than to the
 proper application by the Bank of its own policies and procedures. Moreover, it is
 Management's view that the Requestorsthemselves do not meet the eligibilitycriteriato
 file a Requestfor Inspection.

 3.5      Of all signatoriesof the Request identifiableby name, organization,locationand
 national identitynumber,noneis aProject beneficiary. Also,there is no evidencethat any
 beneficiaries designatedthe Requestorsto act as their agents in presentingthe Request.
 The large majority(morethan 80%)of the Requestorsare from outsidetheNortheast,and
 only 4.8% are from States wherethe Project is being implemented.At least 25% of the
 Requestors are Federal employees, mainly of INCRA, the Federal entity historically
 responsible for expropriation(the approach to land reform advocatedby the Requestors)
 and currentlya part of the Ministryof AgrarianReform, whichin turnis the implementing
 agency for Loan4147-BRatthe Federallevel.

3.6      In significant contrast, Management is making available for consultationby the
Inspection Panel materials it has received from participating States, includingmore than
6,000 signatures and other documents,six videotapes and three audio tapes, from actual
and potential beneficiaries and community associations, concerning all aspects of the
Project. Someof these materialspre-datethe Request and are thereforenot.a reactionto it.
Overall, they testify to the participants'belief in the Cedulada Terra,their understanding
of what it involves in terms of financial and other commitments,the benefitstheybelieve
they will achievethroughthe Project,the harm which stoppingthe program/Projectwould
cause, their preference for obtaining land through non-conflictive means rather than
through invasionas has been encouragedby some of the Requestors,andthe factthat these
beneficiary associationshave not askedanybody to representthem in a Requestor related
letter to the Bank, nor have theybeenconsulted about such a Requestor letter.

3.7     Managementunderstandsthat the Panel could not have discernedthe breakdownof
the Requestorsor the extentto whichthey do or do not represent the Projectbeneficiaries
for the purposes of the Request. It considers, however, that if this informationhad been
available to the Panel, the Request would not have qualified for registrationand is not
eligible for inspection.

            ChapterIV:Response to the Claims of Adverse Project Impacts
                     andViolationsof BankPolicies andProcedures

4.1     The Requestof December10, 1998,and the separateletter of December21. 1998.
make ten claims of adverse Project impacts and violations of Bank policies and
procedures. The Request itself presents six general claims of adverse Project impacts
without referring to any specific Bank policies or procedures (para. 1.3). The separate
letter reiterates these points and also alleges four violations of specific policies and
procedures, of which the Notice of Registration registers two (OD 4.15 and BP 17.50;
para. 1.4). In the interestsof transparency,Managementwill respond to all claims.At the
same time, however,we wish to make clear at the outset that we disagreethat there have
been any adverse impacts or that any Bank policies or procedures have been violated.
Moreover,Managementbelievesthat noneof the claimsis substantiated.

4.2     As some claims are closely related, Management has re-grouped them into the
following four clustersfor the purposesof this Response, indicatingin each case whether
the point originatesinthe Request(R)or the separateletter(SL).

   Cluster (a): claimsconcerningthe Project's contributionto povertyreductionand

 4.5     ClaimNo. 2: BeneficiariesWill Be Unable to Repay DebtsEnteredinto under
 The Project. As mentionedin para. 4.4 above, detailed economicand financialanalyses
 of expected Project impactswere carried out during Project preparation.Based on field
 visits by experienced local consultants, four typical farm models were developed for
 different sub-regions of the Northeast, taking into account the likely low level of
 capitalization, formal trainingand managementskills of Project beneficiaries. The main
finding was that family farming units would not only be viable, but that incomes of
beneficiaries would increase significantly, even after netting out repaymentobligations
incurred underthe Project. Sensitivityanalysis (inter alia for possiblepaymentof inflated
land prices, higher than estimatedwithout-projectfamily incomes andsimplerproduction
systems than those used in the farm models) established a very high degree of robustness
of the expectedeconomicandfinancialreturns.

4.6     Economic Rate of Return(ERR). The expected ERR for the overallpilot Project
is 32%, ranging from26%in semi-aridareasto 75% in peri-urbanlocations. Detailsof the
analyses are provided inthe ProjectAppraisalDocument.

4.7     Financial Viability. Perhaps the more relevant question, from the standpointof
the Requestors, concerns the expected financial viability of the Project at the level of
individuals and the communityassociations. Overall, the pre-Projectanalysesindicated
very good prospects for financial sustainability. There are several reasons.why this is
indeed likely, despite the fact that many settlements created under traditional land
distribution programsare still strugglingto survivefinancially.

 (i)    The Project depends on beneficiary initiative and selection of landsthey want to
        buy. This resultsin a positive selectionbias in favorof rural landlessfamilieswith
        initiative. It also meansthe landsselected are often amongthe bestavailableinthe
        area and are suitable for production systems compatible with beneficiaries' own
        experience and skills. In contrast, expropriated lands must be unproductive/
        underutilized,and areoftenof poorerquality.

 (ii)   Project beneficiaries have immediate access to matching grant resources for
        complementaryinvestments(housing, small-scale irrigation schemes,etc.). These
        funds, which includeinitial start-upsupport of US$1,300equivalentper family,are
        critical for the initial capitalization of new farmers and allow beneficiariesto
        immediately make productiveuse of their newly acquiredproperties.The separate

                                              ii



         letter following the Request criticizesaccess to these matching grantsfor unclear
         reasons, but they are actuallyan important design feature of the Project aimed at
         reducing beneficiaries' dependence on continuing Government support.
         Comparable investments in traditional administered settlement schemes on
         expropriatedpropertiestypically depend on lengthy budget approvalmechanisms
         and are thereforeofteninadequateor significantlydelayed.

   (iii) The Project includes funds with which beneficiaries can themselves contract
         technical assistance, which assures rapid and effective delivery of technical
         services. Beneficiariestend to selecttechnicians they feel will produceresultsfor
         them and, if they are not satisfied,have the freedomto make changes.In contrast,
         public extensionand other technical services typically neglect smallholders,and
         farmershavelittle choiceabouttheagent assignedto servethem.

 4.8     A number of evaluationstudies of the Project have been conductedthroughout
 1998, among them detailedcase studies on subprojects in Bahia and Ceara, whichhave
 focused on the question of financialviability (paras. 4.12-4.14). In line withthe pilot
 approach of thisProject,someminoradjustmentsto projectdesign,includingthe financial
 terms of the loansfor land purchase,are being made on the basis of the findingsfromthe
 studies.

4.9      Conditions of Land Purchase Financing.            With respect to land purchase
financing, this Project componentis financed entirely by the Federal Government,which
provides loans to communityassociationsto acquirethe landsthey haveselected(para.2.7
summarizes the arrangements). Initially,the terms of the Cedula da Terra(CdaT)loans
were forl0 years, includinga three-yeargrace period, at a positive real interestrate with
constant amortizationdeterminedby the Brazilian DevelopmentBank(BNDES)basedon
its average cost of long-termborrowing (TJLP). At the time of Project appraisal in
January 1997, the TJLP was 11%in nominal terms and inflation was 8%, yieldinga real
interest rate of 3%. This rate wasthe basis for the economicand financialmodelingdone
at Project appraisal. Sinceall landloanshave a three-yeargrace period,the firstpayments
were not due until 2001.

4.10    As a result of stabilizationefforts in Brazil, inflation fell to 2% in 1998 and the
TJLP rose to about 12% for most of the year, yielding a real interest rate of 10%. In
December 1998,the TJLP rosetojust over 18%, and has since declinedagainto 12.8%. If
the exceptionally high December 1998 rate were to persist over a long period, some
beneficiaries in areas with less favorable agro-climatic conditions would experience
repayment difficulties. The Federal Ministry of Land Reform monitoredthis situation
throughout last year,taking into accountthe findings of case studies carriedoutas part of
the Project. In December1998,the Ministrydecided on changes in the financingterms for
land purchase. In accordance with Complementary Law No. 93, CdaT beneficiaries
would be able to refinance their loans retroactively, with the new terms whichinclude a
20-year repayment periodwith three years of grace, and a fixed interestrate of 4%. With
these new terms, annual repaymentswould be about R$400. The retroactiveadjustments
would be made beforethe firstpaymentsof anyProject beneficiariesfall due.

 4.11    The Request mentions projections of per family annual revenues. cash flow and
 debt service projections,which Management is unable to reconstructor interpret. The
 projection of R$410 of per family annual revenues mentioned in the Request is
 significantly below any realistic expectations, even for the most disadvantaged
 commnunities.The typicalproductionsystem observed among beneficiarieson the 30-50
 ha family plots underthe Project in these areas includes livestock (mainlygoats),fodder
 crops, somelower-valuesubsistencecrops (beans,corn, manioc)and asmallarea of higher
 value productsfor saledependingon the location(sweetpotatoes,cashewandothers).The
 resulting net cash flow would range from R$1,000 after two years of Project
 imnplementation,to R$3,300afterfive years. It bearsrepeatingthat theseare the expected
 results in the least favorableareas; results in areas with better agro-climaticconditions
 would be considerablyhigher.

 4.12    Case Studies and Supervision Findings of Actual Results. In 1998, FAO
 conductedcase studiesof severalCdaT communityassociationsin the Statesof Cearaand
 Bahia, where Project implementationwas most advanced. The purposewas to verifythe
 economic and financialviabilityof the pre-Project assumptions,basedon the experiences
 of ongoing sub-projects,withspecialattentionto the more difficultsemi-aridzonesof both
 States. The case studiesare based on field visits to a large number of sub-projects. In
 Ceara, these includedsub-projectsfinanced under the earlier experimentalcomponentof
the Ceara Rural Developmentand Poverty Alleviation Project (para. 2.5), which have
existed longer and thus allow for a better evaluation of actual v. potential financial
viability.

4.13    Box I summarizesthe resultsof the FAO case studies. Overall,they confirmthe
likely economic and financial viability of most sub-projects. For sub-projectsin more
favorable agro-climaticzones,the actual financialreturns greatlyexceedprojectionsmade
during Project preparation. For those in the least favorable semi-arid zone of Ceara,
profitability is somewhatless than estimated at appraisal. These findingsweretaken into
accotint by the Ministryof Agrarian Reform, in designing adjustments to the financial
terms for the CdaT programin December 1998 (para. 4.10). With the revised.financial
terms, sub-projects in the semi-aridshould be financially viable,particularlyif they have
access to water, whichis also a criterion used by the STUsfor land-purchaseapproval in
semi-aridzones.

 Year 3 and RS3,500-4,000in Year 10,but a significant        share of this income is in the form of on-farm

 irrigation from RS1,600-5,000.Theonlybeneficiarieswho       wouldpotentiallybe unableto meet paymentsin

capacity to repay land purchaseloans. (Surprisingly, per     family costs of land in this area have not been
significantlyhigher than inotherareas.)

Cacao Region of Bahia. Annual family incomes will        range from RS2,000-S,000in Year 3 and RS4,000-
8,000in Year 10,dependingon climaticconditions.      Sufficientcash incomeshouldbe availabletorepay land
purchase loans. Expected financial outcomes in the     extreme South of Bahia are similarto, or marginally
better than, those in the cacaoregion.

Semi-arid Region of Bahia. Productionsystemsare        similarto those in the semi-aridzoneof Ceara(beans,
corn, manioc and livestock),although accessto    irrigation is much better. Family incomes are expectedto
reach R$1,700in droughtyears, and RS4,300in years of      normal rainfall, which shouldbe adequateto make
annual land purchasepayments:



4.14      As the Project is being intensively supervised and                there has been exceptional
interest in it (including by government teams from                  other countries), Bank staff and
consultants have visited the field frequently. They                   typically find that community
associations have a clear idea of the production systemsthey                will implement,appropriate
to the natural, human and financial resources                  available to them.         In many cases,
associations have purchased land that they earlier             rented or sharecropped,and therefore
have a very good notion of its production potential. In              other cases, they have purchased
lands that were under production but have recently                been semi-abandoned(for example,
coconut, cacao and bananas),and thereforeallow for               rapid cashreturns. Mostassociations
understand their repayment obligations and express                  the expectation of being able to
comply. Even more impressive,some communities havealready                       been able to accumulate

                                              14



 savings towards repayment.and some are inquiring about the possibilityof prepaymentto
 shortenamortizationperiodsandtotal interestpayments.:'

 4.15    Quality of Land Sold underthe Market-basedApproach. The Requestclaims
 that most land purchasedby rural workers and subsistence farmersunderthe Projectis     of
 the poorest quality. In fact, all evidence suggests that although landshave beenacquired
 under the Project at lowerthanexpropriatedland prices. theyare generallyof goodquality.
 Project beneficiariesmay be poor and under-educated,but they have worked the      landall
 their lives as subsistence farmers or laborers, and are unlikely to select a poor quality
 property to purchase, knowing, as they do, that their ability to repay   their land loan
 depends on its productivity. It is possible that some groups prefer to remainin an area
 long familiar to them ratherthan move, in which case they may purchasea propertywith
more limited naturalresources,but this is not verycommon. The generalexperiencethus
far is that communitiesbuygoodqualitylands,even ifthey haveto relocate.

4.16     To date, there areno knowncases of clear sub-projectfailure,althoughit wouldbe
unrealistic to assume that this will never happen at either the individualor association
level. In the event that individualsfail in their commitments,the Project Operational
Manualdefines clearproceduresfor substitutionof communitymembers.

4.17     Access to PROCERACredit. In claiming violation of OD 4.15, the Requestalso
asserts that Project beneficiaries will not be able to finance their start-up productive
activities through PROCERA (a special credit line for land reform, establishedin June
1986to complementthe NationalAgrarianReformProgramof October 10, 1985). Thisis
not the case. CdaT beneficiariesbecame eligible for PROCERAcredit through INCRA
Decree 567 of November 20, 1998. To date, no Project participants have received
PROCERA credit because the authorizing decree became effective only in late 1998.
According to INCRA's PROCERACoordinator, it normallytakes two yearsfromthe time
of formal settlementon a landreformplot, even for beneficiariesof traditionallandreform
schemes, to access PROCERA. Project beneficiaries do receive communityinvestments
and start-up grants,andthereforehave support duringthe installmentperiod. Whileaccess
to credit after this initial period is important, and the Project financial projectionsdo
indeed assume somecredit access,the heavilysubsidized terms of the PROCERAline are
not essentialfor financialviability.

4.18    Financial Obligationsof Recipientsof ExpropriatedLands underTraditional
Land Reform Schemes. Finally, Management wishes to point out that the             Request
conveys a misleading impressionthat beneficiariesof expropriationprocessesreceivetheir
lands free of charge in Brazil.Article25 of the Estatuto da Terra(NationalLandStatute)
states that expropriatedland shouldbe sold, not provided free, and Article81 of the same
law establishes a repaymentperiod of 20 years at an annual interest rate of 6%. Once a
project is considered "emancipated"(sufficientlyviable to transfer responsibilityandtitles

 to the participants). beneficiaries are legally required to pay the cost of land plus
 investments made. In practice, few schemesactually been ' emancipated",but when this
 occurs the participantswillhavehigherobligationsthan do the Project beneficiaries,dueto
 the differencein terms andthe inclusionof investmentsin the loanstoberepaid.

 4.19    ClaimNo. 3: TheProjectIs Not AchievingIts Objectives. The bbjectiveof the
 pilot Project is to help reduce rural poverty and test a market-based land reform
 mechanism, whereby beneficiary associations would obtain financing to purchase and
 establish agricultural properties which they judge to be suitable, and for which they
 negotiate directly with willing sellers. Community response to the pilot has been
 exceptionally favorable,and implementationis running ahead of schedule. As indicated
 earlier, 15,000rural familieswereto have beensettled over a three-yearperiod,usingthis
 mechanism. In less than 18 months,8,000 familieshave alreadyreceivedland andtitles,
 7,000 have already negotiatedland purchasesand will receive loans shortly,and 28,000
 farnilies are organizedinto community associations and have selected propertieswhich
 they wish to purchase. The only thing holding back these 28,000 families is lack of
 resources, which the Brazilian Government is attempting to negotiate with the Bank
 through an expansionof the pilot under an AdaptableProgramLoan (paras. 1.2and 2.9).
 Case studiesand intensivesupervisionconfirmgood prospectsfor sustainabilityof the vast
 majority of sub-projects,withno knownfailuresto date.

 4.20   Claim No. 4: The Project Will Lead to an Increase in the Prices of
 Agricultural Land.     The Notice of Registration indicatesthat the Requestorsclaim the
 Project has increasedthe price of agriculturallandsavailablefor ruralworkers.In fact, the
actual claim in the Request is that the Project will lead to an increasein land prices in
future. Theoretically, the availability of land purchase financing should stimulate the
demand for land,and thiscouldlead to increasesin landprices. Whetherthiswill occurin
practice depends on the price elasticityof land demand and supply, and on the scale of
Project-financedlandpurchases. Measuringthis effect is complicatedby the largenumber
of simultaneousfactorsthat influencethe land marketovertime.

4.21    All available data indicate that land prices in Brazil have been falling in recent
years, and have continuedto do so even in States that are participatingin the pilot Project
(see Reydon and Plata, 1998). These falling prices are generally attributedto economic
stabilization and removalof agriculturalsubsidies followingintroductionof the Real Plan
in 1994. This trend couldcometo an end, or evenbe reversed, dependingonthe evolution
of the current economic crisis in Brazil, but Management believesthat price movements
would have little to do with the pilot Project because it is too small to exert a significant
influence on the market. In 1998,221,428ha were acquiredin fiveNortheaststates. This
represents 0.3% of the agriculturalland, and only a fraction of all land transactedin the
same year, in these states.

4.22    Although it is plarmedto expand the pilot, both within and outsidethe Northeast
region, it is unlikelythat the area acquiredin any one state and given year willexceedthe
scale of the Project inthe states whereit was implementedin 1998. Moreover,discussions
with landowners and bankers in various states confirm the large stock of land held by

                                             16



 banks as collateral for defaulted farm debt or bx absentee-owners interested in selling.
 Comparingthe size of the landmarketand the scale of the project, it seemshighlyimlikely
 that the pilot, or its expansion,would significantly affect the price of agriculturalland.
 Nonetheless, Managementis aware of the theoretical potential for some impact and has
 had this matter underconsiderationsince the earliest design stage of the Project. Wewill
 continue to monitor the situation,and would certainly react to any clearindicationsthat
 land prices were increasing in response to Project activities. In particular, if the
 concentrationof Projectactivitiesin a small area seemed to be leadingto localland price
 increases, a consciouseffortwouldbemade to broadenthe geographicscopeof the project
 in orderto reducethispotentiallocalpressureon land prices.

               Constitutionalityof Pursuinga Market-basedApproachto Land
               Reformin BrazilandWhetherIt Is Crowdingout Expropriation

 4.23    Claim No. 5: The Project Is Not Being Implemented as A Pilot. The
 Requestors contend that the Project is not being implemented as a pilot and is being
 expanded without proper evaluation (the latter point is not mentioned in the Notice of
 Registration). Evenif true,this claimaboutwhether the Project is a pilotwouldnotper se
 be grounds for allegingharmto individualparticipants. Managementin fact believesthat
 this Project exemplifies a successfulapproachto piloting. The Projectwas designedto test
 a new methodology,witha limitednumberof targeted beneficiariesinfive states(i.e.,less
than the total number of Northeast states, but adequate to test the mechanism under
different conditions). Due to the huge demand for participation, the pilot is being
implementedmuch fasterthanoriginallyplanned,but it still accountsfor lessthan 10%of
all land reformbeneficiariesin 1998.

4.24    As this is a pilot Project,there has been intensive supervision,internationaland
national seminars, studies and workshops. The Project is being supervisedwith very
strong input from the field. In addition to formal supervision from Headquarters,Bank
staff in the Brasilia and Recife Officeshave made some 18 visits to participatingstates
since the Project started. The Project has also been visited by the CMU Director and
discussed in three major seminars, with extensive participation by Governmentand the
Bank, the private sector,NGOs, academia,international specialists andrepresentativesof
multilateral/bilateral organizations.There have been a number of workshopsinvolvingthe
STUs and the communityassociationsof each state. As an example,the materialwhich
Management is making available to the Panel includes a report and audio tapes of a
meeting of the presidentsandsomemembersof all the communityassociationsinvolvedin
the Project, in Bahia in November 1998. The findings and recommendationswere
reviewed by the beneficiarieswithState authoritiesand the Ministerof AgrarianReform.

An ambitious evaluation exercise is underway, based on household interviews with
representative panels of Project beneficiaries,beneficiaries of traditional(expropriation-

4.26    Claim No. 6:      The Project Is an Alternative/Substitute Instead of A
Complement to Brazil's Constitutionally-Mandated Land Reform. The Request
questions the constitutionality of a market-based approach to achieve land reform,
suggesting that the Project somehow violates the Brazilian Constitution and related
legislation. Management understands that expropriation is only one of the land reform
instruments, which can be used in Brazil, and is satisfied that altemative approachesare
legally permissible. Managementdoes not disagree that expropriationis an importantand
necessary instrumentat the dispositionof the Brazilian Govenmment,  nor does it expectthat

                                            I8



the market-based approach piloted under Loan      4147-BR would supplant all other land
reform instruments.

4.27    Constitutionalityllegalityof Alternativesto   Expropriation. Propertvis one of
the fundamental rights guaranteedby Brazilian     Constitution of 1988 (Article 5, XXII).
Nonetheless, the Constitutionalsoprovides that under    certain and specificcircumstances.
 the Federal Government may expropriate land.        Article 184 authorizes the Federal
 Governmentto expropriatefor thepurposesof     agrarianreform:

         "It falls under the Republic's authority to  expropriatefor social interest,for
        purposes of agrarian reform, rural property    which is not performing its social
       function, againstprior andfair compensationin     agrarian debtbonds (TDA)witha
        clauseprovidingfor the maintenanceof real value and     redeemablewithinaperiod
        of up to twentyyears asfrom the secondyear   of issue,and the use ofwhichshallbe
        definedin law.

However, while Article 184 provides the        legal discretion/authority for the Federal
Government to expropriateunder certain conditions,     it neither precludes other means to
achieve agrarian reform nor restricts the private     purchase and sale of land. This
interpretation is supportedby: (a) a specific legalopinion issued by the General Counsel
of the Brazilian Ministry of Land Reform; (b) the      customary legal opinion whichthe
Bank receives from the Attorney General of the Ministry       of Finance as a conditionof
effectiveness, stating that the Loan Agreement    is enforceable and in conformitywith
Brazilian legislation; and (c) writings by respected       Brazilian legal scholars (eg.,
Constitutional expert Dr. Jose Afonsoda Silva, Curso   do Direito ConstitucionalPositivo,
1992, in which he commentson Article 184 of the      Constitution: "It does not mean that
land reform can only be done through this way [expropriation]").     Finally, the principal
land legislation of Brazil,the 1964Land Statute,or Estatuto da    Terra,clearlyestablishes
in its Title II (LandReform), ChapterI (Objectivesand    Means to Access Rural Property),
Article 17that:

        "The accessto ruralpropertyshall be implementedthroughthe distributionor
       redistribution of land, through the execution         of the following measures:
       (a) expropriationfor social interest;(b) donation; (c)   purchaseand sale:
        (d)gathering of vacantland;(e)(vetoed- thispara.    Dealt withpublic landillegally
       occupiedor exploredbythirdparties); (j) inheritanceor bequest."

4.28   The Market-based Approach - Complementarity              or Substitution of Other
Land Reform Instruments? Management            has never suggested that the market-based
approach, which is being piloted under Loan 4147-BR,       should supplant all other land
reform instruments in Brazil. It does believe,  however,that it would be imprudentfor a
country with estimates ranging between 1.0     and 2.5 million landless families living in
acute rural poverty not to be activelytesting alternativemeans   to achieve swift and cost-
effective changes inthe distributionof land assets.

                                                     19



 4.29     The concerns about substitution may have arisen because of the overwhelming
 success of the pilot Project on the one hand, and the continuing high costs and limited
 sustainability of traditional land reform on the other.            The Table below shows the per
 family cost of traditional land reform to be about twice as high as the market-based
 approach being piloted under the Project.

 4.30    In 1998, during which most of the approximately 8,000 families who have already
received lands and titles were processed, US$55 million equivalent, or 3.5% of total
expenditures spent by the Government on its traditional land reform program, were spent
in the Cedula da Terra program. The approved budget for 1999 includes R$30 million for
CdaT, or 2.1% of the total budget of R$ 1.4 billion allocated for the traditional land reform
program.     At the same time, in the five participating Northeast states, the Project has
increased the overall number of families benefited by land reform under any approach,
rather than replaced the traditional approach. In 1997, the last year before effective Project
implementation, about 15,800 families were benefited in the Project states by traditional
land reform.      This number remained at about 15,600 in 1998.                  The size of areas
expropriated also remained roughly constant: 521,800 ha in 1997 v. 508,300 ha in 1998.
At the national level, the traditional land reform program was significantly expanded over
the same period.

4.31     Finally, as a practical matter, the Project is likely to remain a complement to, rather
than a substitute for, expropriation because it does not generally deal with larger
properties. The Project depends entirely on the initiative of community associations whose
members are willing to work closely together to select a property, negotiate the price,
assume financial obligations, prepare and implement complementary sub-projects, and
contract technical assistance.        Given the difficulties of organizing larger beneficiary
associations of this kind, the average size has been small compared with that of INCRA
settlements, and Management does not expect this to change. In other words, the Project
typically targets smaller properties not subject to expropriation. The large majority of the

                                             20



 properties acquired under the pilot Project could not have been legally expropriated.
 because they do not reach the minimum size required for expropriation under the
 Constitution and related legislation. The average size of properties expropriatedby
 INCRA in the Northeastwas 1,566ha in 1997and 1,463 ha in 1998(2.3 and 1.8timesthe
 Project average,respectively,in eachof thetwo years). In addition,of thesmallnumberof
 properties that couldhave beenlegallyexpropriatedon the basis of theirsize,manywould
 not have been considered unproductive (i.e., meeting the non-perfornance of social
 function criterion, which is also required for expropriation). According to INCRA,
 because of these restrictions, nearly four million properties (corresponding to
 approximately200 millionha of land,someof the bestin the country)are outof the reach
 of expropriation. In summary,the market-basedapproach has, for all the reasonsdetailed
 above, been a complementary instrument rather than a substitute for expropriation.
 Looking to the future,the market-basedoptionwould not replacealternativeapproachesto
 land reform, such as expropriation,but it would constitute an extremelyimportantoption
 in the Govemment's array of instrumentsfor dealing with serious and long-standingland
 issues.

 4.32    ExpropriationasA Formof Punishment. The Requestorsassertthat landreform
 through expropriationpunishes owners who maintain large tracts of unproductiveland.
 Whatever the theoreticalmerits of this argument,expropriation in Brazil has, in practice,
 resulted in compensationwell abovethe marketvalue of the land and thus in a significant
transfer of resourcestothe previouslandowners.

4.33    Under the pilot Project, land has been acquired at an averagecostof R$182/haor
R$4,847/family. The nominal cost of expropriated land in the Northeast in 1998 was
R311/haand R$8,229/family.Sincepart of the expropriationcompensationis paidin long
term government bonds (TDAs) at below-market interest rates, the nominalvalues for
expropriation need to be adjusted to present value terms to be comparableto the cash
payments to owners under the Project. Employing an estimated medium-to long-term
interest rate of 16%,the costof expropriatedland in the Northeastin 1998was R$249/ha
and R$6,578/family- still well abovethe unit costs underthe Project. Moreover,in many
cases expropriatedownerslaterobtainadditionalcompensationthroughjudicial actions. A
recent study shows that the final cost, after judicial action, of expropriatedland in the
Northeast has averagedthree times the initial compensation amount. As the Presidentof
INCRA testifiedduringthe Senatehearings on the Cedulada Terraprogram:

        "...We are paying some rural properties amounts in excess of RS1OOmillion
       [around USS100million at the time]. None of thoseproperties is worth 10% of
        that value. Thosevaluesare the resultnot of over-valuationbyINCRA,butactually
       of under-valuation. When INCRA under-values, the owner goes to the courts,
        which normally rule in theirfavor. Theseprocesses take severalyears, accruing
       compensatory interest charges...For years and years we paid 12% plus TR [an
       inflation adjustment],compensatoryinterest and interest on arrears...This is the
       worst business...Is this what the beneficiaries [of agrarian reform]want? Is this
       punishment? It could be a psychological punishment, but it is not reflected in
       material termsfrom anypoint of view."

 Cluster (c ): Claims Concerning Environmental Assessment



 4.34    Claim No. 7: The Project violates OD 4.01 on EnvironmentalAssessment.
 The final sentenceof para. 1(b)of the supplementallettertothe Requestsclaimsthat:

         "Moreover, the appraisalpolicy of the World Bank such as OP 4.01 [reference
         should beto OD4.01]EnvironmentalAssessment,wasnotput intoeffect."

 The claim is not discussedelsewherein,the Request, no informationis presentedto show
 harm, and the Inspection Panel did not include this item in its Notice of Registration.
 Management agreeswith the Panel on this point. However,in the interestsof providing
 full informationaboutthe Project,Managementwould liketo make the followingpoints.

 4.35    In compliancewithOD4.01,the Projectwas screenedandgiven anEnvironmental
 Category "B", as no significantadverse environmental impacts were expectedto result
 from Project activities. Given that the specific properties to be purchased and the
 complementaryinvestmentsthat wouldbe needed would beidentifiedonlyinthe courseof
 implementation,the approachfollowed(typicalof programmaticprojectsof this kind)was
 to make provision in the State OperationalManuals for proper environmentalscreening,
 analysis and mitigationmechanismsfor subprojects. Concerningeligibilitycriteriafor the
 purchase of land, the Manuals state that properties considered for purchase must
 demonstrate potential for sustainable exploitation of natural resources; they must be
 properly demarcatedand legal reserve areas registered in writing; they cannot be located
near indigenous reserves if they are not clearly demarcated; and no properties will be
considered which are primary forest or on which there are land claims by indigenous
people. By way of illustration,in the material which Managementis providing to the
Panel, are examples of environmentalprotection plans for land purchasesand on land
investments.



Cluster (d): ClaimsConcerningConsultation, Disclosureof Information
              and NGO Participation

4.36    Claim No. 8: The Bank Failed to Consult and AdequatelyInform Project-
Affected People and Their Representatives; Claim No. 9: The ProjectViolatesBP
17.50 on Disclosure of Operational Information; and Claim No. 10: The Project
Violates GP 14.70on InvolvingNon-GovernmentalOrganizationsin Bank-supported
Activities. The Request alleges that information about the Project, including the
Operational Manual, was not made available to Project beneficiaries or their
representatives, as required under BP 17.50 (incorrectly referred to as OP 17.50 in the
Request). The intentof BP 17.50is to establish a mechanismthroughwhichtransparency
concerning Bank-supportedoperations is effected by the release by the Bank of relevant
information to the public throughthe Public InformationCenter (InfoShop)at key stages
of Project preparation.

 4.37   Disclosure bv the Bank Managementhas disclosed all standard informationon
 the Project (Project InformationDocument/PID.EnvironmentalData Sheet. and Project
 Appraisal Document/PAD)through its InfoShop. Moreover, the Country Management
 Unit for Brazil is locatedin the field and routinely assists interestedparties who mav not
 know how to access the InfoShopin Washington,D.C., to obtain documentswhich are
 available to the public. Meetings of Bank staff with some representatives of the
 Requestors have taken place, including a meeting with the Bank's CountryDirector on
 October 14, 1998. In this meeting, the Director indicated the Bank's willingnessto
 maintain an open dialogueon land issues in general, and on the Project,offeringto share
 the major findings of ongoingevaluation studies with the Requestors and welcominga
 mutual exchangeof views on these findings. The Bank intends to continueits effortsto
 find common ground on land issueswiththe Requestorsand otherorganizations,building
 on the process already started in order to ensure the best possible outcome for the
 beneficiaries.

4.38    Dissemination by the Borrower. With respect to the Operational Manual and
related information at the local level,the STUs in the States where the pilot Project is
being executed sent copies of their OM's early on to representatives of most of the
organizations which have signedthe Request. Specifically,the OM was sent to various
church groups, the Movimentosem Terra (MST) and the State Federations and National
Confederationof Rural Workers(FETAG/CONTAG). Managementis makingavailableto
the Panel some 100 examplesof the covering letters attaching the OM to organizational
signatories of the Request and other institutions. In addition,all States have conducted
information campaignsaboutthe Project throughradio, television, pamphletsandposters.
Examples of tapes used on television and radio, as well as many examples of the              (
pamphlets and posters about the Project, are also being made available to the Panel. In
many of the declarations in the video and audio tapes which have been providedto the
Bank and are available to the Inspection Panel for consultation (para. ,1.5),beneficiaries
themselves describe having firstheard about the prograrnthrough radio andtelevision,or
through the local rural syndicates,the church or the MST. Giventhat 8,000 familieshave
already received landsandtitles,7,000will receiveloans shortly,andanother28,000areat
varying stages in the process- all in less than 18 months - it is simply not crediblethat
there has not been a major effortat informationdisseminationaboutthis Project.

4.39    Participation of Beneficiaries. The design of the Project places beneficiariesin
the driver's seat, and its success depends entirely on their active participation,through
community associations,in all stagesof the Project cycle. The associationsmust selectthe
land they wish to purchase,negotiate the price with the seller, take the loan, identifyand
execute complementary investments, and contract technical assistance to improve
productivity andoutput of their newproperties. The Supplementalletterclaimsthat:

   "...the States of Cearaand Bahia...communityassociationsare beingconstituted (i)by
   the agents of the state governments,mediatorsof the interestsof the landowners,or (ii)
   by the landowner himself, interestedin selling his land. In the great majorityof cases
   studied, the rural workersare not aware of the commitmentthey arepledging, because
   the informationthat they are assuminga credit burdenis omittedfrom them."

 4.40    Managementbelievesthese assertionsare unfounded. W'ithrespectto the States of
 Ceara andBahia. anumberof communityassociationspre-datethe Project. In Ceara,84%
 of the participating associationsexisted before the Project, some of them for as long as 9
 orlO years. Of the remaining 16%, some were established at the initiative or with the
 participation of the local rural syndicate; others followed the example of neighboring
 communities. In Bahia,mostof the new associations havebeen formedwiththe supportof
 the church, the local rural syndicates,the MST and other pre-existinglocalorganizations.
 In addition,the Stateshaveorganizedmeetings witheach of the associationsto reviewthe
 conditions of the land loans. In the videotapes available to the Panel, almost all
 communities state that they knew they had to pay for the land and the conditionsof the
 loans. The communitiesthemselvesheld meetingsto discuss whetherthey shouldtake the
 loan. The results of these meetings are regularly recorded in minutes signed by all
 members of the communityassociation. Examplesof such signedminutesare availableto
 the Panel. Managementis aware of some cases where landownersor their agents have
 attempted to use the communityassociations, but the members have resisted, and the
 communities and STUs have been very attentive to this possibility. The fact that the
 average cost of the Project landshas been below expropriated land prices suggeststhat
 landownerswho maybe attemptingto subvertthe processare notgenerallysucceeding.

 4.41   Participation by Non-governmental Organizations. The local chapters of
 several of the rural movementswhichhave signed the Request have been involvedin the
Project, andhaveplayed animportantrole in disseminatinginformationabout it,helpingto
organize new community associations, assisting communities in processing their
paperwork, providingtransportationfor them to be able to visit alternativeproperties,and
helping with the decision-makingprocess about which property to select. Community
associations are also free to contract with any local technician or organizationfor the
provision of technical assistanceto help them improve the productivityand outputof the
lands purchased. In the video and audio tapes which the Inspection Panel may wish to
consult (para. 1.5),thereare numerousexamplesof beneficiariesmentioningsuchhelp:

   "The MST lets us knowabout the Project, helps us to get organized,lends us money
   during our organizationphase, and is nowproviding technicalassistancetous."

   "We werepart of one of the invasions[of private farms] organizedby the MST, when
   one of the [MST] leaderstold usabout the CdaTProjectand helpedus toget organized
   to be able toparticipate in it."

   "The rural syndicateflocal affiliateof CONTAG] let us know abouttheProject,helped
   us toform the associationtoparticipate, helped us with thepaper-work helpedus with
   the negotiation of theland,and continueshelping us withthe wholeprocess."

   Statement by a localCatholicpriest: "The CdaTprogram should be implementedat a
   muchfaster pace. Wehave beenable to organize the communitiestoparticipateinit at
   a muchfaster pace thanthespeed with which the moneyis becomingavailable."

4.42   Despite this kindof help on the ground at the local level,the national leadershipof
some of the most important rural movements remain opposed to the Cedula da Terra

 program and have refusedto participatein formal Project councils. The followincexcerpt
 from the Senate Hearingsin Brazilon the pilot Project reflects this position.In discussing
 the invitation to representatives of the national movements to          participate in the
 Consultative Council for the Project, the MST representativeto the Senate Hearinghad
 this to say:

          "...Not only will we not participate in the council, but we willfight this type of'
         Program. I wouldliketo leavethisfact very clearand to be objective,becausewe
         do not wanttocreateillusionswith anyoneaboutthisProgram."



                                 Chapter V: Conclusions

 5.01    Management considers that the Brazil Land Reform and Poverty           Alleviation
 Project is a very welldesignedoperation. As a pilot, it is being closelysupervised,studied
 and fine-tuned. The Projectis alreadyyieldingsignificantresults on the groundfor    alarge
 number of poor rural familiesin the Northeast of Brazil, and shows excitingpromiseas     a
cost-effective, expeditiousand non-conflictivemeans of achieving a redistributionof land
assets. It has not and wouldnot replaceall alternativeapproachesto landreform,such as
expropriation, but it does constitute an extremely important option in the Government's
array of instrumentsfor dealingwith seriousand longstandinglandissues.

5.02     The Requestors do not demonstrate real or potential harm to any direct Project
beneficiaries,nor do theyseekto improvethe Projectdesignor execution. Theobjectiveis
to stop the Project and prevent expansion of market-based land reform,.because they
advocate "punitiveexpropriation"as the only "legitimate"meansto redistributelandassets
in Brazil. The foundationof this argumentis philosophical,and centers on a policychoice
of the Government, andnot on the proper applicationby the Bank of itsown policiesand
procedures. The only specificclaimsof non-compliancewithBankpoliciesandprocedures
are unsubstantiated andare drawnfrom a separate letter,signed by oneRequestorand not
part of the Request as defined by the Panel. None of the identifiable signatoriesof the
Request is a Project beneficiary(para. 3.5), and no evidenceis presentedto showthat the
beneficiaries designated any of the Requestors to act as their agent in presenting the
Request. On the other hand, there is now voluminous documentationfrom the actual
beneficiaries, expressingtheir clear and passionate support for the Project. In addition,
among the signatures to documents repudiating the Request are those               of local
representatives of churches of various denominations, local mayors and municipal
assemblies, and rural syndicates(affiliates of the national CONTAG),also      voicing their
support for the beneficiaries'position.

5.03    For the reasons shownabove, Management respectfullysubmits that the Request
does not meet the requirements for Registration or Inspection in Resolution 93-10        of
September 22, 1993, establishing the Inspection Panel, or in the August 19, 1994
Operating Proceduresof the Panel.

  support. Some 65 staffweeks have           been used in Project supervisionover a         20-month
  period, well above the averagefor other prdljectsin           Brazil, and with more than 70% of
  supervisiontime providedby staff of          the Bank's Brasilia and Recife Offices.         Besides
  formal supervisionfromBankHeadquarters,project                staff in the field officeshave made
  some 18visits to participatingstatessince the project          started. The Project has alsobeen
  visited by the BrazilCMUDirectorand            other Bank Directors includingfromthe          Africa
  Region. In addition, the project          has been discussed in three major seminars             with
  extensive participationfromGovernmentand              the Bank, the private sector/civilsociety,
  NGOs, academia,internationalspecialistsandmultilateral/bilateralorganizations.             2   There
  have also been a number of workshops             involving the State Technical Units with         the
 associations in eachstate. Availableto the         Panel for its review,is a reportandtwo audio
 tapes of the meeting of the presidents          of all community associationsinvolved in           the
 Project and some of their membership,in            Bahia in November 1998. The findingsand
 recommendationswerereviewedby              the beneficiarieswith State Governmentauthorities
 and the Minister of AgrarianReform.           The result of all this activityhas beena      seriesof
 lessons whichhave beenor will be incorporatedas changesor                adaptationsin the existing
 project and the designof the follow-up,AdaptableProgramLoan.                 Theseinclude:

 (a)      Access to Land. A central lesson         learnedand the message beingreceivedfrom
many organizationsandthe beneficiariesthemselves,is that the targetpopulationfor                   land
reform wants access to land in a          rapid, participatory and less conflictivemanner, even
though they know the land must be            paid for. Proof of this was the huge        demand for

 purchase of land whichexceeded40.000 families in one year of Project implementation.
 The market-basedapproachpilotedunderthe project expeditesthe settlementof landless
 rural families, with land acquisitionfrom identificationto purchase typicallytaking less
 than 90 days. Further,projectedhousehold incomes (five years after land acquisition)
 range from 3 to 10times the pre-projecthouseholdincomeand permitthesehouseholds
 to service their land loans.To date, families have generally chosen good qualityland at
 costs that represent savings relative to traditionalmethods of land reform and without
 exerting upward pressure on land prices. Targetinghas been effectiveand efficient,the
 vast majorityof beneficiarieshavingcharacteristicsconsistentwiththetargetpopulation.

 (b)     Size of Beneficiary Groups: It has been observed that groups should have a
 minimum of 10familiesand a maximnumof around50 for optimalperformance. Groups
 smallerthan 10familiesare likelyto have difficultyformingan associationboard,which
 is a conditionof eligibilityfor land;and,the resourcesavailableto a verysmall groupare
 likely to be insufficientto make certain investments,either due to cost as inthe case of
 rural electrification,or to under-utilizationof purchased equipment, in the case of a
 tractor. For groupsof over50 families,experiencehas shownthat managementof a rural
property by a large group can be difficult and that the tendency, demonstrated in
traditional, i.e. expropriation-basedland reform settlements, where 100, 200 or more
 families are settled,is for such groupsto ultimatelybe sub-dividedinto smallergroupsof
around 50 familieswhichthen createtheir own associations.

c)      Community Investments: Experience of land reform over many decades has
shown that to avoid out-migrationand keep families on their land, conditions must be
createdfor themto establishthemselvesinthe area immediatelyafterland is acquired. In
the case of the market-basedpilot, a mechanismwas introducedby which,immediately
after land acquisition,theTechnicalUnit calculatesthe amountof communityinvestment
to which each beneficiaryassociationis entitled,plus aid in the amountof US$1,300.00
for the cost of establishingeach family. The TU authorizesthe Bancodo Brasiltodraft a
single contract with the association,with investmentsubprojectresourcesbeing blocked
in each association's accountuntil subproject proposals are approved by the Technical
Unit, at whichpoint the resourcesare rapidly unblockedand disbursed. Thisstreamlined
mechanism has brought many advantages to beneficiary families, permitting them to
immediately use the aid money to move in and get established. The certaintyof being
able to use resources for investmentsin the land acquired, without the need to work as
paid laborers to support their families, is an incentive for beneficiariesto establish the
property rapidly and startfarming.

d)      Organizations of Associations: Although many beneficiary associationswere
formed several years ago and are well-organized,others were formedonlyvery recently.
Experience has shownthat these more recentassociationscan tendto lack aset of ethical
values andprinciplesto guideinterpersonalrelationshipsbetweenthe groupsformed,and
an understanding of public policies and basic notions of planning, which are neededto
make settlements sustainable.       These issues have been discussed at length with
participating states and the Nucleus of Agricultural Studies and Development(NEAD),
and recommendationshave been adopted for the propertraining of settlers to efficiently

  implement and start settlementactivities. creating the foundations for the settlement's
  sustainability. Thismodel for building human and social capitalwill also be a featureof
 the proposedfollow-upProject,shouldthe Bank go ahead withits financing.

  e)     Technical Assistance: Studies/observations during the first year of project
  implementation indicated that official technical assistance (TA) has fallen short of
 expectations in both quality and timeliness. The Project calls for TA funding for the
 preparation and implementationof community investment subprojects. However,
 communities need.moreeffectiveand efficient TA in planning familyfarning activities,
 i.e., the production of crops and their processing, storage and nmarketing.During
 implementationof the pilot,alternativeshave been discussed with the Statesto improve
 TA for beneficiaryfamilies,especiallyin the firstthree yearsof settlement. Theamount
 allocatedfor the communitytopurchaseTA has been increasedduringthe landpurchase
 process and subsequentproductionplanning over the first three yearsafter installationto
 help ensureincreasesinproductivityandincomes.

 f)      Financial Charges: When the Project was prepared, the Long-TermInterest
 Rate - TJLP - was selected by the Government to apply to the credits obtainedby
 associations to purchaselands and to define the financial charges for each loan. The
 paymentperiod as definedwas up to 10years, withup to 3 years' grace. Studiesdoneby
 the Nucleus of AgriculturalStudies and Development (NEAD) indicatedthat, in some
 regions such as the northemlitoral(coastalregion) of Bahiaand Ceara,landsacquiredby
 associations could be paid for in the period stipulated. In other regions, however,
principally the semi-arid,which is subject to frequent droughts, families could find it
hard to fulfil their repaymentobligationsin yearsof drought. In addition,withthe rising
interest rates, the TJLP rose significantly, becoming burdensome for small farmers
benefiting from the Project. In discussionsduring the preparationof the new Project,it
was agreed that the TJLP would no longer be used to define financialchargesstemming
from the loan and wouldbe replacedby a fixed interestrate of 4% p.a. similarto the one
to be charged by the LandBank (Bancoda Terra). Moreover,the paymentperiodwould
be iricreasedto 20 years. Thesenew charges and terms will also be valid for the current
pilot Project, and be appliedretroactively as a refinancingof current land loans. There
will be no loss to Project beneficiaries,since no portion-of the loans contractedhas yet
expired.

g)      Beneficiary Participation and Consultative Councils: The design of the
Project places beneficiariesin the driver's seat, and its success dependsentirelyon their
active participation, throughcommunity associations, in all stages of the Project cycle.
Experience to date has been very positive at the community level,with the associations
(many of them pre-dating the Project) showing strong interest, initiative and active
participation. At the sametime,the Project also envisagedthe creationof a Consultative
Council in each State, comprising representatives of Government and organizedcivil
society, includingchurches,unions (of owners and workers)and othernon-governmental
organization (NGOs). In contrastto the active grassroots level communityassociations,
the Councils' performance in the first year of implementation has been below
expectations. The Bank and the Government are reviewing the functions,composition
