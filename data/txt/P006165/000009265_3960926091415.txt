MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT"
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR11.7 MILLION TO THE
REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR THE LA PAZ MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Bolivia for SDR11.7 million (US$15.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be made for 35 years,
including 10 years' grace, with repayment in semi-annual installments of
1-1/4Z of the principal amount from the eleventh year through the twentieth
year, and of 2-1/2% from the twenty-first year until final maturity.  About
75% of the proceeds of the credit, denominated in US dollars, would be
on-lent to the Municipality of La Paz at a fixed interest rate of 8-1/2%
per annum, and repaid to the Government in national currency at the
official rate of exchange on the payment date. The amounts on-lent would
be amortized over 20 years from the date of on-lending. The other 25% of
the credit proceeds would be passed on to the Municipality as a grant.
Parallel cofinancing, in the form of grants, has been obtained from the
German Technical Cooperation A0ency, and will be obtained from the
Governments of France, Spain and The Netherlands, to meet part of the cost
of technical assistance and institutional improvements.
2.        Background.  La Paz is a city of 1.2 million, or about 20% of
Bolivia's population. Most of the country's commercial, financial and
administrative activities, and a very large proportion of the nation's
health, education and social facilities, are concentrated there. The city
generates about half of Bolivia's internal fiscal revenues. During the
last decade, the number of inhabitants has roughly doubled in -ize, mainly
because of immigrat on from rural areas and the depressed mining centers.
Although this growth is not unusual by Latin American standards, it
represents a challenge because of the city's unusually difficult physical
environment and its strained capacity to absorb more migrants in a
productive manner. In particular, lower income neighborhoods, comprising
about half of the population, are spread on the unstable steep slopes of
the La Paz valley, where lack of erosion control and drainage results in
destructive mud flows and landslides. In addition, the shortage of urban
transport and the deficient sanitation conditions represent serious
constraints to the efficient and harmonious development of the city.
3.        The National Government that took office in August 1985 inherited
an economy beset by rampant inflation, contracted revenues, a large public
sector deficit, lack of confidence both internally and abroad, a weak
administration, and increasing urban poverty. These problems have had a
particularly acute impact on the Municipality of La Paz. In line with the
Government's new economic policy, incorporating a national tax reform, the
Municipality has given priority to concerted measures, which aim at
transforming the autonomous local government into an equitable, efficient,
and financially viable provider of urban services. An Investment and
Modernization Program (IMP) has been worked out, focusing on urban
upgrading and landslide control, primarily in low income areas, on better
transport and sanitation conditions, streamlined municipal organization,



- 2 -
modern administrative pracedures, and sound financial mnagement.  The
bloated municipal staff has been reduced by about one-third, from 5,200 in
the fall of 1985 to 3,500 at present, with a view to raising wages and
salaries, by about 20% in real terms, without expenditure on Personnel
exceeding the legally authorized limit of 50% of municipal revenues, and
thus enhancing the efficiency of the administration. A 10-vear backlog in
infrastructure maintenance began to be tackled. A Municipal Training
Institute was created in early 1987 to assist in strengthening the various
departments of the Nunicipality,  Contacts were established with two
South-American cities, known for their high standards of administration and
effective management of urban services; and steps were taken to secure
technical asslstance from several European Governments in preventing floods
and landslides, reorranizing municipal departments and training personnel,
improving planning and accounting, and appropriately registering and
assessing urban property.
4.        The Bank became active in the urban sector of Bolivia's economy
in the mid-seventies. Its first loan for an Urban Development Project was
made in 1977 (Loan 1489-BO). The loan helped finance urban upgrading works
in low-income neighborhoods of La Paz, the provision of sites and services
to the inhabitants of the El Alto area of La Paz, and a line of credit for
craftsmen and small enterprises located in these parts of the capital.
After delays due to difficult political and economic circumstances, the
project wes successfully completed in 1986. It benefitted about 30,000
families and proved to be a sound way to approach complex urban problems.
The staff of an administrative unit, established within the Municipality of
La Paz in the context of the project, has been instrumental in preparing
the proposed project with the help of two advanc.es, totalling TTS$1.5
million, bv IDA's Project Preparation Facllity.
5.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to assist
the Municipality of La Paz in strengthening its institutional capacity to
discharge service, administrative and fiscal functions, while redressing
some critical shortcomings in the city's infrastructure. It would help
alleviate the impact of the current economic adjustment process on the
population of the capital, by providing temporary employment opportunities
througl public works needed to prevent furtber deterioration of municipal
services and to maintain basic urban Infrastructure in working order.
Other major obiectives are to restructure the organization of the
Municipality, improve financial and investment planning, raise current
revenues by updating the cadastre, carry out a program of civil works and
undertake an adequate maintenance program.
6.        Project Description.  The project, which would incorporate
certain components of the IMP, would consist of: municipal management
improvement, including (i) administrative reorganization, creation of
autonomous entities in charge of certain municipal activities,
computerization of accounts and purchase of office equipment; (ii) setting
up an efficient personnel management system and training program; (iii)
financial management improvement, budgetting and investment planning, and
management information and control; and (iv) modernization of the municipal
cadastre to increase tax revenue from urban property, through correct
assessment, appropriate tax rates, prompt billing and efficient collection;
urban transport improvement, including rehabilitation of hasic
infrastructure, construction of bus terminals, better traffic management,



and adeonate eouipment raintenance capaeitv; and urban development,
including (i) upgrading of urban infrastructure with community
participation in nineteen neighborhoods in marginal areas; (ii)
construction of flood and erosion control works along drainage basins,
construction of landslide prevention works, and build-up of capacity for
handling emergencies; (iii) setting up a decentralized solid waste
collection and disposal system, and street cleaning system, and repair and
maintenance of the necessary equipment; and (iv) implementation of a
community education program to support, and to participate in, municipal
actions.
7.        The cost of the proposed project is estimated at ITS521.3 million
ecuivalent.  The foreign exchange comnonent amounts to TS$6.3 million, or
30%. IDA would meet 70% of total cost, 52% of the foreign exchange cost
and 78% of the local cost. Parallel cofinancing by European Governments
would provide the balance of the foreign exchange cost and the Mutnicipalitv
of La Paz the remainder of the local cost.  The Municipality would be
responsible for the execution of the project. A prolect office within the
Planning Office of the Municipality wo-ld monitor and coordinate progress,
A Project Coordinator, acceptable to IDA, is at present the bead of the
Project Office, and several ranking managers and technicians (Project
Specialists), acceptable to TDA and required to carry oujt the project,
are, and will be, emploved by the municipality until its completion. A
twinning agreement, to he concluded shortlv with the Municipal Enterprise
for Urban Service- (E.E.V.V.) of Medellin, Colombia, will provide for
assistance in setting up a solid waste management svstem. The project is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1994. A breakdown of estimated
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule, are
given in Schedule B. A Timetable of key processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Bolivia are given in Schedules C and D. Maps
showing population distribution and principal cities, income and project
areas, and landslide risk locations are attachee. The staff appraisal
report, No. 6769-BO, dated July 8, 1987, is being distributed separately.
8.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The objectives of the proposed
project are consistent with the lending strategy of IDA and the public
investment policies of the Government. Thev are also closely related to
the objectives of the recently approved IDA credits for the Public
Financial Management Project (PFMP) and the Emergency Social Fnnd (FSF).
In fact, certain institutional reforms being undertaken within the
financial sector of Bolivia's economy under the PFMP, are similar to those
which would he initiated ky the Municipalitv of La Paz in the context of
the proposed project; while certain urban upgrading works of employment-
and-income-generating nature, to be carried out in La Paz by the ESF (with
provision for cost recovery), will he coordinated with civil works included
in the proposed project. In the urban sector specifically, the proposed
project is oriented toward3 consolidating ongoing efforts, aiming at
strengthening economic and social services; in view of the preeminence of
La Paz, its importance to the economv of the couintry, and its largp
population of urban poor, the improvement of municipal nmnagentent, services



- 4s -
and infrastructure is a first order priority within the framework of
Bolivia's recovery, Moreover, the civil works to be executed as physical
elements of the urban transport and urban development parts of the proposed
project should provide temporary employment for some inhabitants of La Paz
and thus help to defuse the opposition to the Government's economic
adjustment program, stemming from its social impact.
9.        Actions Agreed Upon.  In view of the significance for the
financial condition of the Bolivian municipalities of the Tax Leform Law of
1986, the Government has agreed to review annually with IDA, during the
execution of the proposed project, the revenue sharing provisions of the
Law and take, if so requested, measures to improve or accelerate revenue
shar-itg arrangements affecting the municipalities. Furthermore, the
Government has agreed to assist the Municipality ef La Paz, if necessary,
in carrying out the IMP, and to take all actions necessary to help meet the
cost recovery provisions agreed upon between IDA and the Municipality.
10.       The Municipality has agreed to:
(i) carry out the IMP in accordance with specified target dates and
annually review its progress with IDA;
(ii) implement a personnel policy, satisfactory to IDA, which -
irrespective of regular attrition - would further streamline the
municipal staff, thereby making possible better compensation and
higher efficiency;
(iii) replace the Project Coordinator only if IDA has raised no
objection to the qualifications and terms of employment of the
proposed replacement;
(iv) furnish to IDA by the end of 1987 and promptly put into effect a
program, which would, inter-alia, de^entralize selected municipal
services and create autonomous enterprises for performing them;
(v) undertake a program, satisfactory to IDA, to adequately maintain
municipdl infrastructure and equipment;
(vi) assume new debt only if this did not affect the agreed ratio of
municipal revenues to debt service of at least 2.8:1 in 1987 and
1988, and at least 3.3:1 beginning in 1989;
(vii) finance from self-generated funds not less than 28% of municipal
investment in 1988 and 1989, and not less than 35% in 1990 and
thereafter; and
(viii) ensure, through user charges, betterment levies and other
municipal revenues, the recovery of the full investment,
maintenance and operation costs of specified municipal
infrastructure and services.
Among the conditions for making the proposed credit effective are the
issuance by the Municipality of a procurement manual satisfactory to IDA
and the opening by the Municipality of a Project Account with an initial
deposit of at least US$125,000 equivalent.

11.       Justification.  A broad range of benefits would accrtue from the
project. It would help improve the efficiency of urban service deliverv
and of resource management, with a positive fiscal and flnancial ilroact on
the Municipality. It would alleviate the unemplovment conditions in the
capital by generating 30,000 man-vears equivalent of temporary jobs. About
50% of expenditure on the project would benefit the pooret segments of the
population. The transport comnonent would shorten by more than one hour
the current commuting time for 95,000 daily passengers between the largest
popular neiahborhood and the city center, and redtuce vehicle operating
costs. Better maintenance of infrastructure would have a positive impact
on the citY, particu'arly on the condition of the urban noor. About 60,000
people in marginal areas, where average income is helow the poverty
threshold, would directlv benefit from better water supplv and/or
sewerage. Project works for prevention and control of landslides would
redtce loss of life and damage to private and public property. Finally,
the project would serve as a model for other Bolivian cities. 'ne economic
rate of return of the project (weighted average TRR of all project
components) is 32%.
12.       Risks.  Given Bolivia's history, the main risk is pol-tical:
changes in Government and municipal adndnistration, strikes and social
disruptions may lead to delays in the achievement of project objectives or
even jeopardize them. This risk has been countered by simplifying the
design and limiting the size of the proposed Project, and by ensuring the
full commitment of the Municipality to its obiectives by way of
institutional reforms put into effect during project preparation. Another
risk involved is the shortage of counterpart funds; however, no Government
contribution would be required to carry out the project and, given the
fiscal and financial improvements achieved during project preparation, the
Municipality should he able to raise the funds needed for the project
th-ough stricter tax collection and more efficient use of resources.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
