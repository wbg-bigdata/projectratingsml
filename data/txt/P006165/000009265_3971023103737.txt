LA PAZ MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1842-BO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the La Paz Municipal
Development Project in Bolivia, for which an IDA Credit in the amount of SDR
11,700,000 was approved on August 7, 1987, and made effective on January 28, 1988.
2.    The credit was closed on December 31, 1996, eighteen months behind the original
schedule of 06/30/1995.  The final disbursement took place in December, 1996.
Cofinancing for the project, totaling about US$3.0 million, was provided by a grant, (the
Spanish Grant), from the Government of Spain in an amount equivalent to US$400,000; a
grant, (the French Grant), from the Government of France in an amount equivalent to
approximately US$600,000; a grant, (the Netherlands Grant), from the Government of the
Netherlands, in an amount equivalent to approximately US$600,000; and a grant, (the
GTZ grant), from the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) in an amount
equivalent to US$1,400,000.
3.    The ICR was prepared by John A. Stoddart (Consultant) under the supervision of
Oscar Alvarado (Task Manager, LA3EI) and reviewed by Eugene D. McCarthy (Division
Chief, LA3EI), and Robert Crown, Project Adviser, LA3DR.
4.    Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Association's completion mission
comprising Oscar Alvarado (LA3EI) and John A Stoddart (Consultant), who visited La
Paz, Bolivia from October 10 to 19, 1996. The ICR is based on material obtained during
the mission and contained in the project files.  The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by providing facts, figures and views reflected in the report. The
Borrower's contribution is included as Annex B to this ICR.

BOLIVIA
LA PAZ MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1842-BO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    La Paz is a city of more than 0.8 million, or about 12% of Bolivia's population.
Most of the country's commercial, financial and administrative activities, and a very large
proportion of the nation's health, education, and social activities, are concentrated there.
The city generates about half of Bolivia's internal fiscal revenues. During the last decade,
the number of inhabitants has roughly doubled in size, mainly because of immigration from
rural areas and the depressed mining centers. Although this growth is not unusual by
Latin American standards, it represents a challenge because of the city's unusually difficult
physical environment and its strained capacity to absorb more migrants in a productive
manner. In particular, lower income neighborhoods, comprising about half of the
population, are spread out over the unstable steep slopes of the La Paz valley, where lack
of erosion control and drainage results in destructive mud flows and landslides. In
addition, traffic congestion and deficient sanitation conditions represent serious
constraints to the efficient and harmonious development of the city.
Project Objectives
2.    The project was designed to assist the Municipality of La Paz in strengthening its
institutional capacity to discharge service, administrative and fiscal functions, while
addressing some critical shortcomings in the city's infrastructure. In addition, the project
was intended to help alleviate the impact of an ongoing structural adjustment process on
the population of La Paz, by providing temporary employment opportunities through
public works needed to prevent further deterioration of municipal services and maintain
basic urban infrastructure in working order. These objectives were addressed with four
project components which were to: restructure the organization of the Municipality;
improve financial and investment planning; raise current revenues through better tax
administration and update the cadastre; carry out a program of civil works; and develop a
more rational management of human resources.



- iii -
Project Implementation
3.    Credit 1842-BO was approved August 7, 1987, and became effective January 28,
1988. The original closing date was June 30, 1995, but was extended to October 31,
1996 due to delays experienced in carrying out the fiscal cadastre component of the
project. Total project cost is calculated at US$21,780,000 of which US$15,731,312 were
drawn from IDA funds. In addition, cofinancing in the form of grants, totaling US$3.0
million equivalent was obtained from the German Technical Cooperation Agency,
(US$1.4 million), the Government of France, (US$0.6 million), the Government of the
Netherlands, (US$0.6 million),and the Government of Spain, (US$0.4 million).
4.    Project implementation proceeded without major delays on physical works related
to improving urban transport, protecting urban areas from landslides and flooding, and
improving solid waste collection and disposal. Conversely, due to frequent changes in the
municipal and project administration, (5 different mayors and 11 different project
coordinators in the period 1988-1995), progress in the implementation of the institutional,
administrative, and financial management components was mixed and initially plagued by
delays. One major component, the fiscal cadastre, faced difficulties initially in contracting
the aerophotography. Under the Bolivian Constitution only the Armed Forces are allowed
to conduct cartographic services, and there would have been a conflict with the
Association's procurement procedures because of the resulting "sole sourcing". The
problem was solved when the Municipality financed the aerophotography themselves.
Project Results
5.    The project's objectives were well conceived and have been achieved despite
frequent changes in the municipal and project administration. The successfully completed
cadastre component is crucial to the assessment of property taxes on which there has been
a lot of evasion in the past. Once the data on the 45,000 units inventoried have been
collated and analyzed, and new assessments issued, (in 1997 for 1996 taxes), as presently
planned, revenue from property taxes will increase significantly. The improvement in
municipal and administrative organizational structure, the decentralization and creation of
autonomous enterprises for selected municipal activities, the computerization of records
and accounts, the improvement in responsiveness and service levels to the public and the
acquisition of data management and other modern office equipment, in addition to
contributing to better billing and collection procedures (with subsequent improvement in
revenue collections), also contributed significantly in the task of compiling the data base of
Municipal assets and allowed the subsequent inventory of Municipal properties to proceed
smoothly. As intended, the project provided temporary employment opportunities, which
were assesed to have reached more than 30,000 man-month. Prospects for project
sustainability are favorable, although they depend partially on the municipality carrying out
a proposed new phase of the institutional modernization program aimed at continuing and
consolidating reform and preparing the municipality to face the current challenges into the
new century.



- Iv -
6.    The urban transport component of the project has not solved the traffic problems
but has at least slowed the increase in traffic congestion in La Paz, and pedestrian safety
has been enhanced by the laying of new sidewalks, new curbs, new guardrails and the
building of 4 pedestrian bridges at the busiest intersections. A sub-project in the urban
transport component was the establishment of a maintenance system for municipal
equipment, including provision of maintenance facilities, equipment and spare parts. This
was successfully accomplished.
7.    Urban upgrading in the marginal areas was achieved despite the difficult terrain
and the constant influx of families from the countryside. Stairways were built up the steep
hillsides, potable water and sewerage facilities were laid, and markets were built.
8.    Most of the slopes surrounding the city of La Paz consist of extremely unstable
soil which, when saturated by the water carried by more than 200 rivers and streams that
cross the city, erodes and causes mud flows and landslides. Flood and erosion control
works along drainage basins, including landslide prevention measures and an early warning
system, were put in place.
9.    Solid waste management was another successful component. At the start of the
Project the situation was chaotic. Of the 340 tons a day of solid waste only 146 tons a day
were collected. Obsolete and broken down equipment, and lack of a landfill, contributed
to this situation. Today a landfill is available, as are modem garbage trucks, and of the 370
tons of solid waste produced daily, 330 tons, (90%), are collected, mostly by a private
company, which is supervised by the Municipality. Credit should also go to numerous
micro companies which collect 20 tons daily of garbage in hand carts from places
inaccessible to the large trucks.
Bank Performance
10.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory in identification, preparation, and
appraisal work, but in supervision it lacked continuity. After the Credit became effective
on 01/28/88, 7 Bank officers became involved in supervising the Project at one time or
another during project implementation, but none for more than 3 years. Admittedly, there
were a number of different disciplines involved: it appears that too many Bank staff were
assigned to this modest US$17 million project over a period of nine years.
Borrower Performance
11.   The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. However, during the
1992-1993 period, the management's lack of continuity and loss of interest almost brought
the project to a halt. The numerous changes in senior personnel both in the Municipality
and the Project Office, were detrimental at times and probably prolonged the Project past
the initial closing date. However, collaboration with the Bank group was satisfactory, and
an effective dialogue during supervision between Bank staff and Borrower contributed to
timely resolution of most problems.



v -
Assessment of Outcome
12.   The project outcome is rated satisfactory. The objective of strengthening the
institutional capacity of the Municipality of La Paz to discharge service, administrative and
financial and fiscal responsibilities while addressing shortcomings in the city's
infrastructure has been achieved. The growth of traffic congestion has been slowed,
garbage collection has been vastly improved, potable water and sewerage service are now
enjoyed by many of the city's poorer classes for the first time, and the flood control
measures put in place are expected to reduce the flooding and landslides during the rainy
season. The Municipality finances have also improved with good operating ratio (current
expenses/current revenues) which approached 60% in 1995, outperforming the estimated
63% in the SAR.
Future Operations
13.   Because of the wide variety of components, the sustainability and future operation
of project's accomplishments depend on the commitment and performance of various
municipal institutions, in charge of providing services upgraded by the project. Overall, the
prospects for sustainability are reasonably good. The municipal administration is currently
carrying out a follow-up modernization and structural reform program, which builds on
the results of the project and intends to address directly new challenges.
14.   The new project would contract-out/sell to private operators various municipal
functions such as the cadastre, the financial management and various services including the
water company, market places and bus terminals. The municipality would prepare itself for
its new role as regulator. If successful in these privatization efforts, assurance of proper
management and operation would be highly probable. For most of the project
components, the Municipality of La Paz and the Bank have agreed on an operations plan
and a set of monitoring indicators. It is proposed that the success indicators be checked in
two years.
Key Lessons
16.   The project provided several important lessons for municipal development project
operations in Bolivia and elsewhere:
* clear and quantifiable project objectives and goals, as well as separate cost
accounting, must be established from the beginning to allow proper project
implementation ex-post evaluation;
* technological changes intended to improve financial management system must
be designed in accordance with the existing culture, need managerial
commitment and political support, and should provide for continuous training;
* organizational reforms should also be accompanied by measures which address
corresponding reforms in the municipal civil service (personnel management,
internal processes etc.) in order to assure sustainability;



- vi -
* private sector participation should always be considered as an alternative to
managing most public functions within a municipality; and
* Effective design and management of a centralized Implementation Unit is a key
success factor in projects comprising activities related to numerous agencies.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
LA PAZ MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1842-BO)
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.    The World Bank became active in the urban sector of Bolivia's economy in the
mid-seventies. Its first loan for an Urban Development Project was made in 1977 (Loan
1489-BO). The loan helped finance urban upgrading works in low-income neighborhoods
of La Paz, the provision of sites and services to the inhabitants of the El Alto area of La
Paz, and a line of credit for craftsmen and small enterprises located in these parts of the
capital. The project was successfully completed in 1986. It benefited about 30,000
families and proved a sound way to approach complex urban problems.
2.    The National Government that took office in August 1985 inherited an economy
beset by rampant inflation, reduced revenues, a large public sector deficit, lack of
confidence both internally and abroad, a weak administration, and increasing urban
poverty. These problems had a particularly acute impact on the Municipality of La Paz.
In line with the Government's new economic policy, incorporating a national tax reform,
the Municipality gave priority to concerted measures, aimed at transforming the
autonomous local government into an equitable, efficient, and financially viable provider
of urban services. An Investment and Modernization Program (IMP) was worked out,
focusing on urban upgrading and landslide control, primarily in low income areas, on
better transport and sanitation conditions, streamlined municipal organization, modern
administration procedures, and sound financial management. The bloated municipal staff
was cut in order to free resources for raising salaries by about 20% in real terms. A
Municipal Training Institute (ICAM) was created in early 1987 to assist in strengthening
the various departments of the Municipality.  Steps were taken to secure technical
assistance from several European Governments in preventing floods and landslides,
reorganizing municipal departments and training personnel, improving planning and
accounting, and appropriately registering and assessing urban property.
B. Project Objectives
3.    The project was designed to assist the Municipality of La Paz in strengthening its
institutional capacity to discharge service, administrative and fiscal functions, while
redressing some critical shortcomings in the city's infrastructure. It was also intended to



2 -
provide temporary employment opportunities to help alleviate the effects of the economic
adjustment process at that time. Other major objectives were to restructure the
organization of the Municipality, improve financial and investment planning, raise current
revenues through better tax administration and updating the cadastre, carry out a program
of civil works, develop a more rational management of human resources and improve
training in the Municipality. Public transport was to be improved, as well as road
conditions.  Garbage collection was to be expanded and improved, and urban
improvements made to the poorer sectors of the city, with particular emphasis on landslide
control. Finally, a campaign was to be launched to acquaint the citizens of La Paz with
the steps being taken to improve their city.
C. Achievement of Project Objectives
4.    The project's objectives were well conceived and have been reasonably well
achieved despite frequent changes in the municipal and project administration. While
physical objective achievements were highly satisfactory, the ones related to institutional
strengthening were satisfactory to a lesser degree, with full benefits and sustainability
partially contingent on future municipality performance. Total project cost is calculated at
US$21,780,000 of which US$15,731,312 million were drawn from IDA funds. Parallel
cofinancing in the form of grants totaling US$3.0 million equivalent, was obtained from
German Technical Cooperation Agency, (US$1.4 million), the Govemment of France,
(US$0.6 million), the Government of the Netherlands (US$0.6 million), and the
Government of Spain (US$0.4 million). All of the above donations were provided in kind
(mainly consultants) and during the first three years of project implementation. Given
these facts, attempts to get donors' comments on the project were not successful. In all,
however, coordination with donors was satisfactory.
5.    The Project's objectives were not always quantified in the SAR --- in those cases,
the general achievement of objectives is noted in this report. Project implementation
proceeded without major delays on physical works related to improving urban transport,
protecting urban areas from landslides and flooding and improving solid waste collection
and disposal.  Conversely, due to frequent changes in the municipal and project
administration, (5 different mayors and 11 different project coordinators in the period
1988-1995), progress in the implementation of the institutional, administrative, and
financial management components was mixed and initially plagued by delays.
6.    An economic ex-post evaluation was carried out for all those project components
for which economic benefits could be quantified. This included five out of the seven
project components, which represent 87% of total investments. Economic benefits were
reasonably well quantified given the information available. The economic evaluation was
carried with conservative assumptions and we consider that this evaluation reasonably
indicates the grade of success of the project.
7.    The result of the economic evaluation systematically shows that the project was a
success. All indicators used, whether ERR, benefit/cost ratio or others, show significant
economic benefits, with calculated ERRs, ranging from 35% to over 80%, and a benefit-



- 3 -
cost ratio (in the case of the landslide control component) over 1.25. The specific
outcome for each component is presented in the ensuing paragraphs and commented in
more detail in Annex A.
8.    Municipal Management Component.    Much  of the  success  of  this
component of the project lies in the Municipality's adherence to the priority elements of
the Investment and Modernization Program (IMP), developed by the National
Government that took office in August 1985. The program focused on urban upgrading
and landslide control, primarily in low income areas, on better transport and sanitation
conditions, streamlined municipal organization, modern administrative procedures, and
sound financial management.
9.    The strengthening of financial management, under the direction of consultants, led
to the development of a computerized, administrative and financial information system
covering Budget, Treasury, Accounting, Procurement and Storage Inventories. The
implementation of a new accounting department structure resulted in improved cost
accounting, and a better management information system. Charges for municipal services
can now be processed more quickly and accurately; this is expected to lead to a
considerable increase in municipal revenues in the future. It should be noted, however,
that the municipality has faced implementation problems in transforming the 'bld" culture
into a new, disciplined financial management as required by the new financial system. This
fact, together with difficulties in keeping up with technology advances, has led the current
administration to decide to contract out most of their financial management functions.
10.   The Directorate for Community Action, which receives community requests, was
strengthened and now takes a more proactive role in community relations, through visiting
the communities, and promoting community participation in prioritizing their action
programs. Most of the funds for this component came from the Spanish grant.
11.   The recently completed fiscal cadastre---which basically consists of updating about
one fourth of the official register of the quantity, and value of real estate used in
apportioning taxes -- faced initial difficulties in contracting because the total cost of the
component had been underestimated and the cartographic portion faced procurement
problems. Under the Bolivian Constitution only the Armed Forces are allowed to conduct
aerial photographic services, and there would have been a conflict with the Association's
procurement procedures because of the resulting 'tole sourcing" with a governmental
institution. The problem was solved when the Municipality undertook to finance the
cartography themselves. This cadastre is crucial to the assessment of property taxes on
which there has been a lot of evasion in the past. The fiscal cadastre was finalized and
accepted in late November, 1996, after the 1995 property tax bills had been distributed.
When the new tax assessments are billed in 1997 (for 1996 taxes), given the new updated
property values, it is expected that revenue from property taxes will increase significantly.
12.   Training for Municipal employees has deservedly been a matter of concern to the
Mayor's office. For this reason, the Municipal Training Institute was established in 1987



- 4 -
and at the end of 1996, a total of 11,000 municipal employees had attended courses there.
Most of the funding for this component came from the French grant.
13.   Other important sub-projects under the Municipal Management component were:
(a)   a computerized compilation of all Municipal Orders and Resolutions
concerning Municipal properties, followed by an inventory of these
properties which had never previously been done;
(b)   a computerized compilation of all the steps necessary to comply with
Municipal decrees (Process Single Registry, - "RUT"). More than 100,000
procedures ('tramites') are dealt with each year and this centralized list
will help to speed up the processing.
14.   The municipal management component, closely linked to the municipal
bureaucratic structure was the most affected by political instability and on occasions lost
continuity. The strengthening of the financial management, and the cadaster components
have yet to yield results but will probably have a significant financial impact once the new
system is used as planned during 1997. For the economic evaluation, an assessment was
carried out based on time savings gained by improved administrative efficiency due to the
'Rut" of six key procedures. This assessment concluded that over US$1.6 million are
saved each year, clearly indicating a high return.
15.   Urban Transport Component.    The number of vehicles on the streets in the
area covered by the La Paz Municipality increased from 40,000 in 1976 to 103,000 in
1995, and is expected to rise to 120,000 vehicles by the year 2000. Given the difficult
topography of the city (located in a valley surrounded by steep slopes that fall off the
eastern edge of the Altiplano plateau), traffic congestion is a serious problem.
16.   The urban transport component of the project has not solved the traffic problems,
but has helped speed up the flow of traffic through the paving of more than 10 kilometers
of main avenues, and surface repairs to 270,000 square meters of streets. Much remains
to be done in a city where 65% of the streets are unpaved, but a start has been made and
the benefits are already being felt by the citizenry.
17.   Pedestrian safety has been considerably enhanced by the laying of almost 100,000
square meters of new sidewalks, 50,000 meters of new curbs, 6.5 kilometers of safety
barriers, and 4 pedestrian bridges were built over the busiest sections of the Hernando
Siles street, one of the main avenues of the city. A sign making workshop was built and
put into operation and almost 15 kilometers of traffic lanes were painted.
18.   A sub-project in the urban transport component was the establishment of a
maintenance service for municipal equipment, including provision of maintenance facilities,
equipment and spare parts. This was successfully accomplished. Much broken down
equipment was repaired and returned to service, including 55 heavy duty units, 44 garbage



trucks, 42 dump trucks and 10 general purpose vehicles. Three equipment storage depots,
and two warehouses were renovated so that municipal equipment is now spread around
the city and can be deployed more efficiently than in the past. It is envisaged that this
function would be privatized by the current administration.
19.   An economic evaluation for this component was carried out, with benefits
estimated as vehicle operation cost savings for the next fifteen years in seven selected
avenues. An ERR of 35% was obtained, indicating a high ratio from the transport
component.
D. Urban Development and Infrastructure Improvement Component
20.   Urban upgrading in about nineteen locations (with an average of 3,100
households) chosen with community participation was a major part of this component.
Among the infrastructure works were five potable water and sewerage systems, plus 3
markets and a communal dining room. Of particular importance were 4,000 meters of
stairways constructed in low income areas where the roads are very narrow and where
public transportation cannot circulate. Previously, the popula_e struggled up the steep
slopes, which were particularly hazardous in the wet winter months; now there are well
graded concrete steps to ease the journey from home to where the urban transport services
can be accessed.
21.   Construction of flood and erosion control works along drainage basins, including
landslide prevention works, were financed by the $1.4 million (equivalent) Grant from the
German Technical Cooperation Agency. The major works completed were: (a) the
channeling of 70 streams, (b) installation of 11 new storm drains, (c) the cleaning of 78
ravines and gorges, and (d) repairs to 30 retaining walls and drainage canals. Much of the
work has only recently been completed and it remains to be seen the effect on flood and
landslide control during the next rainy season. However, it is expected that the new works
will result in a reduction in flood damage compared to more recent years.
22.   Under the Project, IDA provided professional services, technical assistance for
staff training, and minor equipment and spare parts for the solid waste management
system. The heavy equipment, including garbage collection trucks and compactors, was
provided to the Municipal Garbage Collection company (EMA) through a Grant from the
Japanese Govemrnment totaling US$4.1 million. This Grant was conditioned on the
equipment being operated by a private contractor. EMA reached agreement with the
private company, STARCO, to handle waste management collection and disposal and the
operation is proving a success.
23.   At the start of the Project, garbage collection and dispcsal was in a chaotic state.
Of the 340 tons of solid waste produced daily, only 146 tons was collected. Obsolete and
broken down equipment, and the lack of a landfill contributed to this situation. Today a
landfill is available, as are modem garbage trucks, and of the 370 tons of solid waste now
produced daily, 330 tons, (90%), is collected, mostly by a private company, which is



- 6 -
supervised by the Municipality. Credit should also go to the numerous micro companies
which collect 20 tons of garbage daily, in hand carts, from places inaccessible to large
trucks, and which deliver it to central collection sites. A laboratory of bromatology' was
built and placed in operation, as was a municipal center of zoonosis2 as called for in the
SAR.
24.   In the economic evaluation for this subcomponent the increase in revenues was
used as the proxy for the economic benefits and resulted in an ERR close to 70% as
compared with 44% calculated during project analysis. Although this cannot be totally
attributable to the project, it should be noted that the project contribution was indeed
significant.
25.   The urban upgrading subcomponent was only partially carried out, as a chawlge in
priorities resulted in reallocating 60% of the original funds to the control of natural
hazards and transport components. In all, more than 80 subprojects were constructed.
Benefits from individual works seem significant, as was discussed with the city managers
and evident from a field visit. However, due to the high dispersion in the investments, no
calculation of the economic rate of return was made for this subcomponent.
26.   An economic evaluation was carried for the Control of Natural Hazards
subcomponent based on reclamation of land close to the rectified channels and reduction
in maintenance costs. The econornic analysis resulted in a satisfactory benefit/cost ratio of
about 1.5.
27.   A pilot community education program covering urban services, civic duties and
responsibilities and community participation, to support each major municipal action and
civil works program was successfully completed. Seventy education establishments, 325
teachers and 21,00 students were involved in the formal and non-formal education
programs which brought to the general public's attention what the Municipality was
attempting to achieve.
E. Major Factors Affecting the Project
28.   A high turnover of key personnel in the municipal administration, -- which was
almost always reflected in a turnover in the Project Implementation Unit (PFM) -- was a
factor in the Project being delayed 18 months beyond the original completion date. Up to
1985, the mayor of La Paz had been appointed by the central government. After 1985, the
mayor was elected by popular vote but for a period of only two years and with the
obligation to resign 6 months before the end of his/her term if intending to run for re-
election. Throughout 1988 there were three different Project Coordinators, and in 1992
no less than five. Even though the parties concerned met with the Association's approval
IBromatology: Laboratory for testing food and beverages
2Zoonosis: Center for controlling health risks associated with domestic animals



- 7 -
from a professional standpoint, -- this was clearly against the spirit of Section 2.09 (a) of
the Project Agreement which was intended to promote continuity in the project
management. The situation improved considerably with the passing of the Political
Reform Law in August 1994 which lengthened the mayoral period to 5 years, thus
allowing effective long range planning, which should lead to more efficient municipal
government, with less turn-over of personnel for political reasons. However, the Law also
stipulates that Mayors elected by less than 50% of the voting would be subjected to
confirmation by the city council one year after taking power. The mayor of La Paz elected
in 1996 with less than 50% of the vote, along with 55 other mayors elsewhere in Bolivia,
was then dismissed in January 1997 and a new one appointed for the next four years, who
will be subjected to the same confirmation process in January 1998.
F. Project Sustainability
29.   Prospects for project sustainability are reasonably favorable. As mentioned, there is
some uncertainty as sustainability of some subprojects is contingent and/or affected by the
proposed new modernization program described below. The same mayor was in office for
6 of the 9 years covered by this Project, and gave it full support in those years. The new
mayor of La Paz appointed in January 1997 has expressed her commitment to continue to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the municipality and has endorsed a new follow-up
project to consolidate and deepen reform. Under this new project, several additional
functions and municipal companies would be transferred to private sector management,
including areas improved under this project such as the cadastre and the financial
management. Other functions are to be decentralized in the Subalcaldias. Under this new
scheme, the municipality would have a new role as regulator rather than as implementation
of municipal investment. These privatization and decentralization processes should result
in enhancing project sustainability. The improvement in municipal and administrative
organizational structure, the computerization of records and accounts and the acquisition
of data management and other modern office equipment, the improvements in flood
control efforts and the commitment to ameliorating the urban transport problems augur
well for the sustainability of this project. One area of concern is the possible loss of
trained personnel.   The new  technologies introduced into the accounting and
administration departments of the Municipality have required the training of numerous
employees who may be tempted to move to the private sector where their newly acquired
skills are in demand, and where salaries and working conditions are generally much higher
than in the Municipality. To counter such a loss of skilled workers, municipal salaries and
conditions need to be made more competitive, but there are serious constraints to doing
so. Training should be an on-going affair to create a large enough cadre of experts so that
the eventual migration to the private sector becomes manageable.
G. Bank Performance
30.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory in identification, preparation, and
appraisal work, but in supervision it lacked continuity. After the Credit became effective
on 01/28/88, 7 Bank officers became involved in supervising the Project at one time or
another during project implementation, but none for more than 3 years. Admittedly, there



- 8 -
were a number of different disciplines involved: municipal finance and administration;
urban transport; landslide control; sanitation; and community education, but it appears that
too many Bank staff were assigned to this modest US$17 million project over a period of
nine years.
H. Borrower Performance
31.   The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory, and in the last three
years was actually better than satisfactory. However, during the 1992-1993 period, the
management's lack of continuity and loss of interest almost brought the project to a halt.
The numerous changes in senior personnel both in the Municipality and the Project Office,
were detrimental at times and probably prolonged the Project past the initial closing date.
However, collaboration with the Bank group was satisfactory, and an effective dialogue
during supervision between Bank staff and Borrower contributed to timely resolution of
most problems.
I. Assessment of Outcome
32.   The project outcome is rated satisfactory. The objective of strengthening the
institutional capacity of the Municipality of La Paz to discharge service, administrative and
financial and fiscal responsibilities while addressing shortcomings in the city's
infrastructure has been achieved. The growth of traffic congestion has been slowed, and
pedestrians in downtown La Paz are safer from traffic hazards than they were in the past.
Garbage collection has been vastly improved, and the streets in the low income areas are
much cleaner. Potable water and sewerage service are now enjoyed by many of the city's
poorer classes for the first time, and the flood control measures put in place are expected
to reduce the flooding and landslides during the rainy season. The Municipality now has a
record income which reached US$42 million in 1995 against expenditures of US$25
million, and for the first time revenues and expenditures are clearly identifiable. The city's
operating ratio (current expenses/current revenues) has had a positive declining trend and
approached 60% in 1995, outperforming the estimated 63% in the SAR. Much of the
increased income in the Municipality comes from revenue sharing introduced in recent
years, but the modern accounting system installed under the project is contributing to
more accurate and more timely invoicing by the Municipality. Once the fiscal cadastre has
been thoroughly analyzed and updated there should be even more income from new real
estate tax assessments.
J. Future Operations
33.    Because of the wide variety of components, the sustainability and future operation
of project's accomplishments depend on the commitment and performance of various
municipal institutions, in charge of providing services upgraded by the project. Overall,
and despite recent political changes and uncertainty at least in the short and medium term,
the prospects for sustainability are reasonably good. The municipal administration is
currently carrying out a follow-up modernization and structural reform program, which
builds on the results of the project and intends to address directly new challenges.



9-
34.   The new project would contract-out/sell to private operators various municipal
functions such as the cadastre, the financial management and various services including the
water company, market places and bus terminals. The municipality would prepare itself for
its new role as regulator. If successful in these privatization efforts, assurance of proper
management and operation would be highly probable.
35.   For most of the project components, the Municipality of La Paz and the Bank have
agreed on an operations plan and a set of monitoring indicators, as shown in Table 11.
This plan depends partially on the ongoing modernization program and so the compliance
with the proposed indicators will depend on the performance of the plan. However, overall
sustainability will also depend on two key factors (i) the carrying out of a civil service
program to upgrade human resources and (ii) the financial consolidation of the
municipality. It is proposed that the success indicators be checked in two years.
K. Key Lessons
36.   The Project provided several important lessons for municipal development project
operations in Bolivia and elsewhere:
v  Technological changes must take into account the existing cultural environment. The
introduction of the new Integrated Financial Management System, which had almost
no design problems, has suffered from start-up and implementation problems. The
system entailed radical procedural adjustments, and so informal and manual processes
were forced into systematized and orderly procedures. Lack of complete commitment
at the managerial level as well as insufficient training, led to a lengthy implementation,
period, to an initial rejection by both managers and officials, and to an under-use of the
system's potential. While the system is now finally and successfully in use, the city
administration has decided to contract-out with a private operator the financial
management (the scope of which is still to be defined), as they feel unable to update
the system to keep-up with technological changes. Attention should thus be given to
intensive and permanent training, and to a better understanding from the beginning of
the operational implications of such projects.
*  Structural reforms should include civil service Reform.  Structural reforms, such as
those introduced in La Paz, are usually difficult to introduce and easy to disrupt,
especially when there is high personnel turnover. When such reforms are linked to civil
service reform they have a better anchor and sustainability is more likely to be
achieved. Lack of effective civil service reform measures (for example, lack of clear
definition of new positions and corresponding functions, responsible for the financial
management systems) to consolidate such changes has diminished the project
effectiveness. A new civil service reform is now crucial for the municipality.
* Private sector as alternative to public management Privatization of municipal functions
should be considered as an alternative to improving most municipal functions. If



- 10-
functions remain public, efficiency gains remain vulnerable and subject to political
changes. Technological changes are harder to implement (see above) and entail a high
risk of becoming obsolete.
* Effective Use of Implementation Unit. While certain valid arguments are normally
raised against having separate implementation units (they create parallel structures
with different salary scales, undermine ownership, and run the risk of leaving nothing
when the project finishes), the model used in this case proved very effective and could
be replicated in similar cases. With a plethora of subprojects involving most municipal
offices and institutions, an autonomous implementation unit (PFM) was clearly
necessary. Given its effective communication with the city Mayors and its good
coordination with beneficiary offices, the PFM was a key player and greatly
contributed to project's satisfactory outcome. Key elements in its success were: (i)
staff kept to a minimum and partially paid by the city, (ii) staff continuity and
leadership at the technical level at the beginning and during the last three years; (iii)
total commitment from the mayor acting as coordinator; and (iv) relatively
autonomous and quick in taking decisions (relations with Bank, procurement).
E Establish clear and quantifiable project objectives and goals. Attention should be
devoted to defining clear and quantifiable objectives from the beginning of project
preparation. As mentioned, the ex-post economic evaluation for this project could
have been more accurate and meaningful with clearer and more quantifiable objectives
at the outset.

Appendix A
Economic Evaluation
1.    An economic ex-post evaluation was carried  out for all those project
subcomponents for which economic benefits could be quantified. This included four
(Municipal Management, Urban Transport components, Solid waste, and control of
Natural Hazards subcomponents) out of the five project components, which together
represent 87% of total investments. The evaluation was conducted by a consultant under
the supervision of the Bank. The methodology used included the reconstruction of the ex-
ante analysis, ex-post evaluation and comparison of the ex-ante and ex-post situations.
Economic benefits, including a measurement of economic return, were reasonably well
quantified given the information that was available.
2.    The main difficulties found in the evaluation included (i) a lack of clear quantifiable
targets and indicators with which compafisons were to be made, (ii) difficulties in
compiling information due to apparent loss of institutional memory, and (iii) convergence
of other investments outside of the project which rendered it difficult to isolate project
impacts from impacts caused by other factors (i.e. construction of other roads close to the
ones financed by the project). However, given the overall conservative nature of the
evaluation, we consider that it reasonably indicates the degree of success of the project.
3.    The result of the economic evaluation systematically shows that the project was a
success, and thus support the satisfactory rating that was assigned to it. All indicators
used, whether ERR, benefitlcost ratio or others, show significant economic benefits. The
subcomponents for which an economic indicator was not calculated (urban upgrading,
education, financial management, cadaster and training subcomponents) were all assessed
to have made important contributions. Even when their cost is added to other related
subcomponents, the economic return is positive. Results of the evaluated components are
presented in the table below and analyzed in the following paragraphs:

4.    Urban Management. For the economic evaluation, an assessment was carried out
based on time savings gained by improved administrative efficiency due to the new
Process Single Registry used in six key municipal procedures. Time needed to process
these procedures dropped dramatically from 1988 to 1996 (e.g. payment of property taxes
decreased from 24 hr. to .5 hr., vehicle registration from 24 hr. to 1 hour). This
assessment concluded that over US $1.66 million was saved each year, indicating clearly a
very high return, when compared with a financial cost of US$ 1.6 million. Productivity
was also raised as evidenced by the number of processes per municipal staff, which
increased from 24 in 1990 to 43 in 1996. No evaluation was made for the financial
management and cadastre component (financial investment of $3.0 million), as they were
recently concluded and their contribution have not yet completely materialized. The
benefits from the cadastre component are expected to materialize during 1997, when the
first billing with the new system will take place.
5.    Urban Transport. An economic evaluation for this component was carried out,
with benefits estimated in terms of cost savings from vehicle operation. It comprised
vehicle counts (classified per type of vehicles) and operation cost savings projections in
seven selected avenues for the next 15 years. Various factors, such as excessive increase in
individual public transport vehicles, and the construction of important projects such as the
Avenida Costanera, affected this outcome and its relation to the initial economnic
calculations. The estimated ERR is 3 5%. Given that other benefits, such as time savings,
are not included, this ERR indicates a high return from the transport component.
6.    Solid Waste. The increase in revenues was used as the proxy for the economic
benefits for the solid waste improvement subcomponent and resulted in an ERR close to
70%. This cannot be totally attributable to the project, as other investments, such as the
purchase of new trucks, financed under a Japanese grant, had an impact over time.
However, it should be noted that the project contribution was indeed significant as it laid
the groundwork for achieving the solid waste benefits.
7.    The Urban Upgrading subcomponent was only partially carried out, as a change
in priorities resulted in reallocating 60% of its original funds to the Control of Natural
Hazards subcomponent and the transport component. In all, more than 80 subprojects
were constructed. Benefits from individual works seem significant, as was revealed in
discussions with the city managers and evidenced from a field visit. However, due to the
high dispersion in the investments, no calculation of the economic rate of return was
carried out for this subcomponent.
8.    Control of Natural Hazards An economnic evaluation was carried for the Control
of Natural Hazards subcomponent (stabilization of three rivers). Benefits were based on
cost of land recuperation, prevention of previous annual losses due to emergency disasters
and reduction in maintenance costs. Other benefits, such as increase in land value were not
measured as they would be partially explained by the ones already mentioned. The
economic analysis resulted in a satisfactory benefit/cost ratio of about 1.5.



- 23 -
9.    As was the case during project appraisal, no attempt was made to measure
economic benefits drawn from the Education subcomponent. However, including its cost
within the Control of Natural Hazards subcomponent, the one it was most related to, the
overall benefit/cost ratio for such subcomponent diminishes to a still positive benefit/cost
ratio of 1.25.

L     THE SETTING
The districts that currently surround the city began to spring up after 1920, when the
indigenous inhabitants were moved out to the mountainsides to make way for a more
cosmopolitan city in the center. In the 1930s, the city started to expand around the
downtown area. This brought with it the opening of main roads leading out to the new
districts and also facilitating communication with the communities on the mountainsides.
During the 1950s there was considerable immigration into the city from the Altiplano
(fHigh Plateau) region. These immigrants brought in a cultural tradition that was highly
positive for the city's development, namely a strong sense of community focused on what
needed to be done to improve their lot. However, the outcome of these large-scale
movements into the city was the establishment of unplanned and substandard settlements
lacking the necessary services and amenities.
In the course of the 1960s some residential neighborhoods became densely populated as a
result of the construction of multifamily buildings. This caused the better-off population
to move into the city's Southern Zone, displacing the low-income people living in that
zone to its outskirts. In this way, the East, West and North mountainside areas, which
were considered forest reserves, became increasingly used for residential purposes without
any sort of control. At the same time, some working-class neighborhoods were developed
and consolidated. This entire settlement process took place without any planning and
created two main problems: the people living in the areas concerned had no security of
tenure and the neighborhoods lacked drinking water and sewerage services.
The population growth is reflected in the findings of the last three censuses conducted in
the country, the figures being as follows (including the city of El Alto, then considered
part of La Paz): 1950 Census - 321,073 inhabitants, 1976 Census - 540,298 inhabitants.
During the period 1976-92 La Paz grew at the very low rate of 1.78%, while El Alto
posted a very high growth rate of 9.23%.
This is explained by the continual migration from the Altiplano into the plain where El
Alto is located, coupled with the very limited availability of usable land in La Paz.
According to the 1992 Population and Housing Census, the population of La Paz was
713,378 and that of El Alto 405,000.
To the above circumstances must be added the problems inherent in the municipality. The
history of the successive municipal governments from the beginning of the 1950s to 1985
was marked -- with a few exceptions -- by inefficiency and a lack of organization, and in
some cases corruption, which brought the city to the brink of ruin. Faced with this
distinctly disturbing situation, Mayor Ronald MacLean Abaroa, during his first term of
office, assembled a team of professionals and designed the Municipal Strengthening
Project, which was then set in motion as an instrument for restoring the city's
administration in all the areas for which the Municipality is responsible, as a generator of



- 28 -
strategic projects that will enable the resolving, in the short and medium term, of the city's
urban infrastructure problems and the natural hazards which pose a threat to it.
II.   BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT
In June 1986, the Government of Bolivia and the Municipality of La Paz [Honorable
Alcaldia Municipal de La Paz (HAM)], meeting at the World Bank headquarters in
Washington, D.C., negotiated Credit Agreement 1842-BO, the amount of which was SDR
11,700,000 (approximately US$15 million), with the HAM being responsible for providing
US$3.3 million in counterpart funds. The term of the credit was set at 35 years, including
ten grace years.
Preparation of the terms of reference was started in July of that same year. Then in
November the technical team was formed to make the designs for all the components of
the Municipal Strengthening Project (MSP). This process continued till February 1987
and was financed by World Bank funds totaling US$1,308,441.57.
The final studies covered all activities that were the HAM's responsibility and were the
outcome of an in-depth diagnosis of the background and the problems involved. The
project objectives were also formulated and viable solutions capable of immediate
implementation were proposed for each area of work.
On August 7, 1987, Credit Agreement 1842-BO was signed and implementation of the
project was started. In the same year, the governments of Germany, France, the
Netherlands and Spain committed additional resources for the hiring of experts to
contribute their skills and experience to the different components of the project.
The project closing date was initially set at June 30, 1995. This date was subsequently
extended to June 30, 1996 and then again to December 31, 1996.

projects.
IV.   IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIENCE
In accordance with Annex 2 to Credit Agreement 1842-BO signed with the World Bank,
and in order to work efficiently toward the objectives outlined, the project divided its
activities into the following components: Improvement of Municipal Management, Urban
Transportation and Urban Development and Infrastructure Improvement.
A. COMPONENT: IMPROVEMENT OF MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT
As a result of the economic crisis then wracking the country and the succession of inept
municipal governments, in September 1985, at the start of a new administration, the
Municipality itself was in a state of profound crisis. Debts were mounting and revenue
collections were dropping continuously, to the extent that there were not even enough
finds on hand to pay the personnel. The HAM was constantly having to resort to the
Central Bank to cover its deficits. However, these were not the only problems.
Corruption was entrenched and lack of organization and inadequate administrative control
were pervasive.
To correct this extremely serious situation, a rigorous austerity policy was introduced;
spending was slashed and open war was declared on corruption. The results were
positive, because unlike the pattem in previous years, in 1986 all expenditures were
covered by the HAM's own revenues and in 1987 actual revenues were 12.5 times higher
than prior to 1985.
The administrative and financial recovery marked the start of the recovery of the
Municipality as a whole, an outcome to which the project contributed significantly.
For this Municipal Management Improvement Program, the schedule of activities of the
La Paz Investment and Modernization Program was drawn up and followed, in
accordance with Section 2.12 of the agreement on project 1842-BO.
1.  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
Annex 2 to Credit Agreement 1842-BO specifies that the tasks of this program are to
implement computerized accounting systems designed to improve budgetary, financial
and investment planning, together with administrative information and control systems,
including establishment of cost and revenue centers for the services and direct charging of
users.



- 30 -
Subproject: Strengthening of Financial Administration
Administrative and financial information systems were developed, including computerized
budget, cash accounting, procurement and stores systems. A new organization structure
was also implemented for the financial area that enables development of the costs and
management information system. A single central computer system is used with a single
database that functions by means of three modules: Budget, Accounting and Cash. The
system was implemented by means of a specialized consultancy contract with Messrs.
Coopers and Lybrand. Due to the modernization work undertaken in the course of the
current year, the entire system has been modified to adapt it to the new requirements.
2.    MUNICIPAL CADASTER
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement specifies that the objective in this case is improvement
of application of the municipal cadaster (land and property register) in order to increase
revenue from property taxes and refine the planning of the development and management
of urban services, including updating and upgrading of the urban property register,
modification of the assessment procedures, adjustment of the tax rates and improvement
of the billing and collection system.
Subproject: Computerized Urban Tax Cadaster
The gross urban area of the city of La Paz is approximately 7,000 ha and the built-up area
is 4,655 ha. The number of properties is estimated at 178,300 and the total value of the
buildings is put at some US$6.7 billion.
This subproject was designed in 1991 to ensure proper management of the La Paz
cadaster. Implementation, by mean of a specialized study made by the consulting
consortium KLM AEROCARTO/EUROCONSULT,ILIS/RAET, was started in May
1994 covering a pilot area of 30,000 properties, subsequently increased to 45,000. The
high reliability of the information provided by this subproject makes it possible to achieve
the programmed collection goals. In the context of the modernization of the municipality,
the complementation, updating and administration of the system will have to be
coordinated with the private sector, under the best conditions obtainable in the interests of
the city. This process has already been begun and will be concluded in the course of the
next few months.
Subproject: Digital Cartography
The Digital Cartography work will complement the Computerized Urban Tax Cadaster
and will enable horizontal and vertical checking on the ground, aerotriangulation and
adjustment of blocks. Execution of this subproject will serve to consolidate the Integral
Masterplan for the Multipurpose Cadaster by ensuring that georeferenced cadastral
information will be available and offering greater possibilities for its multiple application in



- 31 -
land-use planning and administration. The contract for this work was awarded to the
German consulting firm HANSA LUFTBILD.
3.  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND TRAINING PROGRAM
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement specifies the tasks of this program as implementation of
a new and strengthened system for personnel management and development of an internal
training capability.
Subproject: Improvement of the Organic and Administrative Structure of the
Municipality
The designing of an organic structure made it possible to adjust certain units and to
implement a more rational administrative set-up. At the same time, the Manual of
Functions, the Manual of Workstations and the Chart of Positions and Remunerations
were prepared.
Studies were made focusing on deconcentration of technical services, service to the public,
installation of four Zone Submunicipalities (a product of the administrative
deconcentration), and conversion of certain basic services into municipal enterprises. In
addition, instructions were issued concerning administrative procedures for execution of
projects and the effecting of investments and expenditures.
Subproject: Training
The Institituto de Capacitaci6n Municipal [Municipal Training Institute] (ICAM) was
established in February 1987. The project designed a program to strengthen it, by
financing equipment and different courses aimed at upgrading the knowledge and expertise
of the municipality's professional and other personnel. Training is also provided for small-
scale entrepreneurs and craftsmen to foster the establishment of productive
microenterprises and service businesses.
With the implementation of the legislation on grassroots participation and administrative
decentralization the ICAM played an important role in the training of other municipalities
and citizens in learning about and applying the new laws.
In its nine years of operation the institute has developed and carried out basic, advanced
and refresher programs for municipal employees of varying skill levels. By the end of this
year, about 11,000 persons will have benefited from its courses.
4.    ADMINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION PROGRAM
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement details the purposes of this program as improvement of
the municipal and administrative structure; decentralization of certain municipal activities
and creation of autonomous enterprises to perform same; computerization of registers and



- 32 -
accounts; improvement of effective reaction to the needs of the public and of the levels of
service provided, and procurement and use of data-management and office equipment.
Subproject: Transcription and Codifying of Municipal Ordinances and
Resolutions
Before this subproject was initiated in 1987 the municipal property records were in a state
of total chaos. Computer systems were used to compile the data from the municipal
ordinances and resolutions, as a first step toward organizing these important municipal
instruments.
Subproject: Inventory of Municipal Property
This inventory made it possible to ascertain the quantity, location and value of the real
estate owned by the Municipality, including land and properties. These have now been
correctly identified, recorded and verified with the Real Property Department. Registers
have also been drawn up of the value of furnishings, fittings, heavy equipment and light
equipment items.
On the basis of this information the Municipality's Land Bank was set up.
As a result of these measures, the management of the property of the citizens of La Paz is
now more efficient and transparent.
Subproject: Single Register of Procedures (SRP)
By means of computerized coding, as of 1987 there has been an organized classification of
procedures through which the public and public employees can be informed of the routing,
process and handling of all procedures. Using this system, about 110,000 external
procedures and 30,000 internal ones are processed per year. The total number of process
steps is 800,000 per year. The flow of procedures is increasing by 5% per year. The main
instruments used by the SRP include the Manual Paceflo (Citizen's Manual), which is
updated periodically and details the requirements, the purpose and the time required for
each procedure. The SRP as a whole is highly dynamic and constantly needs
systematizing and refinement.
B.  COMPONENT: URBAN TRANSPORTATION
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement lists the following areas of work for Urban
Transportation: Rehabilitation of the main roads; improvement of the system of streets
and traffic lights; preparation and implementation of traffic and parking systems;
construction of bus terminals; and establishment of a maintenance system for municipal
equipment, including supply of facilities, equipment and parts.



- 33 -
Due to the expansion of its population in recent decades, the number of vehicles in
the city has grown tremendously. As a result, the streets ane. avenues in the downtown
area are badly congested. To this must be added the current bad state of many of the
city's main thoroughfares. These factors combine to create countless problems that
complicate life for those who live and work in La Paz.
In 1976 the city's vehicle population numbered 40,000 units, but by 1995 this total
had grown to 103,000 and if the present rate of growth continues it is expected to reach
120,000 by the year V00. At this time the average is one vehicle for every seven
inhabitants whereas in 1976 it was one for every fifteen inhabitants, i.e., the number of
vehicles per inhabitant has doubled in the space of twenty years.
For this area, the schedule of activities of the La Paz Investment and
Modernization Program was drawn up and carried out in accordance with section 2.13 of
the Credit Agreement.
Subproject: Road Improvement
An ambitious road improvement program was launched in 1987 which included
various infrastructure works: asphalting, block-paving, walkway construction, bridges,
grade-separated intersections and road marking and signing.
However, despite the considerable amount of progress achieved in all
neighborhoods of the city there is still much to be done, because the types of roads are not
the most suitable, those with earth roadbeds amounting to 809.9 km and representing
65.1% of the total.
Main Works
* 250,520 m2 of improvements in streets and avenues: asphalting, block-paving,
surfacing with tiles and stone materials.
* 97,100 m2 of sidewalk restoration

i Pedestrian walkway in Plaza Perez Velasco
* El Alto and La Florida transportation terminals
i Blue Zone Parking: a Blue Zone system was designedfor the center. This consists
basically in delimitation of areas in which parking will be controlled, enabling
constant rotation.
Subproject: Municipal Equipment Rehabilitation
In 1985 the municipal equipment for various types of works was in very poor
shape. Execution of a maintenance plan and provision of parts made it possible to
rehabilitate this equipment, thereby increasing its availability. The facilities of three shops
and two stores were also improved.
Equipment rehabilitated
55 units of heavy equipment
44 trash trucks
42 dump trucks
10 miscellaneous trucks

C.  URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT
The execution of this component has included measures to enable provision of
services, ensure the safety of human settlements, promote the health and welfare of
citizens and foster awareness of urban problems among the population.
Although this component covered all areas of the city special attention in termns of
efforts and resources was paid to the low-income districts. The component consisted of
four subprojects, carried out in accordance with the scheduling set up by the La Paz
Investment and Modernization Program pursuant to section 2.13 of the Credit Agreement.
Subproject: Urban Improvement
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement details the Urban Improvement work to be done
as provision of basic infrastructure, with inclusion of drainage and pedestrian walkways, in
approximately 19 selected neighborhoods, with community participation.
There is a considerable need for infrastructure on the mountainside settlements and
in the outlying communities, which is aggravated by the poor soil quality and the constant
increase in population.
The works were carried out in conjunction with neighborhood groups organized
with a view to achieving the best results. Special mention should be made of the
installation of drinking water and sewerage systems in outlying commnunities, construction
of markets and construction of steps.
Main works
*  Installation of drinking water and sewerage systems
Zones served: Villa Nueva Potosi Alto Mariscal Santa Cruz, Alto San Antonio,
Pampahasi and Rio Minasa. In addition, roads were paved with curbed sidewalks
and urban roadways improved
*  Construction of markets
San Jose Market in Munaypata, low-cost restaurant in Alto Obrajes, Rio Seco Market
shopping area, Alto San Antonio Market.
*  Steps
3,950 m in 42flights of steps, the main ones being Alto Segfncoma, Av. Vea Mugca
- Av. del Maestro, Francisco Bolognesi Street, 6th Street in Villa San Antonio.
Subproject: Control of Natural Hazards
Annex 2 specifies the following for Landslide Control, subsequently designated
Subproject for Hazard Control: Construction of flood and erosion control works along



- 36 -
watersheds, with inclusion of landslide prevention measures; establishment of rules and
procedures for land use in order to prevent unplanned settlements, and setting up of a
quick alert system and procedures for emergency assistance in the event of floods and
landslides.
The natural conditions prevailing in the location of the city of La Paz are very
complex and necessitate specialized soil-stabilization works because of the many steep
slopes. Much of the land is unstable and unsuitable for construction. The area where the
city stands is made up of light erodible soils of variable texture. There are also countless
underground streams fed by saturation of various geological formations by rainwater or
surface runoff. There are in fact about 200 rivers of differing sizes within the city's
boundaries. To all of these natural factors there must then be added the impact of the
uncontrolled urban growth of the capital in recent years.
Landslides, cave-ins and floods are the natural disaster most likely to occur,
especially in the marginal areas. Special high-cost works are needed to provide proper
protection against these risks.
When the works were started in 1987 a full and detailed study on hazard control
was prepared for the project. This study found that a large part of the existing works,
such as masonry walls and gabions, were in bad condition, since regular upkeep and
associated measures had been neglected, causing considerable economic losses to the
community. In addition, clandestine home building in formerly wooded areas had
heightened vulnerability to erosion and slides.
Control of Hazards and Emergencies
Works
River channeling:                70; 10,100 m of works
Filtration galleries.            11
Construction of gabion walls: 52; 60,500 m3 built
Works in the ravines:           78
Wall and channel repairs:       30
Associated works
* Repairs in the rivers, walls over which water can spill, ditches and gutters, dike
construction, walls in ravines, river ckaring, spur dikes, covering-over of
watercourses, filtration gallery maintenance and reinforced earth walls.



- 37 -
Subproject: Urban Sanitation
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement lists the responsibilities of the Solid-Waste or
Urban Sanitation Administration as preparation and implementation of a system of refuse
collection and disposal and a street-cleaning system; establishment of a foodstuffs and
public health laboratory; decentralization of the Solid-Waste and Sanitation
Administration; and repair and maintenance of the refuise collection and compacting
vehicles, including supply of parts for same.
Before the activities of this subproject were started, the urban sanitation situation
in the city was chaotic. Of the approximately 340 tons of solid waste generated in 1986,
less than half (146 tons) was collected. This was due to the fact that there was no
appropriate organization for the work, neither was there a sanitary landfill, while
collection equipment was either obsolete or nonexistent and trash was just dumped
anywhere.
Refuse collection
1993: 104,463 tons/year
1994: 104,745 tons/year
1995: 108,074 tons/year
The launching of this subproject made it possible to start introducing real and
effective solutions. New collection programs were set up with optimum schedules,
frequencies and routes. Major improvements were the establishment of the solid-waste
transfer station and of the new sanitary landfill at Mallasa for final disposal of the trash
collected.
All these measures have resulted in a gradual increase in solid-waste collection.
Currently, of the 370 tons generated per day, 330 tons is being collected, i.e. 90% of the
total.
The initiatives aimed at formation of collection microenterprises must not be
overlooked either. Since they first started operations in 1991 these enterprises have been
doing a commendable job, collecting 20 tons a day in the mountainside communities
where the regular trash trucks cannot go.
Since 1992 the Municipal Refuse Collection Enterprise (EMA) has been
supervising the work of the private company STARCO, which was awarded the contract
for refuse collection. The EMA is presently handling the cleaning of the city streets and
maintenance and operation of the transfer station and of the Mallasa landfill.



- 38 -
Another priority environmental problem is connected with the misuse of the rivers
for dumping trash and liquid waste, which causes pollution of both the air and the land.
Although this situation has been improved with the covering-over of various rivers that
flow through the city, control measures will have to be applied. The equipment and
facilities of the foodstuffs and public health laboratory have been improved with a view to
enabling measurement of pollution levels. As its name implies, the laboratory is also used
for checking the quality of the foodstuffs and beverages consumed by the population. In
addition, the Zoonosis Center was remodeled to permit proper surveillance of the health
status of domestic animals.
Main works
* Sanitary and environmental recovery of the Old Sopacachi dump.
* Establishment of the Mallasa sanitary landfill.
* Solid-waste transfer station.
* Procurement of manual trash collection carts.
* Procurement of trash containers.
- Construction of the food and public health laboratory.
- Startup of the Zoonosis Center.
Subproject: Urban Education
Annex 2 to the Credit Agreement refers to establishment and implementation of a
pilot urban education program covering urban services, civic obligations and duties and
community participation, including radio campaigns, and an experimental course on
community education to be given in five pilot elementary schools.
Citizens need to be familiar with city government policies, what the municipality
does and the urban problems it has to cope with. To this end and with a view to fostering
joint efforts and two-way communication in the interest of both parties, an Urban
Education subproject consisting of the following three components was designed and
carried out:
Formal Education and Promotion of Cultural Action
This experimental program, which was run for three years starting in 1987, was
carried out in 20 schools with participation by 125 teachers and 7,280 students.
Instruction was given, at curriculum subject level, on the different areas in which the HAM
works, such as transportation and roads, urban sanitation and hazard control. A set of
instructional materials was printed for the purpose.



- 39 -
Nonformal Education
13,500 students and 200 teachers from 50 schools participated in the "Open
Classroomre, "Knowing Our City" and "Mobile Museum" programs, and two exhibitions
on municipal topics were also held.
Mass Media
The "We Are All La Paz" campaign was conducted in 1987, which used
educational messages to raise awareness concerning urban problems and the services
involved. These messages were aired intensively on radio and television.
Another important activity was the making of a series of video documentaries on
community topics for informational and educational purposes. These documentaries were
made available for use on television. Special emphasis was also placed on printing and
publishing various publications containing material promoting the HAM.
D.    TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Thanks to the participation of international and national experts, the tasks
undertaken by the project were accomplished with excellence. The work done by the
external consultants was a significant contribution, especially in the urban and financial
management component. The outcome of this work is in general evident in a better
organization of the municipality. The consultants also participated in various tasks
assigned directly by the mayor and other executives, in technical missions with
international agencies, in the preparation of various documents, in various seminars and
meetings, and in the monitoring of programs and different coordination activities.
The study and preparation of important urban development, traffic and road, and
sanitation and urban infrastructure projects produced a bank of projects that enabled the
HAM to qualify for and obtain financing from other agencies, such as the National
Regional Development Fund (FNDR), the Social Investment Fund (SIF), the Japanese
Government Cooperation Agency, etc. The project's support for this project management
activity was significant throughout its execution.
The technical assistance initially financed with resources from Credit 1 842-BO was
continued with the HAM's effort to engage suitable professionals and permanent advisory
services for the different municipal units, so as to ensure appropriate continuity and
follow-up of the projects undertaken.



- 40 -
E.    OTHER IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES
Projects prepared by the MSP and executed with financing from the former
Emergency Social Fund
Between the years 1987 and 1991 this source provided the Municipality with
US$2,700,000 on the basis of projects prepared by the MSP and in grant form. The funds
were allocated by priority to the hazard control area, for works carried out in the outlying
areas.
Health Project
As a result of the decentralization of health services in the country, in 1990 the
HAM assumed responsibility for the health services in District VIII on the western side of
the city, with a population of 110,000.
These services focus primarily on mothers and children, consisting of primary care
in gynecology, pediatrics, dentistry and general medicine. There are also laboratory
services, nursing units and social services.
This program was financed by the World Bank through the pertinent state
authority.
The MSP prepared the projects and was responsible for the two Area Health
Centers and eleven Sector Integral Centers.
Center Improvement Program (PROCENTRO)
The La Paz Municipal Government assigned the execution of the PROCENTRO
project to the MSP and the Support Project for Urban and Municipal Development
(PADUNI). PROCENTRO's objectives were to rehabilitate the downtown area as a
whole, revitalizing it as a live and active center for the city, and to work among the
different sectors of the population to attract investment to revive the center.
District centers
Preparation of the respective projects and oversight and supervision of the District
Centers in the north, east and west zones of the city.
Maflasa Zoo
Design of the complete project.



- 41 -
Cable Railway
Preparation of the project and of the bidding documents.
V.  FACTORS THAT IMPEDED BETTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
PROJECT
Up till 1985 the mayor of the city was appointed directly by the Central
Government. With the introduction of the municipal democratic system in accordance
with the Organic Law on Municipalities, the mayor began to be elected every two years by
direct ballot. These short terms of office had the effect of weakening the planning of
works and projects. They were also obstacles to proper performance of the
responsibilities the law assigned to the Municipality such as the planning and
implementation of all technical, administrative, legal, economic, financial, cultural and
social actions and activities for the city. This situation caused uncertainty among
municipal executives because of the short span of time available to them.
All of these factors influenced the relationship between the municipal leadership
and the project. However, due to its solid foundations, clear objectives and adequate
financing the project was able to move ahead and achieve completion with institutional
stability.
The situation has now changed in that the Law Reforming the Political
Constitution of the State, of August 12, 1994, sets five-year terms of office which will
give the municipal administrations sufficient time to implement their medium and long-
term plans and projects.
VI.   EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIE MUNICIPAL
STRENGTHENING PROJECT
The counterpart funding committed by the HAM was approximately US$3.3
million. However, by the close of the project HAM disbursements for it stood at
US$6,185,786. This near doubling of the counterpart resources is explained by the
dynamism of the execution of various works carried out through the project and by the
effective mechanisms employed for awarding and completing the works contracted out by
the municipality, all of which serves to underscore the confidence of the financing and
executing agencies in the project.
The World Bank Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) of 1987 set certain financial goals
that the municipality was to meet during the project execution period. The actual figures
and the SAR projections are given below:



- 42 -
Current revenues
HAM actual figure 1988-95                  US$270,743,000
SAR projection 1988-95                     US$138.986.000
US$131,757,000
Current expenditures
HAM actual figure 1988-95                  US$189,184,000
SAR projection 1988-95                     US$ 92.624.000
US$ 50,198,000
Surplus
HAM actual figure 1988-95                  US$ 81,559,000
SAR projection 1988-95                     US$ 46.363.000
US$ 35,196,000
The HAM's achievement in exceeding the SAR projections as regards revenue,
expenditure and surplus is attributable in part to the tax reforms imposed by the Central
Government and to sound municipal administration. However, the project's contribution
to the municipality's success was significant, due to the implementation of programs and
subprojects that enabled, as of 1987, vigorous economic recovery as a result of the actions
included in the Improvement of Municipal Management component.
On February 3, 1995, a Debt Offsetting Agreement was concluded between the
Ministry of Finance and the HAM, under which the outstanding mutual debts between the
State General Treasury and the HAM were cleared. As a result, the Central Government
assumed the total debt in respect of Credit 1842-BO, leaving the HAM free of this
obligation.
It is important to note the consistently cordial professional relations maintained
between the two institutions over the ten-year period.
VII. EVALUATION OF THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE
The Bank's relations with the borrower were cordial throughout and it provided
timely technical assistance and advice with decision-making. It also displayed flexibility in
the allocation and reallocation of resources in the annual reprogramming exercises. In
some cases there was a certain delay in communication, since many decisions were made
in the Bank's headquarters rather then being delegated to its mission in Bolivia.
The project, for its part, accepted and executed the different initiatives and
suggestions for better implementation of the agreement.



- 43 -
The disbursements were made without complications and quite smoothly.
However, it is fair to note that in certain instances the Bank did not recognize the amounts
of some specific investments in works.
VIII. SUSTAINABILlTY
The sector studies covered all areas of the municipality's activity. They were
based on the present situation but made provision for the future. The tasks undertaken
were always, as the project's title indicated, aimed at strengthening the municipality with
one clear goal: sustainability over time.
From the start of the project in 1986 the HAM underwent some far-reaching
changes that reshaped it in many ways. This is all reflected in concrete results. Today the
municipality is more up to date, economically strong and solvent, better organized and less
corrupt.
The project to improve financial administration and the urban cadaster and to set
up the ICAM, SRP, etc., have created what are now permanent instruments of the HAM.
They serve to enable modernization of its operation and management and generation of
enhanced revenues for investment in infrastructure, education and health, in accordance
with the new responsibilities assigned to the HAM.
The implementation of projects and execution of major works have contributed
significantly toward comprehensive solutions to problems connected with vehicular traffic,
natural hazards, urban sanitation, basic infrastructure and urban education. The work
done has had a considerable social impact which has benefited the low-income sectors of
the city's population.

AYUDA HEMORIA
Misi6n del Banco Mundial para la preparacion del Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) del Proyecto de Fortalecimiento Municipal -
Cr6dito 1842/BO.
10 al 19 de Octubre de 1996
1.   La Misi6n del Banco Mundial/AIF conf ormada por los sefiores
Oscar Alvarado, Of icial del Proyecto, John Stoddart, consultor
de la Divisi6n de Operaciones e Infraestructura y alberto
Nogales  de  la Representaci6n  del  Banco Mundial  (BM)  en
Bolivia, programaron una serie de visitas y entrevistas con
distintas autoridades municipales para analizar y evaluar el
estado de cumplimiento del Proyecto de Fortalecimiento.
Municipal (PFM), en cada uno de sus componentes y de acuerdo
a los convenios de Credito y del Proyecto. Las actividades
descritas se desarrollaron durante el periodo del 10 al 19 de
octubre de 1996.
2.   La Mision  efectu6  su trabajo de  evaluaci6n  en estrecho
contacto con la Unidad del PFM, representada por los sefiores:
Walter Hoz de Vila, Coordinador General y Carlos Moncada,
Gerente. Asl mismo, se entrevist6 con el Honorable Alcalde
Municipal,  Lic.  Ronald  MacLean  Abaroa,  el  Secretario
Ejecutivo, Ing. Jerry Vargas Ugalde, el Oficial Mayor de
Hacienda y Administraci6n, Lic. Javier Cuevas y otras
autoridades y tecnicos del Gobierno Municipal de La Paz.
ESTADO DE IMPLEMENTACION DEL PROYECTO
3.   Situaci6n  General.-  el  Proyecto  en  su  etapa  final  de
implementacion estd concluyendo satisfactoriamente todos sus
componentes, habi&ndose cumplido en general con los objetivos,
metas y acuerdos establecidos con la AIF/BM. Todos los
recursos del Credito fueron comprometidos, quedando solamente
por desembolsar los referidos al Proyecto de Catastro, que
concluye el 31 de octubre de 1996 y del proyecto de
Cartografia Digital, que tiene prevista su conclusi6n al 30 de
noviembre de 1996; ambos proyectos estan siendo ejecutados a
trav6s de consultoria internacional.
4.   An&lisis del cumplimiento de los objetivos.-  Se efectu6 una
revisi6n por cada una de las partes del proyecto establecidas
en el anexo 2 del Convenio de Cr6dito, verificando las
actividades y/o proyectos ejecutados por el municipio a trav6s
de la Unidad del PFM.

Se pudo constatar que el proyecto tuvo un impacto positivo en
el municipio, principalmente en lo relacionado a las obras de
control de riesgos, mejoramiento vial, saneamiento urbano y
modernizaci6n de la administracion, pese a los continuos
cambios de personal t6cnico y autoridades, principalmente en
la Alcaldia Municipal.
Se efectu6 un recorrido por la ciudad de La Paz, verificando
las distintas obras ejecutadas por el Proyecto, tanto en el
sector de control de riesgos, canalizaciones, estructura
urbana y vial, obras civiles para los distritos municipales,
estaci6n de transferencia y relleno sanitario, maestranzas
para mantenimiento del equipo municipal y otros. Se pudo
constatar el enorme impacto del proyecto en la ciudad,
habilitando zonas y otorgando mejores condiciones de calidad
de vida al ciudadano, con la ejecuci6n de obras pequefas pero
de gran impacto social y otras mayores de importante servicio
a la ciudad.
AsI mismo, se verific6 la dotacion de equipo al municipio, que
casi en su totalidad fue transferido por la Unidad del PFM,
consistente en equipo tecnico, de oficinas, computadoras,
vehiculos y mobiliario.
En resumen se considera que el Proyecto ha cumplido la mayoria
de sus objetivos, ejecutando todas las partes establecidas en
el Convenio de Credito. Con referencia a las proyecciones de
impacto financiero que el proyecto debia representar al
municipio, se pudo constatar que, si bien los gastos
ejecutados fueron superiores a lo pronosticado en el SAR, los
ingresos fueron muy superiores a los proyectados. Por tanto,
el superavit pronosticado para el periodo 90-95 fue de $us.
46.2 millones, siendo el actual de $us. 64.7 millones.
5.   Asistencia T6cnica.- Este componente fue de mucha utilidad en
el Proyecto, si bien los recursos del Credito fueron
ejecutados durante las gestiones 87 y 88, a partir de la
gesti6n 89 el municipio asumi6 los costos por este concepto,
en proo2ura de mantener el personal caiificaeo en el municipio
preservando la continuidad en el desarrollo de los proyectos.
Este importante esfuerzo del municipio continuara hasta el
cierre del Proyecto, vale decir el 31 de diciembre de 1996.
La Misi6n considera que la asistencia tecnica, permanente a lo
largo de la ejecuci6n del Proyecto, ha permitido el logro de
los objetivos y demuestra el interes del municipio en contar
con una planta de profesionales altamente capacitados acorde
a sus responsabilidades institucionales.

6.   Actividades Pendientes.- Existe preocupaci6n por la 6ptima
transferencia del Sistema de Catastro, desarrollado a trav6s
del proyecto de Catastro Urbano Fiscal Automatizado, a la
municipalidad una vez concluido el proyecto (31 de octubre de
1996). La HAM debe tomar la determinaci6n acerca del futuro de
la modalidad de administracion del sistema en el mas breve
tiempo posible, para de esta manera lograr la continuidad del
proyecto y asegurar la importante inversi6n realizada. Asi
mismo, debe efectuar todos los esfuerzos para lograr el
adecuado cumplimiento de ILIS al contrato en las condiciones
de calidad establecidas en el mismo.
Se preve que el proyecto de Cartograf la Digital serd concluido
satisfactoriamente de acuerdo a contrato, el avance actual no
presenta demoras.
Con referencia al Sistema Integrado de Administracifn
Financiera, desarrollado por la firma Coopers & Lybrand, que
a la fecha se encuentra implementado en el municipio, restando
los ajustes propios del proceso de sistematizaci6n, la HAM
debera continuar con la aplicaci6n de todos los procedimientos
establecidos para preservar la importante inversi6n y
garantizar la 6ptima .aplicacion del sistema, definiendo asi
mismo la modalidad futura de su administracion. Por otra
parte, se debe concluir con el proceso de ajuste al sistema y
capacitaci6n de personal bajo responsabilidad de la firma
consultora.
El trabajo de auditoria externa de las cuentas de la
municipalidad por la gesti6n 1995, serc convocado a licitaci6n
publica la semana pr6xima, se estima el cumplimiento de 6ste
compromiso hasta fines de la presente gesti6n.
La Misi6n agradece la gentil colaboraci6n de la Unidad del PFM
y todas las autoridades municipales.
