APPRAISAL OF A SECOND ROAD PROJECT
BOTSWANA
SUMARY
i.        Botswana is a landlocked, sparsely populated, arid country, where
livestock forms the basis of the economy. However, recent major discoveries
of copper, nickel and diamonds in exploitable quantities will lead to de-
velopment of an important mining industry in the near future.
ii.       The country's large area, low population density and low produc-
tivity make the provision of a transport system a relatively costly matter.
The road network comprises 26 km of paved roads, about 800 km of all-weather
roads (including parts of the important North-South road), and about 7,200
km of earth tracks. The Government's highway program aims at improving the
roads that connect the population and economic centers, mainly in the east-
ern portion of the country.
iii.      Botswana has received help for its road development from IDA, the
U.K. Government, and USAID. Under the First Road Project in 1964 (Credit
63-BEC). IDA provided US$3.60 million equivalent for constructing three
roads (including one low-cost road opening up the north of the country to
development), improving parts of the North-South road and strengthening and
equipping the maintenance organization. The First Road Project, completed
in 1968, was well executed and was a successful contribution to Botswana's
economic development. Road works are also included in Bank loan 776-BT for
infrastructure needed for the Shashe mining development.  The U.K. Government
has provided help for highway maintenance in the form of staff and equipment,
and has financed the feasibility study on which the proposed Second Road
1'roject is based. USAID has financed a feasibility study of the Nata-Zambia
Border road in the north and consultants have been appointed for detailed
engineering.
iv.       This proposed project is based on technical and economic studies
carried out by consultants. It comprises reconstruction and paving of about
80 km of the North-South road (including the 66 km section between the cap-
ital, Gaborone, and the town of Lobatse), consultant services for detailed
engineering and supervision of construction, and technical assistance for
the Roads Branch of the Public Works Department. The cost of the project
is estimated at US$6.2 million equivalent, including contingencies, with
a foreign exchange component of US$5.15 million equivalent. The Government
is unable to make a significant contribution to the project cost and US$6.0
million equivalent would have to be financed externally; there would thus
be local cost financing of US$0.85 million. The proposed credit would
provide US$2 million equivalent or about 33% of the project costs. The
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) has agreed to provide the



- ii -
remainder of the external financing. The Government is approaching UNDP and
bilateral development agencies to provide the technical assistance for the
Roads Branch; if so provided, the allocation of proceeds of the credit will
be adjusted accordingly.
v.        Detailed engineering and bidding documents for the proposed con-
struction are completed. Retroactive financing of US$220,000 equivalent
from October 1970 is proposed under the project for the cost of the
detailed engineering.
vi.       The best estimate of the internal economic return for the recon-
struction and paving is 19% indicating that the project is well justified.
Benefits used in the economic evaluation are derived from potential road
user savings and maintenance expenditure savings.
vii.      The project would be executed by the Ministry of Works and Com-
munications. The works would be carried out under a single construction
contract which would be awarded after international competitive bidding,
consultants would supervise construction.
viii.     The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$2 million equiv-
alent.



APPRAISAL OF A SECOND ROAD PROJECT
BOTSWANA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Botswana has requested the Association and the
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) to help finance a project
consisting of (a) reconstruction and paving of the Pioneer Gate-Lobatse-
Gaborone-Sebele section (about 80 km) of the North-South road, (b) consulting
services for detailed engineering and construction supervision of the work,
and (c) technical assistance to the Roads Branch of the Public Works Depart-
ment (PWD). The total cost of the project is estimated at US$6.2 million
equivalent. The Government would provide the equivalent of US$200,000; the
remainder would be financed by SIDA and IDA on the basis of a US$4.00 million
and US$2.00 million equivalent participation respectively.
1.02      A feasibility study of the proposed road project was financed by
U.K. Government and was carried out by consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and
Partners (U.K.); the Government, in agreement with the Association, retained
Gibb's Africani subsidiary for detailed engineering.
1.03      This would be the Second Road Project in Botswana.  Credit 63-BEC
(US$3.6() million equivalent) for the First Road Project was signed in August
1964. The project was completed in 1968 on time, within the cost estimates
and to satisfactory standards. It included:
(a)  design, construction and reconstruction of three
roads totalling 570 km;
(b)  selected betterment of the North-South road; and
(c)  strengthening and expansion of the maintenance
organization.
1.04      Appraisal of the present project is based on economic and technical
studies prepared by the consultants, and on the findings of an appraisal mis-
sion comprising Messrs. F.D.T. Reid (engineer, PMEA) and N.J. Kanaan (econ-
omist) which visited Botswana in February 1971. Mr. A. Van Dijck (engineer)
visited Botswana in September 1971 and participated in the preparation of the
report. Editing was by Miss R. Mayes.



- 2 -
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Botswana (with an area of about 600,000 km ) is a landlocked coun-
try, bordered by the Republic of South Africa on the south and east, by South
West Africa on the north and west, by Southern Rhodesia on the ntortheast, and
by Zambia in the extreme north. The Kalahari desert - part sand, part grass-
land - covers much of the south and west.
2.02      Based on an adjusted 1964 census, the population is presently es-
timated at 670,000 growing at 3% per year. Most of the population lives in
villages, but about 5% is nomadic. The population is unevenly distributed
and about 75% live in the eastern 10% of the country near the North-South
road and the parallel railway line. Per capita GNP was estimated at about
US$100 in 1969/70 and is expected to grow at 8% annually over the next five
years - largely as a result of planned development of the mining industry.
2.03      On the basis of a 1967/68 labor census it is estimated that 87%
of the labor force is employed in animal husbandry and agriculture, 5% in
extractive industries, and the rest in service and public administration.
Of the US$10 million earned by exports in 1968, 96% caiae from livestock and
livestock products. However, the exploitation of diamond deposits 225 km
west of Francistown has recently begun and the importance of the mining sec-
tor will further increase as extraction of large deposits of copper and
nickel in the northeast gets under way (para. 3.09). This increase in min-
ing activity will open up new opportunities for employment.
2.04      The scarcity of educated and skilled manpower is a major constraint
on economic development in Botswana. Botswana nationals fill only 25% of
civil service jobs requiring a minimum education of five years. According
to present plans, enrollment in secondary schools will triple between 1969
and 1975; nevertheless, it will take ten to fifteen years before nationals
can fill all jobs requiring a minimum of five years education. So far, as-
sistance in education has been provided on a bilateral basis only, but Bank
assistance may be requested in the future.
B. The Transport Sector
General
2.05      The large area of Botswana, its low population density and low
productivity in general, and the desert conditions throughout most of the
country, result in low density of cargo and passenger flows, and make deve-
lopment of a transport system a costly matter. The country is landlocked,
and access to the sea is through Cape Town, Beira or Lourenco Marques, each
about 1,500 km from the capital, Gaborone.



-3-
Highways
2.06      Details of the highway system are given in Chapter 3.
Railways
2.07      In the nineteenth century a railroad system was built in southern
Africa connecting the major urban centers of Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg,
Salisbury and Beira. This railroad extends through the length (635 km) of
the eastern part of what is today Botswana, which at present has the use of
this railroad line connecting the two large trading partners (South Africa
and Southern Rhodesia) without having to bear the financial burden associated
with such an operation. The railroad is owned, operated and maintained by
the Rhodesia Railway Corporation which pays Botswana an annual wayleave of
US$450,000 equivalent. The railroad is the main mode of transport for import
and export. In 1969, railroad traffic originating or terminating in Botswana
was about 500,000 tons, 10% of which was moved within Botswana, the rest
being either imports or exports (Table 1). About 400,000 passengers were
transported within Botswana by rail in 1969.
Air Transport
2.08      Because of the large distances between urban centers, the poor
condition of roads and the limited area served by the railroad, air transport
could play an increased role in Botswana, and the Government's development
strategy accordingly emphasizes the need for air connections to integrate dis-
persed settlements into the life of the country. In March 1970, Botswana Air-
ways Corporation (50% Government owned and 50% privately owned) took over
Botswana National Airways, an airline which had started operation in 1965,
but which had invested ill-advisedly in large aircraft. Scheduled domestic
flights serve most of the population centers in the country with Hawker Sid-
deley 748, Britten Norman Islander and de Havilland Dove aircraft, all suit-
able for the present airports which, other than Gaborone and Francistown,
are unsurfaced airstrips without terminal buildings or related facilities.
The only international scheduled services are by Zambian Airways between
Lusaka, Francistown, and Gaborone and by South African Airways between
Johannesburg, Gaborone and Francistown. Reliable data on air passenger or
cargo movements are nct available.
C. Transportation Policy and Coordination
2.09      The Ministry of Works and Communications is responsible for high-
ways and for air transport, and has a section dealing with the railway, but
since the latter is controlled from Southern Rhodesia (para. 2.06), the Min-
istry has little influence over it. A small group in the Ministry recently
began work on a transport plan; this group could be a nucleus for a coordi-
nating agency if and when the need for modal coordination arises. The pro-
posed road project runs parallel to the railway for the entire length of the
road (80 km); it is unlikely, however, that there would be much competition
between these two modes as each plays a different role. The railway is prim-
arily a link between South Africa and Southern Rhodesia and only a very small



- 4 -
part of the total movement which it handles is Botswana traffic (para. 2.07).
Service and timing of train operations on the railway are dictated by demands
at the larger centers of Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg, Salisbury and
Beira; little attention is given to the demands at in-between points such as
Gaborone and Lobatse. Due to the importance that the railway assigns to ef-
ficiency of operations, the best service is given to wagon-load shipments,
while less than wagon-load shipments experience delays while being consolid-
ated into shipments for the same destination. This type of rail service is
not well suited to satisfy the transport demands between Lobatse and Gaborone
where the comparatively light density of traffic and the short haul between
the two centers is more conducive to road rather than rail transport. The
road, on the other hand, serves primarily the transport demands between
Lobatse and Gaborone, and points in between, some of which are not served
at all by the railway. The Government's policy is to become less dependent
on the rigid schedule of the railroad by providing road transport which
would serve the whole area between Gaborone and Lobatse.
2.10      There may however be a problem of road-rail competition when the
improvement of the remainder of the North-South road is considered, as the
two routes parallel each other for about 650 km. Since future IDA assis-
tance may be required for further improvements in the North-South road a
pre-feasibility study to determine timing of such improvements to appro-
priate sections of the road should be undertaken. This preliminary study,
to be carried out by the Ministry of Works, should be finished by the end
of 1972, before which time no improvements are planned. The Government has
given assurances that this preliminary study will be undertaken and its con-
clusions discussed with the Association.
2.11      There is no restriction on importation of vehicles or on entry
into the trucking industry, and no regulation of trucking rates. A Trans-
portation Act is being prepared to regulate speed and weight limits, and
to introduce annual vehicle inspection. Permissible axle loading (9 m
tons per single axle) will be the same as in South Africa and enforcement
is expected to pose no problem; a loadometer survey carried out on the North-
South road during the feasibility study for the proposed project revealed
that only about 1% of truck and bus axle-loads exceeded 9 m tons. However,
the new Shashe mining developments (para. 3.09) may lead to heavier traffic
using the road system, and it is important that an adequate legal basis
exists to deal with vehicle weights. The Government has submitted the
Transportation Act which is likely to be passed by Parliament in December
1971, and has given assurances that satisfactory weight controls will be
implemented.

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Development of the Highway Network
3.01      The road system of Botswana is in its early stage of development.
When Botswana became independent in September 1966, there were only about
430 km, of all-weather roads in the country out of a total 7,700 km of roads
and tracks (Table 2). Since then, the Road Project (Credit 63-BEC) has in-
creased the length of all-weather roads to over 800 km. The main route is
the North-South road (670 km) running the length of the eastern part of the
country from the Southern Rhodesian border in the north to the South African
border, near Mafeking, in the south. Excepting Gaborone-Lobatse and some
other sections its condition is fair in relation to the low level of present
traffic, but driving becomes difficult in some sections during the rainy
season.
B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.02      About 6,700 vehicles are registered in Botswana, of which about
40% are passenger cars, 30% pick-ups and the rest trucks and buses. The
fleet has been growing an average of about 13% per annum since 1959 (Table
3). No accurate data exists on passenger and cargo transport and on gasoline
consumption over the years, but a rough calculation based on estimated fleet
utilization and average length of haul indicates road freight traffic of
about 50 million ton-km and passenger transport of about 300 million passenger-
km in 1969, most of it originating or terminating in Gaborone and Lobatse.
C.   Highway Administration
3.03      Gazetted roads 1/ are classified as trunk, main and district roads
(Table 2). The roads Branch of the PWD in the Ministry of Works and Com-
munications (see Chart) is responsible for planning, construction and main-
tenance of trunk and main roads. It is also responsible for airfield main-
tenance. The Roads Branch, with headquarters in Gaborone, comprises three
main sections: Planning and Design, Construction, and Maintenance, the lat-
ter having provincial units in Gaborone (south) and Francistown (north),
each headed by a Road Engineer (Maintenance). Central facilities in Gaborone
include a central workshop, a laboratory and a training center for field
staff; there are divisional workshops in Francistown. In addition, there
are 23 field maintenance depots and 10 more are planned.
3.04      While organization of the Roads Branch is basically satisfactory,
the staffing situation is not. The Branch has been staffed by expatriates,
employed either under contract or provided under U.K. technical assistance.
Lately, however, a serious situation has developed because the Government's
1/   Non-gazetted roads totalling about 3,000 km are the responsibility of
District Councils.



salary scales do not attract qualified expatriates. Only the Senior Roads
Engineer position is filled; the remaining four professional staff posts are
vacant, although a U.K.-financed engineer is expected to fill one of these
vacancies soon. The proposed project will help finance three experts for
construction and maintenance of highways, as well as for on-the-job training
for Botswana nationals in the day-to-day operations of highway maintenance
(para. 4.05).
D. Highway Financing and Planning
3.05      Data on revenues from road users in Botswana (other than on vehicle
registration fees) are not available, but 1970 import duties on vehicles,
spare parts, gasoline and diesel oil imported into the South African Custom
Union of which Botswana is a member were estimated by the appraisal mission,
it was not possible to estimate these revenues for previous years. Such re-
venues accruing to the Government totalled about R 1.5 million (US$2.1() mil-
lion equivalent), which more than covered 1970 expenditures on administering
and maintaining (including such betterment work as regravelling) the highway
system and should continue to do so in the coming years.
3.06      Expenditures on highway maintenance (including minor betterment)
have increased from approximately R 0.46 million (US$0.64 million equivalent)
in 1967/68 to R 0.78 million (US$1.09 million equivalent) in 1970/71. The
National Development Plan 1970-75 envisages that expenditure will rise
to R 1.17 million (US$1.56 million equivalent) by 1974/75. These expendi-
tures, while modest in relation to the extent and condition of the highway
network, are adequate in view of the low traffic level on the roads.
3.07      Priorities for road improvements have been largely based on the
experience and judgment of officials in the Ministry of Works and Com-
munications. Recently, an economist has been appointed to the Ministry and,
together with a transport economist provided by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) has helped prepare a 1970-75 road development plan.
This plan, which would supersede that included in the National Development
Plan 1970-75, envisages construction or reconstruction of about 1,100 km of
roads and has been coordinated with the overall development requirements of
Botswana. It includes the road to be financed under the proposed project as
well as about 60% of the remainder of the main North-South road.  It is an
ambitious program, totalling about R 11.3 million (IJS$15 million equivalent)
and its execution is entirely dependent on the availability of external fi-
nancing.
3.08      Most of the roadworks included in the program form part of the
North-South road and thus will be covered in the proposed preliminary study
(para. 2.10).  As part of this program the Government is with U.K. loan funds
improving 106 km of the Sebele (9 km north of Gaborone) - Pilane section of
the North-South trunk road, which is in poor condition.  The Government has
negotiated USAID financing for design of the road from Nata to the Zambian
border, following a feasibility study by URS Research Company (US) also
financed by USAID.



3.09      A Bank loan (776-BT) has recently been made for infrastructure
needed for the Shashe copper/nickel mining development at Pikwe, south of
Francistown; the infrastructure includes improvement to gravel standards of
74 km of the North-South road and of a 56 km spur road to Pikwe. The Loan
will finance the full costs of these road works estimated at about US$2.3
million equivalent.
3.10      Traffic data are collected but, because of staff shortages, other
information necessary for transport planning is only being gathered to a
limited extent. The experts to be provided under technical assistance
should however help to remedy the situation. The Government has given as-
surances that in future, data for planning of highway maintenance, improve-
ment and construction will be collected systematically.
E. Highway Engineering
3.11      To the extent possible, road and bridge works have been designed
and supervised departmentally, with consultants called in only for major
road construction. Because of shortage of staff, however, PWD now relies
almost entirely on consultants. Design standards used are appropriate.
F. Highway Construction
3.12      There is no domestic construction industry capable of carrying
out a contract of the size of the proposed project. The few small local
firms that exist are largely subsidiaries of Southern Rhodesian firms, or-
ganized only for carrying out minor betterment and gravelling works. PWD
has a construction unit, with its own equipment, which is used for better-
ment works costing up to R 150,000. The Roads Branch is not sufficiently
staffed to supervise major construction work.
G. Highway Maintenance
3.13      Routine maintenance of the gazetted road system is performed by
force account with equipment rented from and maintained by the Mechanical
Equipment Branch of the PWD. Technical assistance is shortly to be provided
by UK to establish this Branch on a self-financing basis to maintain all
Government vehicles and equipment. Road maintenance is carried out to modest
standards; it is generally adequate, taking into account that it has to
be performed on largely unengineered roads with inadequate drainage.
Its organization and direction have suffered recently from the lack of
engineering and supporting staff (para. 3.04).
3.14      In the First Road Project, about US$600,000 equivalent was pro-
vided for building 12 maintenance roadside depots, for purchasing maintenance
equipment, and for initiating a training scheme. The effects of this small
effort were positive, but part of the equipment must now be replaced. Im-
mediate replacement needs are being financed by the U.K. and the equipment
and spare parts are expected to arrive shortly.



3.15      Maintenance workshops, especially the one in Francistown, will
also need improvement.  U.K. financing is also being provided for this work.
3.16      The Government plans to increase budget allocations substantially
for road maintenance and improvement work (para. 3.06). During Credit nego-
tiations assurances were obtained from the Government regarding the adequate
maintenance of the gazetted road network.
4. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(i) the reconstruction and paving of about 80 km of the
North-South road from Pioneer Gate (South African
border) through Lobatse and Gaborone to Sebele,
some 9 km north of Gaborone;
(ii)  consulting services for detailed engineering and super-
vision of construction of the above work; and
(iii)  technical assistance to strengthen the staffing of the
Roads Branch of the PWD.
B. Reconstruction and Paving
4.02      The project road connects the capital Gaborone and the important
town of Lobatse. The terrain is generally flat. The existing road has sunk
below the level of the surrounding terrain through traffic wear and mainten-
ance grading; this makes drainage difficult. The surface is in poor condition
despite the efforts of the Roads Branch to improve it by selective gravelling.
Driving conditions are hazardous, particularly with the bad corrugations and
dust in dry weather; during rain the road is almost impassable. Improvements
made under the First Road Project included installation of box and pipe cul-
verts, the construction of a road-over-rail bridge, and the replacement of
sub-standard bridges; these prior investments will be incorporated in the
proposed project.
4.03      The project road has been designed to standards adopted for trunk
roads in Botswana (Table 4), in particular a pavement width of 6.70 m and a
shoulder width of 2 m; the pavement will be completed with a two-coat bi-
tuminous surface treatment. Grades will not normally exceed 3%. The stand-
ards are satisfactory and have been confirmed during credit negotiations.
This type of road does not lend itself to labor-intensive methods, because
there is relatively little earth moving involved and the bulk of the cost
is in the pavement structure. The project is expected to provide jobs for
about 100-150 workers. There is not much overt unemployment in Botswana,
although disguised or seasonal unemployment exists in the country side.

C. Consulting Services
4.04      With U.K. financing, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (U.K.) carried
out the feasibility study for the project road; the Government of Botswana,
in agreement with IDA, subsequently retained the African subsidiary of this
firm to carry out detailed engineering. The consultants' contract was ac-
ceptable to the Association. Detailed engineering is complete and bidding
documents will be ready shortly. The project includes financing of the de-
tailed engineering retroactively to October 1, 1970 up to the equivalent of
US$220,000. The Government proposes to use the same consultant to assist in
prequalifying bidders, evaluating bids and supervising construction; this
would be acceptable to the Association. Draft terms of reference have been
agreed with the Government.
D. Technical Assistance for Strengthing of Roads Branch
4.05      Most key positions in the Roads Branch are vacant; no local en-
gineers are available and present salaries are too low to attract qualified
and experienced expatriates (para. 3.04). The project includes provision
for financing the additional salaries, above that which Government can offer
in salaries and other benefits, needed to attract qualified professional
staff. In this manner the following posts will be filled for four years:
(i) Road Engineer (Construction) and (ii) two Road Engineers (Maintenance)
to supervise road maintenance. A major task for the experts would be to
train, to the extent possible, Botswana nationals in highway construction
and maintenance. The Government is examining whether financing of the ex-
perts cannot be obtained through the OPAS program of UNDP or through bila-
teral sources. If the Government is successful, the funds allocated for
the technical assistance item will be reallocated.
E. Cost Estimates
4.06      The cost of the project is estimated at US$6.20 million including
contingency allowances; a summary of the project cost follows:

tion)                     0.15   0.82   0.97   0.20   1.09   1.29
TOTAL          0.79   3.86   4.65   1.05   5.15   6.20
4.07      The construction cost estimate is based on quantities derived from
completed detailed engineering and on unit prices at September 1971 levels
for similar, current road projects in nearby Soutli Africa, as adapted to
Botswana circumstances. Contingency allowances of 8% for quantity increases
and 17% for price increases have been included. The latter represents an
average increase of 10%l per annum; this high percentage increase is con-
sidered necessary because of rapid price increases for civil works in South
Africa and surrounding countries. The tax element of construction cost is
estimated at about 2%.
4.08      The cost of detailed engineering is based on the contract with
the consultant; the cost of supervising construction has been estimated on
the basis of estimated man-months and average rates for similar works.
4.09      The consultants assessed the foreign component of construction cost
at 85%. For consulting services the foreign exchange component has been es-
timated at 80%. The local cost of the technical assistance for the PWD will
consist of the salaries paid according to Government salary scales; the for-
eign exchange cost will be the additional payment necessary to attract ex-
patriate personnel.
F. Execution of the Project
4.10      The executing agency would be the Ministry of Works and Communica-
tions, assisted by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Africa), under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association.



- 11 -
4.11      Construction would be carried out under a single contract let after
international competitive bidding on the basis of unit prices and in accord-
ance with the Association's established bidding procedures. Subdivision of
the bidding would not attract suitable smaller local construction firms, be-
cause there are none in Botswana.
4.12      Work could start by the fourth quarter of 1972 and be completed by
early 1975. This schedule assumes that contractors would be prequalified in
M.irch 1972, bids received in July 1972 and a contract awarded in Auguat-
September 1972.
4.13      In the event that experts to fill the technical assistance posts
included in the project will be financed by IDA and SIDA the terms and con-
ditions will be agreed with the Association.
G. Financing and Disbursements
4.14      The project would be financed jointly by the Association, SIDA
and the Government of Botswana. Botswana is able to provide only US$200,000
equivalent. External financing must therefore fill the balance and SIDA has
agreed to finance the project jointly with the Association and to accept the
Association as executing agency. The proposed external financing would be a
SIDA Credit of US$4 million equivalent and an IDA Credit of US$2 million. The
Government would finance 2% of the costs of construction (estimated to be equal
to the tax element), as well as the local costs of the technical assistance
financed under the project. The Association would finance one-third and
SIDA two-thirds of the remaining costs of construction; the Association would
finance one-third and SIDA two-thirds of the full costs of the consultant
services (detailed engineering and supervision) and of the foreign exchange
costs of the technical assistance.
4.15      A condition for credit effectiveness shall be conclusion of a
credit agreement between SIDA and the Government and a joint financing
agreement between SIDA, the Association, and Goverment on allocation
and disbursement of proceeds of financing.
4.16      The disbursement schedule corresponding with the program indicated
in para 4.12 would be (for details of IDA disbursement see Annex):
IDA Fiscal Year                    1973    197      1        1976     Total
Amount (US$ million squivalent)
IDA            0.2      0.8     0.7     0.3       2.0
SIDA           0.4      t.t,    1.4      0.6      4.0
Governmernt    0.02    0.08    0.07    0.03       0.20
The amount of US$220,000 equivalent proposed for retroactive financing of the
cost of detailed engineering from October 1970 is included as disbursement in
fiscal year 1973.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      The direct influence area, through which the road passes, stretches
from north of Gaborone (Agriculture College) to Pioneer Gate, 5 km east of
Lobatse on the South African border. This direct influence area is about
40,000 sq. km and has about 240,000 people (37% of the country's population).
The most important economic activity is livestock raising and cattle fanning,
which provides Botswana's main export. The abattoir at Lobatse, which is the
largest commercial organization in the country, has a capacity of 200,000
head per year (93,000 head processed in 1969). Agriculture in 1969 produced
about 35,000 toils of sorghum, maize and millet, mostly for local consumption.
The only important mining industry in the direct influence area of this road
is manganese (25,000 tons in 1969).
5.02      The indirect influence area of the proposed road project (the rest
of the North-South road) extends north of Gaborone to the Southern Rhodesian
border (Ramokgwebana) and south of Lobatse to the South African border
(Ramathlababama). A large amount of the present and potential economric ac-
tivity -- livestock and mining -- is concentrated in this corridor. Expan-
sion of economic activity, especially of mining operations (para. 3.09), and
further improvements on the North-South road are bound to have an important
impact in the form of increased traffic on the project road.
B. Benefits from the Project
5.03      The proposed project road was considered as three sections on the
basis of traffic intensity: Sebele - Gaborone, Gaborone - Lobatse, and
Lobatse - Pioneer Gate. ADT on these sections varied between a high of 285
and a low of 150 of which about 40% are heavy vehicles (Table 5). Historic
traffic figures on the project road show an annual growth of about 13%. Fu-
ture average annual growth is estimated by the consultants at 10% for light
vehicles (up to 1-1/2 tons capacity) and 8% for heavier vehicles for the
first ten years after opening of the new road, decreasing to 8% and 6% re-
spectively for the next ten years; these figures appear reasonable, and in
the second ten years will be influenced by the major mining development
taking place at Shashe. Some traffic between Botswana and South Africa and
between the Kalahari District and Gaborone will be diverted to the improved
road and has been taken into account in the economic evaluation (see Table 5)
but little traffic is expected to be generated by the improvement.
5.04      Most of the quantifiable benefits attributed to the project are
derived from savings to road users of both present and diverted traffic
(Table 6). The unit operating costs will decrease by about 30% after re-
construction. Additional benefits are derived from the difference in main-
tenance costs of a well-constructed paved road and the existing gravel road
with rising volumes of traffic. Unquantified benefits attributable to the
project are reduced travel time and increased comfort to the users of the
road, as well as faster turnover of shippers' capital.



- 13 -
5.05      Comparing the potential saving from delaying construction by one
year (about US$250,000) with the first year benefit which will accrue to
the users (about US$500,000) shows that execution of the project is overdue.
An analysis to determine the best level of road improvement, which compared
different types and timings of improvements (such as optimum staging of
pavement construction) proved that the highest economic return would be
achieved if paving were carried out immediately.
5.06      For the three sections forming the project road, the estimated
net benefits, discounted over a 20-year economic life of the road, give
internal economic returns varying between 21% and 12% (Table 7). A sensi-
tivity analysis indicates that reasonable variations in construction costs
and traffic growth, the two major inputs in the analysis, have little impact
on the IER. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the IER would fall below
10% for the project as a whole. It could, however, fall to 10% on the 6 km
section between Lobatse and Pioneer Gate in the event that construction cost
is 10% higher than estimated and at the same time, expected traffic growth
falls 10% below the estimate.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During Credit negotiations agreement has been reached and assur-
ances obtained from the Government on the following principal points:
(a)  the pre-feasibility study of the North-South road
(para. 2.10);
(b)  collection of data necessary for transport planning
(para. 3.10); and
(c)  adequate maintenance of the gazetted road network
(para. 3.16).
6.02      A condition of credit effectiveness will be conclusion of a credit
agreement between SIDA and the Government and a joint financing agreement be-
tween SIDA, the Association and the Government (para. 4.15).
6.03      With the agreements and assurances indicated above, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$2 million
equivalent.
