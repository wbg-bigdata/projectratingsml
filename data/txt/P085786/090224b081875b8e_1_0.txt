                         Overall, the Project has recorded satisfactory progress towards achievement of the development objective. The project has recorded the following results: reduced student classroom
                         ratios from 70:1 to 45:1 in targeted areas, increased the number of people accessing basic services as follows: (i) in health to 12,412,046 against a target of 10,449,859; (ii) increased
                         the number of people with access to improved water sources to 1,310,256 against a target of 1,769,750; (iii) 879,583 people have improved sanitation against a set target of 889,250;
                         (iv) 3,087,000 people with access to roads against a target of 2,823,263; (v) 20 million person days of employment through public works created against 16.8 million target; (vi)
                         1,044,000 people have access to irrigation facilities against a target of 248,291; (vii) 325,500 people have access to markets against a set target of 348,115. These results have led to
                         citizen satisfaction at the rate of 85% (which is the target) in delivery of basic social services in targeted areas. In all the interventions, the total number of direct beneficiaries is over
                         20 million against a target of 16 million with the number of female beneficiaries at 54 percent. The rapid assessments carried out by independent consultants indicate that the project

                         has demonstrated high impact on beneficiary households through the savings and investment promotion which has enabled the savers to increase their household assets, to access
                         farm inputs from own resources and increase farm acreage under cultivation. The Project has also undertaken social accountability interventions through the use of community score
                         cards and citizen report cards, including deposition of information in the public domain as a way of exacting accountability from implementers at all levels.
