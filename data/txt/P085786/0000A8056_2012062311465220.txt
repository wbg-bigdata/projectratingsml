                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, project has recorded satisfactory progress towards achievement of the development objective. The project has recorded the following results: reduced student classroom
                         ratios, increased the number of people accessing basic services in health, improved water sources, improved sanitation, roads, irrigation facilities, and employment creation. These
                         results led to citizen satisfaction in delivery of basic social services in targeted areas. In all the interventions, the number of female beneficiaries is above fifty percent. The rapid
                         assessments carried out by independent consultants indicate that the project has demonstrated high impact on beneficiary households through the savings and investment promotion
                         which has enabled the savers to increase their household assets, access to farm inputs from own resources and increase in farm farm acreage. The Project has also undertaken
                         social accountability interventions through the use of community score cards and citizen report cards, including deposition of information in the public domain as a way of exacting
                         accountability from implementers at all levels.
