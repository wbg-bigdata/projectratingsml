NON-FORMAL VOCATIONAL TRAING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Republic of Turkey
Amount:               US$58.5 million
Terms:                Seventeen years, including four years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:  The proposed project supports the Government's efforts
to increase and improve the supply of well-trained labor
for manufacturing industries and to improve employment
opportunities (including self employment) for people
with limited education and training. The project would
expand the number of training places in various
institutions such as the Apprenticeship Training Centers
and the Public Training Centers and would improve the
quality of Non-Formal Vocational Training CNFVT) pro-
grams and enhance their relevance to labor market needs
through technical assistance and training in a number of
critical areas: instructor training, training needs
assessment, curriculum design, instructional materials
development, skill testing and certification, and
entrepreneurship courses. The project would also
include the establishment of production revolving funds
to enable the training institutions to generate addi-
tional revenues through the production of items for sale.
Benefit and Risks:    The proposed project would make a valuable contribution
towards meeting critical manpower shortages which con-
strain economic growth in manufacturing industries and
would also significantly increase basic skill training
to improve employment opportunities for disadvantaged
groups, including out-of-school youth and unemployed
adults. The major quantifiable benefit of the proposed
project when fully operational would be an annual output
of 60,000 additional workers with industrial anld service
skills. The proposed project would also improve the
quality of training provided and, through establishment
of the Production Revolving Funds, would produce a
source of revenue to help reduce the cost of operations
of the NFVT system. The proposed project would be
implemented in three successive phases of approximately
two years, each one comprising a set of sub-projects.
The MOE has successfully identified, prepared and
appraised the first phase of the project. Therefore,
the risk that second and third phase sub-projects may
not be well prepared according to labor market and
community needs is considered minimal.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCON AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE EBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR A
NON-FORMAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$58.5 million to finance the
foreign exchange cost of a Non-Formal Vocational Training (NFVT) project. The
loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate.
PART I - TME ECONOMY 11
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey: The Vth Five-Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.       Turkey's area is about 780,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a population of around
50 million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984. The density of population is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more
recently, to the Middle East), there is still substantial unemployment which,
including disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about
19 percent of the civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no
absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There are
considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable increase in income inequality
since the 1970s, especially a relative deterioration of the position of wage
and salary earners and an improvement in the position of the trading and
connercial classes, and, more generally, of capital-owners. Educational
enrollment particularly at primary level, has expanded greatly, but the level
of adult literacy remains relatively low compared to the European average for
middle income countries.
11 Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
Presideut's Report for the Sir Hydropower Project (P-4529-TU) dated
August 1, 1986.



4.       During the L970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize imports, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
front, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.      The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five Structural Adjustment Loans, an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan and a
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan, involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutions and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
be put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
system, the export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program. Implementation
of the adjustment program started in January 1980, continued under a military
regime during the period September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been
carried out by an elected government.
The Struetural Adjustment Proggram, 1980-86
7.      The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and the outcome met or exceeded the Government's
own targets through 1982. The overall performance deteriorated in 1983 due to
a combination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages in the monetary
program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved again, except in the
area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The improvement was
maintained in 1985, this time including a slowdown in inflation and a
reduction in the budget deficit. In 1986, while output has grown at a rapid
pace and inflation has decelerated, the balance of payments position has
deteriorated somewhat.
8.      After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.3 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.5 percent growth) and industry (10.1 percent growth).
Merchandise exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar
terms. In 1985, the economy grew by about 5.1 percent, as against the program



-3-
target of 5.5 percent. The slowdown in growth was most significant in
agriculture (2.4 percent growth) and manufacturing (5.5 percent), due
respectively to less favorable climatic conditions and slackening domestic
demand. Preliminary estimates for 1986 indicate a real GNP growth rate of
about 7 percent, reflecting rapid rates of growth of both industrial and
agricultural production, and a sharp revival of domestic demand. On the
expenditure side, the average annual real rate of growth of public fixed
investment over the period 1980-84 was 3.8 percent. Estimates for 1985
indicate that public fixed investment totalled TL 3,108 billion, implying a
*uch higher real growth (13.3 percent) over 1984 than programmed
(5.8 percent). The growth of investment was concentrated in
infrastructure energy, transportation and telecommunication.  Provisional
estimates for 1986 indicate a continuing rapid growth of public investment.
The growth rate of private investment has fluctuated more severely, falling by
17 percent in 1980, recovering slowly, and then rising by 8.8 percent in 1984,
7.8 percent in 1985, and considerably more than this in 1986. Private
consumption, after declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by
5 percent in 1983 and 5.5 percent in 1984 before slowing down to an estimated
3.6 percent in 1985. Strict budgetary discipline contributed to a steady
decline in the real rate of growth of public consumption from 8.4 percent in
1980 to 1.7 percent in 1983; however, it increased to 3.0 percent in 1984 and
an estimated 3.2 percent in 1985. Preliminary estimates for 1986 indicate
that the growth of both public and private consumption has accelerated to over
7 percent.
9_      During 1981-82, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in the wholesale price index (WPI) decelerated to 37 percent
in 1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and
the inflation rate rose to 30 percert. Inflation accelerated further in 1984,
and reached 50 percent, due to die lagged impact of the expansionary monetary
policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant increase in
agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and vegetables, as a
consequence of export liberalization and higher export market prices. Other
contributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases of SEE prices -
since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to set their prices
freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal depreciation of
the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed from a larger
than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a slowdown in the
growth of revenues.
10.      In 1985 inflation declined considerably -- the average annual rate of
increase in the WPI fell to 43.2 percent, after reaching a very high level in
the first quarter of 1985 (about 60 percent as of March 1985). By
December 1985, the month-over-month change in the WPI (i.e. December 1985 over
Decemer 1984) had correspondingly declined to 38.3 percent and by
October 1986 it had dipped even further, dropping to about 28 percent.
Factors causing the high inflation rate in the first quarter of 1985 were the
introduction of a value added tax (VAT) in January 1985 and continued
substantial increases in the prices of several key intermediate goods and
inputs. Thereafter, several factors combined to lower inflationary
pressures: (i) monetary growth slowed, particularly in the fourth quarter,
with H2 growth declining from an annual rate of 64 percent as of
September 1985 to 53 percent at year-end; (ii) by April 1985 most of the
catch-up increases in the prices of SEE products appeared to have been



- 4 -
completed and the rate of price adjustment abated considerably; (iii) the
significant slide of the dollar, which started after March 1985, resulted in a
slowing down of the nominal depreciation of the Turkish lira against the
dollar and therefore in smaller increases in prices of imported products than
were witnessed in 1983-84; (iv) the persistence of high real interest rates
(which increased as inflation declined) helped to channel iiquidity towards
savings rather than consumption and thus lowered aggregate demand; and
(v) lower exports of certain agricultural products (cereals and pulses) meant
that the domestic market was well supplied, thus easing inflationary pressures
on food prices. The steady deceleration in the inflation rate reinforces the
expectation that the Government's target rate of 25 percent for 1986 could be
achieved, particularly considering the large decline in world oil prices since
January 1986, and the continued weakening of the dollar relative to other
international currencies.
11.      In the fiscal area, progress has been uneven- During 1980-82 the
budget deficit declined from 5.3 to 1.7 percent of GTIP, but increased to
almost 5 percent of GNP in 1984, due mainly to a disappointing performance in
raising tax revenues. In 1985, however, the budget deficit is estimated to
have been TL 621 billion or 2.2 percent of GNP, a significant improvement over
1984. This is largely because the Government took several measures in 1985 to
increase revenues, the most important of which was the introduction of VAT.
In its first year, VAT collections amounted to about TL 1 trillion,
significantly above the target. Other tax measures which were adopted
included substantial increases in various fixed charges and duties and large
increases in penalties for overdue tax payments. As a result of these
measures, budget revenues rose from 15.4 percent of GNP in 1984 to
16.9 percent in 1985, and are estimated at over 18 percent of GNP in 1986,
reversing the downward trend in revenues over the previous three years.
Government expenditures decreased from 20.3 percent of GNP in 1984 to an
estimated 19.2 percent in 1985, but have increased in 1986 to an estimated
20.5 percent of GNP.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system. Since 1981, interest rates on time deposits at
commercial banks have been positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding a positive real return since early 1984. Positive deposit interest
rates have resulted in a steady growth in deposits, about 10 percent per annum
in real terms in 1984 and 1985. Improvements in incentives for savings were
accompanied by administrative reforms of the banking system, the enactment of
a new banking law, and measures to revitalize the capital market.
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 60 to 80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the impact of high liquidity and reserve requirements, the option which
commercial banks have to invest in high-yielding government bonds, and high
intermediation costs. The Government took a number of steps in 1985 to reduce
the interest rate differentials between preferential and non-preferential
credits: in particular, the preferential interest rate for export credits was
discontinued in January 1985, while, during the year, interest rates for
larger agricultural loans and for loans to SEEs were increased from 28 and
22 percent to 34 and 35 percent, respectively. The narrowing of the gap
between interest rates on preferential and non-preferential credits, together
with the decrease effected in the amount of preferential credits, is expected
to increase the general availability of credit and exert a downward pressure
on non-preferential interest rates.



- 5 -
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.4 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $0.9 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982. In
1983 the current account deficit increased to $1.9 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion. Remittances, too, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 19 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports grew by more than 16 percent to reach $10.3 billion. As a
result of these developments, both the trade and the current account deficits
declined as compared to 1983. 1985 witnessed a further strong improvement of
the balance of payments situation. Merchandise exports grew by 12 percent (in
dollar terms) in 1985, while merchandise imports increased by 9 percent.
Among the iavisibles, tourism revenues and investment income from abroad
increased significantly compared to 1984 and previous years. Workers'
remittances, on the other hand, declined by 5 percent. The current account
deficit in 1985 is estimated at about $1.0 billion, or about 1.9 percent of
GNP. In 1986, the current account deficit is expected to widen to about
$1.5 billion as a result of the rapid growth of capital goods imports and a
decline of exports to both the Middle East as well as the OECD market.
15.     Merchandise export performance was impressive throughout the 1980-85
period, during which exports registered an average annual rate of increase of
about 21 percent in dollar terms. This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of exports to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods and textiles, have risen from 32 percent of total exports in 1980 to
more than 72 percent in 1985. These results were achieved by a combination of
indirect measures (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization) as
well as direct measures (tax rebates, preferential credits) to enhance the
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.     On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the volume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased substantially. The increase was
most pronounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and consumer goods)
that have been subjected to major liberalization through a lowering of tariff
rates and a significant removal of quantitative restrictions.  In 1985, as
domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of pent-up demand for
importables released by import liberalization weakened, the rate of import
growth decreased to about one-half of the level recorded in 1984. While total
imports are expected to fall in 1986 due to the oil price decline, non-oil
import growth is estimated to have accelerated, led particularly by the rise
in capital goods imports.
Mediun-Term Prospects
17.     The Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand National Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces. The public



- 6 -
sector is targeted to play a supportive role by concentrating its investments
in infrastructure rather than manufacturing, while the private sector is to be
encouraged to play a leading role in the growth of manufacturing and exports.
Some of the key targets are:
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989; and
(v)    a decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear somewhat
ambitious and likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public
sector) as well as have an adverse impact on the external balance.
Accordingly, the Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that
they remain compatible with the fight against inflation and with a growth
strategy comensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.      The recent decline in international oil prices has significantly
reduced Turkey's oil import bill in 1986 and has beer, instrumental in reducing
inflation and generating a rapid rate of output growth. However, the reduced
purchasing power of Turkey's oil exporting trading partners has resulted in a
sharp decline of exports to these countries, to a large extent offsetting the
gains from reduced oil imports. Over the medium term, Turkey's success at
continuing its export drive will depend on its ability to substitute exports
from the Middle East to other developing countries and to sustain its export
growth to the OECD market. Given the uncertainty associated with the oil
price and export projections and in order to emphasize inflation control and a
greater build-up of foreign exchange reserves, we have been cautious in
revisiog GDP growth targets significantly at this time.
20.      The Bank's projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.6 percent p.a. on
average for the 1986-90 period. Following the rapid GNP growth experienced in
1986, relatively slower growth is forseen initially before some acceleration
in the outer years. The inflaticn targets in the Bank's projections are also
more conservative compared to the Plan targets, implying a reduction from
about 43 percent in 1985 to around 18 percent in 1990. Key economic variables
in the Bank's projections for the period 1986-90 are presented in Table 1.

21.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment of about 3.9 percent p.a. on average for the
1987-90 period. In light of the developments in 1985 and 1986, this implies a
much tighter control of public investment. The comparable figure for the
growth of private fixed investment is 10.6 percent p.a. The projections allow
for a modest increase of per capita consumption of slightly above 3.0 percent
p.a. on average over the period 1987-90.
22.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
6.9 percent per annum in real terms during 1987-90. This assumes the
maintenance of a realistic exchange rate, further import liberalization and
the ability of Turkish exporters to take advantage of higher expected growth
in the OECD market. Merchandise imports are projected to grow at an average
annual rate of about 6 percent. This is consistent with the import
liberalization program of the Government. On these assumptions, the current
account deficit is projected at $1.1 billion in 1990 as compared to an
estimated 1985 figure of $1,013 million. The projected capital account would
remain manageable throughout the period, even in the face of some sharp
increases in amortization payments arising from the debts rescheduled during
1978-80.
23.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a decline in interest rates, the GNP
growth projected in the medium-term base case scenario could be exceeded if
export growth is higher than assumed and there is an improvement in the
mobilization of public resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a downside risk case has also been developed. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of under 5 percent p.a. over the
1987-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources (3 percent
lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would lead to a
more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a lower GDP
growth and a higher debt service ratio. In such a situation the Government
would have less chance of absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the
average standard of living. However, if the Government in such circumstances
were to resort to a high growth strategy, then it could witness a repeat of
the situation which prevailed in the 1970s which led to a debt crisis. It is
unlikely that the Governrent would risk such a situation. It is therefore
more probable - even if exogenous developments are unfavorable - that the
Government would continue with the structural adjustment program as
implemented to date.

External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources - OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks nave outstripped those from official sources and have
reached an estimated level of $2.4 billion by end-1985. Of the estimated
total debt outstanding of $25.4 billion (including IMP) at end-1985, medium
and long-term debt accounted for about 74 percent. Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to an estimated 26 percent in 1985. Much
of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is due to the inflows
associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme. I/ At end-1985, the outstanding
liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme amounted to $2.7 billion,
constituting 40 percent of short-term external obligations. Inf lows from the
Dresdner scheme have been steadily growing with few withdrawals, which is
clearly a reflection of increased confidence in the Government's economic
policies. The Government is sensitive, however, to the build-up of short-term
debt and intends to limit its share of total debt in the medium term. Based
on the growth scenario outlined in paras. 19-2i, debt outstanding and
disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an estimated
46 percent in 1985 to 43 percent in 1990. This translates into a forecast of
total debt outstanding in 1990 of $34 billion, with short-term debt
constituting about 26 percent of the total.
26-      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estima,ed 31 percent in 19S-5, mostly as a
result of Large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due-  Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.3 billion a year durinig
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt. However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
about 25 perceut in 1990, due largely to the projected rate of export growth.
The debt burden should remain manageable provided current policies are
successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained, and Turkey continues
to receive support from international commercial and official sources.
Confidence in Turkey's overall economic performance, its stable record in
meeting debt servicing obligations and its improved debt management,
encouraged commercial banks to commit about $1.9 billion of medium-term
credits in 1985. Through August 1986, about half of the $1.5 billion borrowed
from comnmrcial banks consisted of medium and long-term loans. Several major
Zmerican, European, Japanese and Middle Eastern banks have been involved in
these operations.
lf Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits f-om Turkish workers
in West Germany and auttomatically places these funds at the disposition of
the Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an
interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market rate.



- 10 -
27.     Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government did not ask for
a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the view
that the favorable economic developments in 1985 indicate that Turkey has
"graduated" from the IMF's program and that the IMF presence through
Article IV consultations and periodic staff visits to review the economic
performance should suffice for purposes of maintaining international
confidence.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.     Through September 30. 1986 the Bank and IDA have lent
$7,398.4 million 1/ to Turkey, through 103 projects. Agriculture accounts for
21 percent of the funds lent, industry and DFCs for 21 percent, power for
18 percent, structural adjustment and program loans for 27 percent, and urban
development, transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for
the remaining 14 percentt. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged
63 percent of appraisal estimates at the end of September 1986, which compares
favorably with other countries in the region. As of September 30, 1986, IFC
comiitents to Turkey totalled about $256 millicn, of which about $81 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a sizmuary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1986.
29.     Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Go-rernment has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was completed in June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program. Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current Five Year Plan involves the broadening and deepening
of the adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments
have underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
without giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of
Bank lending in the post-SAL period will continue to be on striking an
appropriate balance between sectaral adjustment lending designed in part to be
quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and
carefully formulated project lending focussing on high priority projects
principally in the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
30.     A series of sectoral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
plnned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. A financial sector adjustment loan approved in June 1986 is the
second of the series. Further lending of this kind would support measures to
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans are likely to be developed include energy and transport, and
it is expected that there would be a follow-up loan in agriculture.
1/ Net of cancellations.



- 11 -
31.      Project lending, which would continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, would be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. Some project lending would be earmarked for the construction or
rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would be
guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation cf foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
32.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
33.      This would be the third loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors in this fiscal year. Other proposed loans being processed include
water supply and sewerage and urban development projects, and an energy sector
adjustment loan.
34.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1986-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 14 percent in 1984, is estimated at 14.4 percent in 1985, and is
expected to grow to about 18 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to about $14 billion in 1989
and private medium and long-term debt outsL iding is projected to increase
from $5.2 billion in 1984 to $7 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of
total debt service payments is projected to increase from about 13 percent in
1984, to about 17 percent in 1989.
PART OII- NON FORMAL VOCATIONAL TRAING
35.      Turkey's economic development strategy adopted in 1980 entails giving
an increased role to market forces and promoting export-oriented industries,
particularly in the private sector. This strategy, with its emphasis on
improving industrial efficiency, has major implications for human resource
development. In the process of supporting and modernizing export-oriented and
technology based industries, constraints posed by shortages of skilled and
technical manpower can result in a slower rate of innovation, problems in
quality control, poor plant maintenance, and hence lower levels of
productivity. Manpower projections prepared for the Industrial Schools
Project (Loan 2536-TU) show that the supply from the formal vocational school
system will meet approximately 86 percent of the estimated labor demand for
skilled and semi-skilled manpower in the industry sector over the period
1985-95. The combined output from the industrial schools and the
apprenticeship training system, even after the strengthening of the latter
under the proposed project, would still fall short of the projected demand for
skilled industrial manpower over the same period.



- 12 -
36.      Turkey's structural adjustment program has placed a premium on the
retraining of workers to match the requirements of the priority sectors, e.g.
export industries. Inadequate skill levels have been identified as a key
ingredient in the country's unemployment problem. A manpower survey conducted
in 1984 by the State Institute of Statistics (SIS) showed that approximately
half of the total registered urban unemployed have only primary education or
less. By contrast, the second lowest rate of 'uemployment (7 percent) was
found to be amongst the graduates of the vocational training schools run by
the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOE). At present, 45 percent of
pupils drop out at the end of primary education. Projections suggest that by
1990 less than 60 percent of the 12-17 age group will be in school. These
children lack the basic skills which would allow them to gain employment, and
given their limited general education, many well be only semi-literate. The
MOE has launched three major initiatives to address some of these problems.
In 1980, a major literacy campaign was undertaken, aimed at the active
population between the ages of 14 and 44 with emphasis on women, slum dwellers
and agricultural workers. The MOE also provides complementary courses to
upgrade education levels. In addition, for people lacking functional and
employable skills, such as school dropouts, the MOE provides vocational
training to enhance their ability to achieve gainful employment. The
Non-Formal Vocational Training (NFVT) program is designed to provide the
flexibility in course offerings, levels of training, duration and location of
training necessary to address specific needs of these disadvantaged target
groups.
37.      The General Directorate of Apprenticeship and Non Formal Education
(GDANE) within the MOE is the main agency responsible for providing NFVT in
Tlurkey. This Directorate oversees a network of 59 Apprenticeship Training
Centers (ATCs) and 651 Public Training Centers. The apprenticeship system
provides training in about 40 trades for eight hours per week for two to four
years, depending upon specialization. The Public Training Centers offer
courses of 4 to 8 months duration in about 150 trades. GDANE also ensures
coordination within the MOE and with other public and private bodies
counducting similar activities. Formal pre-service vocational training is
provided through a network of industrial, commercial and tourism vocational
schools.
38.      In 1985, some 900,000 persons participated in intensive NFVT
courses. This degree of participation reflects a strong commitment by both
the Government and trainees and has significant benefits for the economy. A
number of areas have been identified in the recently issued Education and
Training Sector Survey 1/ for improving the effectiveness of the NFVT system.
Expansion of the apprenticeship training system, improving the quality of
instructors through in-service training, improving the quality and relevance
of curricula currently used in NFVT and provision of appropriate equipment and
pedagogical materials in these institutions are some of the critical needs of
this subsector that the proposed project is designed to address.

The Bank's Role in Edueation and VocationalTrinin
39.     The previous three Bank loans in the education sector have supported
Turkey's industrial training program. The first Education Project of
$13.5 million (748-TU) signed in 1971 assisted 32 four-year formal industrial
schools, the Technical Teacher Training College in Ankara, the Educational
Science Equipment Center, and the Education, Film, Radio and Television
Center. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) No. 4018 (dated June 28,
1982) noted the good educational impact of the project, with enrollments
reaching the levels as anticipated at appraisal. While serious problems were
noted in the design and construction of new buildings, these issues are not
relevant to the current project which does not include construction of new
facilities. The PPAR also noted the difficulties encountered as a result of
the lack of a project implementation unit (PIU). A PIU established in the MOE
under the Industrial Schools Project (Loan 2536-TU) is now functioning well
and will be strengthened further in the proposed project. The second loan of
$36.8 million was approved in 1984 for an Industrial Training Project (Loan
2399-TU), which aims at establishing post-secondary technican training under
the Council of Higher Education and providing in-service training for
technicians through the Industrial Training and Development Center. It also
includes fellowship training for staff of the State Institute of Statistics
responsible for the compilation and analysis of data. The third loan, made in
1985 for the Industrial Schools Project (Loan 2536-TU) for $57.7 million,
supports priority industrial training programs by assisting 39 industrial
schools and by strengthening the capacity of the MOE to manage the vocational
training system. Implementation of both of these projects is proceeding
satisfactorily.
40.     As the manpower requirements of a modernized industrial sector as
well as the problems of unemployment have increasingly become a priority for
the Government, a broader range of skill training areas has emerged for
potential Sank lending. The Bank's recent Education and Training Sector
Survey (para 39), prepared in close colaboration with the Government,
identified as a critical issue the need to improve NFVT in order to enhance
employment opportunities for the less educated and under-privileged groups.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
41.      The proposed project was identified in September 1985 and prepared by
the Government with the assistance of a Bank preparation mission in
December, 1985. The project was appraised in April 1986. Loan negotiations
took place in Washington DC from November 3 to November 7, 1986 with a Turkish
delegation led by Mr. Hikmet Ulugbay, Chief Counselor for Economic and
Commercial Affairs of the Turkish Embassy, Washington, D.C. and including
representatives of MOE, the State Planning Organization and the
Undersecretariat of the Treasury and Foreign Trade. A report entitled "Staff
Appraisal Report - Turkey: Non-Formal Vocational Training Project" (No
6360-TU) dated November 12, 1986 is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A summary of the proposed project is provided at the
beginning of this report and Annex III contains supplementary project data.

Project Objectives
42.     The proposed project has two main objectives: (a) to increase and
improve the supply of well-trained labor for manufacturing industries; and
(b) to improve employment and income generation opportunities for
disadvantaged groups. These objectives would be achieved by improv4ng the
quality of NFVT programs and enhancing their relevance to labor market needs,
and by expanding the number of training places in various institutions such as
the Apprenticeship Training Centers (ATC) and the Public Training Centers.
Project Description
43.      The proposed project consists of the following main components:
(a) provision of training equipment and minor civil works for NFVT
institutions to re-equip 16,600 existing places and equipping of
16,300 new places within existing facilities;
(b) assistance for training program design and development, to
improve the effectiveness of the in-service instructor training
system, to strengthen vocational training programs through
improved training needs assessment, program design,
instructional materials development, skill testing and
certification, and the evaluation and development of
entrepreneurship courses; and
(c) Introduction of about 200 Production Revolving Funds (PRFs)
established for the purchase of consumable materials for NFVT
institutions.
Assistnce to NFVT Instutions
44.      To enable the MOE to respond rapidly and flexibly to changing local
and national labor market needs, the provision of training equipment and minor
works for NFVT institutions would be implemented in three phases. Under the
proposed approach, each phase would include several sub-projects which would
mainly comprise the provision of equipment and minor works for an NFVT
institution. The MOE has already prepared the first phase program consisting
of a set of sub-projects estimated to cost about $12 million and these have
been reviewed by the Bank during appraisal. The MOE would continue to be
responsible for the identification and preparation of sub-projects for the
second and third phase, using agreed criteria (para.55). As a result of the
project, total enrollment in MOE institutions is expected to increase by about
85,000, producing some 60,000 additional graduates annually from 1994.
45.      The proposed project would also provide minor refurbishment and
training equipment to 40 Public Training Centers (see map) in the first phase,
adding about 120 more centers in its subsequent two phases. The centers
included in the first phase are located mainly in major industrial areas (301)
and in areas of eastern Turkey (70%) where availability of facilities has been
below national averages. Programs to be assisted in these centers would
increase the employability and income generation opportunities amongst groups
with

50.      To improve the employability of NFVT graduates, ODANE would develop
skill standards and certification procedures. The information collected
through training needs assessment studies would be translated into programs
conforming to industry occupational standards. National certification
standards based on objective performance criteria would be developed with the
participation of employers. The NFEI would prepare these guidelines and would
train instructors to test skills and assess performance. The proposed project
would provide technical assistance and fellowship for this component.
51.      The MOE would also develop an information system for the graduates
which would assist them in finding appropriate credit facilities and advisory
services for those who wish to start their own businesses. The proposed
project would provide specialist services to establish entrepreneurship
training courses and develop cooperative arrangements with financial and
extension organizations. In addition, 50 months of fellowship training would
be provided to MOE staff in developing entrepreneurship development programs.
52.      In order to provide feedback on the planning, design implementation
and evaluation of NFVT programs, the GDANE would conduct a mid-term evaluation
study during the third year of the project to include a follow-up of
graduates' employment experience. This study would be completed by June 30,
1990. To assist GDANE with this study, the project would provide specialist
services.
Production Revolving Funds
53.      Finally, the proposed project would establish approximately 200
Project Revolving Funds (PRFs) to include the initial purchase of materials
for production of items for sale. Production Revolving Funds are a
well-tested financial mechanism which enables training institutions to
generate additional revenues through the sale of items produced while at the
same time providing practical training experience. In 1985, a total of 520
PRFs were in operation within the MOE mainly in the industrial schools and
vocational schools for girls. MOE is now turning its attention to the
generalization of PRFs to NFVT institutions. The Government has confirmed
that PRFs will be opened or maintained with adequate financing in all
institutions assisted by the project.
jlect            on
54.      The proposed project would be implemented by the MOE under the
responsibility of the Deputy Undersecretary for Technical and Vocational
Education. The Management Committee, headed by the Deputy Undersecretary for
Technical and Vocational Education, would make the final selection of
sub-projects to be included in the second and third phases. The Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) established under the Industrial Schools Project
(Loan 2536-TU) would act as the secretariat to the Management Committee and
would serve as liason between the MOE and the Bank. The MOE, through the
provincial directorates of education, would advise individual institutions
about the requirements for sub-project identification, including the items
eligible for project financing.

limited access to formal education and training. A total of 22 existing trade
specializations, mainly in the areas of industry, income generation
activities, construction and business services would be assisted in the first
phase. The additional enrollment would be accommodated in existing training
centers or through the well-established policy of the municipalities of
providing additional buildings free of charge, where there is shortage of
workshop space.
46.      In addition, the proposed project would provide training equipment to
18 ATCs in the first phase (see map) and to some 36 additional centers in its
subsequent two phases. In selecting the 18 ATCs of the first phase,
particular attention was given by the MOE to the links of ATCs with
surrounding industries and regional development requirements. A total of 6
trade specializations (metal machining, automotive, wood working, metal
working, electrical and electronics) would be supported in the first phase,
which would directly serve the needs of the major export industries. These
are the basic trade specializations which are most needed in the respective
regions where the ATCs are located. The demand for this type of training is
consequently very high.
47.      The proposed project would also provide minor refurbishment and
training equipment to 3 Adult Technical Training Centers (ATICs), 10
CommercelTourism Training Centers (CTTCs) and 3 Women's Training Centers
(UTCs) in the first phase (see map) and to some additional 6 ATTCs, 20 CTTCs
and 15 WTCs in the next two phases. These institutions are similar to Public
Training Centers but with somewhat different emphasis with regard to the
curriculum and types of students attracted. In order to assist the MOE with
the complex procurement needs for the estimated 270 NFVT institutions (in a
large number of trade specializations), the project would include one
procurement specialist and fellowships for 2 procurement officers. The
procurement specialist will be appointed by October 1987.
Tfraiing Program Design and Development
48.     The proposed project will include technical assistance to design an
improved program of in-service training for instructors and to enhance the
skills of existing instructor trainers. In-service instructor training would
be organized in each trade specialization in selected NFVT centers. In order
to upgrade, organize and coordinate the in-service training courses run by
GD&NE, the proposed project would finance expert services including the design
of in-service training programs for instructors in entrepreneurship
development. In addition, the proposed project would finance fellowship
training for 40 key instructor training staff in specific skill areas,
including in-service training program design and entrepreneurship development.
49.     In order to assist the NFVT program with training needs surveys to
increase the relevance of training programs to labor market needs, the
proposed project would provide one specialist. The NFEI would update existing
programs and prepare new ones and would provide relevant staff training. The
project would also finance one specialist in program design and necessary
fellowship training to study both training needs assessment and program
design- The proposed project would also assist GDANE to develop local
expertise in developing instructional materials, including training modules.
To strengthen its capacity in this area, the project would include one
curriculum specialist and finance 80 months of fellowship training.

55.      The main directorates within the Department of Technical and
Vocational Education would appraise and review individual sub-project requests
for the second and third phases of the Project, using the criteria agreed upon
with the Bank which were applied in the selection of subprojects for the first
phase. These criteria incluLde eligibility, feasibility, and the economic and
financial criteria to be applied. For the next two phases, the PIU acting as
the secretariat of the Management Committee would send the proposals to the
Bank for approval two and four years, respectively, into the life of the
project. The Bank would review these proposals to ensure compliance with the
agreed criteria, and would monitor sub-project appraisal and selection
processes. The Bank would selectively review progress in carrying out
sub-projects to ensure that implementation has proceeded in accordance with
sub-project appraisals.
56.      in addition to the functions outlined above, the functions of the PIU
would primarily be those of coordinating the work of implementing departments,
monitoring progress, keeping project accounts and liaising with the Bank. In
addition, the PIU would be responsible for procurement of goods and services,
including technical assistance. The existing Project Implementation Unit
will be strengthened and maintained in accordance with an agreed staffing plan
and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (see para 47).
Projet Costs and Financing
57.      Project costs are estimated at $71.1 million equivalent, including
about $0.2 million of taxes and duties for civil works. The proposed loan of
$58.5 million would finance 100 percent of the estimated foreign exchange
component or about 82 percent of total project costs, with remaining costs
(US$12.6 million) financed by the Government. A physical contingency
allowance of 10 percent ($2.0 million) has been added to all project items in
the first phase. Price contingencies amounting to $18.0 million equivalent,
or 33.9 percent of base cost plus physical contingencies, assume international
inflation rates of 6.8 percent in 1987 and 1988, 7 percent in 1989,
721 percent in 1990, and 4 percent thereafter. While local costs in TL are
expected to increase at a faster rate, it is assumed that the Government will
maintain current exchange rate policies which compensate for differences
between local and foreign price escalations. Total contingencies are $20.0
million or about 39 percent of the base cost. Equipment and goods imported
for use by the Government ministries are exempt from taxes and duties.
Technical assistance costs for consulting services and fellowships include
salaries, housing, relocation costs, subsistence, office services, language
training and overheads.
58.      Recurrent costs in NFVT are very low and the incremental recurrent
costs generated by the proposed expansion are expected to be approximately
$1.4 million equivalent by 1994. This represents approximately 6 percent of
the ME recurrent budget spent on NFVT in 1985 and 0.2 percent of the entire
MOE budget in that year. However, it is estimated that the profits generated
by all the PRFs opened through the project would amount to $1.1 million
equivalent and would therefore cover at least 75% of the estimated additional
recurrent costs generated by the project.

Procurement and Disbursement
59.     Procurement (other than for technical assistance and training) would
be carried out on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines, except for:
(a) Refurbishment of existing centers, (mainly PTCs) and
installation of equipment, estimated to cost a total of $1.8
million would be carried out by the Directorate of Investment,
Establishment and Building Services in the MOE, under force
account.
(b) Contracts for equipment estimated to cost less than $150,000
equivalent each, which in the aggregate would not exceed $5.0
million and which would not be expected to interest foreign
suppliers because of the variety of items in each contract,
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally, using local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
(c)  Sundry items not exceeding $50,000 in each contract, to an
aggregate amount of $1.1 million equivalent, would be purchased
locally on the basis of three quotations, in accordance with the
local procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank.
(d) Acquisition of technical books and modules of instructional
materials estimated to cost $1.7 million (including copyright
and royalty payments) would be through negotiations with
publishers. Government financed translation and printing would
be carried out by the Ministry's own facilities.
(e) Government financed consumable materials for the PREFs, to an
aggregate amount of $2.8 million, would be procured through
local shopping requiring at least three quotations in accordance
with local procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Contracts for equipment would be grouped as much as possible to form bidding
packages attractive to suppliers. Technical assistance would be tendered as a
comprehensive package in order to ensure an integrated approach to training
systems development. This contract would be awarded in accordance with Bank
procedures. Table 2 depicts the procurement arrangements for the proposed
project.
60.     The proposed loan would be disbursed against:  (i) 100l   of foreign
expenditure on directly imported equipment and instructional materials and for
copyright and royalty payments to permit books and instructional materials to
be reproduced in Turkey; (ii) 100X of local expenditures (ex-factory) for
equipment and instructional materials procured through ICB; (iii) 651 of
expenditures on other locally procured equipment; and (iv) 100% of
expenditures for consultants services and overseas training. The project is
expected to close by December 31, 1995. Disbursements against contracts for
goods and services exceeding $200,000 equivalent would be made against normal



- 19 -
documentation. Disbursements against contracts below that level and for force
account work would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE6)
available for examination by Bank missions. In order to facilitate timely
project implementation, a Special Account, with an initial deposit of
$3 million, representing about four months projected disbursements during the
peak year of disbursement, would be established in the Central Bank of Turkey.

Accounting and Audit
61.      The PIU would maintain separate accounts for the project in
accordance with acceptable accounting practice and would prepare a detailed
statement at the end of each quarter reflecting project expenditures during
the period. Within 45 days after the end of each quarter, the PIU would
submit copies of these statements to the Bank to facilitate supervision.
Project accounts (including the Special Account) would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with Bank
Guidelines. The Bank would be provided, within six months of the end of each
fiscal year, with an audit report, including a separate opinion by the auditor
on disbursements against a certified statement of expenditures.

Benefits and Risks
62.      The proposed project would make a valuable contribution towards
meeting critical skilled manpower shortages which constrain economic growth in
key sectors such as manufacturing industries. It would significantly improve
the quantity and quality of basic skill training, enhancing employment and
income generating opportunities for low income and disadvantaged groups,
including out-of-school youth and unemployed adults.
63.      The major quantifiable benefit of the proposed project, when fully
operational, would be an annual output of 60,000 additional semi-skilled
workers with industrial and service skills. In addition, the proposed project
would strengthen vital services and programs in the areas of instructor
training, needs assessment, program design, skill testing and certification,
entrepreneurship courses and evaluation, through the provision of relevant
technical assistance. The income generated through PRFs will reduce the cost
of financing NFVT for the Government.
64.      There is some risk that the preparation of subprojects for the second
and third phases of the project may be delayed. However, the MOE has
successfully identified, prepared and appraised the first phase of the
project. Therefore, the risk is considered minimal.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
66.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank. I recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
