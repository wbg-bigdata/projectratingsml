./ The metric system has been used in most cases. However, India is still
in the process of transition to the metric system; non-metric units are
still widely used and have been used in this report where a conversion
to the metric system may confuse the reader.

WEST BENGAL MINOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                     India, acting by its President (GOI).
Beneficiary:                  Government of West Bengal (GOWB).
Amount:                       IDA Credit: SDR 101 million (US$99 million
equivalent).
Terms:                        Standard.
On-lendina Terms:             From the Government of India to the
Government of West Bengal as part of central
assistance for State development projects on
terms and conditions applicable at the time.
GOI would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Proiect Description:          The proposed project would comprise a five
year program for upgrading and constructing
public tubevell irrigation systems, open
dugwells, and riverlift installations. It
would support construction of about:
(i) 3,400 deep tubewells (DTWs); (ii) 5,400
shallow tubevells; and (iii) 10,000 open
dugwells (ODWs). It would finance also
completion of the distribution systems of
about 200 riverlift installations (RLIs),
improvements to management and agricultural
extension services. The project would raise
agricultural production and the standard of
living of small and marginal farmers in West
Bengal. The level of capacity utilisation of
existing minor irrigation works suggests that
there is an apparent risk of inadequate
farmer response. Hovever, the present lack
of demand for irrigation water is primarily
due to the poor quality of the irrigation
service offered. Under the proposed project,
the risk is minimized through the application
of proven designs of works and improved
technology which would ensure the provision
of a reliable, timely and equitable irriga-
tion service.

INDIA
WEST BENGAL MINOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
Staff ADpraisal Report
I. BACKGROUND
General
1.01    The State of West Bengal (WB), located in the northeastern part of
India, is generally well endowed with both surface water and groundwater
resources. Irrigation is necessary for crop production during the dry season
and to stabilize production in the wet season. Under WB conditions, minor
irrigation schemes have generally lower unit area costs, shorter gestation
periods and provide more reliable sources of irrigation water than major and
medium irrigation developments. Furthermore, minor irrigation development
based on groundwater is not subject to many of the water distribution and
management problems encountered with major and medium surface water schemes.
Storage is provided naturally, conveyance from well to field is generally
over short distances, water can be tapped and delivered to farmers' fields
quickly, and irrigation is timely. Similar attributes can be described to
minor irrigation schemes based on secure surface water supplies such as river
lift schemes. Consequently, GOWB has placed great emphasis on minor irriga-
tion development, using all appropriate technologies ranging from low dis-
charge tubewells to high discharge tubewells and river-lift schemes. The
proposed West Bengal Minor Irrigation Project would support this development
strategy.
Mtriculture and Irritation in India
1.02    A detailed review is given in "Economic Situation and Prospects of
India", IBRD Report No. 4962-IN, April, 1984. India has a population of
about 750 M (mid-1984) which is growing at an annual rate of 2.0%. Since
1960, per capita income grew at an annual rate of 1.4% and has reached
US$260. Although the average per capita income has increased and access to
public services has improved, growth has been too slow to bring about more
than a gradual reduction in the incidence of poverty. Accordingly, GOI's
development plans give priority to alleviating poverty and creating employ-
ment, especially in rural areas.
1.03    Agriculture is a dominant sector of the Indian economy and con-
tributes about 33% of GNP (in 1981/82). It engages about 70% of the labor
force and provides the base for about 45Z of India's exports. During the
last decade, GOI has devoted considerable attention to agriculture in its
development plans. To support agricultural growth, GOI has: (i) accelerated
irrigation development through modernization of existing surface water
schemes and construction of new schemes; (ii) supported minor irrigation
development, particularly that based on groundwater, through direct public
intervention and through support of the long term credit system for private
use; and (iii) improved agricultural supporting services to optimize the use
of land and water resources.
1.04    Irrigation was given the highest priority from the beginning of the
planning era in 1950. Some 57.0 N ha were developed by 1980/81, about 58% of
which was from surface sources and 42% from groundwater; in recent years,



-2-
irrigated area has been expanding by about 2-3 M ha annually. Irrigated
areas are almost four times as productive as rainfed areas and account for
about 60X of all agricultural output in India. More significantly, expansion
of irrigation facilities and increased productivity on irrigated lands have
together accounted for at least three-quarters of the agricultural growth
since 1960. With little idle land left, only limited increase is expected in
the net sown area in the future. The main increase in agricultural produc-
tion will come from maximization of the irrigation potential by new develop-
ment and from full utilization of the potential in areas already developed
for irrigation, from double cropping, improvements in agricultural practices,
water management and in the use of agricultural inputs.
1.05    Groundwater development has been impressive over the last two to
three decades. The rate of creation of irrigation potential from groundwater
increased from 0.5 M ha p.a. by the end of the Fourth Plan (1968/69-1973/74)
to 1.1 ri ha p.a. in 1977/78. At present, net groundwater extraction within
India is estimated to be about one-half of mean annual recharge. The bulk
of future groundwater development must occur in the Eastern Region of India
where only about one-third of the ultimate potential has been developed. Of
the 3.5 M ha of groundwater irrigation developed during the Fifth Plan
(1973-78), about 2.2 M ha, or 62Z, were in the Eastern Region. The growth
rate of area irrigated by groundwater in the Eastern Region during this
period was 6.5% p.a. compared with 3X p.a. in the rest of India.
The State of West Bengal
1.06    Salient Features.  The State has a geographical area of about
87,850 m' and the population is about 50 M giving a population density
(570/km ) second only to Kerala within the union. The State thus contains
some 8% of India's populati 2n on only 2.7Z of its land. The agricultural
land covers about 57,000 km or 65Z of the total land surface of the State
with a rural population reported at 40 H. Most owner farmers in WB have land
holdings snich are, even by Indian standards, very small and, moreover,
extremely fragmented; there is also a high proportion of tenant farmers.
These conditions limit the opportunities for irrigation development based on
institutional credit.
1.07    The Economy.  Although the State of West Bengal is an important
industrial base of the eastern region of India, its economy is dominated by
agriculture which contributes about 40% to the State income and employs 75Z
of the labor force. The growth of the primary sector, including agriculture,
forestry and mining was less then 1.0Z per annum (p.a.) compared to an
all-India average of 2.0X. The secondary sector including jute, cotton and
tea processing industries, manufacturing, construction, electricity and
communication grew only at 1.9Z p.a., which was about half the national rate
of 3.9Z p.a. The service sector of the economy which is concentrated mainly
in and around Calcutta has contributed marginally to the vell being of the
majority of the population (80Z) living in the rural areas.
1.08    EmRloyment and Rural Poverty.  The labor force constitutes about 28%
of the WE population and cultivators and agricultural laborers constitute
about 18% and 27% of the total labor force respectively. Productive employ-
ment has not kept pace with population growth. It is estimated that 70% of
the population of WB live below the poverty level and are mainly concentrated



-3-
in the rural areas. The State land reform program aims to redistribute land
from larger farms and co register sharecroppers to establish tenants' rights.
However, implementation of the program has proved difficult.
1.09    Public Services.  The literacy rate in WB is about 41% as compared
to the national average of 36%. Availability of beds in hospitals, health
centres and clinics is about one per 758 head of the population. About 87Z
of all villages are located less than 2 km from a public water supply
provided by a dug well, tubewell or standpipe. Although the State is well
connected to the rest of India through national highways, railways and air-
ways, the intra-state communication is inadequate. The Ganges, which divides
the State, was formerly an obstruction to transport, but the Farakka Barrage
now carries both road and railway across the river.
1.10    Agricultural Production Trends (Table T-1).  About 5.7 M ha of the
State are cultivated. Paddy accounts for 92% of the cropped area and about
88% of the State's food grain production (9.0 H tons) making it the fourth
largest rice producer in India. Nevertheless, about 2.0 H tons of grain are
imported annually into WB, mainly for the 8.0 M population of Calcutta. The
State accounts for 60% of the country's jute andt25% of its tea and these two
crops are WB's most valuable agricultural exports. Production of food grains
(rice and wheat) increased at about 3.5Z p.a. to 7.4 M tons over the decade
1964-74. The greatest growth period in grain production was between 1967
and 1972 when a growth rate of 6% p.a. occurred and fertilizer consumption
increased at a rate of 20% p.a. The growth coincided with a GOWB drive to
expand minor irrigation and to introduce high yielding varieties (HYV) of
rice and wheat. The increases in grain production came mainly from irrigated
rabi crops while rainf.d production remained static. Since the early 1970's,
food grain production has fluctuated about 7.3 M tons p.a. due to variations
of monsoon rainfall and the incidence of droughts and destructive floods.
Productions of coarse grains (barley and maize) and of pulses and millets
have generally decreased over the past decade, while production of oilseeds
has more than doubled. Among vegetables, potato has recently shown the most
significant production growth rate, with an increase of about 80% above
1971-72 level.
1.11    Irrigation Develonment.  Although mean annual rainfall in the
southern districts of the plains ranges from 1,125 mm to 1,875 mm, it is
often poorly distributed in the wet season and there is considerable
inter-annual variation. Irrigation is therefore necessary for crop produc-
tion during the dry season and to stabilize production in the wet season.
The State is well endowed with both surface water and groundwater resources,
but only about 1.65 M ha (about 29Z of the cultivated areas) receive irriga-
tion. About 1.0 M ha are irrigated under major and medium surface irrigation
schemes mainly to supplement monsoon rainfall since storages are generally
lacking and rivers originating on the Central Indian Plateau have low dry
season flows. About 0.65 M ha are served by tubewells and river lift instal-
lations which provide most of the year round irrigation. The distribution of
the statewide minor irrigation development by districts is given in Table
T-2. Most public sector facilities were constructed in the decade ending
1974-75 and generally performance has been unsatisfactory. Emphasis has been
on constructing the water source (tubevell or river lift pumping station)
rather than completing the distribution systems. Even for completed schemes,
the implementation period has often been excessive.



-4-
1.12    The private sector development of minor irrigation in WB through
institutional credit has been less successful than in most other States of
India because most land holdings are small and fragmented and there is a high
proportion of tenant farmers. These conditions make access to the long-term
credit system extremely difficult, if not impossible to such farmers. In
fact, institutional credit records show a continuing decline in lending for
minor irrigation in recent years in both fiscal and physical terms in spite
of large subsidies (para 2.19).
1.13    Power Supply and Demand.  Power supply in WB is primarily provided
by the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) with the Calcutta Electric
Supply Company (CESC) responsible for power supply to the Calcutta area.
WBSEB has a total installed capacity of about 1200 MW from various generating
stations; it is also interconnected with the grids of the neighboring States
of Orissa, Bihar, Assam and Sikkim. While the combined capacity available
between CESC and WBSEB should be adequate to meet load demands of Calcutta
and the rest of WB, restrictions through load shedding and rostering are
often enforced. However, energy consumption for agricultural purposes repre-
sents only 3% of total consumption and thus, WBSEB can give priority to the
agricultural sector without materially affecting the power supply to other
users. Endeavors are also being made to improve generation capacity and new
projects of about 1,460 MW are scheduled to be commissioned between 1984-89.
The energy is transmitted through some 4,185 km of ERV transmission (220 to
33 kV) lines and an extensive 11 kV network throughout the State. Presently
only about one-third of the villages has electric power. The Bank Group has
participated in augmenting power supply in WB through the Farakka Thermal
Power Project (Cr. 1053-IN; 1980). In addition, the Bank Group is supporting
rural electrification in WB through the Third Rural Electrification Project
(Loan No. 2165; 1982), a line of credit to the Rural Electrification Corpora-
tion (REC).
Bank Group 0perations in West Bengal
1.14    The Bank Group has supported minor irrigation development i- WB in
both the private and public sectors. The West Bengal Agricultural Develop-
ment Project (Cr. 541-IN; 1975) financed private and public groundwater
development and construction of public river lift irrigation schemes. WB
also benefitted from the four all-India ARDC line of credit projects (Cr.
540-IN; 1975; Cr. 715-IN; 1977; Cr. 947-IN; 1979; and Cr. 1209-IN; 1982)
which provided institutional credit for minor irrigation development, and
other on-farm improvements in physical infrastructure and farm equipment.
The on-going WB Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Cr. 690-IN;
1977) is designed to strengthen agricultural supporting services. In addi-
tion, the Bank (i) supports the WB Social Forestry Project (Credit 1178-IN;
1982) which is primarily designed to increase fuel wood supplies on both
private lands and degraded forest areas; and (ii) has appraised and super-
vises the Sundarban Development Project (IFAD Loan 49-IN; 1981) on behalf of
IFAD.
1.15    A predominant problem area with Bank-supported projects over the last
decade relates to organization improvements, staffing and administrative
supporting services (para 2.16). Government employees are strongly organized
in unions and staff associations, and with unemployment levels in the State,
staff resist any change that directly or indirectly may affect career
prospects or job security; organization changes can be challenged (and may be



-5-
hindered) by staff appealing to the courts for an injunction; such staff
action has caused delays to Bank-supported projects. A consequence of staff-
ing problems has been delays by GOWB in financing project works and, in
particular, admi.-istrative facilities such as buildings or vehicles which
depend on staff being in place to be fully utilized. In this respect, rather
than build and maintain buildings or buy vehicles, th- preferred solution of
GOWB is either to rent or lease.  It is concluded that mu-w of tbh problems
in completed and on-going Bank-supported projects have resulted because the
above determinants were not taken into full consideration when rhose projects
were appraised. To sumarize, a problem with development pro&rams in WB is
not only to decide what should be done, but to formulate and olan taking into
account the limitations that GOWB will have to face to make organization
changes and improvements.
1.16    With respect to minor irrigation development, only the West Bengal
Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 541-IN) undertook a component (comple-
tion of river lift installations) which will be included under the project
(para 3.27). The component was a partial success because of delays in
finalizing the planning and design criteria and a final design which was less
than satisfactory, particularly with respect to the irrigation distribution
system.  The formulation and planning of the proposed project has __ken into
account the State, sector and project issues which affected other
Bank-supported operations in WB and the lessons learnt for these projects.
II. THE PROJECT AREA AND PRESENT DEVELOPMENT
Salient Features
2.01    Location.  The minor irrigation systems to be constructed under the
project would be distributed in 14 of the 16 districts of the State, exclud-
ing only the essentially urban district of Calcutta and the mainly mountain
district of Darjeeling (Map IBRD 18610). Groundwater irrigation systems
would be distributed throughout the plains area of the State with the type of
facility selected for any location being the most appropriate taking account
of hydrogeology, physiography and land availability. The river lift instal-
lations (RLIs) to be completed under the project would be located in seven of
the plains districts. The project area is therefore representative of
climatic and agronomic conditions found within the plains area.
2.02    Climate.  Climatological data for the project area are given in
Table T-3. West Bengal has a tropical monsoon climate but proximities of the
Himalayas to the north, and the Bay of Bengal to the south, have a damping
effect on climate extremes which might otherwise be expected given the
latitude and land elevation of the plains. The winter season from November
to February is cool with typical minima of about 110C. The hot season
extends from March through May when maximum temperatures are about 370C.
About 90X of the rainfall occurs during June through October with mean annual
rainfall on the plains ranging from 1125 to 1875 mm (Map IBRD 18381) and
reaching over 2,500 mm in Himalayan foothills. There is high inter-annual
and intra-annual variation in rainfall, and within the monsoon season,
periods of drought are common. Cyclonic storms can occur which produce very



-6-
high intensity rainfall accompanied by strong winds. Uncertainty regarding
the amount and distribution of rainfall makes irrigation a prerequisite for
successful crop production even during the monsoon season.
2.03    Phvsio raphv.  WB may be divided into four physiographic regions:
(i) the Himalayan foothills region; (ii) the fringe of the Central Plateau of
India; tiii) the Sundarbans; and (iv) the plains region. The Himalayan
foothills region rises abruptly from elevations of 60-90 m to 3,700 m above
m.s.l. with deep, steep sided valleys separated by ridges of high land. The
fringe region of the Central Plateau has undulating topography with hills of
varying elevation. The plains region has gentle slopes and is crossed by a
number of major rivers. The Sundarbans region is a flat, low-lying delta
dissected by numerous natural waterways and tidal creeks.
2.04    Soils.  A wide variety of soils occur within the State
(Map IBRD 18382). These include acid brown soils of the area below the
Himalayan foothills and the acid red lateritic soils of the western part of
the State. The old alluvial soils are derived from degraded Vindyan rocks
of the Western Chotanagpur Plateau in the south-central part of the State.
The new alluvial soils have been laid down by the Ganga in the central
plains, together with deltaic coastal soils of the Sundarbans region. The
alluvial soils range from poorly to highly drained, as do the deltaic coastal
soils. The brown soils of the north and the lateritic soils are typically
medium to well drained. Thickness of soil profiles are variable and soils
may be absent on steeper slopes. Some areas of saline soils occur on the
plains area and, in particular, in the deltaic zone.  Soil fertility levels
are generally high except for marginal areas near the hills.
2.05    Land Use.  The cultivated area of 5.7 x ha represents 65% of the land
surface of the State with current fallow constituting only 1-2% of that area
in any year. The reserved forest of about 1.2 M ha. (13.7Z) is less than is
required to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Cultivable waste land,
common lands, permanent pasture and barren lands total about 0.6 H ha (7U)
mainly in the Sundarbans and Plateau regions. The remaining area (16.5X)
is not available for cultivation for various reasons such as urban and vil-
lage areas and roads, etc. The cultivated area has remained essentially
stagnant since 1974 and there is little scope for future expansion.
2.06    Land Distribution and Tenure.  Rural population density (1981)
averaged about 600/kmz of agricultural land; lowest densities occur in the
northern, western and deltaic parts of the State and the highest in the
plains and eastern areas. The agricultural work force was about 8.6 M in
1981, of which 55% were cultivators and 45% agricultural laborers. According
to the Agricultural Sample Census of 1976-77, net cultivated area per
agricultural worker ranged from about 0.4 ha in Hooghly district to about
0.8 ha in the Terai and Plateau areas (Table T-4). An estimated 5.3 M opera-
tional holdings cover 5.0 M ha and show the following farm size distribution:
Farm Size              Z Holdinsts         X Area
Less than 0.5 ha          43.6               10.6
0.5 - 1.0 E-            22.9              17.5
1.0 - 2.0 ha            20.6              29.6
2.0 - 3.0 ha             8.1              19.9
Over 3.0 ha                4.8               22.4



-7-
Thus, farmers with less than 2 ha operate about 87Z of all holdings, but
control only 58Z of the cultivable land. In addition, fragmentation of
holdings is a serious problem. The 1976/77 census reports that typical farms
were scattered over about five fragments with an average field size of 0.2 ha
in Hooghly and 0.3 ha in W. Dinajpur. Despite progress with land tenure
legislation, many farmers are share croppers or tenants. The State land
reform program aims to redistribute land from large farms and to register all
share croppers, but implementation difficulties are great. Nonetheless, even
if all redistribution objectives in the State were achieved, the effect on
holding size would be negligible. Small and fragmented holdings and land
tenure conditions are a major reason for strong Government support of minor
irrigation development in the public sector.
Water Resources and Utilization
2.07    Surface Water Irrization.  The area irrigated by gravity systems
through government canals increased from about 0.6 N ha in 1965-66 to about
1.0 H ha in 1975-76. The gross irrigation potential from surface water
resources is estimated to be about 3.6 M ha of which some 1.3 x ha would be
from minor irrigation such as river lifts and tanks. In recent years, the
area irrigated by canal systems has averaged about 1.0 x ha, depending on
annual monsoon and run off conditions. Most government canal systems take
off from diversion weirs on rivers originating from the Central Plateau.
None of these rivers carry significant cry season flows, and consequently the
irrigation systems mainly provide water to supplement monsoon rainfall.
2.08    Minor irrigation facilities based on surface water include RLIs,
public and privately owned tanks, minor diversion canals and private low lift
pumps installed by-farmers. The irrigation potential created by minor
irrigation schemes is estimated to be about 0.9 M ha. The GOWB has con-
structed about 3000 RLIs to provide perennial water supplies. Only 1900 of
these schemes have complete piped distribution networks which serve on
average about 40 ha or about half the design command area.
2.09    Groundwater Irrigation.  Groundwater resources are contained mainly
in the alluvial aquifer system which underlies most of the plains area (Map
IBRD 18495). The system, which will support high yielding wells, is a thick
sequence of sediments in which beds of sand interfinger with lenses or beds
of silt and clay. In western WB, the alluvial system wedges out and low to
moderate amounts of groundwater are contained in Gondwana sandstones of the
Coalfield Zone. The main aquifer of the hard rock deposits is the weathered
zone and the presence of an extensive cover of lateritic mature soil indi-
cates that the zone of weathering is likely to be well developed. Other
localized aquifers on the hard rock area are the relatively thin, shoe-string
deposits of sandy river alluvium bordering stream courses.
2.10    The main recharge sources to all aquifer systems are infiltration
from rainfall, deep percolation of water held on paddy fields, and infiltra-
tion of flood water. Other recharge sources are deep percolation from sur-
face water irrigation distribution systems and infiltration from rivers,
streams, ponds or lakes. Discharge is by evaporation from shallow water
tables, transpiration of vegetation, effluent seepage to the natural drains
and abstraction by wells. Only 17% of the State groundwater resources are



-8-
presently developed with an irregular distribution within the State. Much of
the undeveloped resource is in the northern districts where the incentive
to develop groundwater for irrigation is relatively low due to the high
rainfall. Nevertheless, the present level of groundwater development
throughout the State does not constrain future groundwater development within
forseeable planning horizons. The water balance summaries by districts are
given in Table T-2.
2.11    Most of the water contained by the alluvial and hard rock aquifer
systems has less than 1,000 parts per million (ppm) dissolved solids, the
exception being the coastal areas where saline intrusion can occur. There
are considerable areas of better quality water with dissolved solids falling
as low as 250 ppm. A few pockets of water with high chloride concentrations
(in excess of 250 ppm CR) occur in some districts but their localities and
those of other poor quality groundwater are well defined.
Present Agricultural Development
2.12    Crops and Cropping Patterns.  Areas, yields and production for the
major crops in West Bengal are given in Table T-1. Taking 1980/81 as a
sample crop year, about 6.4 M ha was cultivated. Rice, grown in three dif-
ferent seasons depending on soil type and availability of irrigation water,
accounted for about 74% of the cropped area. Aus rice (9%) is grown under
rainfed conditions on the lighter and well drained soils which can be worked
during pre-monsoon rains. It is generally sown broadcast in late April/May
and harvested in early September. Aman rice (60%) is by far the most impor-
tant crop. Traditional varieties are transplanted in July/August and har-
vested in November/December; early maturing HYVs require assured irrigation
and can be harvested September/October and followed by a rabi crop. Boro
rice (5%), grown entirely under irrigation, is transplanted late January and
harvested late May. The main constraint to boro rice is availability of
reliable irrigation and high water demand in April and May. Wheat is grown
in the rabi season and represented about 4% of the cropped area in 1980/81.
However, the area to wheat has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly in
northern parts of the State with assured irrigation. The GOWB would like to
increase the areas under pulses, oilseeds and wheat at the expense of boro
rice to spread irrigation supplies in the water-short rabi season. Pulses
(7%), including pigeon peas and masur, are grown in the rabi season as
irrigated crops following rice and jute. Non-food crops account for 15% of
the cropped areas and include various types of oilseeds (4%), jute (9%) with
the remaining 2% under miscellaneous crops of which potato is the most impor-
tant. Average present cropping patterns by soil types are given on
Table T-5.
2.13    CroR Yields.  Crop yields show considerable differences by districts
and years reflecting average and actual rainfall conditions respectively
(Table T-1) and the availability of irrigation water. In general, the
average yields for most crops are higher in the plains area reflecting better
land capability, more access to irrigation and better farming practices.
Average yields for various crops in plains area districts (representing a mix
of rainfed and irrigated crop yields over the cultivated area of a district)
are given below for 1980-81:

Aricultural SuDDortima Services
2.14    Agricultural Research.  The major institutions conducting agricul-
tural research in WB are the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the Agricul-
tural University (Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya), and institutes and
sub-stations of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The DOA
has responsibility for conducting research to develop agricultural technology
and its research capability has been strengthened through the Bank assisted
West Bengal Agricultural Extension and Research Project (para 1.14). The
project established four commodity research stations, a new station for
wheat, and stations in the six agro-ecological zones for testing new
varieties and cultivation practices. The project strengthened the water
management research centre (WMRC) established in 1972 and also conducted
adaptive research trials at about,50 sub-divisional seed farms. Significant
achievements by DOA stations include breeding of HYV rice varieties and
research on wheat which contributed to the rapid increase in the wheat cul-
tivation in the last decade. The WMRC has established suitable irrigation
practices for all major crops on different soil types. The Agricultural
University, established in 1974, has faculties for agriculture and veterinary
science and 12 research centres including the main centre at Kalyani. The
ICAR research stations include the Jute Agricultural Research Institute
(JARI) at Barrackpore, near Calcutta which undertake breeding programs, pest
and disease coatrol programs, and research into improved agronomic practices,
and retting and fibre extraction technology. The Jute Technical Research
Institute is engaged in research on fibre quality. Other ICAR stations
include sub-centres for maize and rice, for potatoes at Darjeeling and for
plantation crops. Since the Bank has an on-going agricultural research
operation, no provision for agricultural research would be necessary under
the project. Any benefits which may result from the on-going research
program are attributed to the research project and benefits assumed in the
proposed project analysis reflect the impact on agricultural production that
would be obtained from existing research facilities in WB (para 6.05).
2.15   ftricultural Extension.  The Bank assisted West Bengal Agricultural
Development Project (Cr. 541-IN) included a component to reorganize and
strengthen the extension system in six project districts according to the T&V
system. Following this pilot operation, GOWB extended the reorganization
throughout the State with the assistance of the West Bengal Agricultural
Extension and Research Project (Cr. 690-IN). Under the T&V extension program
in WB, a comprehensive cropping program for each district is drawn up every
year with village level extension workers (VLW) responsible for assisting
farmers on regular visit days. A ratio of one VLW per 1200 farmers is



-10-
planned, but there are large numbers of vacancies both at VLW level and
amongst Agricultural Development Officers at the sub-divisional level which
may weaken the extension service to farmers.
2.16    Since inception in 1977, Cr. 690-IN has suffered serious staffing
problems which have varied in origin, scale and attempted resolution
throughout the project period. These staffing problems, are largely related
to three main factors: (i) the T&V extension concept entails the adoption of
a single-function, single-line-of-command service which involved radical
organizational changes from the traditional extension services !f; (ii) the
resistance of staff in WB to change and recourse to the courts to block
change; and (iii) the existence in WB of numerous ad hoc and inconsistent
staf5ing decisions give adequate scope for court action, even without the
added complication of a basic change in job function. A consequence of the
staffing shortages, has been a reluctance of GOWB to invest in infrastructure
and equipment essential for a viable T&V extension service. Nonetheless, the
GOWB is committed to the T&V extension philosophy and results in areas where
regular extension visits are being made, attest to the potential effective-
ness of the extension project concept. While Credit 690-IN is scheduled to
be closed on March 31, 1985, it is anticipated that WB will continue to
improve its extension services under the National Agricultural Extension II
Project. In this respect, the GOWB would undertake a comprehensive review of
the State's agricultural extension services and the project would support
incremental staffing costs for key staff required to supervise VLWs in the
districts where project works are to be located (para 3.36). Furthermore,
an agreement has been reached with GOWB that it would provide appropriate
staffing, facilities and services and other resources required to carry out
agricultural extension services throughout the districts in which the project
works are located.
2.17    Agricultural Inputs.  The GOWB has about 4,000 ha of seed farms which
supply certified seeds, but the main bulk of seeds are retained by farmers
from previous crops.  Seeds are also bought in from the National Seed Cor-
poration (NSC), the Uttar Pradesh Seed and Terai De?elopment Corporation
(TDC) and private sources (especially for vegetable seeds). In addition, the
State Seed Corporation (SSC), which started operations in 1983/84, will
supply contracting farmers with foundation seed produced on Government farms
or obtained outside the State. The SSC will undertake seed cleaning and
testing while seed certification is the responsibility of a separate
organization, the WB State Seed Certification Agency. Seed distribution is
made through the Agro-Industries Corporation (AIC), the State Cooperative
Marketing Corporation and through authorized dealers of the TDC/NSC. Nor-
mally, there is no shortage of seeds except in years of exceptional demand
due to drought or flood.
2.18    Supplies of fertilizer are generally adequate though temporary
shortages of phosphate fertilizer have occured (summer 1983). There has been
a steady increase in fertilizer use since 1977/78 with about 0.4 M tons used
in 1983/84 giving an average statewide consumption of about 36 kg of nutrient
Li The project attempted to merge 14 separate staff cadres into the Depart-
ment of Agriculture-a radical step in any public service and especially
so in a State such as West Bengal.



-11-
per ha. About 60% of pool fertilizer is distributed by the AIC and the State
Cooperative Marketing Federation. At block level, the Cooperative Marketing
Society sells direct to farmers and primary Village Level Cooperatives. In
addition, there is an extensive network of private dealers who obtain sup-
plies direct from the manufacturers. The Indian Farmers Fertiliser Corpora-
tion has a program to open outlets in more remote areas. Pesticides are
distributed by the AIC and by manufacturers mainly through private outlets.
The DOA maintains some spraying equipment for hire to farmers together with
buffer stocks of pesticides for use in emergencies. In general, pesticides
are freely available with about 3,000 tons utilized annually.
2.19    Agricultural Credit.  Institutional credit is distributed according
to the normal pattern for India. The State Cooperative Bank (SCB) provides
about 70% of short and medium term (2-5 years) credit with the balance sup-
plied by nationalized commercial banks. There are about 6,000 nrimary
cooperative societies at village level affiliated to District Cooperative
Banks (DCB). Short term credit from commercial banks is channelled mainly to
larger farmers whereas the Cooperative Banks reserve 40% of loans for
sharecroppers and tenant farmers and a further 40% to small and marginal
farmers. Short term credit is also obtained from non-institutional channels
such as traders, money lenders and family members, and through the farm
owner/tenant relationship. A major problem for short-term institutional
credit in WB, with respect to lending and recovery, is the large annual
variation in crop production resulting from climatic conditions.
2.20    The sources of long term institutional credit (more than 5 years) are
the State Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDB) and the nationalized com-
mercial banks. Traditionally, the LDB was the main source of long term
credit, but commercial banks have developed an increasing portfolio over the
past decade. Most long term lending to individual farmers has been for minor
irrigation such as tubewells, dugwells and pump sets. However, despite
government subsidies of up to 75% for water point construction and almost
100% for electrical connection, the level of lending has never achieved
programmed results. In fact, actual credit disbursement (1983/84 constant
prices) declined from Rs. 132 M in 1978/79 to about Rs. 65 M in 1981/82 and
the trend continues. Moreover, the recovery of long term credit has been
disappointing. In 1982/83, overdues to the LDB represented 61% of demand.
The evidence suggests that given the land distribution and tenure in WB (para
2.06), the demand for long term credit is limited primarily because: (i) most
farm holdings are small and fragmented or operated by tenant farmers thus
limiting the number of potential sites suitable for a privately owned irriga-
tion source which would be financially viable; and (ii) most individual
farmers with sufficient resources to develop their own wells have already
done so.
2.21    Marketing. Processing and Storage.  The State has a deficit in food
grains, mainly because of Calcutta's requirements. Only Birbhum, West Dinaj-
pur and Midnapur districts have regular surpluses to local needs and as a
result, only about 20% of paddy and 40% of wheat is sold on the open market.
In contrast about 90% of vegetables and potatoes and 98% of fibre crops are
marketed. There are about 2,600 village level primary markets practically
all privately operated; regulated markets have made only slow progress in
West Bengal. Prices at primary and secondary markets are negotiated and
farmers receive about 75% of the wholesale price of food grains and only 67Z



-12-
in the case of jute, since commodities are sold in very small lots. Cold
storage facilities (about 1.1 M tons) are available for about half the potato
crop but farmers normally sell at harvest time vhen prices are lowest.
Farmers receive about 50X of the wholesale price for vegetables with price
subject to transport costs to the main Calcutta Market. The CMF purchases
jute mainly for the Jute Corporation of India, potatoes for storage in
cooperative cold stores, and wheat for the Food Corporation of India if
prices drop to the support price. In general, there are no serious con-
straints to the present system but GOWB plans to provide more marketing
outlets to enable farmers to attract better farm gate prices.
III. THE PROJECT
Proiect Formulation
3.01    Project preparation has been carried out by the technical departments
of GOWB in close co-ordination with the Central Water Commission (CWC) of
GOI. Early 1983, the Government of India (GOI) and GOWB requested Bank
assistance regarding a project to develop deep tubewells and river lift
installations in WB; the project consisted of traditionally designed deep
tubewells and completion of river lift schemes. After visits to Uttar
Pradesh, in September 1983, GOWB revised their proposal to incorporate
improved technology similar to that tested and introduced under the
Bank-supported Second UP Public Tubewell Project (Cr. 1332-IN; 1983). In
December 1983, GOWB further decided to expand the project scope to include
construction of open dug wells and low discharge tubewells.
3.02    Proiect Concept and Obiectives.  The policy of the GOWB is to maxi-
mize minor irrigation development by exploitation of surface and groundwater
resources throughout the State. In pursuit of this policy, the project
objective would be to select the least cost and most appropriate technology
to develop the land and water resources taking into account the
socio-economic characteristics of the site to be developed. With respect to
groundwater development, the appropriate technology under the project could
be anything from an open dug well through low capacity tubewells with either
centrifugal or submersible pumps (depending on the water table depth) up to
deep public tubevells (constructed to improved design standards). Since the
command areas of the minor irrigation units would be small, locations can be
chosen so that beneficiaries include a high proportion of farmers with small
and fragmented land holdings who would not have access to the long term
credit system under the standard terms and conditions of institutional credit
(para 2.20). Thus the project would complement groundwater development in
the private sector and be selective in the target group of beneficiaries to
be reached. With respect to surface water development, the project would
provide electrical energization to pumps and buried piped distribution sys-
tems for selected, existing RLI schemes with the objective of improving their
operation and management capabilities.
3.03    A second project objective is institution building to ensure that
project works are effectively and efficiently implemented, and operation and
maintenance of completed and existing works enables predicted benefits to be



-13-
obtained. In this respect, the project would support management improvements
including a management study of the Agricultural Engineering Directorate
(AED), the main implementing agency.
3.04    Justification for Bank Involvement.  The GOWB has given priority to
minor irrigation development with emphasis on groundwater utilization (para
1.01). In the public sector, while physical implementation of the construc-
tion program has been satisfactory, its operations have not achieved expected
benefits. Poor performance has been caused by incomplete planning and design
which makes works difficult to manage, results in low efficiency and provides
an excuse for ineffective operation and maintenance. Nevertheless, in the
socio-economic context of WB and in areas with good land and groundwater
resources, minor irrigation development by the public sector is the only
effective way to reach most of the farmers who oWn or operate small, frag-
mented holdings (para 2.20). The GOWB has requested Bank involvement in the
project to assist in three main activities: (i) introduction of improved
technologies to ensure that irrigation service is timely, reliable and pre-
dictable and thus manageable; (ii) expansion of minor irrigation program
through the use of a full range of sources and technologies including shallow
tubewells and open dugwells; and (iii) institution building and management
improvements for construction and O&M of new and/or existing works.
3.05    The GOWB has decided to adopt under the project, improved tech-
nologies successfully demonstrated by the Uttar Pradesh Public Tubewell
Projects (Cr. 1004-IN; 1979 and Cr. 1332-In; 1983) for both deep tubewells
and river lift schemes. These new design and operation criteria represent a
break with past traditions and it will be difficult for WB to introduce such
changes without Bank involvement. If the project is successful, the GOWB is
likely to use the same technologies for both existing and new minor irriga-
tion works throughout the State. With respect to institution building and
management improvements, a range of improvements have been formulated during
the preparation process; such improvements as part of a comprehensive pack-
age, are unlikely to be generated within the agencies themselves without the
project. Further, GOWB has decided to increase the role of panchayats (vil-
lage level elected councils) in the program; Bank assistance has helped GOWB
to formulate the necessary safeguards to minimize risks and yet take full
advantage of this innovative management move.
Project ComRonents
3.06    The proposed project would finance a five year program
(1984/85-1989/90) incorporating the following elements of the GOWB develop-
ment program in the minor irrigation sector:
(a)  DeeR Tubewells.  Construction of deep tubevell irrigation systems
to serve about 67,000 ha including: 3about 1,200 high capacity
tubewells (HDTWs) each of about 200m /h capacity and serving abojt
40 ha; 400 medium capacity tubewells (NDTWs) each of about 100 m lh
capacity and serving about 20 ha; and about 1,800 low capacity
tubewells (LDTWs) each of about 30 m /h and serving about 6 ha.
(b)  Shallow Tubewells.  Construciion of about 5,400 shallow tubewell
systems (STWs) of about 30 m lh capacity and each serving about 6 ha.



-14-
(c)  Open Dug Wells.  Construction of about 10,000 open dug wells (ODWs)
of various designs in alluvial and hard rock areas.
(d)  River Lift Installations.  Completion of the distribution systems
and conversion to electric powered pump units on abSut 200 existing
river lift installations (RLI) each of about 400 m /h capacity and
serving about 80 ha.
(e)  Manatement ImDrovements.  Provision of equipment and buildings for
AED staff; research and development to test advanced technologies for
public tubewells and RLIs; training and study visits and tours for
project staff; preparation of Design and O&M Manuals including tech-
nical assistance; and studies related to project management, cost
recovery and an agro-economic baseline for selected project areas.
(f)  Strengthening the Asricultural Extension Services.  Incremental staff
costs and preparation of a comprehensive plan for agricultural exten-
sion services for districts under the project.
Planninz Criteria
3.07    Site Selection Procedures.  The land and groundwater resources in WB
have been surveyed in sufficient detail by the State Water Investigation
Directorate (SWID), to select broad areas where the project works would be
technically and economically viable; the preparation work has included an
evaluation of existing and proposed power supply and demand. Thus, with
respect to State level selection, a GOWB Committee has already identified
development areas within the State and has made a general allocation of the
project program to the various districts. This could be done because the
proposed work program is small compared to the potential development area and
available groundwater resources. Project impact areas for groundwater
development have been decided on general physical and technical cuaisidera-
tions but at district level there remains considerable flexibility in select-
ing sites of individual works. District level selection will be made by
District Site Selection Committees (DSSC) which will include representatives
of the concerned district level officers and the panchayat organization. The
DSSC will identify local areas which are likely to meet siting criteria for
individual works and also decide priorities under the work program within the
district. Once the local area has been identified where works can be sited,
individual site selection will be made by village panchayats following strict
selection criteria so that physical, technical, socio-economic and management
objectives can be achieved. In particular, individual site selection would
ensure that potential beneficiaries understand and are prepared to accept the
responsibilities expected from them. Once a specific site is identified,
site investigations by AED would be made to confirm technical viability.
Choice of each individual site at local level would then be reviewed and
confirmed by the appropriate committees at district and state levels. In
this way, the various agencies involved in project would be able to check
that siting criteria has been adhered to, and would be fully informed of the
proposed implementation program and schedule.



-15-
3.08    Siting Criteria.  For new DTW, STW or ODW systems, well sites will be
located such that groundvater availability would be sufficient to provide a
reliable irrigation service as assumed in project design; soils in the com-
mand area would be of suitable quality for project agricultural objectives to
be achieved; the command area would not be subject to submergence during
heavy floods; and there would be no other public irrigation service in the
areas selected. In addition, for DTW and STW systems, an individual well
site would be a maximum distance of 1.5 km from an existing 11 kV power line
and the average distance of all project well systems from existing 11 kV
lines would be not greater than 1.2 km. For locations which comply with the
above technical criteria, the type of well to be installed would be the
least-cost technology appropriate to the land and aquifer conditions of the
area. Once the general location and type of well have been decided,
individual command areas would be determined to satisfy the following
socio-economic and management criteria:
(i) the construction of private tubewells is difficult because of the
drilling depth necessary to achieve a satisfactory yield; and/or the
area is economically backward and further private well construction
will be very slow to develop;
ii)  at least 80X of the command area of any DTW or group of STWs, and
100% of the command area for ODWs would be owned or operated by
farmers with holdings less than one hectare;
(iii) the command area of project works would not contain holdings with
private irrigation sources (excluding open wells) except for high
capacity DTWs, where not greater than 1OZ of the command area is
served by private irrigation sources; and
(iv) the local panchayat has the capability and would agree to take on
the management responsibilities as defined under the project (para
5.11) for the well type selected for the site.
The above criteria can be strictly enforced since command area boundaries
and/or water point locations can be adjusted to ensure that a selected target
group of beneficiaries are reached. Nonetheless, special attention will be
given during the selection process to those areas which could be developed by
either STWs or DTWs to avoid pre-emption of a possible private development
option and to ensure that the least-cost design alternative is selected.
3.09    The locations of the RLIs to be modernized with piped distribution
systems and electric motor powered pumps have already been selected; the main
criterion has been proximity of an 11 kV power source which can be extended
to serve the pump station.
3.10    Water Requirements.  The wide geographical distribution of the
project works imply cultivation under a range of climatic and soil conditions
and varying proximity to markets; consequently, there will be a wide varia-
tion of cropping patterns throughout project lands. In almost all cases, a
wet season rice crop will be taken mainly for the farmer's home consumption.
This could be either a traditional 'aman rice grown on rainfall in most
years, or a wet season HYV which would require at least puddling and
pre-planting irrigation in some years. The HYV rice crop would be preferred



-16-
if vheat is to follow due to its early maturing characteristics. Many
farmers will grow ,'boro' rice, a dry season rice, with very high water demand
and a typical peak requirement of about 10 an/day in April on tight soils.
us' rice, planted during the pre-monsoon rains, would normally require
irrigation in widely varying quantities depending on the actual rainfall
year. Jute has similar water requirements to 'aus' rice less the puddling
requirement. Wheat and potato would be grown as rabi crop entirely under
irrigation with water demand for potato somewhat higher that wbeat.
3.11    Weighted mean water requirements have been estimated.  Based on this
analysis, all tubewell irrigstion systems and BLIs are designed with pumping
capacity equivalent to 100 mi/h on 20 ha of command area. This converts to a
water duty of about 0.92 1/sec/ha (equivalent to 8 rm/day on the command
area) with a daily operation of about 16 h/day. Crop peak water requirements
are given during land preparation and pre-irrigation for 'aus' rice and
equate to about 14 rn/day through April. 'Boro' rice produces a peak demand
in April of about 9 mm/day. The project is designed to support about 50X
crop cover of  Aus' rice or ILOZ crop cover of 'boro' rice grown on tight
soils. During peak periods, it is assumed that wells could operate up to
about 18 h/day through April and IBSEB confirm that for short periods, this
level of power service can be provided. No other crops are constrained by
the water supply.
3.12    With respect to open dug wells in hard rock areas, the governing
constraint would be well yie d. An average dug well equipped with a pump set
would produce about 12,000 m  of water over the five months period of the
dry season. This is equal to a water supply at well head of 500-600 am/ha
for a 2 ha command area; which is adequate for 100% cover of vegetables; the
well would also be used to provide supplementary irrigation to wet season
rice. The water duties on typical dug wells in riverine alluvium (serving
about 4 ha) would be similar to the tubewell systems (para 3.11).
Deep Tubewell Systems
3.13    Well CaRacity.  Relatively deep tubewells (DTWs) gould be the
appropriate technology where: (i) yields over about 100 m /h are required;
(ii) aquifer conditions such as clay layers in the upper soil profile make
DTWs necessary for all yields; and (iii) deep water levels preclude use of
SIlWs with centrifugal pumps. Well design and drilling technology would be
similar for all DTWs irrespectivS of discharge capacity. The preferred
discharge of a DTW would be 200m /h serving about 40 ha since such a well
would give the least cost per unit area developed. however, there are parts
of the State where contiguous command areas of 40 ha may not be available.
For such areas, an medium capacity well (MDTW) of 100 m /h serving 20 ha or a
cluster of low capacity wells (LDIW) each of 30 m3/h serving about 6 ha may
be suitable. Since, individual well sites will be selected as the project
proceeds, allocation of the DTW program under the project between high,
medium and low capacity wells is provisional. Bowever, enough sites will be
selected before the mid-term review of the project (para 3.38) when, if
necessary, allocation of the DTW program will be revised.
3.14    Design of liuih and Medium Capacity Tubewell Systems.  The design of
HDTW and MDIW systems follow the principles successfully tested under the
UP Public Tubewell Projects (para 3.05). A system would consist of a water



-17-
point with pump house; a distribution chamber equipped with float svitch for
automatic control of the pump; a buried pipe distribution system with outlet
valves each commanding about 2 to 3 ha; earthen field channels below the
outlets to serve farm holdings; an access road to the water point for opera-
tion and maintenance purposes; and an electrical power supply. The improved
tubewell systems are described below with detailed design principles given in
Annex 7, SDV; the estimated costs of typical DTW systems are given in
Table T-6.
3.15    The Water PiJnt.  The water point would consist of the well, pump,
prime mover, switch gear, starter and protection relays and electrical power
connection, all located in a brick-built pump house. The wells would be
fitted with submersible or electric turbine pumps. Water level operated
electrical probes fitted at the distribution chamber would permit automation
of the pump prime mover. The electrical system would be provided with a
capacitor, low voltage or temperature cut-out, and a single phase preventer
in the starter relay to protect the motor. Electronic hour meters would be
fitted on all pumping units. The wells would be drilled using either direct
rotary or reverse circulation drilling rigs. Total depths of wells would be
in the range of 60 to 250 m according to the design, discharge capacity and
local site condition. Well casing and screen would be of mild steel or other
approved material; under the R&D component (para 3.33), other materials would
be tested. Materials required and unit cost estimates are given in Annex 3,
Tables I and 2.
3.16    Distribution Chamber.  An essential feature of the system is the
elevated distribution chamber which maintains operating head in the piped
distribution system (Chart C-1). It also enables automatic operation of the
pumping unit by means of level operated electrical probes which: (i) activate
power supply according to the water level in the chamber and in response to
irrigation demand; and (ii) enable water distribution at less than the full
discharge rate of the pump without spillage. The design of the distribution
chamber ensures equal division of the water supply from the well into two or
three streams depending on the design capacity of the water point.
3.17    Buried PiDe Distribution System.  A typical layout for a HDTW dis-
tribution system is given in Chart C-2. The buried conveyance system would
be PVC feeder pipes from the elevated distribution chamber to connect with
closed loops or branches (where indicated by shape of service area) of PVC
pipe which constitute the main distribution system. The distribution chamber
would ensure equal division of the pump discharge to each pipe loop or
branch. The loop design ensures that an outlet can be supplied from two
directions which reduces flow velocities and head losses in the pipelines.
A EDTW system would have three loops while a MDTW would generally have two
branches. In EDTW systems, feeder pipes would be either of 200 mm diameter
PVC or reinforced concrete; distribution pipes would be 140 mm diameter PVC.
The P9T systems would have 110 mm diameter PVC pipe. Pipes would be 2.5
kg/cm pressure rating with a depth of cover not less than 0.8 meter. The
average lengths of feeder and distribution pipes for the two system types are
given in Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2.
3.18    Distribution Slatem Outlets.  Outlet valves would be provided along
the buried distribution pipes to command about 2 to 3 ha ses ving 5-10
farmers. The valve would be designed to deliver about 67 m Ih under the



-18-
prevailing head at any point in a EDTW distribution loop or about 50 m3/h on
a MDTW branch. Only one of about six outlets on each loop or branch would be
operated at any time. The valve would be set in a brick-built distribution
box which would have an arrangement to deliver water in several directions as
required. A single 200 mm surge riser with a top elevation about 0.5 m above
the top water level of the distribution would be provided at a point farthest
from the chamber.
3.19    Field Channels.  The most distant field in an outlet command would
generally be less than about 160 m from the outlet valve. Common field
channels would be aligned along property boundaries such that water can be
delivered from the outlet distribution boxes to individual farm plots within
the outlet command. Average length of earth channel for typical HDTW and
IMDTW command areas would be about 50 i/ha.
3.20    Power SuDPp1. The HDTW and NDTW systems would be provided with an
electrical power supply by extending an 11 kV feeder line to the well head
and providing an 11/0.4 kV transformer and a short low tension connection to
the pump unit starter relay. The maximum length of llkV spur line would be
1.5 km, with an average length of 1.2 km for all DTWs wells under the
project. Dedicated 11 kV lines serving only state owned wells would not
normally be required as power supply is generally reliable in WB. Nonethe-
less, to ensure that project wells can function as planned, agreements have
been reached with GOWB that through the WBSEB; it would: (i) provide project
tubewells and RLIs with 16 hours of power supply per day at peak demand
periods with a voltage fluctuation of not greater than + 6Z; and (ii) ener-
gize each project tubewell or RLI within two months of its completion.
3.21    Low Capacity Deep Tubewell Systems.  Individual LDTWs each discharg-
ing about 30 m3/h and serving about 6 ha would be sited in clusters of about
six wells for effective management and to reduce operator costs. The wells
would be located where water level requires a shaft driven turbine or submer-
sible pump. An LDTW system would consist of water point, an earthen channel
delivery system, and an 0.4 kV low tension power line.
3.22    The water point would consist of the well, pump, prime motor, switch
gear, starter and protection relay, and electrical power supply, located in a
brick-built pump house. The starter relay would be direct on-line and a
capacitor would be fitted for pump motor protection. Electronic hour meters
would be fitted to facilitate monitoring of pump operation. The well. would
be hand drilled with a pump chamber of 200/150 mm diameter to an appropriate
depth and a production string of 80 mm diameter to total depth. The wells
would be gravel packed and have a depth of about 60m. Earthen field channels
would be aligned along property boundaries to deliver water from a well to
farm fields; the most distant field would generally not exceed 300 m from the
well head. The average density of field channels would be about 80 m/ha of
command. An cluster of LDTWs would be provided with an 11 kV power line to
a 11/0.4 kV transformer at the load center of the cluster, from where lower
tension 0.4 kV connections would be made to each well head. The lengths of
11 kV line to the transformer location for each cluster would average about
1.2 km with about 0.22 km of low tension lire per well. The unit cost of a
typical LDTW is summarized in Table T-6 and detailed in Annex 3, Table 3.



-19-
Shallow Tubewell Systems
3.23    In areas with shallow water levels, tubewells equippel with
centrifugal pumps would be constructed discharging about 30 m /h and serving
about 6 ha. In such conditions, shallow tubewells (STWs) would be preferred
over LDTWs due to their lower cost and easier maintenance of the pump unit.
The STWs would be grouped in clusters of about six wells and energized
through 0.4 kV low tension power line from a common 11/0.4 kV transformer on
an 11 kV spur line. A STW system would consist of a water point (well,
centrifugal pump, electric motor, and on-line starter relay), pump house,
earthen channel water distribution system from well head to the farm fields,
and the power connection. Apart from the well and pump unit, the STW system
is similar to the LDTW system (para 3.21). The wells would be hand drilled
at 150 mm diameter for installation 80 mm diameter pipe casing and screeo,
and a course sand pack. The wells would be up to about 60 m depth and about
9 m of screen would be provided. The centrifugal pump mounted either at land
surface or in a sh2llow sump would be powered by a 3 HP electric motor and
provided with a small hand pump for priming. Cost estimates for typical STW
systems are summarized in Table T-6 and detailed in Annex 3, Tables 4.
Dug Wells
3.24    Two types of dug wells would be constructed under the project - a
large diameter well for hard rock areas, and a small diameter well lined with
precast concrete rings for areas where relatively thin but highly permeable
riverine sands overlie hard rock. Both well types would be suitable for
installation of a centrifugal pump.
3.25    Duz Wells in Hard Rock.  The typical open well would be about 3m
square cross section and about 12 m deep and would serve about 2 ha. Brick-
work will normally be required to secure the uppermost part of the well where
soil and unstable rock may be encountered; the remaining well section would
be unlined. The well will penetrate below the water table to provide a
reservoir for pumping; construction of this section will require continuous
dewatering. As each ODW can be pumped only for a few hours each day under
production conditions, if it as decided to mechanize wells, one diesel driven
centrifugal pump with 30-50 m /h discharge could be shared by a group of
wells. The water distribution system from well head to the farm fields will
be earthen channels. Unit cost estimates for wells are given in Annex 3,
Table 5.
3.26    Dug Wells in Riverine Alluvium.  The wells will be excavated at about
1.5 m diameter for installation of 1.2 m internal diameter precast, rein-
forced concrete rings with well depths extendi.g to about 12 m. When the
water table is reached, the rings will slide down as excavation proceeds and
dewatering would be required when working in this section. A well will be
completed when a fully dewatered section cannot be maintained for further
excavation with a 100 m3/h pump. Such wells would sustain a continuous
discharge of about 30 m3Ih when fitted with centrifugal pumps powered by
either diesel or electric motors. The command area would be about 4 ha and
the water distribution system from well head to farm fields would be in
earthen channels. Unit cost estimates for wells are given in Annex 3,
Table 6.



-20-
River Lift Installations
3.27    The GOWB has installed over 3,000 small scale RLIs during the past
two decades throughout the State. Most RLIs use diesel motor pump units and
many have incomplete water distribution systems and pump houses. Under the
project, about 200 existing RlIs would be modernized and completed by:
(i) electrification of the pump units to enable the RLI to be operated
automatically as for improved HDTWs (para 3.16); and (ii) provision of
elevated distribution chambers, a buried pipe water distribution system with
outlets to 2-3 ha commands and an earthen channel conveyance system within
outlet commands to farm fields. Many design characteristics of a modernized
RLI would be similar to those described for HDTWs and MUTWs (see para 3.13
et. seq.) differing only because the stream size (400 el/h) and command area
(80 ha) of the RLI would be larger. The systems are described below with
detailed design principles given in Annex 7, SDV. Cost estimates are sum-
marised in Table T-6 and detailed in Annex 3, Table 7.
3.28    The Water Point.  A typical water point would consist of the pump
units (pump, prime mover, starter and protection relays, electrical power
connection) all located in a brick built pump house or on a barge for float-
ing pump units. The pumps would be two 200 m13h, electric motor driven,
centrifugal pumps with Star-Delta starter relays wired for independent opera-
tion. The electrical system would include a capacitor, low voltage or tem-
perature cut-out, and a single phase preventer in the relay for motor protec-
tion and electronic hour meters. An 11 kV spur line would be extended from
the nearest 11 kV line to an 11/4.0 kV transformer located at the pump house.
The transformer would be connected to the pump starter relay by short LT
lines and would include an electricity meter. The length of 11 kV spur line
would average 2.5 km per facility.
3.29    Distribution Chambers.  The pump station discharge of 400 m3/h would
be divided into six equal streams of about 66 a3/h, each serving sub-systems
of the distribution system which can be operated independently (see Chart
C-2). This would be achieved by installing a primary distribution chamber on
the river bank near the pump station where a first division of the flow would
be made, followed by one or more secondary distribution chambers located at
strategic positions in the command area where final division of flows would
be made. The breakdown of the full flow at the primary chamber 3iay be into
flows of 66 m3/h or multiple.; of this discharge (typically 132 m /h) accord-
ing to the geometry of the command area which controls the optimum pipe
layout. The primary chamber operates as a master chamber for the system to
control flows from the pumps and automate of the pump switch gear. The
design principles of distribution chambers are similar to EDTWs (para 3.16).
3.30    The Distribution System.  The buried pipe conveyance would consist of
RCC pipe in the larger sizes (450 mm and/or 300 mm diameters) and PVC pipe in
the smaller sizes (200 mm, 160 mm and 140 mm diameters). The system would
consist of feeder pipes leading to delivery pipe sub-systemc which could be
closed loops or branches. Pipe outlets would be valves installed in
brick-built distribution boxes and commanding 2-3 ha as described for BDTWs
and NDTWs (para 3.18). Earthen channels would be aligned along property
boundaries to deliver water from the outlet to individual farm plots
(para 3.19).



-.21-
&ananement Imurovements.
3.31    The project would support management improvements within the Agricul-
tural Engineering Directorate (AED), the main implementing agency
(para 5.02). Work units would be established for quality control and train-
ing; the existing research and development and-monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) units would be strengthened. The project would also provide for a
Management Study of the AED (para 5.10); construction of residential build-
ings and a small staff training center; equipment; preparation of Design and
0&M manuals; visits and study tours for project staff; and technical assis-
tance. The project would also finance additional extension staff required to
supervise and support the VLWs in the 14 districts of IB included under the
project. The estimated costs of these items are given in Table T-7.
3.32    Buildinas.  Both residential and non-residential buildings are
provided as standard items under all construction programs with the number
and size of the buildings based on long established statewide norms. The
buildings used during construction are handed over to 0& staff when works
are commissioned. Non-residential buildings are used for management purposes
and storage facilities for O&M supplies and equipment. In recent years, the
statewide development program has expanded and in most districts, the AED has
very little accommodation and rentals are expensive and limited. As a conse-
quence, particularly in more remote parts of WB, the AED has difficulty in
attracting qualified field staff. Therefore, under the project, residential
buildings would be constructed for selected grades of staff in 0&M and other
field activities. The inspection bungalows would be standard PWD designs
and generally constructed on land presently owned by the AED or GOiB.
3.33    Research and Development.  The design concept and criteria of the
project works are acceptable to IDA. However, the nature of the project
components are such that design standards and specifications can be reviewed
on a continuous basis -and improvements introduced where necessary. To assist
GOWB in planning for future developments, the project would undertake studies
and test improved irrigation technologies and techniques which are either
untried in WB or have only been attempted on an experimental scale.  The main
activities to be tested and evaluated have been provisionally identified in
conjunction with GOWB and would include further technical improvements to
minor irrigation systems and procedures to minimize cost and/or improve O&M
standards of minor irrigation management. The initial work program would
be finalized by the R&D unit within the AED (para 5.07) which would be
strengthen under the project. The project would also support the cost of
experimental civil works (Table T-7). Agreements have been reached with GOEi
that through the AID: (i) not later than December 1, 1985, it would prepare
and submit to IDA a draft work plan for research and development activities
under the project and taking into consideration IDA's comments, carry out the
work plan; and (ii) in consultation with IDA, commencing July 1, 1987, review
annually the work plan, and if necessary, revise such work plan accordingly.
3.34    Technical Services.  To help the AED in the preparation of Design and
0&M Manuals (para 5.23), technical assistance would be provided through about
8 man-weeks of consultancy service. The monthly cost including salaries,
fees and subsistence for a foreign consultant would average about US$12,000.



-22-
3.35    Traininz. The project greatly expands the State program of con-
structing minor irrigation systems which involve planning, design and
implementation concepts which are novel to most of the AED staff. Conse-
quently, the Government would have to undertake substantial training to
correspond with the staffing required to achieve the project implementation
schedule (para 5.22). The project provides for one small service training
centre, training equipment, visiting local specialists to assist the AED
staff in giving the various training programs, and also for tours and visits
to enable project staff to widen their experience.
3.36    StrenRthenina the Extension Services.  To help the State consolidate
the progress made in improving its extension sevices (para 2.16), the project
would finance the incremental staffing costs of key extension staff (mainly
Agricultural Development Officers) in the Department of Agriculture (DOA)
required to supervise and support the activities of VLWs in the districts
under the project. In addition, the GOWB would undertake a comprehensive
review for further strengthening of its extension services in the State. In
this respect, an understanding has been reached with GOWB that it would
prepare and submit to IDA for its review and comments, a comprehensive report
summarising its plans for agricultural extension services in West Bengal over
the project period, and taking into account IDA's comments, if any, revise
such plan accordingly. In this respect, the plan for extension services
would, inter alia, cover staffing required at each level, training needs,
equipment, vehicles and civil works. It was further understood that the plan
would be prepared in a format and a timely manner which would enable it to be
considered for financing under a Bank supported National Agricultural Exten-
sion Project should GOI/GOWB make such a request.
Project Implementation (Chart C-3)
3.37    The project would be implemented over a five year period from about
March 1985 to March 1990. The main construction season is from mid November
through mid June although certain activities can continue through the monsoon
season at some sites. The construction work would be distributed extensively
throughout the State. All components have established construction techni-
ques which relate to local conditions. Much of the work is suited for small
contracts and sufficient labor contractors are available throughout the State
to ensure satisfactory progress and good quality work.
3.38    An agreement has been reached with GOWB that it would locate and
carry out the project works in accordance with siting, planning and design
criteria, and construction standards agreed by IDA. In addition, agreements
have been reached with GOWB that it would: (i) prepare and provide to IDA
for review draft terms of reference for a mid-term review of the project and,
taking into account IDA's comments, carry out a mid-term review of the
project; (ii) submit a report summarizing the results of the review to InA by
March 31, 1988; and (iii) taking into account the Association-s comments,
carry out necessary adjustments to the project.

The foreign exchange cost would be about US$ 13.4 million, or 9% of the total
project cost. Cost estimates are based on price levels prevailing in Septem-
ber 1984. Physical contingencies on civil works have been provided for each
type of construction activity (for example, to allow for variations in the
depth of the wells and layout of the distribution systems which depend on
local aquifer conditions and topography respectively). The physical contin-
gency average about 6% of the base cost. Price contingencies, which account
for about 24% of the base cost, reflect expected inflation rates over the
project period (same rates for local and foreign expenditures), and have been
taken as 8.0% in 1984/85, 7.0% in 1985/88 and 6% thereafter.
Financinz
4.02    The proposed IDA credit of US$ 99.0 1X, would finance the foreign
exchange component and about 67% of local costs. All expenditures would be
met by GOWB from its development budget, which includes a GOI contribution.
The IDA credit would be made to GOI on standard IDA terms. An agreement has
been reached with GOI that it would make the proceeds of the credit available
to GOWB on GOI's standard terms and arrangements for development assistance
to the States. Agreements have been reached with GOWB that it would promptly
provide resources and funds to: (i) execute the project in accordance with
the implementation and expenditure schedules for the project period, and
(ii) to operate and maintain adequately and efficiently the irrigation sys-
tems under the project. A key step each year will be the assessment and

provision of the annual financial requirements of-AED to undertake its
activities which would include the project work program and O&M of completed
works. In this respect, the financial requirements for the construction and
operation and maintenance of the project works and other project activities
have been included by the GOWB under the Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-90).

a1  Excluding 1S4 3.5 N vhich is not allocated to specific work. (see Table T-9).
4.04    Works to be financed under the project would cost approximately
US$ 44.3 M, excluding materials and equipment (para 4.06), power supply (para
4.05) and engineering and administration. About US$ 28.3 M (65Z) would be
let through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) contracts, and the remaining US$
16.0 H would be let under piece-work contracts or be carried out by GOWB's
departmental forces. All LCB contracts for civil works would be let on the
basis of documents and procedures approved by IDA.
(a)  LCB Contracts (US$ 28.3 H).  These works would not be suitable for
international tendering since they would be individually small,
scattered over a large area, and carried out intermittently as deter-
mined by weather conditions and agricultural activities. They would
include construction of deep and shallow tubewell systems, modern-
ization of river lift installations, access roads and buildings.
Generally, the materials and equipment under these LCB contracts
would be supplied by the State Government.
(b)  Advance Contracting (US$ 0.5 H).  Works contracts will have been let
between September 1984 when the project was appraised and April 1985
when the project is expected to start. These contracts would be let



-25-
after LCB on the basis of CWC's standardized procedures and
guidelines. An estimated US$ 0.5 M worth of works would be outstand-
ing under such contracts after April 1985 and would be eligible for
financing from the proposed credit.
(c)  Other Procurement Procedures.  (USS 16.0 M).  These works would
include field channels and dug vells; as for LCB contracts, these
works would be individually small and scattered and their implementa-
tion would be governed by weather and agricultural conditions.
However, unlike works under LCB contracts, the works would be so
small that there would be a general lack of interest from contractors
located outside the immediate areas covered by the project.  These
works would therefore be impractical for ICB or country-wide tender-
ing and most of them would be carried out under small piece-work or
rate contracts. When required by safety or quality considerations,
or when the quantities of work are difficult to estimate in advance,
certain small works (estimated in aggregate at US$ 2.0 N) may be
implemented by GOWB's departmental forces.
4.05    Power SuRDlv.  Power transmission and transformation works to be
financed under the project would cost approximately US$ 33.1 M, excluding
engineering and administration. Of this, about US$ 16.3 M would consist of
installation works and US$ 16.8 M would be materials and equipment. Of the
installation works, about US$ 13.3 M would be let after LCB contracts with
the remainder (uSS 3.0 M), which would include storage and transportation
costs, undertaken by the WBSEB's own forces. Since these works would be
small and scattered throughout the area, they would not be suitable for
international tendering. As with IDA credits for rural electrification,
WBSEB would be responsible for the works including procurement of its own
project materials using Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) standard
specifications, General Conditions of Contract and procurement procedures as
agreed for the on-going Bank supported Third Rural Electrification Project
(Loan 2165-IN). Generally, WBSEB would not procure materials and equipment
for project works under separate contracts but include the project items as
part of their regular procurement for the statewide rural electrification
programs. Thus the WBSEB would invite tenders, using LCB procedures satis-
factory to the Bank, for the procurement of conductors (US$ 6.0 M), distribu-
tion transformers (US$ 2.5 M), ST insulators (US$ 1.5 M), concrete poles
(US$4.4 M) and general materials (US$2.4 M). In view of the expected large
number of small contracts and the present smooth functioning of the procure-
ment process, only contracts exceeding US$0.5 M equivalent would require IDA
approval prior to contract awards. The WBSEB procurement procedures for
materials procured when not using IDA Credit proceeds are satisfactory.
4.06    Materials and Equipment to be financed under the project would cost
approximately US$ 49.9 M, excluding engineering and administration. Stand-
ardized procedures and bidding documents approved by IDA would be use- 4or
procurement of materials and equipment. The submersible pump units and
ancillaries for RLIs and DTIs (US$ 12.1 N) and PVC pipes and fittings (US$
14.6 M) would be procured through ICB procedures except for initial quan-
tities of materials to be used in the first construction year (US$ 1.8 M and
US$ 1.5 M of expenditures on pump units and PVC pipe and fittings respec-
tively) which would be procured under LCB procedures. A preference limited
to 15Z, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, would be extended to local
manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. The equipment and materials woald
be grouped to promote efficiency and attract competition. However, bids will



-26-
also be accepted on individual schedules to attract small manufacturers and
also reflect the scattered nature of the project works. Centrifugal pump
sets and ancillary equipment (US$ 3.4 X); steel pipe, fittings and casings
(US$ 14.8 M); general steel worl- (USA 2.4 M); and reinforced concrete pipe
(USS 2.2 M) would be procured through LCB procedures. The equipment procured
by LCB would benefit from existing servicing and supply facilities for spare
parts which need to be available over the 14 districts covered by the
project. For both equipment and material procured by LCB, there is adequate
domestic competition and prices are highly competitive. Equipment for
management improvements (USS 04 M) would be procured as part of the general
GOWB procurement for Goverument agencies.
4.07    Extension Services.  The incremental staff salaries and allowances
of the agricultural extension staff (USA 0.9M) would not involve procurement.
4.08    Contract Review.  All bidding packages for works estimated to cost
USS0.5 M equivalent or more, and for goods costing US$100,000 equivalent or
more, would be subject to standard IDA pre-action review. These will account
for at least 80% of the procurement value of works and 90% of the goods. The
remaining contracts would be subject to IDA post-action review.
Disbursements
4.09    Disbursements would be made for: (i) 100% of the foreign expenditures
for directly imported equipment; (ii) 100% for locally manufactured equipment
procured ex-factory or 70% of cost where ex-factory price is not available;
(iii) 100% of expenditures for mAnagement improvements (excluding buildings)
and for the agricultural extension component; (iv) 75% of expenditures on
buildings and for completed works (excluding materials procured under items
(v) and (vi) below) for deep tubevells, river lift installations, shallow
tubevells and open dugwells; (v) 75Z of expenditures on steel and reinforced
concrete pipes, casings and fittings and general steel materials; and
Cvi) 10OZ of expenditures or 100% of ex-factory price for PVC pipes and
fittings and submersible pumps and ancillaries. Disbursements for works
constructed by departmental forces and for payments of less than Rs 300,000
for works and Rs 150,000 for goods itemized by sub-project, and for extension
staff costs may be made against certificates of expenditure.
4.10    Disbursement for completed shallow tubewells and open dug wells would
be made against certificates of expenditure submitted by GOWB, itemized by
major components including the cost of energization. The disbursement
request for completed deep tubevells or RLIs would also include a certified
statement by the Superintending Engineer in charge that: (i) all works have
been completed in accordance with the agreed siting, planning and design
criteria; and (ii) the tubevell or RLI has been electrified. Documentation
for these works would be retained by GOWB and made available for inspection
by IDA during review missions. Full documentation would be required for all
other disbursements.
4.11    The estimated schedule of expenditure is given in Table T-8.  The
semi-annual disbursement schedule and the proposed allocation of the proceeds
of the credit are presented in Table T-9. Only expenditures occuring upto
March 31, 1990 will be eligible for reimbursement and it is expected that
disbursements would be completed by March 31, 1991. The schedule of O&M



-27-
expenditures is given in Table 8, Annex 3. The expected rate of disburse-
ments for the first three years of project implementation follows the typical
disbursement profile in the Indian irrigation sector, after which, the rate
of disbursement remains constant since implementation of project components
would probably continue under the AED long term development program.
Accounts and Audits
4.12    The project would be subject to normal Government control and audit-
ing procedures. A resident Audit Officer, representing the State Accountant
General (AG) would audit the project accounts. Although continuous and
annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the finalization is a
lengthy process during which the Statutory Audit Report is presented to the
State Legislature. It would be essential therefore to have interim state-
ments of account certified as to accuracy and authenticity by an independent
competent auditor. Such statements, certified by the AG or his designate,
supported by an itemized account and a summary of the expenditures, would be
submitted to IDA as soon as possible after the end of each fiscal year.
Agreements have beer. reached with GOWB that it would cause the AED, the DOA
and the WBSEB to: (i) maintain separate accounts on project expenditures kept
in accordance with sound accounting principles and procedures; (ii) have
these accounts and financial statements certified as to their accuracy and
authenticity annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and make the
resulting interim statements of account available to IDA as soon as possible,
but not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year; (iii) have
the project accounts audited annually in accordance with sound auditing
principles and submit the audit report to IDA as soon as available; and
(iv) make available complete accounts and financial statements to IDA for
inspection during project review. In aadition, an agreement has been reached
with GOWB that it would cause the AED to maintain separate accounts for O&M
expenditures in such a manner that the O&M costs of works constructed under
the project can be identified.
'V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01    Once the irrigation service can be measured and made predictable
through improved technologies, management can be made more effective. Per-
formance of management staff can be evaluated and beneficiaries can assess
whether they are getting the service promised. In particular, management
improvements can be structured to focus on specific measures to set standards
of responsibility and accountability and introduce incentives in management
procedures. Thus, under the project, GOWB plans to: (i) strengthen the
agencies responsible for execution and management of the project works;
(ii) establish procedures to use village panchayats as 'management agents'
for the shallow tubewell and open dugwell components; and (iii) establish
procedures to monitor progress of project implementation and realization of
project benefits.



-28-
Project Organization
5.02    Overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with the
Secretary for Minor Irrigation (MIS). The Agricultural Engineering Direc-
torate (AED) under his jurisdiction, would be the main agency responsible for
project implementation; the AED constructs, operates and maintains river lift
installations and public groundwater irrigation schemes throughout the State.
The WB State Electricity Board (WBSEB) is responsible for construction,
operation and maintenance of power transmission and transformation under the
project. In addition to the construction agencies, the Department of
Agriculture (DOA) would be responsible for the agricultural extension com-
ponent and for the agricultural development activities after minor irrigation
works are commissioned. The WB State Water Investigation Directorate (SWID)
would be responsible for assessing surface and groundwater resources and for
clearance of any groundwater development. The Department of Panchayats (DP),
through village panchayats would be involved in the project as 'management
agents' for the AED (para 5.11).
5.03    Proiect Co-ordination and Accountina.  The Chief Engineer of the AED
would be appointed to act as Project Co-ordinator (PC), reporting directly to
the Secretary of Minor Irrigation (Chart C-4). He will be responsible for
the day-to-day coordination at the working level between the participating
agencies. The PC would be assisted by a Project Co-ordinating Unit (PCU) and
a Project Accounting Unit (PAU) which would be set up exclusively for the
project. The PCU will draw up annual implementation and development
programs; prepare project reports and summaries of monitoring and evaluation
studies; and formulate and maintain an information link to project
beneficiaries and other agencies involved in the project. The PAU would work
closely with the PCU and would be responsible for project accounts and
accounting; requests for project financial provisions; and collation of
expenditures for reimbursement from IDA. Agreements have been reach.d with
GOrB that by June 30, 1985, it would: (i) set up and thereafter maintain a
Project Co-ordinating Unit and a Project Accounting Unit within the AED; and
(ii) appoint a suitably qualified and experienced Officer to head the Project
Co-ordinating Unit and act directly under the Project Co-ordinator.
The Agricultural Enzineering Directorate (AED)
5.04    Existing Organization.  The main implementing agency would be the
AED, which was set up with agricultural engineering rather than minor irriga-
tion as its main activity. It was structured with two separate professional
cadres - Agricultural-Irrigation (A-I) and Agricultural-Mechanical (A-X) --
with demarcation of posts within the organization to reflect recruitment
qualifications and thus protect career prospects of the staff in each cadre;
this has resulted in an inflexible organization structure which cannot effi-
ciently respond to variations in the AED work load. The (A-I) cadre has been
made responsible for tubewell operations and the (A-M) cadre for river lift
installations (RLIs); staff from one cadre do not undertake work allocated to
the other cadre. In addition, there is no formal separation of construction
and O&M activities within the AED; consequently it is difficult to pinpoint
responsibility for O&M works and administrative costs of various AED
activities cannot be easily identified. At field level, most existing works



-29-
cannot provide a reliable and predictable irrigation service; since perfor-
mance cannot be checked, inefficient management practices have developed
partic- ulary overmanning amongst DTI and ELI operators who are strongly
unionized.
5.05    The AED is headed by a Chief Engineer (CE) assisted by an Additional
CE. At State level, operating from the Calcutta headquarters, there are
three units, each headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE), responsible for
Investigation and Planning, Resources Procurement, and Monitoring and Evalua-
tion; in addition, there is a Design Division headed by an Executive Engineer
(EE). In the field, there are four (A-T) Circles and four (A-M) Circles with
territorial responsibilities for both construction and O&M activities. The
SEs have responsiblity for a circle; a SE oversees four to six EEs who each
head a division. The EEs are assisted by two to seven Assistant Engineers
(AE), each responsible for a sub-division. Typical divisions are structured
and staffed based on financial workload norms of Rs 10 M per year for con-
struction or about Rs 4.0 M per year for O&M activities.
5.06    Proposed Or2anization.  The GOWB has recognized the problems within
the AED and concurrent with introduction of new technologies, plans to
improve the management process. This will require short and long-term
actions. As a first step, construction and O&M activities would be divided
such the responsibility of individual staff and work units can be fully
defined in terms of physical workload. Second, organization and staffing
requirements would be estimated using physical rather than financial norms to
define the workload which could be efficiently undertaken by a fully staffed
division or sub-division (Annex 9, SDV). The organization structure over the
project period has thus been formulated in terms of the sub-divisional
requirements for construction and O&M for each type of irrigation system
implemented or managed by the AED. A typical division is assumed to have
four sub-divisions which could be either construction or O&M. The provi-
sional organization build-up is given on Table T-10 and shown on Chart C-4.
5.07    At headquarters, the existing Investigation, Planning and Design
(IPD) Wing would be strengthened under a Chief Engineer (Agriculture) to
manage statewide activities. Within the IPD Wing, there would be five units
involved in project activities. An Investigation and Planning (MP) Unit
would coordinate all aspects of planning, formulate project principles and
criteria and set construction specifications. The existing R&D unit would be
strengthened and be responsible for the R&D component (para 3.33). The
existing Design Unit would be strengthened and would prepare detailed or type
designs for all project works. The I&P and Design Units would also be
responsible for the Design and O&M Manuals to be prepared under the project
(para 5.23). The existing Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit would be
strengthened (para 5.25). A Project Training (PT) Unit would be established
for in-staff training (para 5.22) and for organizing study tours provided
under the project. Also at headquarters, the existing Resources Procurement
(RP) Unit under a SE would be strengthened and be responsible for all
procurement under the project. The RP unit would also be expanded to include
a Quality Control Unit responsible for all aspects of quality control during
the construction and commissioning phases of the proiect program.



-30-
5.08    At field level, each of the (A-I) or (A-M) Circles would have three
or four divisions divided into construction or 0&M sub-divisions depending on
workload within the territorial comand of the circle. A typical construc-
tion sub-division would be responsible for drilling wells, constructing pump
houses and distribution chambers, installing pumping equipment, laying out
pipelines to valve outlets, and construction of field channels. It would
also be responsible for commissioning new project works and would design and
supervise the setting up of the rotational system of water distribution in
each well or RLI command area (para 5.17).  The O&K sub-divisions would be
responsible for all aspects of O&M of project DTWs and RLIs (para 5.20). A
group of about 25 deep tubewells (or 25 clusters of tubewells with each
cluster commanding 36 to 40 ha) would be supervised by a Sub-Assistant
Engineer (SAE); in some cases, an SAE may be responsible for a central divi-
sional store and vorkshop. The project vorks are scattered and for O&M staff
to function effectively, transportation would be provided (either owned by
the AED or leased) with at least one jeep per division with O&M responsiblity
and motorcycles for AEs and ASEs primarily responsible for O&M.
5.09    The AED staffing requirements through the project period are shown
in Table T-11. Project staff would be available either through transfer
within the AED or through recruitment, depending on overall staffing require-
ments of the AED through the project period. Agreements have been reached
with GOWB that it would: (i) sanction and fill staff positions and provide
the necessary funding in accordance with an organization structure and staff-
ing schedule acceptable to IDA, such that the AED can carry out the project
program; (ii) sanction and deploy sufficient O&H staff so that the project
works can be operated and maintained in a manner satisfactory to IDA; and
(iii) train such staff so that the AUD can carry out the project program
and operate and maintain the project works.
5.10    In the long-term, more fundamental structural changes may enable the
AED efficiency to be improved beyond that achieved under the sort term
actions (para 5.06). To facilitate such improvements, the GOWB will retain
qualified Management Consultants to undertake a comprehensive Management
Study of the AED in accordance with terms of reference agreed with IDA
(Annex 4). In this respect, agreements have been reached with GOWB that it
would: (i) undertake a Management Study of AED in accordance with terms of
reference agreed with IDA; (ii) submit a report summarizing the results and
recommendations of the study to IDA for review by September 30, 1986; and
(iii) taking into account IDA's comments, to carry out the recommendations of
the study according to an agreed timetable. One of the main tasks under the
study will be to evaluate the (A-1) and (A-M) cadre issues within the AED
(para 5.04), and formulate practical actions to resolve the problems. Fur-
thermore, the study has been scheduled so that before the recommendations are
finalized, locations of new works under the project will be fixed in suffi-
cient detail to finalize the organization structure and staffing requirements
at the local level. This information would be available before December
1985, and thus recommedations of the Management Study would be based on
detailed siting of works and a specific work program through the project
period.



-31-
Proiect Manatement
5.11    Role of Panchavats.  An important element of the GOWB rural develop-
ment strategy is to increase the role of panchayats (village level elected
councils) in the program; the panchayat system is described in Annex 9, SDV.
The panchayats in West Bengal are strong, well organized and hold regular
elections. The GOWB wants to take advantage of this grass root organization
to help overcome lack of motivation and flexibility within line departments
and eliminate inefficiencies which often occur when government departments
undertake minor work programs spread over large areas. The GOWB argues that
local panchayats have a strong incentive to satisfy as many beneficiaries as
possible since panchayat committees are elected bodies and each farmer has
a vote. In addition, panchayats are primarily interested in performance of
works within their territory and are thus able and prepared to enforce
accountability. Using panchayats as 'management agents' would be an effec-
tive way to break the power of government employed operators -- one of the
most important causes of inefficient operation at present.
5.12    The essential safeguard would be to retain the AED in a supervisory
role with the right to take over direct management if a panchayat proved
unable or unwilling to do an effective job. In addition, any accounts
managed by panchayats and used for project activities would be audited on a
half yearly basis following established Panchayat Department procedures with
audit reports submitted to the AED for review and approval. Thus, the risks
associated with using panchayats as ,'management agents' for project works are
small since the panchayats' role would be carefully defined and limited to
their proven capability.
5.13    Deep Tubewells and River Lift Installations.  The improved technology
for EDTWs, MDTWs and ELIs would consist of automated w.tll or pump source and
a closed pipe distribution system serving valve outlets or spouts which are
opened and closed by farmers (para 3.18). The technology enables groups of
farmers served by any spout to assess whether they are receiving their cor-
rect allocation of water in terms of quality and quantity. Stream size is
fixed by the technology and so the only variable which has to be monitored is
the time and timing of their turn. Since the systems would be farmer
operated, record keeping and reporting breakdowns woul_ become the main role
of the AED operator. Furthermore, since records kept by the operator can be
cross-checked, for the first time in WB, his performance can be independently
monitored. The improved technology will enable GOWB to employ less qualified
operators with only one operator employed at each site instead of an operator
and assistant at present; thus the O&M costs of operating staff will be
considerably reduced compared to those of existing works. With respect to
new and existing DTWs and RLIs, GOWB may use local panchayats as paymaster
for any operator employed by AED within the panchayat jurisdiction. At
present, operators are paid through the local Block Development Officer (BDO)
who cannot check if the operator is working effectively. The proposed arran-
gements would mean every AED operator would be paid through the local elected
body representing the beneficiaries being served.
5.14    Shallow Tubewells.  The STW technology is relatively simple and the
limited O&M activities can be undertaken at local level. The STWs would be
owned by the AED which would use the local panchayat to manage the wells.



-32-
O&M funds would be allocated to the panchayat to pay for the energy bills,
maintenance costs and for one operator (to be known as an Irrigation Assis-
tant) per cluster of wells recruited by the panchayat. The panchayat would
also keep records of revenue from water charges, which would be collected
by the revenue authorities through appropriate collection channels to be
decided by GOWB; initially water charges would be set at the same level as
for existing works. The GOWB proposes a three year transition period during
which the panchayat performance would be supervised and monitored by the AED.
Once the local panchayat has proved that it is responsible and capable, the
STWs would be fully handed over. Panchayat involvement in the management
structure will introduce responsibility, accountability and incentives at the
local level. Beneficiaries will have direct access to staff responsible for
the various activities and, in particular, the operator can be checked by
both his direct supervisor (the Panchayat Committee) and the farmers he
serves. The management structure also requires that records be kept and
evaluated at the local level including expenditure and revenue information;
this will encourage accountability of paid staff (and indirectly the AED)
since inefficiencies would reflect on village development finances. The GOWB
is also considering other incentives to reward efficiency; for example, if
panchayats operate and maintain their scheme effectively, keep within budget
allocations and maintain complete records on a regular basis, they would be
allocated more minor irrigation development. Should a panchayat fail as
management agent, the AED would take direct responsiblity for O&M and action
would be taken through the Department of Panchayats to sort out the problems
or strengthen the local panchayat. In this way, a secondary project benefit
would be to test and strengthen village panchayats for other local rural
development.
5.15    Open DuRwells. The ODWs would be sited with AED technical assistance
and construction would be organized by the panchayat (samity level) super-
vised by AED. Initially, one cluster of ODWs would be allocated to each
qualifying panchayat. Within the comand area of each well, every farmer
would be given an equal share to the well irrespective of land holding size.
Either farmers would be given the opportunity (and be paid) to undertake any
unskilled labor necessary to build the well or, alternatively, local labor
contractors would be used. A siting condition of the well would be farmers-
agreement to these conditionalities. Farmers would be encouraged to use
savings from the money earnt to purchase (or make the down payment for) a
,mobile' diesel pump set to be commonly owned by the farmers served; alterna-
tively, the panchayat might purchase a pump. In this way for most clusters
of ODWs, the farmers will have a pump set when wells are commissioned. The
'farmer construction scheme is attractive because it provides employment
opportunities in areas where jobs are seldom available before labor require-
ments build up on the irrigated areas.
5.16    The ODW scheme would be easy to monitor by the AED since each
panchayat and group of beneficiaries would be given a detailed plan of
action. The arrangement has obvious built-in incentives for the
beneficiaries. The incentive for the panchayats would be an offer of funding
for further ODW clusters if they successfully complete and bring into opera-
tion the first cluster of ODWs; it is expected that local pressure from other
farmers who want wells will encourage panchayats to perform effectively. It
is also expected that the ODW program would encourage institutional credit
activity in areas of WB which have been difficult to reach. Long-term credit



-33-
would be needed for purchase of pump sets for those well clusters where labor
earnings are insufficient to buy the pump set outright; short term credit
would be needed for other agricultural inputs.
Operation and Maintenance
5.17    Water Allocation.  At present, in IB, public minor irrigation works
are operated 'on-dmand'.  Cultivators make a pre-season application (and
pre-payment) for water for specific areas of nominated crops.  The area of
crop actually irrigated is checked periodically during the season.  Water
supply generally exceed demand but shortages can occur when the whole command
is under ,boro' paddy in the rabi season. Such shortages are dealt with on
an ad-hoc basis often to the detriment of the weaker farmers or those fur-
thest from the water source. The improved distribution systems for project
works will enable allocation or entitlement to water on the basis of area of
holding. Payment of water can thus be based on quantity used, measured in
terms of hours of delivery to the cultivator. The GOWB proposes to continue
with the 'on-demand' water allocation but in periods of water shortage to
impose allocation proportional to holding size. The GOWB also proposes under
the R&D program to test and evaluate water allocation and distribution on a
per hectare basis, with water charges based on actual water use (para 7.16).
5.18    Operating PrinciDles.  Operation of DTWs and RLIs would depend on the
method of water allocation adopted. Where this is by application of
individual cultivators (as at present), schedules would be established for
each outlet based on authorized areas and type of crops to be irrigated by
the cultivators supplied by that outlet. Distribution within the group of
cultivators (generally not more than ten per outlet) would be set by estab-
lished schedules, but with considerable freedom of interchange between neigh-
bors. During periods of shortage, water supply would be allocated on the
basis of area of holding. The method of operation successfully demonstrated
under the UP Public Tubevell Project (Cr. 1332-IN) would be followed: namely
to organize cultivators served by a distribution loop into seven groups, each
taking water for a fixed day of the week (either from a single outlet, or
from two or more outlets sequentially if more convenient for the group com-
mand area). Water distribution within the group would be largely decided by
the group members. The operation of MiDTWs would follow the same principles
as HDTWs. Low capacity DTWs and STWs would operate as for a group of farmers
served by an outlet on a large tubewe-ll. Each farmer would take the whole
water supply in turn either on a 'demand' or 'allocated supply' basis depend-
ing on whether supply exceeds demand.
5.19    Some degree of interruption of delivery schedules due to transmission
line breakdowns or power outages is to be expected. However, with reliable
power supply in most parts of WB, interruptions should be infrequent enough
to be accomodated without change of basic rotational schedules to outlets.
5.20    Maintenance Criteria.  Each group of about 25 DTWs or RLIs would be
under the responsibility of a SAE who would have the continuous services of
skilled mechanics to provide the maintenance service for individual tubewells
or RLIs. Each 06& work unit (para 5.08) would have access to an adequately
equipped workshop for maintenance of pumps, prime movers and switch gear,
plus adequate transport. Workshop stores would generally hold at least 10Z



-34-
spares against pump turbines, prime movers and ancillary electric equipment.
As part of routine maintenance and at half yearly intervals, pump discharges
would be checked and turbine impellors replaced if low discharges indicate
wear; well discharge and drawdown would also be checked and tubewells
rehabilitated if the discharge/drawdown relationship indicates deterioration
of performance.
5.21    Farmers  Organization. An importan- task of the SAE in charge of a
cluster of tubewells (DTWs and STWs) or BLIs would be to assist in organizing
farmers. Farmers within each area served by a delivery point would form a
spout committee of three representatives to supervise water distribution
within their command area as per authorized schedule and elect a repre-
sentative to represent them on the Tubewell or RLI Committee to be set up
under the guidance of the GOWB. The Tubewell or ELI Committee would elect a
President and a Secretary and would be responsible for coordination and
cooperation among spout committees, for solving disputes, and for liaising
with concerned SAE (OM) responsible for the installation or with the local
panchayat committees where STlWs are managed by panchayats.
Other Proiect Management Activities
5.22    Training.  Staff training organized by the Project Training Unit
(para 5.07) would be required for: (i) planning and design of improved
tubewell and river lift systems; (ii) water allocation, land acquisition
procedures and legal parameters affecting project works; and (iii) the O&M of
completed works. Training would be necessary because the automatic well
operation and pipe distribution systems under the project are unfamiliar to
many engineering staff. A pre-requisite to the training program would be the
compilation of the Design and O&M Manuals. The training would be
,in-service', directed by senior AED officers and other experts.  The courses
would include lectures, discussions, case studies, and fiel_ trips. Junior
staff would be trained for about three weeks and senior staff for one week.
For senior staff, courses in improved management procedures would be prepared
under the AED Management Study (para 5.10). Details of the training programs
are provided in Annex 11, SDV.
5.23    Design and O&M Manuals.  The improved minor irrigation technology
systems have been demonstrated under the UP Public Tubewell Projects. Thus,
sufficient information is available to prepare: Ci) a comprehensive Design
Manual which would record planning principles and design criteria for the new
tubewell technology together with construction practices to implement the
works; and (ii) an O&M Manual covering all aspects of management of public
groundwater systems. The manuals would also describe arrangements b3 which
the AED relates with other agencies involved in minor irrigation development.
A provision is made under the project (para 3.34) to assist in the prepara-
tion of the Design and O&M Manuals. An agreement has been reached with GOWB
that it would prepare and submit to IDA for review by December 31, 1985,
drafts of comprehensive Design and O0N Manuals, suitable for field staff
responsible for planning, design and construction and for operating and
maintaining tubewells and RLIs in the State.



-35-
5.24    ProRress Review and Reporting Requirements.  Progress reports would
be prepared by the M&E unit (para 5.07) and be submitted to IDA on a
quarterly basis. Each report would contain brief descriptions of the main
events of the reporting period including construction progress; expenditures
incurred; project staffing status; tenders, evaluation and award of con-
tracts; irrigation potential created; actual areas irrigated; operational
hours of water points; and the power supply situation. Agreements have been
reached with GOWB that it would submit to IDA: (i) project progress reports
on a quarterly basis, commencing October 1, 1985 and within two months after
the end of each reporting period; and (ii) a project completion report, no
later than six months after the closing date of the project.
5.25    Monitorinz and Evaluation (M&E).  The existing M&E unit would be
strengthened at headquarters under the CE (Agriculture) and three field units
set up at regional level (para 5.07). The M&E unit would be responsible for
collecting and analyzing data on project planning, implementation and perfor-
mance particularly with respect to siting of project works and the quantity
and quality of the irrigation service. The unit would also be responsible
for agro-economic monitoring, and undertake data collection for the main
crops under the project during the growth cycle including crop production and
input/crop yield data. The operator at each tubewell or river lift system
would assist the M&E unit by keeping daily and seasonal records which reflect
aspects of agricultural performance. Details of the M&E requirements of the
r-oject are given in Annex 11, SDV.  Agreements have been reached with GOWB
that through the AED, (i) not later than September 30, 1985, it would prepare
a draft work plan for M&E activities under the project; (ii) taking into
consideration the Associations' comments, carry out the work plan; and
(iii) commencing July 1, 1986, review the work plan annually in consultation
with IDA and, if necessary, revise the work plan accordingly.
5.26    One of the main N&E tasks will be to carry out baseline studies to
enable project impact to be evaluated. The studies would be undertaken in
three stages.  First, an initial baseline study of the present situation
would be made for representative sample areas to be developed with each type
of technology under the project. Data would also be collected outside the
project area so that the 'future without' project situation can be assessed.
Second, the areas evaluated under the initial baseline study would then be
monitored on a regular and routine basis by the M&E staff. In this respect,
the M&E unit would prepare regular reports of its activities after data from
each kharif and rabi cropping season has been processed. An important
monitoring task will be to verify that the project target groups (para 3.02)
are indeed reached. Finally, in the year prior to project completion, data
collection under the initial baseline study would be repeated so that project
impact can be evaluated. The conclusions with supporting data of the final
study would be submitted as part of the Project Completion Report (para
5.24).
5.27    To assist the GOWB with M&E activities under the project, the AED
would retain either qualified local Consultants or an appropriate government
agency to: (i) undertake the initial baseline survey and based on the survey
conclusions assist AED formulate a M&E program to be undertaken by M&E staff
on a regular basis; (ii) advise on preparation of data collection sheets;
frequency of data collection; sample selection and sizing; evaluation



-36-
methods; management use of proceeded data; and feedback procedures so that
results can be past back through the various levels of AED staff; and
(iii) assist the AED with agro-economic studies required for the Project
Completion Report. In this respect, agreements have been reached with GOWB
that it would: Ci) carry out a baseline agro-economic survey the project
with terms of reference established in consultation with IDA; (ii) submit to
IDA for its review and comments, by July 31, 1987, a report summarizing the
results and conclusions reached under the study; and (iii) taking into
account the IDA's comments, carry out any further monitoring and evaluation
recommended under the study such that project impact can be fully evaluated.
West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB)
5.28    The WBSEB is responsible for the construction and O&M of rural elec-
trification works in the State including the connections to public tubewells.
An Additional Chief Engineer (ACE) plans and monitors the progress of both
general RE works and also special schemes financed by the Rural Electrifica-
tion Corporation (BEC). At field level, where there are sufficient REC
works, WBSEB positions an Assistant Engineer (AE) with responsibility only
for construction of these works. At present, if a new public tubewell falls
within a special REC scheme area, energization of that well would be under-
taken as part of the REC scheme; in areas outside a REC scheme, the AE (O&M)
in whose jurisdiction the new tubewell is located is responsible for the
connection as part of his routine O&M activities. Supervision of all con-
struction works is carried out by the OEM Executive and Superintending
Engineers under the control of the zonal Chief Engineers.
VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. MARKET PROSPECT AND PRICES
Cropping Patterns
6.01    Experience with minor irrigation development in WE has shown that
cropping patterns would generally follow present practices with choice of
crops depending on soil types, availability of irrigation water, and for cash
crops, access to ready markets. The main crops are described in para 2.12
and present and expected future cropping patterns are shown in Table T-5.
Present cropping patterns and yields are based on data collected by either
the AED or Revenue Department; future cropping patterns are based on perfor-
mance of farmers with predictable irrigation supplies. Choice of crops with
reliable irrigation depends primarily on soil types, the three dominant types
being: Ci) heavy soils which are low lying but not subject to flooding;
(ii) medium textured soils in the main potato growing zones; and (iii) light
soils of the higher lands which are generally sandy loams to loams.
6.02    In the kharif season, for all soil types, aman paddy would be the
main crop; limited areas would be put to vegetables, sesame or mung where
there is access to a good market. Kharif paddy requires supplementary
irrigation in years of low rainfall or when there are breaks in the monsoon.
Availability of a reliable irrigation service would encourage farmers to grow
early HYV varieties of paddy (100-120 days) transplanted in July. In the
rabi season, most crops would be fully irrigated; paddy would be grown on the
heavier soils but it is expected that wheat would become a more important



-37-
crop. The harvesting dates of early kharif paddy would enable an earlier
planting of wheat and other rabi crops with a resultant increase in wheat
yields and decrease in water requirements. On medium soils, in the rabi
season, potato is a major cash crop, particularly in areas with cold storage
facilities or access to ready markets. In the pre-kharif or hot season, on
medium and light soils, jute would be the main crop with aus paddy on the
heavier soils. The double cropping of paddy on heavy soils eliminates the
chance of a hot season crop.
6.03    The 'future without' project situation would be the same as the
,'present' situation and takes into account siting criteria for project works
under which most beneficiaries would be small or marginal farmers.  It is
assumed that these farmers would continue to follow rainfed cropping patterns
even if they have access to protective irrigation by renting water from
owners of private irrigation sources. The irrigated area from private sour-
ces is difficult to evaluate in terms of the project analysis because, at
present, any area that receives even less than one complete watering is
recorded as ,'irrigated.'
6.04    Cropping patterns for the 'future with' project situation take into
account five major factors: (i) the preference of farmers to grow paddy;
(ii) the area irrigated from private sources; (iii) the capacity constraint
of the irrigation service particularly with respect to land preparation and
transplanting of paddy in the wet season; (iv) the optimum time for wheat
sowing in the dry season; and (v) the socio-economic potential of the farmers
served. Under the project, in the kharif season, paddy would continue to be
the dominant crop. With improved water distribution and regulation, it is
assumed that the area cultivated with local paddy varieties would decline
while the area cropped with BYV paddy would increase. For areas served by
project works, average cropping intensity at full development (Table T-5) has
been estimated at about 200% as compared with about 110X at present.
Crop Yields
6.05    Present yields of all crops cultivated by most farmers to be served
under the project are low because of the random and unreliable rainfall and a
justifiable reluctance to invest in modern inputs. Farmers follow rainfed
agricultural practices and tend to use local varieties even if they are able
to purchase water from private irrigation sources to deal with critical
drought periods. Applications of fertilizer and plant protection chemicals
are limited primarily because of cash resources and the heavy risks involved.
As a result, all rainfed (and even irrigated) crops produce low yields. No
increase in HYV paddy and wheat yields would be possible in the 'future
without' situation since farmers are unlikely to improve the quality of seeds
or apply improved methods of cultivation. In the 'future with' project
situation, yields of HYV paddy are estimated to reach 3.0 to 4.0 ton/ha
depending on the crop season, local paddy varieties 2.2 ton/ha; wheat
2.2 ton/ha; sesame 1.5 ton/ha; and oilseeds 1.0 ton/ha. The yield of
potatoes is estimated to be about 20 ton/ha. These irrigated crop yields
reflect efficient water regulation, and moderate improvements compared to
present irrigated agricultural practises with respect to land preparation,
use of fertilizer, quality of seed used, weed and pest control, cultivation



-38-
and planting techniques, and timeliness of harvest and threshing. The-crop
yields also assume the degree of under irrigation presently practiced in WB
on holdings with private irrigation sources and a moderately effective
agricultural extension service. Estimates of crop yields and production are
summarized in Table T-1l.
Input Requirements
6.06    Present use of fertilizer and plant protection chemicals by the
majority of potential project beneficiaries is minimal and is mostly limited
to paddy, wheat and maize. Even farmers with their own irrigation sources
and the potential to apply full crop water requirements use only about a
third of the recommended chemical inputs. Very few farmers use good quality
seeds (paddy, wheat and maize); most farmers meet their seed requirements
from their previous harvests. The average farmer owns one pair of draft
animals which provide adequate farm power for the small size holdings and
general farming practices.
6.07    Present and projected input requirements are presented in Annex 6,
SDV and reflect the low income group being reached by the project. Crop
yields used in the project analysis correspond with the assumed moderate
input levels. On average, existing facilities would be sufficient to meet
the small projected increase in input demand over present statewide consump-
tion but there may be local shortfalls in some areas once project tubewell
clusters become fully operational.
6.08    Future requirements of fertilizers and pesticides will depend on
availability rather than marketing and distribution. Since the declared (and
to date successfully pursued) policy of GOI is to bring on stream new fer-
tilizer plants and to increase importation of fertilizer and pesticide
materials not locally manufactured, the project input requirements shouid be
secure. The additional fodder and crop by-products under the project will
ensure that animal draft pover will continue to be adequate for the project's
needs. No labor shortages are expected in the project command areas, since
the project works will be scattered throughout the State, and there is con-
siderable unemployment in the rural areas.
Market ProsDects and Prices (Annex 2)
6.09    The project area covers most of WE and therefore the potential market
is large. Production increase, although substantial percentage-wise and in
terms of the immediate areas developed, is small in relation to the market.
Marketing of surplus produce is not expected to pose any significant problem
since the established trading system through private dealers and Government
markets would take care of disposing the surplus. Many small farmers mav
continue to receive unfavorable prices because they sell crops at harvest
time for want of suitable storage and in order to repay crop loans. It is
envisaged that the project would generate the need for more storage capacity
at local cooperatives to allow farmers to store their produce for some time
and thus benefit from higher seasonal prices.



-39-
6.10    No major changes in the relative crop prices are foreseen because
prices are largely determined by seasonal suppLy and demand pattern. The
Government's price supports for rice and wheat have been particularly effec-
tive in maintaining sufficient incentive for farmers, while keeping the real
price to consumers fairly stable. It has therefore been assumed that future
farmgate prices (in constant terms) for paddy and wheat would follow the
official procurement prices in 1984 of about Rs. 1800/ton and Rs. 1750/ton
for paddy and wheat respectively. Jute would continue to follow
well-established farmgate prices in the areas where it is the major crop
(about Rs. 2,250/ton in 1984). Prices for potatoes, vegetables and other
minor crops would follow market trends depending on location and on produc-
tion and demand in any year.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
General
7.01    Project works will be sited where most beneficiaries are farmers with
small holdings equal or less than 1.0 ha who would not normally be able to
develop an irrigation source at their own expense. In addition, the project
will cover most of WB and thus individual command areas will have a wide
range of climatic, soil and agronomic conditions throughout the State. There-
fore, in assessing the project's impact on typical farmers' incomes, it is
assumed that: (i) soil type can vary within the command area of individual
works; (ii) a farm will be about 1.0 ha with a number of separate parcels of
the same soil type; and (iii) the holding would at present be non-irrigated.
The main characteristics have been generated from socio-economic surveys and
data obtained from other minor irrigation development in WB supported by the
Bank Group (para 1.16) with further evidence provided by GOWB staff. The
detailed assumptions and crop budgets used in formulating model farm budgets
are given in Annex 2.
7.02    It is assumed that all types of tubewells would provide an irrigation
service of the same quantity and quality. With respect to RLIs, the comple-
tion of the distribution systems and conversion to electric powered pumps
would double the command area and improve the quality and reliability of the
irrigation service within the existing irrigated command of the RLI. The
ODWs under the project are located in areas where farm holdings will be
smaller then 1.0 ha and fragmented and beneficiaries will be mainly from
scheduled castes and tribes. The project provides for construction of wells
in both hard rock and alluvial areas designed so that they can be mechanized
by use of a small mobile pump set. To assess the impact of ODWs, it is
assumed that for manually operated open wells, limited water supplies would
restrict farmers to growing a small area (0.25 ha) of high value cash crops
(potatoes or vegetables). An assessment has also been made of the impact
when typical ODWs are mechanized; in this assessment, the pumping cost has
been treated as a farm input with an agricultural production impact as for
tubewells on medium soil types.
Farm Incomes
7.03    Average farm incomes from crop production before payment of water
charges assume that most farmers will move from rainfed to full irrigated
agriculture under the project. It is also assumed that without the project,



-40-
these farmers could not afford their own irrigation sources and thus their
real incomes would continue to stagnate at present levels. Even though, they
may be able to 'rent' water from private tubewell owners to protect their
crops under drought conditions, it is assumed that the limited irrigation
service would have only the marginal effect of making .'rainfed' crop yields
more reliable.
7.04    With the above assumptions, three model farm budgets for heavy,
medium and light soil types have been examined to assess the impact of
irrigation on farm incomes. It is expected that improvements in farm incomes
from crop production for actual farms would vary considerably depending on
location within the State. However, the farm location within a tubewell
command will not affect the quality of irrigation service. The likely impact
for the representative farms is summarized in Table T-13 and detailed in
Annex 2 (Tables 3 to 6). The increase in farm incomes from crop production
before payment of water charges would average about 170X for project works
other than ODWs, about 220% for ODWs without pumpsets and about 250X for
mechanized ODWs. Total family income would rise only about 140% since it
includes income from other sources which is assumed to remain constant.
Imuact on Poverty
7.05    For farmers without a private irrigation source in the project area,
annual incomes per capita 'with' and .'without' the project are estimated as
follows:
Farm Model                       Per CaRita Income (Rs) a/
Holding     Soil        Farm    Other    Total    Farm    Other    Total
Size       Type   -' Future without'-             --'  Future with'---
(ha)
1.00       Heavy       480      140        620     1,300   140      1,440
1.00       Medium      530      140        670      1,310   140     1,450
1.00       Light       340      140        680     1,000   140      1,140
a/ A typical household size is taken as 5.7 members.
This compares to an estimated average State per capita income of about
Rs 1,680. Thus none of the farm types presently reacb the State average
income level, although individual farms within project command areas may
exceed it. Based on a minimum caloric requirement of 2,100 Kcal. per capita
worth of about Rs 740 at present farmgate prices, and other minimum consump-
tion requirements of about Rs 260 per capita, the poverty line for project
impact areas can be taken as Rs 1,000 per zapita. On these assumptions, at
present, most farm households and almost all the farming population live
below this poverty line.
7.06    At full development, for farmers served by RLIs and tubewells the
average per capita income before water charges would increase by about
Rs 690. However, all farms would not benefit equally from this increase.
Only farming units above about 0.70 ha would exceed the poverty level. Thus,
even assuming all farmers could obtain predicted cropping intensities and
yields at full development, about 50% of the farming population cultivating
20% of the land within a typical project tubewell command would still live
under poverty conditions.  For farmers served by unmechanized ODWs, average



-41-
income would increase by Rs 650/ha. Only farmers with ODWs growing high
vaue cash crops with an easily accessible market would exceed the poverty
level.
7.07    A primary project concern will be to assist farmers to obtain the
other inputs necessary to generate the incremental crop production possible
with reliable irrigation; in particular, those farmers who may be unable to
generate a reliable income from crop production to sustain their families and
provide sufficient cash flow to buy inputs for modern irrigated agriculture.
It appears that for most small and marginal farmers (land owners or tenants),
either farming is a secondary income to other activities or they rent addi-
tional land which can be developed as envisaged under the project. The
analysis assumes that some small farmers grow crops for home consumption
utilizing project facilities to the extent that their cash budget allows.
Thus, in terms of formulating a cost recovery policy and appropriate water
charges, consideration must be given to the weaker elements of the project
population; that is those farm families that may remain below the poverty
line even with full development benefits. To achieve this objective, GOIVB
would carry out a study of farmers benefitting from the project. The study
would be undertaken by the M&E Unit of the AED (para 5.26) assisted by the
DOA and would: (i) evaluate the extent that weaker elements of the project
population are able to fully utilize the irrigation service and to purchase
other inputs necessary to achieve full development benefits; and (ii) formu-
late proposals to enable the full development benefits of the project to be
achieved in a timely manner.
Capital and O&M Costs
7.08    For purposes of cost recovery, the estimated project costs have been
adjusted and separated into two parts. Fixed Costs include the capital cost
of constructing the project irrigation works and costs for those items (such
as pump units) which need to be replaced after some time; they also include
fixed O&H Costs which do not vary appreciably with tubewell operating hours.
The only variable cost is electricity which is a function of pump unit
utilization. Annual costs including assumptions of annual operating hours
for typical project irrigation works are detailed in Table T-12 and are
summarized as follows:
System Type

/b Assuming 1,800 hours anuual operation.
/c Discounted at 12Z interest over a 30 year period.



-42-
Ideally, and if full cost recovery were the target, farmers would be charged
on a volumetric basis at a price equal to the long-run marginal cost of
pumping jj in addition to a flat rate equal to the annuity of fixed costs per
unit area.
Repayment CaDacity of Farmers
7.09    For each farm model (para 7.05), the incremental land rent or project
rent has been estimated. It is defined as incremental income less allowances
for depreciation, use of own resources (family labor and bullock power),
perceived risk and own management services; it thus measures the net incen-
tive of farmers to participate in the project. If the entire project rent
(if known) was taxed away, this would leave a farmer indifferent to par-
ticipating in the project. With assumptions used in the analysis, the
project rent does not exhibit significant variations among the areas with
three main soil types. The estimates of project rent for each type of farm
model are shown in Table T-13. The project rent is calculated for a 'typi-
cal' farming situation and can only be estimated within broad tolerances.
However, as most of the beneficiaries would be small or marginal farmers, it
may not be desirable that a substantial portion of the project rent is made
available for cost recovery.
Present Cost Recoverv
7.10    Background.  The policy of GOWB is to tax the agricultural sector
with due recognition of low income levels in the rural areas. With respect
to minor irrigation, the stated policy objective of GOWB is to provide all
farmers with strong incentives to utilize irrigation in order to benefit the
State through increased crop yields, productivity and increased employment in
rural areas. With the exception of cash crops, surplus incremental produc-
tion reaching the market will be limited, since siting criteria will ensure
that farm holdings reached under the project will be small. Thus, the GOWB
cannot rely on the project generating much revenue through indirect agricul-
ture taxation such as sales tax and the main source of cost recovery from
project beneficiaries with present taxation policies will be water charges.
7.11    Present Water Charges.  In general, the State has made considerable
efforts to rationalize cost recovery from public minor irrigation schemes.
The Government regularly reviews charges and presently has a different level
of charges for kharif and rabi seasons to encourage a greater utilization of
the irrigation service. The State has introduced legislation to charge for
water on a volumetric basis but since the quantity of water delivered cannot
be measured with existing technology, a volumetric water rate is not practi-
cal. Consequently, a notional water requirement for each of the main crops
has been assumed so that the volumetric water charge can be applied on the
irrigated area for each crop. In 1984, the base voAumetric charge was raised
from Rs 1.6 to 5.0 per acre-inch (Rs 0.02 to 0.05/m ) for DTWs and RLIs
resulting in a substantial increase in revenue. Furthermore, the payment
procedure is such that farmers must pay water charges before the crop season
begins thus ensuring ivO0 recovery of assessed water charges from land to be
irrigated.
)j For WB, the long-range marginal cost of power is about Rs 0.85-0.90/kWh
at the sub-station or about Rs 1.00/kWh at the individual tubewell making
allowance for transmission losses.



-43-
7.12    For typical project works which are fully utilized, and with effec-
tive and efficient management, it is estimated that in an average rainfall
year, revenue would cover average O&M costs with the present level of water
charges. However, for existing vorks managed by the AED, water charges do
not cover the O&M charges for three main reasons:
(i)  existing works do not provide reliable, timely and equitable irriga-
tion service and incomplete distribution systems mean that actual
irrigated area is considerably less than potential;
(ii)  O&M costs are excessive because of overmanning particularly at the
operator level; and
(iii)  accounting procedures vithin the AED do not enable management to
pinpoint ineffective and inefficient O&M practices.
In addition to the technical and management problems, all of which are
addressed by the project, the cost recovery system presently used in IB does
not fully take into consideration physical factors which affect the value
of irrigation service provided. First, there are large annual and seasonal
variations in demand and large differences in water requirements for the main
crops depending on climatic/soil conditions. Thus, a system of charges based
on unit irrigated area results in a random rate depending on location and,
more important, encourages farmers to take more water than they need to the
detriment of those further away from the water source. Second, the quality
of the irrigation service provided varies considerably throughout the State,
and since water charges are uniform statewide, the level of charges has to
take into account the value of the poorest service offered.
Cost Recovery under the Project
7.13    The improved technology of new DTWs and modernized RLIs would guaran-
tee reliable, timely and equitable irrigation service. Furthermore, a basic
project objective is to make management improvements to reduce or eliminate
the causes of poor performance and low efficiency of public minor irrigation
in the State. For RLIs and DTWs of improved design under the project, the
quantity of water supplied at the well point would be the same as that reach-
ing the fields because conveyance losses are near zero. This means that
there is a major difference between the service from improved and old stand-
ard minor irrigation systems not only in the quantity of water that each
farmer receives but also in the quality of the irrigation service. In addi-
tion, improved minor irrigation technology would provide an 'on demand'
irrigation service (since the farmer decides when to open his outlet) which
can be charged on a volumetric basis such that revenue is proportional to the
tubewell operating hours. A problem for GOWB is how to charge for access to
a reliable irrigation service in addition to some charge which reflects use
of that service, particularly when project works will be randomly distributed
amongst existing works designed to traditional standards
7.14    The primary concern of the GOWB is that minor irrigation development
should not be a financial burden on the State. On the other hand, the cost
recovery system and level of water charges should provide sufficient incen-
tive to encourage all farmers to fully utilize the irrigation service (par-
ticularly in the kharif season). Thus in formulating an cost recovery
policy, the GOWB will consider three separate but interrelated elements:



-44-
(i) financial monitoring to enable 0J costs and revenue from water charges
to be compared; (ii) an appropriate cost recovery system; and (iii) the level
of water charges.
7.15    Financial Monitoring.  To enable the project management to finan-
cially monitor O&k activities, the existing accounting procedures in the AED
need to be strengthened; this will be undertaken as part of the AED Manage-
ment Study (para 5.10). A priority concern, vill be to collect data to
support the O&M budget request to enable minor irrigation works to be effec-
tively and efficiently operated and maintained such that predicted benefits
can be achieved. In this respect, establishment, energy and maintenance
costs should be accounted for under separate headings. In addition, account-
ing procedures should enable O&M costs for existing new works to be separated
so that costs can be analysed. This will enable GOIvB to establish what
portion of O&M costs are due to inefficiencies in management and/or technical
limitations; the GOWB would then have data to decide how much beneficiaries
are paying for these inefficiencies. Accounts should also be kept in such a
way that GOWB/AED can identify costs of managing a typical installation of
each type of technology as well as the overall minor irrigation program.
With these considerations, the AED will have a basis for setting realistic
0&M cost allocations for the various existing and new works. Finally, the
AED should collect revenue data from water charges on a seasonal basis so
that revenue can be related to W X costs for individual works and by
organizational work units.
7.16    Water Char2e System.  For reasons explained above (para 7.12), an
appropriate water charge system for project works could be different from
that for existing minor irrigation works. The improved technology and water
management arrangements would enable vater charge system for project works to
be based on 'hours of use'. Such a volumetric charge system would be basi-
cally different from the present statewide water charge system (although
implicit in the existing legislation); the practicality of introducing a new
system would have to be checked and cleared at appropriate levels of Govern-
ment. The cost recovery system should provide the opportunity for incentives
to encourage farmers to fully utilize the irrigation service and take account
of repayment capacity of the target group of beneficiaries. To achieve these
objectives, the GOIB would consider a two (or more) tier water charge.
First, there should be a base charge for the service which reflects the
.'opportunity cost' of the service. For improved tubewells and BLIs under the
project, this charge could relate to the average costs of works which enable
all users to have an equal quality of service and a greater quantity of vater
because losses are reduced. Already, the State has legislation to levy a
'betterment' charge which could be used as the proposed base charge. Second,
there should be a volumetric water charge which would provide revenue that is
proportional to tubewell utilization. Since there is insufficient informa-
tion at present to enable GOWB to introduce such a .'tiered' water charge
system, the State will undertake a study to formulate an appropriate policy
and agree a timetable for introducing such a policy; in particular, the study
would take into account the efficiency and reliability of the irrigaticn
service as well as the quantity of water provided. With respect to STWs, it
is expected that charges based on 'hours of operation' vill be adopted when
STWs are finally handed over to panchayat management (para 5.10). Until the
STWs are handed over to the panchayats, beneficiaries would pay the same
water charges as for DTWs and BLIs.



-45-
7.17    For reasons outlined above, agreements have been reached with GOWB
that it would: (i) by December 31, 1985, prepare and submit to IDA for
review, draft terms of reference for a water charge system study, and taking
into account IDA's comments, carry out the study; (ii) furnish to IDA for its
review and comment, not later than December 31, 1986, the results of the
study including a proposal for establishing a water charge system for
irrigated areas served by project works and by existing minor irrigation
works; (iii) taking into account IDA's comments on this proposal, furnish
to IDA not later than September 30, 1987, for its review and comment a
timetable for applying the new water charge system; and (iv) taking into
account IDA-s comments, implement the new water charge system in accordance
with this timetable within the project area.
7.18    Proiected Level of Cost Recovery.  For existing minor irrigation
works, the O&H budget allocations for minor irrigation works are not directly
dependent on cost recovery. This is fortunate because it would mean that
farmers would have to pay for any technical or institutional inefficiencies
that result in low utilization of public tubewells or RLIs. Under the cir-
cumstances, present water charges for existing DTWs and RLIs in WB may be
more than adequate for the quality of service provided. Nonetheless, to
ensure that minor irrigation development under the project does not become a
burden on Government, agreements have been reached with GOWB that it would:
(i) continue to set water charges on existing and new irrigation systems with
regular reviews of the cost of operation and maintenance; and (ii) for new
and modernized irrigation schemes in the project area, ensure that revenue
covers the average operation and maintenance costs and a reasonable share of
investment costs, taking into account the repayment capacity of irrigation
beneficiaries.
7.19    Given the present income levels of most project beneficiaries, the
immediate concern of GOWB with respect to cost recovery levels would be to
Price for full utilization of the irrigation service. Only if small or
marginal farmers can achieve full development production is there a
reasonable chance of progressive increases in water charges above current
levels.
7.20    Since the project structure and exact level of water charges which
would be applicable at full development cannot be predicted at this time,
revenue projections for project works have been based on present water rates
which may represent the variable' portion of a two-tier water charge system,
when such a system is adopted (para 7.16). The present values of recovery
thus projected are given in Table T-13. The average rent recovery index
would be about 35Z. The average cost recovery is estimated to be about 42X.
While it may be conceptually feasible to charge higher water rates to project
beneficiaries, the scope for achieving this is limited. Income levels of
most farm families at full development under the project will remain close to
the poverty level and it may not be practical to have a differential water
rate that reflects farm income levels. Per capita income after water charges
would average about Rs 1,300. An estimated 50% of farm households would
remain below the projected poverty threshold of US$90 per capita compared to
about 95% without the project.

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
General
8.01    The provision of a reliable public minor irrigation service would
substantially reduce farmers' risk and produce incentives for complementary
investments such as higher input applications and adoption of advanced farm-
ing practices. It would also lead to a more efficient utilization and
management of groundwater and energy in the public groundwater sector.
Moreover, the improved technology would provide an important social benefit
in that, for the first time in public irrigation development in WB, there can
be equity in water allocation. Project benefits would be generated as fol-
lows:
Works              Command Area           Farm
Type  No. of Units  Served (ha)    Families Served (No.)
(i)  DTis     3,400 Ia      67,000             96,000
(ii)  STWs     5,400         32,000             46,000
(iii)  ODWs    10,000         24,000             25,000
5iv)  RLIs       200         16.000 /b          23,000
Total   19,000        139,000            190,000
/a High, Medium and Low capacity DTWs (para 3.06).
/b Including about 8,000 ha served by existing RLIs before modernization.
In addition, considerable indirect benefits, which cannot be quantified, will
be generated through the management improvements under the project.
8.02    The overall impact of the project in terms of increased agricultural
production and employment generated at full development is snmmarized below:
Increased foodgrain production (tons/year)             367,000
Increased potato production (tons/year)                140,000
Increased jute production (tons/year)                   18,000
Increased sesame production (tons/year)                  5,000
Value added to the local economy (Rs M/year)               5?d
Generated farm employment (iobs)                       180.000
8.03    Production Benefits.  The project would, increase foodgrain produc-
tion by about 367,000 tons, equivalent to an increase of about 130Z over
production without the project. Incremental rice and wheat production would
be mainly available for on-farm consumption for small and marginal farmers;
any surpluses would be marketed within the State. Increased maize production
would be available locally where it is a staple crop. Additional production
of pulses would help alleviate a growing statewide scarcity in that it is the
main source of pxatein for human consumption. Jute and potato production
would be marketed as cash crops.
8.04    Employment.  It is estimated that labor requirements in agriculture
would approximately triple as a result of the project from about 23 M to
about 70 N man-days per year at full development. Most of this labor would
be needed during the rabi (the months of labor surplus in rural areas), since
without irrigation, most land remains fallow. The increase would be due to



-47-
adoption of irrigation, increases in cropped area, more intensive care of
crops and the higher labor needs for harvesting. The labor requirements
would be reflected mainly in the reduction of the present high level of
unemployment and underemployment of family labor, particularly on the smaller
farms. Agricultural laborers and marginal farmers would benefit from
increased labor demand on larger farms and from non-farm employment oppor-
tunities generated by the project due to increased demands for marketing,
transport and processing facilities. About 20,000 jobs for unskilled labor
would be created mainly for constructing the project works. The project
establishment would create permanent jobs for about 2,900 tubewell operators.
8.05    Beneficiares.  The project would benefit about 190,000 farm families
by project completion and indirectly a large number of landless laborers that
has not been estimated. Most beneficiaries would be farmers who cannot
afford a private irrigation source and are unlikely to be eligible for long
term credit. The project will thus help overcome existing and potential
inequities in the use of the key resources of groundwater and irrigable land.
However, even though the project provides the opportunity to utilize an
efficient irrigation to all farmers served, some marginal farmers may not
initially be able to afford the necessary cash inputs to fully benefit from
irrigation. The cash income and/or favorable credit conditions may become
important factors in effective participation of small farmers in the project
and would be carefully monitored (para 7.07).
Economic Analysis
8.06    The project consists of a large number of individual components of
various types of minor irrigation development. Thus, typical examples of
each individual component (para 3.06) represent the project objectives to be
tested; the overall ERR of the project (about 37Z) has limited significance.
8.07    Only agricultu-al production benefits have been entered in the
economic analysis. Economic prices for tradable crops (rice, wheat, jute)
were derived from relevant border prices and for non-traded crops (pulses,
oilseeds, vegetables) from the prevailing and projected market prices. The
economic prices of fertilizers were derived from IBRD price projections. The
shadow price of agricultural labor was assumed at about 50% of the going wage
rates for hired labor. Cost items were valued by employing specific conver-
sion factors to financial costs.  Benefit build-up is the result of the
assumed phasing of areas to come under irrigation, a four year transition
from present to future cropping intensities and a more gradual build-up of
yields, input use, and adoption ox high yielding crop varieties. Full
project development within a tubewell or RLI command area would be reached
after about six years. The cost of pumping has been based on the estimated
marginal cost of electricity for WB. Detailed assumptions on economic
analysis are given in Annex 2.
8.08    The economic cost of all civil works, equipment, land acquisition,
administration and engineering, operation and maintenance have been included
in the derivation of the ERR. Discounting costs and benefits o"-.r a 30-year
period (at 12% discount rate), the estimated ERR and the net present value at
12% discount rate for the various project components are as followu:

The results indicate the clear economic viability for all of the individual
components even when sited on the least attractive soil type. Sample cost
and benefit streams for the analysis for typical project components are shown
in Table T-14; the cost and benefits streams for the remaining project com-
ponents are given in Annex 2. Project viability can also be expressed in
terms of cost and benefits per unit of water. The costs of producing and
delivering water to the plant for a typical project facility ranges from
about 0.23 Rslm3 for STW unit (clustered) to about 0.35 Rs/m3for a typical
MTW; this compares to the implicit value of water at the plant of about
0.60 Rs/m3 at full development.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.09    Several tests were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of assump-
tions made in the economic analysis. One test was calculation of the switch-
ing value for the various assumptions to assess what change in the variable
would reduce the discounted present value of the project's net incremental
benefits to zero. The discount rate used was 12% which has been taken as the
estimated opportunity cost of capital in India. The results of the main
variables tested for a typical high capacity DTW are as follows:

/a  16 hours per day operation during the peak irrigation period.
lb 8 hours per day operation during the peak irrigation period.
Sensitivity tests using the same variables were made for the other project
irrigation components; the analysis is given in Annex 2 and shows similar
results. The tests indicate that only large changes (and unlikely in the



-49-
magnitude required) in the main assumptions will turn this project economi-
cally unviable. For example, the test with respect to net crop production
indicates that the project-s NPV would reduce to zero if farmers fully util-
ized the irrigat-onn service on only about 40X of the net command area of a
typical HDTW.
8.10    Proiect Risk.  The project risks are less than would normally be
expected with an operation of this type because lessons learnt from the UP
Public Tubewell Projects (para 3.05) have helped to identify and minimize the
potential risks involved. The major problem with RLIs and DTWs in the State
has been incomplete distribution systems and management constraints which
result from the existing designs. Another possible risk to project benefits
would be underutilization of minor irrigation systems. Apparent lack of
demand for water with existing public minor irrigation works is primarily due
to the inadequate quantity and quality of the irrigation service. Proven
designs of the works under the project are such that all project irrigation
systems would be able to provide a reliable, timely and equitable service.
Thus, underutilization of project wells is unlikely to be due to the technol-
ogy but rather due to lack of farmers response to an assured irrigation
service, particularly in the kharif season when farmers save water cbarges
in anticipation of good monsoon rainfall. The project provides for a com-
prehensive monitoring and study of the water charge system so that action
can be taken if necessary to minimize this risk. Particular attention would
be given to small and marginal farmers who may have casb flow problems that
could reduce their ability to invest in other agricultural inputs such as
fertilizers, or even commit themselves to expenditure on water charges.
Environmental Effects
8.11    The project areas have been under wet season cultivation for many
decades and introduction of irrigation improvements in the dry season are not
expected to produce a significant change in environmental conditions. Water
from tne project wells is potable and is expected to have a health benefit by
reduction of the occurrence of intestinal diseases. The water delivery
through buried pipes is expected to reduce the potential hazards of malaria
associated with some surface irrigation schemes. Nonetheless, an agreement
has been reached with GOWB that it would take all measures as may be con-
sidered necessary to minimize the risk of malaria, filaria and other
water-related diseases within the project area.
IX.  AGREEMfNTS REACHED AND RECONMENDATIONS
9.01    An agreement has been reached with GOI that it would make the
proceeds of the credit available to GOWB on GOI's standard terms and arrange-
ments for development assistance to the States (para 4.02).
9.02    Agreements have been reached with GOWB that it would:

WEST BENGAL MINOR IRRIGATION PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic and Financial Analysis
Price and Conversion Factors
1.      General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural com-
modities (at farm gate) were derived from the IBRD world market prices (1984
projected through 1995) expressed in 1984 currency values with appropriate
adjustments for freight, handling and processing.  Non-traded foodgrains and
other non-traded goods and services were brought to a common basis with the
traded goods and services through the uEa of conversion factors. Three
conversion factors have been used: (i) Standard Conversion Factor (SCF); (ii)
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF); and (iii) Food Conversion Factor (FCF).
Details on the derivation of the conversion factors and their use in
described below. The opportunity cost of capital (OCC) was assumed at 12Z.
A standard exchange rate of US$1.0 to Rs 11.0 was used to convert prices
expressed in US do!lars to local currency values. The assumptions used to
derive the estimates are described below.
2.      Standard Conversion Factor.  For economic analysis, costs and
benefits of the project have been evaluated at world market prices in order
to measure India's net economic benefits from the project. This requires
certain price adjustments, since many items are not traded in the world
markets and the prices of others are affected by tariffs and trade restric-
tions. To make them comparatle, a SCF have been applied to the price of
non-traded goods. In the absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be
estimated by using the following formula:
SCF  =         X + M
X + S  + M + TM
where: X      export value (f.o.b.);
Y  =  import  alue (c.i.f.);
2 -  subsidies on exports;
T  =  taxes and duties on imports
For the period since 1970, this calculation has produced a SCF of 0.86.
ho-ever, since this method does not take into consideration quantitative
restrictions on trade, tbe estimates derived provide only an upper limit for
the SCF. The Indian Planning Commission recommends to use in the evaluation
of industrial projects, conversion factors for foreign exchange and untraded
goods that imply a SCF of about 0.75. This estimate is considered to be
nearer to the lower limit of the real SCF. Consequently, a SCF of 0.8 has
been used in the economic analysis.



ANNEX 2
-76-                        Page  2
3.      Construction Ccnversion Factor.  The construction of project civil
works require the use of a mixture of equipment, materials, and skilled and
unskilled labor, the proportions of which vary with the type of minor irriga-
tion installation. The conversion factor of 1.00 has been used for works
which require imported materials; domestically manufactured equipment,
engineering and administration charges and skilled labor requirements have
been adjusted by the SCF (0.80). The share of unskilled labor has been
adjusted by the conversion factor of 0.50 (para 6). Based on this analysis,
the following CCF have been used in the economic analysis to convert the
financial into economic prices:
TyRe of Installation                             CCF
HDTW, MDTW and RLI                               0.82
LDTW and STW                                     0.79
ODW (Hard rock)                                  0.63
ODW (Alluvium)                                   0.71
4.      Econcmic Prices of Commodities and Foodgrain Conversion Factor (FCF).
The economic prices for traded commodities such as rice, wheat, groundnuts
and jute were derived by using border prices in US dollars according to IBRD
commodity projections and converted to local currency values at the standard
exchange rate. The domestic cost components (such as local transport, han-
dling and marketing charges) were adjusted by a SCF of 0.80 (Table 1). The
economic prices for non-traded foodgrain (pulses and gram were assumed to be
non-traded) were derived by applying a FCF gj to the present financial
prices. The recent downward revisions of IBRD agricultural commodity price
forecasts nave brought the world market price of wheat and rice to about
parity with the domestic market prices in India. As a result, a FCF of 1.0
has been used in the economic analysis.
5.      Prices of Agricultural InDuts.  Fertilizers have been valued at the
projected world market price (Table 1). Pesticides and insecticides have
been assumed to be traded. In order to make an allowance for taxes and
subsidies and for the cost of transport and marketing, a conversion factor
of 0.95 has been applied to their financial prices. The economic price of
seed and miscellaneous charges has been assumed to approximate their finan-
cial price. The economic price of farm power (bullock pair with operator)
was derived from going daily rental rates, adjusted by the SCF. A summary of
economic and financial prices is presented in Table 2.
6.      Opportunity Cost of Labor.  The rural labor market in the State of WB
belongs to the most depressed in India mainly due to heavy population pres-
sures and the lack of employment opportunities particularly in the slack
periods. The incremental demand for labor generated by construction of civil
works and later on by irrigated agriculture would be easily absorbed by the
existing labor force without any noticable impact on present wage rates.
Analysis of farm labor supply and demand in various Indian irrigation
projects typically give an economic shadow wage rate for farm labor in the
jj Estimated as a rat o of wheat and rice production valued at economic
pricas to wheat and rice production valued at average domestic market
prices.

range of 1/2 to 2/3 of the average financial wage rate. The current average
wage rate in rural areas amounts to 8.0 Rs/day. Given the exceptionally
depressed rural labor market in WB the conversion factor of 0.50 has been
assumed for conversion of the average financial into economic wage rate.
ARricultural Benefits
7.      Present Situation.  The present level of agricultural production is
described in Annex 5, SDV. The level of agricultural development varies with
agro-climatic and market conditions across the State. Between 1970/71 and
1981/82, agricultural production in WB remained virtually stagnant with the
exception of potatoes and oilseeds. Assessment of yields, input levels and
cropping patterns were based on Ci) direct information in the field, (ii)
district statistics, (iii) discussions with local agricultural staff and
farmers and (iv) GOWB surveys and evaluation studies. The soil type (heavy,
medium and light soils) has been selected as the critical variable in the
analysis. Other important factors such as land distribution and fragmenta-
tion pattern, rainfall are relatively uniform throughout the State. The
exception to this general pattern are areas designated for dugwells in the
western part of the State.
8.      Future Without Proiect.  Without irrigation facilities no substantial
changes from the present situation would result. For the purpose of the
project analysis, it has been assumed that there will be no private irriga-
tion sources within the project command areas, and that it would be unlikely
that private irrigation facilities would develop without the project.
9.      Future With Project.  The transition of agriculture from the
'present" to the ."future with." project situations was based on the following
assumptions:
(a)  Yields. Inputs and Economic Prices.  A six-year build-up period
for present to future improved cropping practices has been
assumed. For simplicity, the same period has been taken for the
build-up of crop yields and inputs, as well as for the effect of
changing ecQnomic prices on net returns per ha of each crop.
The assumed pattern foc each year after the start of irrigation
is presented below.
(b) Cropping Intersities. Experience from other similar irrigation
projects suggests that increases in cropping intensity to the full
development level would be faster than increases in yields. A
period of four years was assumed for the transition from present
to projected intensities. The rate is shown below:

ANNEX 2
-78-                          Page  4
The transition of agriculture practices in the RLI commands to be modernized
under the project was assumed to taken half the time expected for the
tubewells since the farmers are more likely to practice irrigated agriculture
in the :pre-project" situation.
Costs
10.     CaRital Costs.  The capital cost estimates were based on September,
1984 unit prices. They were adjusted by specific construction conversion
factors (para 3). The project was evaluated over a 30-year period. The
effective life of wells and the buried pipe distribution systems were assumed
as 30 years and that of pumpsets as 10 years. These assumptions are based on
the experience in India of operating wells and distribution systems similar
to the project design. The replacement cost of the pumpsets has been taken
into account.
11.     Land Acquisition.  The buried pipe distribution system would limit
land acquisition requirements to the area required for siting the water point
(about 0.10 ha per DTW). The land lost in this way to agricultural produc-
tion was valued at the economic net return per ha without the project. The
net return foregone each year (Rs 300 per DTW) was treated as a recurrent
project cost and was subtracted from the 'with project' benefits.
12.     Cost of Pumpin2.  The electric power supply and demand characteris-
tics of WB are described in Annex 8, SDV. Based on recent incremental cost
studies of power generation and transmission in the State, the marginal rate
of Rs 1.00 per kWh has been adopted in the project analysis. The build-up of
pumping cost has been assumed proportional to the build-up of cropping inten-
sities (para 9). The energy cost would vary with the type of irrigation
facility as follows:
(a) STW with centrifugal pump and electric motor operated for 1,800 hrs.
p.a. and delivering 20m3/h through a dynamic head of 8m. Energy
consumption is 0.96 kWh giving a total consumption of 1,728 kWh p.a.
The economic cost of energy at the end of the 0.4 kv line is Rs 1.0
kWh. Thus the annual economic cost of energy is Rs 1,900.
(b) LDTW with submersible electric pump operated for 1,800 hrs. p.a.
and delivering 20m3/h through a dynamic head of 12m. Energy consump-
tion is 1.44 kWh giving a total consumption of 2,592 kWh p.a. The
economic cost of energy at the end of the 0.4 kv line is Rs 1.1 per
kWh.  Thus the annual economic cost of energy is Rs 2,851.
(c)  NDTW with submersible electric pump operated for 1,800 hrs.  p.a.
and delivering 100m.3/h through a dynamic head of 12m. Energy consump-
tion is 5.6 kWh giving a total consumption of 10,080 kWh p.a. The
economic cost of energy at the end of the 11/0.4 kv transformer is
taken as Rs 1.0 kWh. Thus the annual economic cost of energy is Rs
10,080.
(d)  EDrW with submersible electric pump operated for 1,800 hrs.  p.a. and
delivering 200m3/h through a dynamic head of 15m. Energy consumDtion
is 13.9 kWh giving a total consumption of 23,400 kWh p.a. The
economic cost of energy at the 11/0.4 transformer in .aken as Rs 1.0
per kWh. Thus the annual economic cost of energy is Rs 23,400.



ANNEX 2
-79_                            Page  5
13.     Operation and Maintenance Costs.  It has been assumed that annual
maintenance charges would be equal to 1% of capital cost for dug vells and
drilled wells of all types, pump houses and piped conveyance systems. Submer-
sible pumps would require about 32 and centrifugal pumps about 5X of capital
costs for annual maintenance. Maintenance cost of power lines is implicit in
the electricity charges.
14.     Labor requirements for operation of project tubewells and RLI would
be substantially reduced compared to present norms due to automation.
Moreover, the level of skill would also be significantly reduced which would
enable to hire local village labor. The charges are summarized as follows:
(a)  LDTW in cluster of six vells with one operator/supervisor per cluster
at Rs 9,600 p.a. and one nigh guard per cluster at Rs 2,500 p.a. i.e.
about Rs 2,020 p.a. per well. Adjusted by the SCF of 0.80 for
economic analysis the rate per well is Rs 1,620 p.a.
(b)  MT  and HDTW with submersible electric motors and equipped for
automatic operation would require one record keeper at about Rs 4,000
p.a. Adjusted by the SCF of 0.80 the rate per well has been taken as
Rs 3,600 p.a.
Economic Analysis
15.     The Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  Based on the above assumptions,
the ERR and the Net Present Values (NPV) were estimated for the various
facilities proposed under the project as follows:

The results indicate the clear economic viability of all project components.
16.     Sensitivity Analysis.  The main assumptions in tne project analysis
have been tested by estimated the switching values as follows:

al 16 hours per day operation during the peak irrigation period.
hI 8 hours per day operation during the peak irrigation period.
The reduction of rural power supply to about 8 hours per day during the peak
demand period (an unlikely event) would reduce the ERR to 12X. However, this
would be the case only if power is rationed orderly and farmers are notified
well in advance. Unexpected power supply variability would have a more
severe impact, since it could be assumed that the higher the unexpected
variability of power supply the lower the irrigation benefits i.e. the
switching value of 900 hours per day probably understates the impact on ERR.
This is because the farmers would receive an unreliable irrigation service
which would increase their risk aversion to irrigated agriculture and to the
purchase of the inputs necessary to achieve increased crop yields. The
sensitivity to net incremental crop production has been tested by calculating
the switching value of agricultural benefits with and without project. It is
assumed that lower crop yields would be a result of lower than the estimated
input costs required to achieve full crop yields with the project.
16.     In addition to the above analysis, the effect of the following
occurences on the ERR was tested:
(a) 0M Labor Requirements. Assuming that the project irrigation
facilities would be staffed according to present AED norms the ERR
for a typical DTW would decline by 2% points. However a far more
serious eff2ct of maintaining AED norms for project works would be
the financial impact on AED budget. The financial burden on the AED
budget would increase to about Rs 60 N annually rather then Rs 40 M
with modified staffing norms under the project.
(b) Kharif Benefits Excluded. The high rainfall in WB during the kharif
season makes the estimates of kharif benefits (supplementary irriga-
tion) difficult to quantify accurately. Moreover, it may be argued
that irrigation is not reqiired during the rainy season. The exclu-
sion of tbese benefits would reduce the ERR for a typical DEW to
about 32%. However, at the same time it is important to note that
DTW are most valuable in times of monsoon failure.
(c) Cluster Principle on STW and LDTW. The cost of these insts:lations
would significantly increase if not sited in c!:t-rs.  If sited
individually the ERR would decline to 44% and 331 for the STW and
LDTW respectively.
(d) Smaller Command Area for STW ar-i LDTW. It is expected that under the
project the comand areas served by STW and LDTW would be about 6 ha.
However, for various reasons, existing wells serve areas of



-81-
ANNEX 2
Page 7
about 4 ha. If the command area of the project units was taken as
4 ha, the ERR would decline to 35X and 262 for a typical STW and LDTIW
respectively.
(e) Future Without Proiect Benefits. It has been assumed that no sub-
stautial changes from the present situation would results in the
project area without irrigation. Alternatively, assuming a 3% com-
pounded annual growth rate of agriculture production in the "without
project:' situation over the next 10 years, the ERR for a typical DTW
would be reduced by about four percentage points.
(f) Mobile PumDs for ODW. The provision of mobile pump units under the
project would increase the conmand areas from about 0.25 ha to 2 ha
and 4 ha for dugvells in hard rock s=d alluvial areas respectively.
A mobile pump would typically serve a cluster of 3-5 dugwells. The
ERR for a mechanized dugwell would be about 40% and well over 50% in
hard rock and alluvial area respectively.
(g) The Opportunity Cost of Labor. The project would about triple the
demand for farm labor and as a result the opportunity cost of labor
may increase beyond the 4.0 Rs/day assumed in the analysis. With
the economic wage rate equal to the average financial wage rate of
8.0 Rs/day the ERR would decline by about six percentage points for
a typical DTW.

WEST BENGAL MINOR IRRIGATION PROECT
Terms of Reference - AED  Management Study
Introduction
1.      Background.  The project introduces improved technology for DTWs and
RLIs which will make the irrigation service more efficient qnd, for the first
time in WB, provide minor irrigation systems vhich are predictably manage-
able. In addition, the project includes STWs and ODWs as public sector
operations under the AED, which expands the management responsibility of the
AED. The GOWB has recognized that when the existing technologies have been
substantially improved, the potential benefits ca:. only be fully obtained if
management can be made more effective and efficient. Since, the new tech-
nologies provide a predictable service, performance of management staff can
be evaluated and beneficiaries can assess whether they are getting the serv-
ice promised. In particular, management improvements can be structured to
focus on specific measures to set standards of responsibility and account-
ability and introduce incentives in the management procedures. Thus, GOWB
plans to: (i) strengthen the agencies responsible for execution and manage-
ment of the public minor irrigation works; (ii) establish procedures to use
village panchayats as ,management agents' for the shallow tubevell and open
dugwell components; and (iii) establish procedures to monitor progress of
project implementation and realization of project benefits.
2.      Already GOWB has made considerable progress in identifying areas
where the AED can be strengthened with most of recommendations coming from
senior staff within the organization. However, it is recognized that there
are limitations to the range of self-generated management improvements within
an organization. The GOWB and AED believe that there will be considerable
advantages in having independent consultants to assist the AED analyze its
management problems; the consultants would provide a group of experienced
multi-disciplinary professionals who are not burdened with routine
administrative duties and who can evaluate the organization and management
problems of the AED from an outside perspective.
3.      Assumptions.  With respect to AED management improvements the basic
objectives would be to: (i) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
existing AED administration; and (ii) ensure that project (and existing)
works can be managed to achieve predicted benefits. An assumed condition to
achieve these objectives would be that any change to the organization would
be such that the career prospects of existing AED staff are safeguarded.
Management Study
4.      The GOWB would retain the services of a Consultant Group experienced
in all aspects of management consultancy including financial management. In
addition to technical and management expertise, the Consultants would need to



Annex 4
-101-                      Page 2
be familiar with the practices and procedures of WB Government Departments,
and the minor irrigation sub-sector (including legislation related to land
and irrigation). The study would first undertake a preliminary review of the
AED organization structure and predicted workload over the project period.
This would be followed by an in-depth study of the main areas for possible
organizational and management improvements identified under the preliminary
review. The in-depth studies would result in a comprehensive report which
would detail practical improvements which can be made in West Bengal, and
recommends procedures and arrangements to implement such improvements. The
Consultants would have only a advisory role; responsibility for deciding what
would and should be done, and a timetable for making changes, would rest with
the AED/GOWB.
5.      The existing and proposea organization structure and staffing under
the project are summarized in para 5.04 of the World Bank Staff Appraisal
Report No. 5355-IN. The Management Study would review, evaluate and make
recommendations in the following main areas:
(a) Review the objectives and recommendations outlined in the project SAR
and SDV dealing with management and technical improvements under the
project and evaluate what changes can be made given constraints
inherent in existing organization structure, staffing levels, and
management procedures.
(b) Identify, review and evaluate changes required in the management and
organization structure of the AED to implement the construction
program for new works and undertake operation and maintenance of
existing works aDd works to be implemented under the project up to
about March 1991; in particular, the review would identify existing
criteria for establishing organization structure and staffing
requirements and evaluate whether the existing workloaa norms are
realistic.
Cc) Formulate guidelines and identify data collection required to
monitor, evaluate and compare various aspects of management perfor-
mance both in terms of physical and financial parameters (para 17).
(d) Undertake preliminary review of the following management problems
identified at appraisal: (i) changes in the organization into work
units which eliminate or phase out the separation of the AED staff
into Agriculture-Irrigation (A-I) and Agricultural-Mechanical (A-M)
cadres (para 7); (ii) separation of construction and U&M activities
(para 10); (iii) arrangements and procedures for using panchayats in
the management of minor irrigation units; (iv) problems related to
unionization or any other special interest group within the AED,
particularly where such grouping affects staff manning levels; and
(v) legislation, including terms and conditions of staff employment,
as a constraint to organization and staffing changes.
(e) Review of work activities to identify existing procedures (and effec-
tiveness of these procedures) in fixing responsibility and account-
ability of AED staff; evaluate the AED accounting procedures, iden-
tify shortcomings and recommend changes so that costs of AED opera-
tions can be broken down sufficiently to enable sound financial
management.

AED Mana2ement Determinants.
6.      In identifying and evaluating proposals to improve the management
capability of the AED, the following main determinants need special atten-
tion:
ResPonsibility of Ouerationai Circles
7.      Background. At present, there are 4 Agricultural-Irrigation (A-I)
circles responsible for tubewells and 4 Agricultural-Mechanical (A-M) circles
responsible for RLIs.  Within the territorial areas under their respon-
sibility, (A-I) and (A-M) circles undertake both construction and 0&1
activities. The State is divided into four parts such that one (A-I) and one
(A-M) circle serves the same territorial area. The consequences of the
territorial division of the State into separate organizations responsible for
specific types of works includes; (i) reduction in management efficiency
since staff have to cover large areas; and (ii) increase in O&M costs par-
ticularly with respect to transportation.
8.      Proiect Recoumendations. Divide the State into circles responsible
for both tubewells and RLIs and such that there is no territorial overlap-
ping. The area served by a work unit (circle, division or sub-division)
would be decided on the workload, namely, the density of existing tubevells
and XLIs and also take into account the construction program over the next
five years.
9.      Consultants- Task. The existing and proposed workload of the AED
would be analysed and the relative merits and practicality of any changes
assessed for the following: (i) continuing the present organization struc-
ture with separate work units for tubewells and BLI-s activities; and
(ii) re-organizing the field units on a territorial basis with mixed
workloads of tubewell and RLIs in each work unit depending on the local
spatial density of the various minor irrigation works.
Separation of Construction and O&M
10.     Background.  At present, organization and staffing requirements are
decided on norms of about Rs 0.4 M for an O&M division and about Rs 10.0 M
for a construction division. The O&M divisional norms include energy costs
which vary annually depending on irrigation demand. Where there is a con-
struction program, divisional staffing is adjusted to match the workload.
11.     Problem.  Since there is no separation between construction and O&M
responsibilities at any level in the organization, there is (and there will
continue to be) a variation in workload. With present accounting procedures,
it is virtually impossible to separate the costs of O&M and construction.
12.     Recommendations.  Construction and O&N activities should be made the
responsibility of separate work units at least up to sub-division level.
Within divisions with both construction and 0&M workloads, first the OE&
requirements should be fixed and work units staffed accordingly since this



-103-
Annex 4
Page 4
workload is firm and predictable. Staffing requirements for each
sub-division, division or circle would be estimated on the basis that (on
average) a division can manage about 400 units (either DTWs or RLIs). The
number of works managed by each division (or sub-divisi;-) would depend on
the spatial density of units to be managed and take into acci.nm provision
for future expansion if there is a construction program (on-goi:g or planned)
within the work unit area. The overriding consideration would be that works
can be managed effectively and efficiently. In those areas with a substan-
tial construction program, divisions would be strengthened by adding con-
struction sub-divisions or, if necessary, the number of divisions would be
increased. Staffing norms would depend on the spatial density and type of
the works. Extra staff, appropriately organized into work units would be
added to the basic O) structure with construction staffing based on an
average norm of Rs 10.0 H of works/division/year. The financial construction
norm per division should take into consideration the type of installations to
be constructed. The advantage of rationalizing the construction and O&M
activities and staffing would be that: Ci) it will be possible to separate
construction and OH accounts for management purposes; (ii) perfornumce can
be monitored and evaluated; and (iii) individual staff would knov -eir
responsibility, thus a degree of accountability can be introduced.
13.     Consultants  Task.  Review and evaluate the present situation and
establish whether there is sufficient information to check management perfor-
mance.  Formulate accounting procedures so that work unit performance in
terms of workload can be estimated and thus reviewed annually. Review the
recommendations given in para 12 above, and based on the conclusions reached
in such review, formulate a logical procedure for setting both cons:ruction
and O&M workload norms in physical and financial terms. Such norms would
take into account spatial density of works, allowances that should be made
for future workloads, and any other factors that may influence the perfor-
mance of a work unit.
The (A-1) and (A-H) Cadre Problem
14.     Backzround.  The AED staff are separated into two cadres (I and M)
and there is a complete demarcation of all AED activities into I and H jobs.
Although historically there may have been justification for the I and M
streaming, the protection of I and M jobs appears to restrict any change to
improve the management effectiveness and efficiency of the AED. The division
of AED staffing into two separate cadres is considered as an important reason
why the AED has become difficult to manage. Increase in the workloac of the
AED (and resulting O&M responsibilities) will make it increasingly more
difficult to resolve the problem as the AED expands.
15.     The Consultants would (inter alia) review the following actions which
may be taken by GOWB with respect to the (A-I) and (A-M) Cadre Problem with
an essential condition being to safeguard the career prospects of existing
staff:
(i)  All new recruits into the AED would be in a common cadre.
(ii) All existing positions which are designated I nr M, would remain I or
H slots and promotion to these slots would be based on seniority on
the respective I and M cadre lists.

Annex 4
Page 5
(iii)  All new posts created in the AED due to project both with respect to
construction and O&N would be designated 'common cadre- posts
irrespective of whether they are tubewell or RLI works. Since such
posts would have to be filled by a promotion, the post would be
filled on seniority basis by the most senior staff from either the
A-I or A-H cadre using a joint seniority list.
(iv)  All new posts in State level (Headquarters) created under the project
would be 'common cadre' since they have to deal with both tubewell
and RLI activities. The promotion to such a post would be as in item
(iii) above.
(v)  New specialist posts (for example, Officer in charge of a workshop)
would be restricted to qualified staff (i.e., Workshop
Officer-in-charge would be M cadre).
16.     Consultants- Task:  Formulate an appropriate, practical package
(including all or any of those outlined above) to address the A-I and A-H
cadre problem. The Consultants' proposal should identify the actions that
GOWB/AED would have to take to implement any changes proposed and a tentative
timetable for making such changes. A basic condition on any proposals would
be to safeguard the career prospects of existing AED staff.
Nonitorina and Evaluation
17.     The project would provide staff and facilities for 1&E of agricul-
tural, technical and socio-economic performance in the project area. The
existing M&E unit would be strengthened at headquarters of the AED under the
CE (Agriculture) with three field units set up at regional level. The H&E
unit would be responsible for collecting and analyzing data on project
implementation and performance particularly with respect to the quantity and
quality of the irrigation service.  The units would also be responsible for
agro-economic surveys, data collection for the main crops under the project
during the growth cycle including crop production, and input/crop yield data.
The operator at each tubewell or river lift system would assist che M&E units
by keeping certain daily and seasonal records which reflect aspects of
agricultural performance.
18.     Consultants' Task.  In the course of all studies undertaken by the
Consultants, they would identify activities which need to be monitored and
evaluated on a regularly basis to enable management performance to be
evaluated. In particular, they would decide: (i) the format and how much
data need be collected so that statistically analyzed any task to be
monitored can be; and (ii) recommend how, when and in what form, the monitor-
ing data should be made available to various levels of management. Thus,
once the task to be monitored has been identified, the Consultants would
assist the AED in the preparation of necessary data collection sheets, fre-
quency of collection of data, method of evaluation, how management can use
the proceeded data, and what feedback procedure should be instigated to pass
results back through the various levels of AED staff to the data collectors.
The specific management aim of monitoring and evaluation would to introduce
accountability for physical or financial performance of minor irrigation
development and any other activities undertaken by AED management.

Train2ng
19.     At present, there are no formal management training courses in the
AED; it is assumed that as technical staff are promoted, they will learn
management techniques on the job. The consequence of this practise has been
little or no change of management procedures compared to those in force when
AED was set up. Since senior AED staff have no training in modern management
techniques, (particularly financial management), they have only been able to
make limited improvements to present management effectiveness.
20.     Consultants' Task.  The project provided funds for management train-
ing for senior AED staff. After the Management Study has been completed and
its recommendations generally agreed by lED/GOWB, the Consultants will
prepare short management courses for Senior AED staff and will also assist,
if required, in the running of such courses. The outline curricula for the
courses will be presented in the Final Report to be prepared by the Consult-
ants on completion of the Management Studies.
Conditions of Employment.
21.     The Consultant Group would be responsible to the Chief Engineer AED
and would be directed on a day-to-day basis through the Project Co-ordinator
or another suitable qualified and senior officer designated by the CE (AED).
A Management Study Committee, including Senior AED Officers and any other
representatives nominated by GOWB, would be set up and meet on a regular
basis to direct and to maintain close liaison with the Consultants as the
study proceeds. The Consultants are expected to be retained by September 30,
1985. Subject to the findings of the Preliminary Renort and the detailed
tasks that GtWJB/AED would like the Consultants to review and evaluate the
Consultants would prepare a draft Final Report by June 30, 1986. The draft
Final ReDort would be submitted to IDA for its review and comments and taking
into account IDA's comments, the GOWB/AED would undertake the recommendations
of the study to an agreed timetable. The timetable would be made available
to IDA for its review and comments by about September 30, 1986.
22.     The staffing of the the Consultant Group would consist of qualified
professionals in the field of Management Studies, sufficient to undertake the
tasks outlined in these draft Terms of Reference. In addition to general
management skills, the Consultants would require experts in the field of law,
administration, office equipment and facilities, and organization of Govern-
ment departments, particularly those following WB Public Work Department
procedures.
23.     The Consultants would provide sufficient transportation, equipment
and facilities to efficiently undertake the studies; the costs of these
requirements would be included in the fees agreed for the Consultancy. The
AED would provide the necessary assistance to enable the Consultant Group
to undertake its tasks and fulfil its obligations.
