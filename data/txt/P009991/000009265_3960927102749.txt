telending Terms       ICICI Credit Component.  The proceeds of the US$-175
milliop of the Bank loan to ICICI would be relent to
the final private subborrowers either in foreign
exchange at the Bank's standard variable rate plus 22
or in local currehcy at the prevailing Exchange Risk
Administration Scheme (ERAS) rate (presently 152 with
a cap rite of 182). Under this arrangement, the
differential spread between the interest rate on the
Bank loan and the ERAS rate, less 22 for ICICI's"
spread, would accrue to the ERAS Fund to cover the
foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The ERAS
rates would be adjusted every six months to ensure
that the interest rate and foreign exchange risks are
adequately covered.
Eximbank and PCBs Credit Component. US$100 million
of the US$120 million loan to the Government would be
passed on to these financial intermediaries as
equity. Their clients will be small and medium size
firms and the final interest rates to subborrowers
would be consistent with the Reserve Bank of India
interest rate structure for term lending to these
sectorss 13.5? for small firms and 142 p.a. for
medium size firms. These rates are highly positive
in real terms given current and projected inflation
rates of 82. The Government would bear the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks.

TO ITHE EMECUTIV DRECTORS
ON PROPSED LaN  TO MN          AND TO THE
INDUSTRIL CREDIT AND IMESTbE   CORPORATION OP IDIA, LIMITED
FOR AN XaPORT' DEVELOPMENT PROJECT :
1.       The following memorandum and recomiendation on proposed Bank loans of
US$175 million equivalent to ICICI and US$120 million equivalent to India is
submitted for approval.  The proposed loans would be for 20 years., including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate to help
finance an Export Development Project.
2.       Background.  India's exports grew at about 3Z p.a. in real teoms from
1976177 to 1984185. 'Disappoiuting manufacturing growth and export performance
were predominantly due to the trade and domestic regulatory policies. The
combination of rigid investment licensing, high tariffs and import controls,
cascading indirect taxation, unfavorable exchange rate management and
inefficiency in export compensatory schemes led to inefficient high cost
industries which could not generate sustained export growth.
3.       Since 1985, GOI has initiated a series of policy actions that have -
made significant changes in the policy environment. The domestic regulatory
system has been liberalized by delicensing investments, easing barriers to
expansion, allowing greater imports of capital goods and technology and
gradually streamlining industrial exit policies. The share of imports not
subject to quantitative restrictions has increased significantly. There has
also been a significant reduction in the proportion of industrial investments
subject to licensing. In addition, the tax system has beenvrestructured by
reduction and simplification of income and corporate taxes and a modified
value-added tax (MODVAT) has been,introduced that elii-inates the cascading
effect of indirect taxes facilitating indirect tax deduction for exporters.
4.       The most fundamental changes, however, h#ve been made in export
policies. The most important change has been the adoption of a more realistic
and flexible exchange rate policy by which the real effective exchange rate
has depreciated by 302 between July 1985 and November 1988. New duty
exemption schemes have been introduced so that now almost all inputs that are
used in direct and indirect exports are importable without restrictions and
payment of duties. The GOI has also streamlined the duty drawback and refund
of excise taxes for firms that,use duty-paid and domestic inputs.
5.       Primarily as a result of these reforms, manufacturing, which grew at
an average annual rate of only 4.7? during FY67-FY85 period, accelerated to
about 9t p.s. over the last four years. Manufactured exports, which form
about 781 of total exports, have also accelerated rapidly growing by 132 in
real terms in FY87 and 252 in FY88. However, in order to sustain rapid export
growth, many industries in India will have to modernize and restructure their
processes and products through physical investments to be competitive in the
world markets.                                                    D
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has prepared a series of
sector reports on export promotion, industrial regulation and technology
policy as well as a number of reports on individual subsectors. The 1987 CEM,
'Indias An Industrializing Economy in Transition* (Report No. 6633-IN),



-2-
outlined a three-pronged industrial strategy consisting of domestic dereg-
ulation, export promotion and import liberalization. The Bank has also lent
US$250 million for an Industrial Export (Engineering Products) Project (IEP)
(Loans 2629-IN and 2630-IN). These loans became effective in June 1986 and
are contributing to the restructuring needs of export-oriented enterprises.
The proposed project would support the continuing policy dialogue with the
Government on export policies and provide funds for investments for expansion
of exports and for development of key institutions providing C&nancial and
technical assistance to exporters.
7.       Proiect Obiectives.  While the recent policy changes have eliminated
most bottlenecks that inhibited export growth, domestic firms need significant
assistance in restructuring their products and processes to enter inter-
national markets. The Project woulds (i) help actual and potential exporters
to identify, enter and maintain export markets through assistance for export
marketing, product and process adaptations and improvements; and (ii) com-
plement this assistance with term lending for export related investments.
8.       ProJect Description.  The Project would support an integrated export
development program in four financial institutions, which would play a major
role in helping private sector clients develop export plans for the production
and marketing of their products and in financing the resulting investments.
This integrated program in each institution would include the following three
components: (a) Export Development Funds, which the financial institutions
would administer on behalf of the Government, to assist exporters by giving
them matching grants primarily for costs of consultant and foreign travel
associated with the preparation and implementation of export development plans
(USS20 million); (b) Technical Assistance Funds for improving the financial
institutions' capabilities to promote and appraise export development programs
and export-oriented investments through training of key staff and development
of information linkages (US$2.7 million); and (c) a term lending component to
supply investment funds to export-oriented subprojects for expanding export-
able output (US$275 million). The four financial institutions participating
in the project would be: the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India, Limited (ICICI); Export-Import Bank of India (Eximbank); Bank of
Baroda; and Canara Bank. The total cost of the project is estimated to be
US$730 million, with a foreign exchange cost of US$297.7 million (412). A
grant of 364.5 million yen (US$2.7 million equivalent) from the Japanese Grant
Facility is expected to finance the Technical Assistance component. A break-
down of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and estimated disbursemen.ts are shown in Schedule B. A time-
table of the project's key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7603-IN, dated April 20, 1989, is attached.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Government and the DPIs have established an
Exchange Risk Administration Scheme (ERAS) for relending to large scale
borrowers. Under the ERAS scheme, DFIs will pool their foreign currency
borrowings and relend in local currency at adjustable rates, which will be
adeqaate to provide a 2? spread for DFIs and cover the foreign exchange and
interest risks. Each subloan will initially be set at the prevailing ERAS
rate with a maximum cap rate (presently 152 and 182, respectively). The
Government woulds (a) adjust the ERAS rate as necessary to cover the interest
rate and foreign exchange risks; and (b) would make an advance to the ERAS
fund if the fund runs into a deficit in the short-run due to unexpected
exchange rate movements, but would be repaid when the Fund is in surplus.



. ~-3-
10.      The Government apreods  (a) to pass on US$100 million of the loan to
Government in the form of equity to the two commercial banks and Eximbank
under the terms of financial agreements.  These funds would be relent to small
scale firms at 13.51 and to medium size firms at 142, subject to the maximum
subloan size of US$1 million; and (b) to review the relending terms period-
ically to ensure that the rates to final users remain positive in real terms,
reflective of market conditions and sufficient to provide a reasonable spread
to the financial instLtutions; and (c) to pass on to the participating
financial institutions US$20 million on a grant basis to support the
requirements of the Esport Development Funds to be admiristered on behalf of
Government. It is expected that US$2.7 million from the Japanese Grant
Facility to support the Thes of thc participating financial institutions will
be passed on a non-reimbursable  asis.  Signing of the necessary financial
agreements would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loans.
11.      The participating financial institutions agreed to:  (a) follow
procedures for administering the term lending component, acceptable to the
Bank, including repayment terms of no more than 15 years including up to three
years of grace, agreed maximum loan limits, free limits and minimum financial
and economic rates of return on subprojects of 152 and 12?, respectively;
(b) follow procedures for the administration of the Export Development Funds,
acceptable to the Bank, including a matching requirement of at least 502 from
the beneficiary. free limits for review by Government Steering Committees and
strict standards for evaluation of individual proposals. Procedures for the
administration of the Technical Assistance Funds, acceptable to the Bank, have
been discussed during negotiations and it is expected that these will be
confirmed as part of the understandings to be reached in the context of a
US$2.7 million grant from the Japanese Grant Facility.
12.      Benefits.  The Project would support the Government's successful
export promotion effort and would continue the Bank's role in the process of
industrial reform. The Project would strengthen the ability of four
participating financial institutions to provide production and marketing
advice and investment financing to develop and implement export plans of
private sector borrowers. The Technical Assistance Funds would provide
training for a nucleus of staff in each financial institution in export
marketing and project appraisal and access to international production and
market information. The Export Development Funds would encourage firms to
prepare and implement coherent export development plans through matching funds
for technical assistance in product development and market entry. Under the
IEP, these funds already give evidence of promoting exports many times the
amount of the fund costs. The credit component would finance investments of
private enterprises to improve product quality and expand production for
exports. The loan is expected to finance export-oriented subprojects with
minimum financial and economic rates of return of 15? and 122, respectively.
It is projected that the EDP component will support 300 firms, while about 350
subprojects would be assisted under the term lending component.
13.      Risks. Given the traditional emphasis of Indian industrial policy on
developing production capabilities largely for the domestic market, the
financial institutions have had only limited experience in arvlyzing export
projects. It will be essential that the participating financial institutions
improve their capability to promote and appraise investments for export
production; the technical assistance and export development funds are designed



-4-
to ensure that they do this effectively. The proposed Foreign Exchange Risk
Administration Scheme is an Important Innovation linking the relending rates
to she cost of funds through the mechanism of floating rates. Since this
scheme is new, the Government, ICICI and the Bank will monitor developments
closely to ensure that the relending rates adjust properly to cover the costs
of foreign borrowings and meet the needs of the financial institutions and
subborrowers for some predictability in their financial plaoning.
14.      Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loans comply with
the Articles of Agteement of the Bank and recowuend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
