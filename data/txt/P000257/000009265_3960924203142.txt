URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 766-BUR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        This report presents a completion evaluation of the Urban
Development Project financed by Credit 766-BUR for US$8.2 million, which was
approved on January 31, 1978. As of July 31, 1986, US$5,635.54 was cancelled
from the Credit.
2.        The project was slow to start up and experienced a number of delays
due to technical and policy problems. By and large, however, the project met
its objectives and it can be said that the project has had a significant
impact on urban policy and development in Burkina Faso.
3.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion Report was
sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

BURKINA FASO
IURBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 766)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Urban Development Project was conceived as a follow-up
and expansion of a successful squatter upgrading project supported by
UNDP in Ouagadougou. The project became the Bank's first experience
in the country's growing urban sector and one of the early urban
development projects in Africa (paras 2.01 - 2.02).
2.        The Urban Development Project was supported by a
US$8.2 million credit equivalent (Cr. 766-BUR), which was signed in
March 1978. The total project cost of US$10.82 million equivalent
provided for squatter upgrading, sites and services, water supply
distribution, construction loans, social services and community
facilities, and technical assistance to municipalities and the central
government (paras 2.04 - 2.05).
3.        The project was slow to start up and suffered delays due to
disagreements on standards as well as to other technical and
managerial problems.  This resulted in the closing date of
December 1981, being revised on fcur occasions, until it was finally
achieved on December 31, 1985 (paras 3.02 - 3.04).
4.        A number of revisions took place during the life of the
project: while the water supply, construction loans and community
facilities components were only partially completed, the number of
upgraded plots and sites and services was greater than projected;  the
technical assistance components were probably the least successful
(paras 3.09 - 3.17).
5.        Given the variations of the FCFA vis a vis the dollar over
the life of the project, the actual project costs came to FCFA 3.26
billion or US$10.2 million.  A total of US$8,194,364 of the IDA credit
wes disbursed, and only US$5,635 were cancelled at the end of the
project (paras 3.20 - 3.21).
6.        For the components that were completed, the economic
reevaluation demonstrated a slightly higher agregate ERR than that
estimated at appraisal (paras 4.06 - 4.10). In spite of its delays
and shortcomings, the project by and large met its objectives, and has
had a significant positive impact on the country's urban policies. A
second urban project is currently under preparation.

BURKINA FASO
URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COf1PLETTON REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
101      At the time of the preparation of the Upper Volta Urban
Development Project in 1976, Burkina Paso, as it is now known, was one of
the least developed and most rural countries, with less than 9% of its
population living in urban areas and a per capita CNP of US$110. Despite
its predominantly rural character, the country had experienced a sustained,
rapid urban growth since inclependence in 1960, of about 5% per year.
Periodic droughts and slow growth at the rural economy contributed to the
capital of Ouagadougou growing at about 7% per annum, compared to the
country's yearly population increase of 2.3%.  About 80% of the urban labor
force worked outside the formal sector and had household incomes averaging
CFAF 10,000 or US$40 a month. Underemployment, illiteracy and poor health
were the rule in the squatter settlements that began to surround the
commercial and residential centers of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.
These settlements were characterized by very low densities (40-90 persons/
hectare) and a total lack of any urban infrastructure or services. Of
58 standpipes in Ouagadougou at the time, only four were in the squatter
areas although these accounted for more than half the city's population.
1.02      Building upon a successful squatter upgrading project
supported by UNDP, this project became the Bank's first experience in the
country's urban sector and one of the early urban development projects in
Africa. At the time of Board presentation, the Bank Group's contribution
to the development of the country consisted of 15 IDA projects
totalling US$89.4 million. Most of these projects were related to
agricultural and rural development following a strategy dict .ed by the
extreme poverty of the country and the need to raise productivity in
agriculture and livestock, on which the bulk of the population depended for
a livelihood. In addition, there were a few projects developing basic
infrastructure necessary to the economv, such as road construction and
upgrading and telecommunications.
1.03      The Urban Development Project was supported by US$8.2 million
equivalent (Cr. 766-BUR), which was signed March 16, 1978.  The project was
slow to start up, as evidenced by the effectiveness date of 12/2/79, and
took much longer to implement than originallv estimated with the closing
date of 12/81 being revised on four occasions until it was finally achieved
on 12/31/85. These delays were due to disagreements on standards and other
technical and managerial problems as well as to continued political unrest
until the present regime came to power in August of 1983. Nevertheless,
the objectives of the project were met by and large and it can be said that
the project has had a significant impact on urban policy and development in
Burkina Faso. I'his project completion report has been prepared on the
basis of:



(a)  visitq to the field and interviews with local officials;
(b)  quarterly reports and draft project completion reports
prepared bv consultants to the project unit;
(c       lock dvcuments including the appraisal report, loan documents,
qupervision reports and others; and
(d)  interviews with Bank officials involved with the project.
II. PR0O.llC'' I1D)=TIFICATlON, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin and Formulation of the Project
2'01      Tn 1973, with the assistance of the UNDP, the government
naunched a three-year experimental program to improve the living conditions
of p or urban houseliolds in Cissin, one of Ouagadougou's older squatter
settlemaents. This effort succeeded in upgrading some eight hectares of
land inhabited by 266 families and provided 600 serviced plots. It
demonstrated the feasibility of providing low-cost infrastructure and
housing through self-help and community participation. Legalized tenure
stimulated private investment and neighborhood participation although
financial aspects susch as cost recovery for infrastructure and recovery of
loans for housing improvements were less than satisfactory. In November
1975, the Ministrv of Public Works convened an international conference to
evaluate the Cissin experience and to determine its applicability on a
larger scale. On the basis of this evaluation the government adopted the
Cissin concept as the cornerstone of Its policy for upgrading squatter
areas.
2.02      Following a reniiest bv the Minister of Public WTorks at the end of
1975, a Bank identification/preparation mission took place in February
1976. The mission recognized that the government's policy towards the
urban sector based or, the "Cissin Experience was one of the most realistic
and enlightened that the Bank has vet encountered" and a project building
directly of that experience, which would require a relatively short
preparation period was identified. In order to address the problem of
em'iloyment it was proposed to closelv link the project to a DFC project
which was pre-arpraised at the time of the identification preparation
mission. Tn addition, the proposed project would also build upon the
efforts of UN agencies such as UNICEF and WHO in the field of social
services, and of CESAO and Canadian assistance in the development of
neighborhood savings and loans cooperatives called "caisses populaires".
2,03      Preparation of the project was characterized by a great degree of
coordination withn the DFC project, regarding urban employment, and of
enordination with UN agenieies, concerning the urban and social services
There were visits back and forth between TYNDP and Bank staff, and a UNCHS
member participated in preparation and appraisal missions. For a while the
idea of a single, integrated DEC/Urban project was pursued, in spite of the
complexity of such an enterprise and the differences in the level of
preparation of the two projects. Eventually, the Artisan, Small, and



- 3 -
Medium Enterprise Project was appraised separately, although the two
projects remained closely linked and mutually supportive. The Government
requested a US$100,000 advance from the Project Preparation Facility for
aerial photographv, preliminarv layouts for sites and services and squatter
upgrading areas (12 man-months) and a studv for the extension of water
distribution systems. Two more preparation missions followed the
identification/preparation mission during 1976.  The appraisal misslon took
place ir February of 1977.
B.   Appraisal
2.04      The project as described in the staff appraisal report was as
follows:
(a) Upgrading: Provision of basic urban infrastructure including
water supply, drainage and earth roads to approximately 11,000
plots in existing squatter neighborhoods, covering 432 hectares
in Ouagadougou (7,000 plots) and Bobo-Dioulasso (4,000 plots);
(b) Sites and Services: Preparation and servicing of about 1,100 new
plots, a planned residential area covering 50 hectares adjacent
to the upgraded neighborhood in Bobo-Dioulasso. A pilot site and
service area for 100 families will be developed in Gaoua;
(c) Water Supply Distribution: In addition to the upgraded
neighborhoods and sites and services area, water supplv will be
provided to some 20,000 persons living in three other squatter
neighborhoods in Ouagadougou;
(d) Cnrnstruction Loans: Financing of loans for housing improvements
and start-up construction;
(e) Social Services and Community Facilities: Rehabilitation of
65 schools and 17 dispensaries in both cities; construction of
neighborhood community centers, and markets, a pilot community
development project to finance experiments in community
education, public health and women's activities; and purchase of
insecticide, spraying pumps, and a small truck for insecticide
spraying in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.
(f) Assistance to the Municipalities:
(i) technical assistance for:
- training maintenance workers;
- improving management and tax collection procedures;
- reorganization of technical services; and
- expansion of housing offices;
(ii) equipment:
- garbage trucks for the Municipality of Ouagadougou;
- tools for vehicle repair, carpentry, metal works, and



- 4-
conetruction; and
-~ ehicles and equipment for municipal housing offices.
(iiI) relhabilitation of the Ouagadougou municipal garage for
r.iilltenance vehicles; and
[ix)8 tfart-up costs for garbage collection in Ouagadougou and
in.ecticide spraying and municipal housing offices in both
cities for t7wo Nyears.
IJ) Assistance to the Department of Town Planning:
(i') technical assistance for project execution;
(ii)  consultant services for feasibility study and detailed
engineering and design of the project, and preparation of a
second project during project implementation;
(iii)  start-up costs of the Project Unit within the Department of
l'rbanism for three years, from 1978 to 1980; and
(ix') purchase of equipment, supplies, and vehicles; and
(h)  Monitoring and Evaluation:  Local cov'sultant services for sample
surveys and case studies of the perfo.-mance of project components
during and after project execution.
2.03      The total project cost was estimated at US$10.4 million.  IDA's
contributioni of US$ 8.2 million would cover 100% of the foreign exchange
costs (US$6.0 million) and 71% of local cost. Funds for sq dtter upgrading
sites and services and other civil works would be relent by the Government
to the miunicipalities at 6% interest for 17 years with a 5-year grace
perind during which no interest would accrue. Funds for school and clinic
rehabilitation, the public hygiene program and technical assistance would
be passed on to the municipality as grants.  Funds for technical assistance
to tie project unit and for the pilot community development fund would also
be pto,ided as granits.
Overall responsibility for project execution would lie with a
project unit established in the Department of Urbanism of the Ministry of
P'ublic horks.  T'he municipalities, however, would be responsible for their
respective components, as would the National Water Office. Coordination
'or pro4ect execution would be assured through an Interministerial
Coordinating Committee. The project brief recognized that "formidable
personnel and resource constraints, coupled with the weakness of executing
agencies, emphasized the high risk nature of this project".  This
assessment turned out to be quite accurate,

J T. 7NP! FME  TATION
A.   Credit Effectiveness and Start-up
3.(1      The Credit Agreement was signed on March 16, 197/8.  The special
conditions f'or effectiveness included two articles:
(a)  signature of financing agreements regarding on-lending terms with
the municipalities of Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou, the water
authority (ONE) and the sanitation maintenance authority
(FONASEN), for the execution of their respective project
components; and
(b)  the issuance of legal opinions establishing that the above
subsidiarv agreements had been ratified, executed, and were
legally binding.
3.02      The date for effectiveness specified in the credit agreement of
June 30, 1978 was revised several times. The signature of financing
agreements and then the issuance of legal opinions, both suffered delays.
The delays resulted from a slowdown of the decision making process due to
the lengthy change-over from military to civilian rule, as well as from
unfamiliaritv with the complex, cross-sectoral process. The credit finally
became effective on February 2, 1979.
3.03      Some of these problems of internal communications carried over
into the start-up of the project and new ones developed, resulting in
further slippages with regard to the implementation schedule. One of the
most serious problems that arose was the Minister of Public Works rejection
of infrastructure standards agreed upon at appraisal for upgrading, in
favor of higher standards; he also refused to agree to changes, in what was
seen bv the Bank, as inadequate management of the project unit. The
Mnister's public disavowal of the agreements resulted in a lack of
enthusiasm of other executing agencies about their participation in the
project, and a confusion and loss of momentum by the consultants that had
recentlv been contracted to undertake detailed engineering and begin the
technical assistance.
3.04      Thus, bv March 1979, the estimated project costs had increased
from US$10.8 million to U7S$12.5, largely due to the delays, and
disbursements stood at US$0.14 million instead of US$4.0 million estimated
at appraisal. Bank staff and the Minister of Public Works were deadlocked
and, at the request of Programs, the project was declared a prob:em project
in April 1979. High level compromises involving Bank management, that led
to a series of project revisions, were arrived at bv the end of thc year.



-6-
h.   Project Revisions
l o!      A nunbler of revisions were introduced to the project largely as a
result of in?stitutional problems and disagreements on upgrading standards
PW pll-ey issues.  Tnitiallv, the squatter upgrading component rm.a into
difficulties when the Minister of Public Works, as mentioned above,
objected to the infrastruicture standards agreed upon during negotiations,
-i:d particularly to those concerning the circulation and storm drainage
network-  The Minister favored wider roads in a standard grid pattern over
the "soft" upgrading with a narrower primarily pedestrian network devised
to minimize the demolition of Pxisting dwellings. After extensive
discussions and delays, it was agreed to proceed with the upgrading of the
Cissin neighborhood in Ouagadougou, (200 ha) as with Sonsoribougou in
Bobo-Dioulasso (132 ha).  Eventually the project undertook an extension of
Son,soribougou (110 ha) that had been started by the municipal government on
its onm.  The Zogona Gulley channelization, as well as the upgrading of the
surrounding squatter settlements (100 ha) was dropped in 1981, however,
when the Government reclassified the area as an administrative zone for the
future extension of the university.
3.06      The funds made available by the reduction of the squatter
upgrading component were proposed to be reallocated to increase the sites
and services component. Thus, in 1982 a sites and services project was
proposed in Ouagadougou to relocate the larger number of families resulting
frord the more radical upgrading scheme adopted in Cissin. The 78 ha site
was located near the squatter upgrading area and was eventually extended by
another 600 ha. Similarly, the Bobo-Dioulasso sites and services component
was also increased from an initial 50-65 ha. The 100 unit sites and
scrvices in Caoua was completed and not extended.
3.0,      Two other components were dropped in the course of project
implementation, for different reasons. The water supply component which
proposed :o extend existing distribution networks to some 20,000 families
in the low-income neighborhoods of Tampouy, Tanghin, and Hambadallaye, had
been included in the project on the assumption that the city's production
uf witer would be increased by 1981.  IWhen this was not accomplished by the
untional water authority (ONE), it was decided to exclude the component due
to insuifficient water supply. The decision also reflected differences on
standards and on the method for preparing detailed engineering.  The home
construction loans component, which was intended to support the upgrading
and sites and services activities was dropped from the project, within the
conitext of the policv disagreements between the Bank and the Government.
The Government's position was that recovery of the loans would be too
difficult and politicallY sensitive.
C,   Implementation Pcrformance
3o0       Project implementation was estimated at the time of appraisal to
tak-e about 3.5 years. The schedule was designed to maintain the momentum
of site preparation activities that were underway. By December 1977, the
site plan for Cissin had been completed and consultants for the detailed



- 7 -
engineering had been recrujited.  Th is wa s a I  hbeing financed by a ]1']F
advance of UIS$300,000.  In retrospect. tht proposed schedule seems somewhat
ambitious as artual implementation took closer to 0.6  vears.  At the end of
the initially estimated implementation perind. only a little over a quarter
of the credit (L'S$2.2 million), had been disbursed, mainlv for consultants
and equipment. Project implementation improved after the first closing
date extension, and permitted the subsequent e),ten ions of the H using
date.  These extensions were also justified in order to concludle the
various components that were being executed. The overall extension of the
credit also resulred in the 9lmost totaj disbursement of the credit.
Physical Components
3.09      Aside from projecr revisions and delays in implementation
mentioned above, the phvsical components at least partially met their
objectives. The balance for the sites and services and squatter upgrading
components is positive. For the reasons explained above, the number of
units upgraded in squatter settlements slightlv decreased, but the number
of sites and services utnits was considerably augmented. Thus, the total
number of units for both components was 25% greater thian estimated at
appraisal, going from a projected 8,096 to 11,831 units actually built.
This was achieved by the re-allocation of funds between the two components,
following the project revisions and by the transfer of resources from the
two other physical components mentioned above (see actual vs. estimated
project costs, para 3.20). The actual vs. estimated number of units and
areas developed for the sites and services and upgrading components by city
are shown in Table 3.1.
3.10      On the other hand, the social services and communitv facilities
was onlv partially completed: while the 60 schools and 17 dispensaries in
both cities were largely rehabilitated, the neighborhood community centers
and markets were not built. The latter were intended to be built under the
last extension of the credit. The project available funds were
substantiallv diminished by the Thanges in the currency rates however, and
it was decided to emplov these resources in the improvement and completion
of the shelter-related components. As stated, the water supply
distribution and home improvement loans were dropped from the project and
the development impact of these components was therefore not realized.

3.11      As mentioned above, design standards for squatter upgrading and
sites and services was an issue that led to disagreements between IDA and
the Government. The original proposal envisaged a demolition of no more
than 10% of existing dwellings, with a road network of narrow streets
adapted to the organic layout of the settlements. The government argued
for a regular, orthogonal layout with wide boulevards which would require
substantial demolition. The compromise arrived at after lengthy
negotiations had residential land use coefficients of 51% (low) to
64% (reasonable) compared to the average 68% proposed at appraisal, but
also fewer and wider roads of up to 20m and 25m sections. This involved
excessive demolition of existing dwellings, which were easily enough
rebuilt, but also the destruction of over one hundred large trees which are
not in abundance. Table 3.2 shows the land use coefficients for all the
subprojects lot sizes averaged about 375m2, as opposed to 300m2 envisaged
at appraisal.

3.12      Another issue that affected the projects in both cities was the
poor design of storm drainage. There were two types of design problems
that resulted in damage to infrastructure that required fairly extensive
repairs. In the upgrading and sites and services in Bobo-Dioulasso and in
the upgrading in Ouagadougou the design of the storm drainage systems
responded exclusively to the project site requirements without taking into
account the larger area or catchmn-nt basins they were located in. In the
case of Ouagadougou, the relatively flat project site was repeatedly
flooded until the drainage sYstem sections were enlarged to allow for
faster evacuation. In the case of Bobo-Dioulasso the newly 'irbanized
project areas increased the flow of storm waters downstream chat resulted
in the flooding and damaging of the older, densely populated Colma
neighborhood.
3.13      The second proolem in both cities, involved testing an idea (of
the designer/builder) that turned out to be a rather bad one. This was to
cut the storm drainage channels, in areas with a hard laterite surface,
direct]y in the sandstone without the concrete or masonrv surfacing that is
applied in parts where the earth was softer. This short-cut in the name of
economy, resulted in severe erosion of the channels and even the roads that
run along in some parts and threatened culverts, bridges and other works as
well.  In consequence, fairlv extensive repairs had to he undertaken,
diverting funds from other project components that were intended to be
completed during the last phase of the project, such as the community
facilities.
Non-Physical Components
3.14      Of the non-physical components onlv the proposed monitoring and
evaluation was not carried out. This component intended to engage local
consultant services for sample surveys and case studies of the performance
of project components during and after project execution. This was due



- To -
f  St to tlhe dL Lnys i  the injl I emet-It ion of the she)ter sub-project whICh
l ed to the p)ostppciement t of Lhe component, and then to the lack of
ecntlius)a¾1f in hoth the proJect unit and the housing offices for the
feedback the exercise might provide. On the other hand, the assistance to
the municip-alities and to the project unit in the department of UTrban
l'Ianning, wxb'ch (oristed largely of foreign consultant services, exceeded
the resourres initia11N allocated for these components by almost 50%.  This
resulted largely from the extension of project and the continued need of
support ro ensure reaqonlile execution of the project while execution of
phvsictl works was assured.  Other institutional objectives of the
technical assistance such as the reorganization of the municipal public
works departments or the improvement of tax collection and management were
not substantiallv achieeved. Again, this can be attributed in part to
delays In project execution, and tc problems in timing the corresponding
technical assiHtance, and in part to weakness of local institutions and
inadeauate design of technical assistance.
3.15      The assistsnce to muunicipalities included the purchase of
vehicles and equipment as well as training, technical assistance and
operating costs. Aside from minor procurement problems addressed below,
the purchase of vehicles and equipment was successfully completed and
resoonded to, if not totallv satisfied, the needs of the municipalities.
Most purchases were achieved early on during project execution close to the
original schedule. The major problem associated with this subcomponent was
the ongoing maintenance of the fleet for lack of spare parts due to the
cumbersome procurement procedures for these items. In restrospect a
twYo-year supplv of basic spare parts or a special fund for their provision
would have been adequate. The training of mechanics associated with the
purchase of equinment was only partially successful:  most of the trainees
were not literate and this hindered the effort. In additio , a high
personnel turnover rate made for the training to be diluted in terms of its
imoa(t in the two municipal public works departments.  At the end of
project implementation, a greater effect seems to have been made in
Bobo-Dioul;-a so where improved organization of maintenance services is stili
in place.  ! -ever, due to the problems mentioned above, the overall
roreanization of the ouDblic works departments was not achieved in either
of the municipalities.
Part or the assistance to the municipalities concerned the
i,oproverent of tax collection and financial management.  One consultant
inte-rvenedl in 1983, and recommended mainly an increase in water taxes. The
fact thlat this was proposed as a single, isolated measure was not deemed
satisfactorv bv either the Bank nor the Government.  New terms of reference
were drawn up and a consultant from among five new candidates was selected
in av, 198l., Although the Assoc4ation considered his experience in
municlpal finances was insufficient, it was agreed to proceed with the
contract, given the interest of the municipalities in the assistance. In
the end, the consultant demanded a sizeable increase in his fees which the
municipality of Ouagadougou refused, and the contract was never signed.
Thereafter, technical assistance for tax and finance Improvement was not
carried out,



- 11 -
3.17      Assistance to the Department of Urbanism included technJIcal
assistance for detailed engineering, project execution and management, ano
preparation of the second urban project, as well as operatirg cost for the
Project Unit, and vehicles and equipnment. Again, the extended
implementation period required the extension of technical assisLance and
operating costs that substantially exceeded the initial estimates. Things
worked well though, in spite of several changes in local staff and in
consultants which involved several contracts and extensions over the years.
This component also included technical assistance for the establishment of
neighborhood savings and loans associations in each city. Only one was
established in Cissin, with Canadian assistance which was still ongoing at
the time of the project completion mission. The responsibilitv for this
component was transferred from the Ministry of Public Works to that of
Rural Development. The last contract under this component was signed in
October 1985, for the preparation of a feasibility study for the second
urban project whose preparation is currently underway. The available funds
did not cover the entire feasibility study, which required a supplemental
PPF approved by IDA in May, 1986.
D.   Covenants and Reporting
3.18      The Burkina Faso government fulfilled most of the eighteen credit
conditions and covenants although not always in a timely fashion. The
covenants not met were those regarding the components that were dropped
from the project: the rehabilitation of the Zogona neighborhood and gulley
(schedule 2, A and I), the extension of water distribution networks to
three low-income neighborhoods (schedule 2, L), and the provision of
housing improvement loans (schedule 2, D).  In addition, the establishment
of an interministerial coordinating committee (3.05) was no met either.
Auditing of the project account for each fiscal year (4.01), suffered
delays but was finally brought upto-date by the end of the project,
including for the period of the credit extensions. The audits, which were
carried out bv a local firm and found to be acceptable to the Bank, were
for three periods: from effectiveness to 1981, 1981 to 1984, and 1984 to
project completion. The quarterly project reports (3.12a) were also slow
to start-up but achieved a good level of quality and timeliness in the last
three years of project execution.
E.   Procurement
3.19      No major procurement issues were raised during project
implementation. International competitive bidding was successfully used
for the bulk of the works, equipment purchases, and consulting services0
Local competitive bidding was used for topographical surveys,
rehabilitation of community facilities and construction of communal water
taps. Some minor problems were the following:
(a) one incident concerning the ICB involved a latrine emptying
cistern truck which was rejected twice for faulty or inadequate
pumping parts, before it was finally accepted towards the end of



12 -
the project.  in another  instance, ,it the request of the
IPunicipalitv of Boho-r)ioulasso, a bulldozer, not initially
ins lucled inT the project, was proposed to be financed 507 hv the
municipal-itv and 507 bv the project. The Association initially
b'hiected to the direct purchase procedures being utilized, but
lft or reviewing the case, waived the TCB requirements;
(h5  concerning 1LCB, work bv small contractors was not always
jrtisfactory and, in. the case of communal water taps, required
extensive repairs or improvements. rhe surveving work in
Ouagadougou was awarded to a gove,nment agency, who then
proceeded to increase the cost of its services. The Association
objected, and after discuissions and delavs, the agenev carried
out the work on1 the basis of its initial bid.
Ff 8   Costs
Table 3.3 provides a summary of the appraisal estimates and
actual project costs as of June 1986. The FCFA varied between 245 and 360
lc the dollar over the life of the project.  Thus, while the dollar

IV'.  INSTITUTIONAT., ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Institutional. Aspects
4.01      The institutional arrangements of the project as appraised were
fairlv complicated, involving more than a half dozen units in the
municipalities, the central government and the decentralized utilities.
Three offices, one in each municipality and the project unit in the
Ministry of Public Works, which bore the main responsibility for the
variouis components, were newly created for the purposes of the project.
Given this set of circumstances, plus the high turnover rate of personnel
in the different agencies and the political confrontations within the
Government, It is not surprising that the institutional aspects were among
the least successful of the project components. Nevertheless, some
progress was made.
4.02      The project unit was established within the Department of
Urbanism of the Ministry of Public Works and was responsible for preparing
and evaluating bidding documents, supervising detailed engineering and



- 15 -
execution of civil works, assisting the municipal housing offices and
managing the disbursement of project funds. The unit, which underwent
several personnel changes and required reinforcements by external
consultants, managed, nonetheless, tc) achieve most of its objectives.
At the end of the project it was running smoothly and efficiently although
it was slated to disappear at project completion. Staff were re-absorbed
largely into the Ministry of Public Works, although the project accountant
was seconded to the project unit for the second u;t J   roject. in the
Ministry of Territorial Administration.  In sp,ite          e problems
encountered, the project unit was crucial to the         .,s of the project.
It is unlikely that any existing sectoral agency co,-_ have bridged the
cross-sectoral gaps as well as the project unit, or provided at least a
thread of continuity and purpose over time.
4.03      The municipalities of Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou were
responsible for (a) provision of services such as garbage collection
maintenance of community facilities and insecticide spraying; (b) housing
related activities through the municipal housing offices established by the
project, and (c) for reorganizing and strengthening the departments of
public works, tax collection and financial management. The provision of
services was accomplished as the equipmenL for garbage collection and
insecticide spraying became available and was not provided when the trucks
broke down or the insecticide ran out. The maintenance of schools and
dispensaries was carried out as foreseen.
4.04      The housing offices managed to discharge its accounting and
technical responsibilities vis-a-vis the sites and services and squatter
upgrading projects although additional technical assistance, provided by
consultants was required at different times.  The community development
activities including project publicity and plot allocation activities were
also accomplished.  The link with the savings and loan subproject did not
take place as the responsibility for this component was transmitted to the
Ministry of Rural Development at the request of the Minister of Public
Works.  The major shortcoming at the municipal level concerned the reorga-
nization and strengthening of the departments of Public Works, tax col-
lection and municipal finances.  None of these subcomponents was
substantially achieved. Several factors contributed to this situation,
including the lack of political will by the government at the time, the
poor timing of consultant interventions due to slippages of project
execution and last but not least, the inadequacy of consultant services
particularly in the case of tax collection and financial management.
4.05      Finally, the failure by the Government to establish the inter-
ministerial coordinating committee (one of the covenants not met)
undoubtedly contributed to some of the problems described above.  The
committee was to be made up of two ministers, several -directors-gene ral and
other directors, representing the different agencies involved in the
project.  The committee, to be chaired by the Minister of Puiblic Works, was
to meet at least six times a year to ensure the coordination of project
execution and the fulfillment bv all agencies concerned of their respective
responsibilities. The committee would also resolve any problems and even

At appraisa'l  an aggregitn- Ite (if return was calculated for the
S'ltira tew 1eirgrad ing, Sites and services, and water supply components, which
togetler made up approxim.itciv 757 of total project costs.  The aggregate
ERR was found to he 3i4.  Sensitivitv analvsis was carried out, with both a
A(j7increase in costs and a 207 decrease in benefits, and the rate of
return did not- drop below 217.  As mentioned above, during implementation,
tho water supply component- was excluded from the project.
4.07      At appraisal, economic rates of return for the squatter upgrading
and sites and servrices were calculated using expected increases in the
propertv values as a measure of project benefits.  Land values for unim-
proved project areas and improved areas with similar locational charac-
teristics were estimated on the basis of the U1'P Cissin squatter upgrading
area.  Proolect costs used itn the economic analysis included all on-site
infrastructure costs, an allocated share of off-site costs, detailed
engineering and construction supervision, physical contingencies and
operation and maintenance. Also included were building materials and labor
for housing construction and improvement, project administration costs and
the withiout-proiect market price of land (believed to reflect opportunity
costs). All costs t;ere in Tune 1977 prices and were net of taxes and
duties,
4.08      Based on the benefits and costs described above, economic rates
o  ret urrt found for upgrading and sites and services were:
Ouagado'igou
Cissin Upgrading                407
.ogona  4pgradinc               24
lonbo-Dioulasso
Sonsoribougori Upgrading        317
Sites and services               372
The sensitivit  analvsis indicated that these ERR were relatively insensi-
!ive to a '07 increase in costs and somewhat more sensitive to a 20%
reduction in benefits.
.09     Based o:n actual nosts and current estimated property values, the
econoric reevaluntion followed the same metlhod as the original analysis.
Nue to the changes in project composition described above, however, one
upgrading subpro-ect was deleted (Qogonar, Ouagadougou) and one sites -nd
ser\2ices project was added, also in Ouagadougou.  The ERR found for the
projects in both ci.ies is the following (see annex 3):

Bobo-Dioulasso
Sonsoribougou Upgrading         3'
Sites and Services              427,
4.10       It is interesting to note that of the three components that can
be compared with appraisal estimates, i.e., the upgrading in Ouagadougou
and both the upgrading and sites and services in Bobo-Dioulasso, only the
Ouagadougou upgrading is off the mark. Vlhile the actual ERR is slightly
higher for both projects in Bobo-Dioulasso, the Cissin upgrading has almost
half the ERR estimated at appraisal.  This is due largely to the changes in
the urban design, which was long a bone of contention between the Govern-
ment and IDA, that resulted in much wider streets and therefore somewhat
less "saleable" land for plots. Costs were also increased when as a result
of the design changes above, a considerably larger storm drainage system
had to be built. It is also to be noted that the sites and services
projects in both cities average substantially higher ERRs than the upgra-
ding projects: 41% vs 26Z. Although this was foreseen in the original
analysis for the case of Bobo-Dioulasso, the spread was not as significant:
377 vs 317. The economic reevaluation thus confirms that the sites and
services and upgrading components of the project were indeed a sound
investment.
C.   Cost Recovery and Affordabilitv
4.11      Under the project, cost recovery was to come from two sources:
direct project beneficiaries and city-wide taxation. Direct beneficiaries
were to pay for land acquisition, detailed engineering, on-site plot
development, management charges of the Housing Offices, and home
improvement loans. The cost recovery mechanism included plot charges,
water tariffs, and loan pavments. The city-wide population was to pay
through municipal taxes for community facilities, off-site infrastructure
investments, and municipal assistance. Technical assistance to the Depart-
ment of Urbanism and the municipalities were considered as institution
building activities and were the onlv project costs not recovered directly.
Due to changes in the project and to the delays in its execution, much of
the recovery did not take place to the extent that was planned (see para
4.13).  Aside from the home improvement loans that were dropped from the
project (presumably for reasons of affordability), the technical assistance
for improving tax assessment and collection did not take place and plot
charges for direct beneficiaries were modified to cover somewhat less than
100% of the costs.
4,12      Under the project, squatters or customary tenure residents in the
project areas were to make a one time pavment of FCFA 15,000.  The costs of
these plots, which would amount to no more than 107 of total number of
plots, was to be cross-subsidized by new outside beneficiaries. In a
meeting held in Cissin in 1982 with the customary residents, the proposed



- i8 -
pCxrienrh Were strongly oIjected.  As a result, the government decided to
t.l oCC  lati r p cn t t o r(JA 10 per sctLare meter, or FCFA 3,750 for the
a~\tcra£e *A eplot, and decrease regular plot costs by not applying the
hi chor crocc-snhsidv, The surreys conducted at the time were the basis for
Lt' t`eCLlxOTendotion to dron the home iinprovement loans as well.  New
½.wficiar-ies were to make a downpayment of FCFA 15,000, equivalent to
lout '(1' of tl-e coats, and pay the remainder at 8 1/2% interest over a
oti,4id (4 ton years. Contrary to the efforts to reduce plot charges, the
s    prciect execultion requlted in increased costs.  The recalculated
Plot cost; came ro FCFA /475 per square meter in Ouagadougou and FCFA 565
per scuare meter in Bobo-Dioulasso.  On this basis, it was decided to
-ncreao' tI? downpavment to FCFA 25,000. Tn retrospect, this decision did
alfeCt aOfoCrdahilitv leoxels but not as muclh as one might have suspected.
T'e manitoring and evaltiation component which was specifically to have
looked init( this, was unfortunatelv not carrled out.  On the basis of a
sp'; s-,urvey, lic)o,,e\xer, which was conducted in preparation for the second
urban project, the target population, by and large, seems to have been
reached.
-+. s      hlie process of plot allocation was a lot lengthier and more
.-'r-pIica-ed than foieseen at appraisal.  This resulted from legal approvals
requi-ed for allocation and cost recovery procedures.  Thus, after many
rex'iews, allocation criteria and procedures were sanctioned in March 1983,
%. Ihl e the cost recovery procedures or "cahier de charges" were approved in
April of  hlie same year.  Once procedures had been agreed to the Commissions
for plot allocation were established and then suspended following the
change in government in August 1983.  They were finally reinstated and
hegan operations in earlv 1984.  By the project closing date at the end of
i985, plot allocation had been completed for both sites and services and
uipgrading projects in Bobo-Dioulasso and was proceeding somewhat more
Jlowly in Ouagadougou. Cost recovery started off well. At the end of
i98', beneficiaries in arrears totaled 18%.  Following measures introduced
b! the new government concerning salaries and rents, however, arrears
lncreaFed t,. 367T six mponths later. This situation has begun to improve as
aresult of the implementation of efforts to reduce arrears of more than
'.) davs and bring all beneficiaries up-to-date. In Bobo-Dioulasso in
!keeping with these principles, 66 families who had not made the required
doxennavmert were obliged to give up their plots, which were then reassigned
,o othsers ^n the waiting list.  The housing developmaent funds in
(unpadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso had received FCFA 166 million and FCFA 240
iJlinoi respectively by thle end of 1985.

A.   Bank Performance
.I'he Bank's o7erall performance has been largely satisfactory.  At
roe saqe time, there is little doubt that at appraisal the Bank underes-
iirmtr'd Ihe difficulties in undertaking a fairly ambitious and complex
prr,4ect. V'hile some aspects of the project were given a great deal of
ationtion at appraisal, such as the squatter upgrading and sites and



- 19 -
services, others were looked at only superficially. Consequently, few
resources were dedicated to such components, as in the case of the
improvement of tax assessment and collection. Some of the changes that
took place during the life of the project reflected changes of position of
the government, such as in the case of design standards. Other changes,
however, reflected insufficient or inadequate information and probably
should not have been included in the first place, such as the water
distribution component which was dropped when it was established there
wasn't enough water production.  (People in these areas continue to
purchase water from door to door vendors).
5.02      During project execution the Bank demonstrated a good deal of
flexibility in order to break the impasse arrived at over eesign standards
and other issues with the government. The compromises were reasonably
satisfactory and in any case outweighed the negative consequences of a
break with government and the suspension of the credit.  It was largely as
a result of the Bank's decision to pursue the project through many changes
and adaptations that it was finally successfully completed. As a result of
the length of the implementation period, Bank staff re~sponsible for the
project changed on a number of occasions and overlapped less than would
have been desirable. This led to changes in emphasis and priorities
although a reasonable continuity was maintained throughout project
execution.
5.03      The shortcomings on the Bank's part reflect the fact that urban
projects were relatively new at the time, and that the Bank was at the
beginning of the learning curve in this field. All in all, however the
project attained its general objectives.  More importantly, it established
squatter upgrading and sites and services as the cornerstones of government
housing policy. Today, these programs are helping Burkina Faso meet the
challenge of urbanization. The Bank, in its persistence to complete the
project in spite of numerous difficulties, certainly deserves a good part
of the credit due.
B.   Lessons Learned
5.04      The lessons that can be drawn from this project have largely been
demonstrated by the earlier completion of other projects. It is still
useful to go over these in the context of this particular experience.
Among the central issues is that of project complexity and the requ±red
coordination in its implementation.  The experience in this case demon-
strates that projects and particularly first projects, should be kept
relatively simple in terms of the number of components, as well as the
number of participating agencies.  Although there are often opportunities
for simultaneously developing a number of different components that are
mutually reinforcing, it is probably a better idea to go with fewer
components even at the risk of making less dramatic advances in the sector.
A major advantage is that there are less interacting agencies involved that
can pose difficulties in one component that repercut in the project as a
whole. Along the same lines, it is desirably to keep the creation of new
agencies to a minimum, and preferable to work with existing institutions.
