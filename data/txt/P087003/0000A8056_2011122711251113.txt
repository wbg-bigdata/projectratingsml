                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is completed and all activities planned were implemented successfully. However, the project did not fully achieve the original project development objectives,
                         which were formally revised in January 2010 along with the project key performance indicators (KPIs). Final evaluation of the project indicates that the revised PDOs have been
                         substantially achieved as demonstrated by the KPIs (all PDO indicators were achieved, 9 intermediate outcome indicators (IO) were achieved, and three IO were partially achieved).

                         all activities supported by the Regional AIDS Fund (RAF) have been successful, the vast majority of them have achieved their objectives. Probably the biggest achievement of the
                         project was in building constituencies across the region to promote dialog and evidence based interventions and overcome political and technical barriers.
