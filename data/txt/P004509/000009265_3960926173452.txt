MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR AN IRRIGATION OPERATIONS SUPPORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recom'endation on a proposed loan to
*        the Republic of the Philippines for US$45 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5
years' grace, at the standard variable interest rate, and would assist the
*        Government of the Philippines in its efforts to improve tha operations and
maintenance (O&M) of its national irrigation systems.
2.        Background.  The total irrigated area in the Philippines has
doubled over the last 20 years to approximately 1.5 million ha. This
expansion, and the related dramatic increase in paddy production have
enabled the country to achieve marginal self-sufficiency in rice and to
sustain a satisfactory rate of agricultural growth (averaging 4% p.a. since
1970). Some 47% of the total area under irrigation is served by small-
scale communal systems, owned and operated by irrigators' associations
(IAs), and another 13% are served by private pump units. The remaining 40%
(0.6 million ha) is served by 127 large-scale national irrigation systems
(NISs), built, operated and maintuined by the. semi-autonomous public
National Irrigation Administration (NIA). By 1993, after completing
several ongoing projects, NIA will be operating 147 such NISs, totalling
nearly 750,000 ha.
3.        As with any other infrastructure, proper O&M of irrigation works
is needed to prevent system deterioration, which in turn leads to decreases
in cropping area, yields and output. Although irrigation service fee (ISF)
rates and collection efficiency are better, and the development of IAs is
more advanced in the Philippines than in many comparator countries, the
volume and quality of O&M are still inadequate to sustain system irrigation
operating performance.   Therefore, although the Government may initiate a
few new construction or modernization projects over the next decade, it
has shifted its priorities for tie irrigation subsector from system
expansion to improving O&M of the installed NIS network, to avoid more
costly expenditures on rehabilitation which would otherwise become
inevitable over the next 10-15 years.
4.       The main constraints to more effective O&M are posed by NIA's
financial situation and the fact that, because of its past emphasis on new
construction, NIA has yet to develop adequate procedures and technical
capacity in O&M. NIA charges ISF, denominated in paddy equivalents and
payable either in cash or in kind, which recover most of its current O&M
costs (averaging US$16.50/ha p.a. in recent years). Nonetheless, these
represent only about 60% of the expenditures which NIA should be making to
prevent NIS deterioration. While ISF rates per se are not low, current ISF
receipts would not support these higher expenditure levels, although



NIA could cover most of the funding gap by making a concerted effort to
improve its ISF collection efficiency (estimated at 59% in 1987) and expand
its ongoing and fairly successful IA development program. To ensure the
effectiveness of higher O&M expenditures, NIA would also need to strengthen
further its internal planning, operating procedures and the structure of
staff incentives, as well as to upgrade staff skills in proper water
management and irrigation system O&M techniques and IA development.
5.       Due to the Bank's long involvement in the Philippines irrigation
subsector, several years ago NIA requested assistance in evaluating the
operating performance of the NISs and developing an action plan for
improvement. A consultant study financed under the Medium-Scale Irrigation
Project (Loan 1809-PH), completed in 1985, identified specific areas for
upgrading and institutional strengthening. Drawing on these
recommendations, NIA has prepared a nine-year Irrigation O&M Improvement
Program, and has requested Bank funding for a three-year Phase I, under the
proposed Irrigation Operations Support Project (IOSP).
6.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The IOSP would be the first
Bank-financed project in the Philippines designed primarily to address
irrigation system O&M. It would complement the Bank's past support (17
loans and credits totalling US$738 million) for irrigation subsector
development. In the aggregate, by 1990, the ongoing and completed Bank-
financed projects will be irrigating about 490,000 ha (or nearly one-third
of the total irrigated area in the country). They will benefit some
290,000 families, and will help to produce more than 2 million tons of
paddy, or about 22% of total projected rice production alnd 30% of irrigated
production. The proposed project would help the Government to ensure
maximum returns from these earlier investments and, therefore, is an
important component of the Bank's future country assistance strategy for
the Philippines.
7.        Proiect Objectives.   The IOSP would support institutional
development and training which is critical to improving the long-term O&M
capability of NIA and the lAs/beneficiaries. It would also provide
financing for minor rehabilitation work to restore existing NISs to
original or modified design levels, and would increase the volume and
quality of O& work, so as to reduce the current trend of system
deterioration. Post-project activities during subsequent Phases II and III
of NIA's nine-year Irrigation O&N Improvement Program would include some
major rehabilitation (on 18 NISs) and system modernization, as well as
continued work to improve 06M levels and further develop the IA network
nationwide. The main targets for the overall Program are the reduction of
NIS performance deterioration; improvement of water delivery and water use
efficiency to permit higher rates of cropping intensity; and achievement of
full recovery of higher O&M expenditures through ISF payments by
beneficiaries. The three-year IOSP is expected to achieve about 75% of the
final Program targets.
8.        project DescriRtion.  The project would cover all NISs, excluding
a few selected areas where major rehabilitation would be needed before
improved O&M would have the desired impact. The project would support the
following:



- 3 -
(a)  Institutional Strengthening of NIA to Provide Improved O&M
Services. Increased O&M performance and efficiency would be
obtained through: (i) improvements in the ISF collection
process; (ii) full implementation of NIA's Irrigation
Management Information System (IMIS); (iii) staff training
in O&M and farmer organization development;  (iv) execution
of system rehabilitation studies and preparation of manuals
and (v) reconditioning of some existing, and procurement of
some additional, O&M equipment;
(b) Acceleration of NIA's Irrigators' Association JeveloRment
Program. Some 390 new lAs, comprising about 96,000 farmers
in an area of 114,000 irrigated ha, would be fully organized
and trained to enable them to assume responsibilities for O&M
of the laterals and sublaterals in their NIS service areas.
(c) Execution of Minor Rehabilitation. Essential small rehabili-
tation works would be carried out to restore and sustain the
operational capability of the 127 NISs and enable them to
respond effectively to increased levels of O&M.
(d)  Execution of an Exganded 0gerations and Maintenance Program.
The volume of O&M work would be stepped up nationwide,
including: (i) system operations, such as timely operation
of gates and spillway controls, proper operation of canal
control structures, adequate supervision of system
performance, timely remedial measures, and regular
recording of canal and river discharges; and (ii) system
maintenance, such as canal desilting and weed control, minor
repairs to canals and structures, drainage clearing, and
repair and maintenance of service roads, buildings, equip-ent
and vehicles.
9.       The total project cost, including physical contingencies and
expected price increases, is estimated at about US$60.2 million, with a
foreign exchange comporant of US$17.1 million.   The proposed Bank loan of
US$45.0 million would finance about 75% of total costs, including 100% of
the foreign exchange requirement and about 65% of local costs. The
remaining project cost of US$15.2 million would be funded by NIA and the
Government.  NIA's current annual income of about US$6.1 million from ISF
and US$2.6 million from equipment rental and management fees would be
supplemented by the additional US$2.5 million in average annual ISF
revenues to be achieved under the project through improved collection
efficiency. NIA has been channelling all ISF revenue and most of its
income derived from investment activity into O&M. To encourage this
practice, NIA's US$10.3 million counterpart contribution would all be used
to finance part of the O&M component of the project. Bank loan funds would
cover the full cost of all other components and 48% of incremental O&M
costs. To ensure that NIA continues to allocate increasing amounts to O&M,
Bank reimbursement against the O&M component expenditures would be on a
declining basis, at 85%, 55%, and 30% of the incremental O&M expenditures
in the first, second, and third years of the project, respectively.
Retroactive financing of up to US$1.5 million for expenditures after
October 15, 1987 may be required for some start-up activities, particularly
equipment purchases, engineering services and parcellary mapping.



-4-
10.       A summary of the project costs and financing plan is given in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7102, dated April 27, 1988, is being distributed
separately.
11.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, confirmation was obtained
from the Government and NIA on the following: (a) that NIA would revise
its iucentive grants to provide separate bonus payments for quality of O&M
work and for ISF collections; (b) that NIA would modify its agreements with
each IA, to implement separate contracts for ISF collections and for O&M;
(c) that NIA would limit investments for system restoration under the
project to a P3,000/ha average in each Region and to repairs essential to
supply of required irrigation deliveries; (d) that for each calendar year,
NIA would submit a detailed work program and funding proposals for Bank
review by June 30 of the preceding year; and (e) that NIA would receive
Government budgetary support, if needed, to ensure O&1 funding at the
levels agreed to under the project.
12.       Benefits.   The main benefit of the proposed project would result
from improved O&M of the 127 NISs, which would expand agricultural
production, increase and stabilize farm incomes, and generate employment,
while making a substantial contribution to the country's food self-
sufficiency objective. Since the project is national in scope, its
benefits would have a positive impact nationwide.  In addition, terough the
projected increased irrigated land-use intensity and the constant need for
O&M of thie systems, the farm and local laborer employment impact would be
year-round, helping to prevent outward migration from the rural areas. The
project would directly benefit about 430,000 farm families, or 2.6 million
persons, in the NIS service areas. Most are sm4llholders; 88% cultivate
farms of less than 3.0 ha size, and 40% cultivate farms of 1 ha or less.
The estimated economic rate of return o the project is 34%. Sensitivity
tests indicate that attractive economic returns would accrue even with
substantial adverse changes in project costs and benefits.
13.        Risks.  The main project risks are the possibility of adverse
farmer reactions to measures to improve ISF collection efficiency and
thereby raise the effective cost recovery levels, and the fact that in some
areas targets may be difficult to reach because of prevailing peace and
order problems. However, these potential problems are not considered
significant and should be eased by improved irrigation services and
increased farmer participation through lAs, both supported by the project.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
