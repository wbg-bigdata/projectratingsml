1. Program Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

       Macroeconomic and sector background

At the time of project identification and appraisal for the first Agriculture Development Policy
Operation (AgDPO 1), Ghana’s economy continued to grow steadily. Economic growth reached
6.3 percent in 2007, slightly below the 6.4 percent growth in real gross domestic product (GDP)
recorded in 2006.1 The Country Economic Memorandum (2007) noted that national rural poverty
had decreased from 64 percent in 1991/92 to 50 percent in 1998/99 and 39 percent in 2005/06.
Over the same period, the depth of poverty among rural households (as measured by the poverty
gap) had diminished as well, from 0.24 to 0.18 to 0.14.

These remarkable achievements resulted in part from strong growth in the agricultural sector.
Cocoa earnings in 2008 amounted to about US$ 1.2 billion, exceeding earnings from gold.
Farmers received 55–60 percent of international prices, increasing the impact on the local rural
economy. The sustained growth rates experienced in the agricultural sector averaged around 5
percent per year between 2001 and 2006 (compared to 2.1 percent in 2000), exceeding
population growth, which was estimated at 2.7 percent per year. Over 2000–05, the crop and
livestock subsectors grew by 30 percent in real terms—equivalent to an average increase of 5.4
percent per year.

The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy II (GPRS II) (2006–09) was an agriculture-led strategy to
diversify the economy away from its dependence on cocoa and toward cereals and other cash
crops for export markets. Development partners regarded GPRS II as an acceptable basis for
aligning support over the short to medium term. The GPRS II recognized that a large share of
growth in agricultural productivity would come from activity in the private sector, supported by
adequate public investments, institutions, and policies.

The financing framework for the GPRS II identified a significant funding gap, however.
Whereas the Bank-funded Poverty Reduction Support Credit 5 (PRSC 5) and the Multi Donor
Budget Support (MDBS) mechanism contributed additional budgetary resources, they were
insufficient to close the financing gap for implementing GPRS II.

Experiences with PRSCs suggested that budgetary support could be an appropriate instrument
for development assistance. However, the PRSC—and the MDBS, to which it contributes—were
not considered sufficiently appropriate instruments to deepen the policy dialogue at the sector
level, because they necessarily focus on cross-cutting targets. At the same time, the government
had not fully addressed budgetary needs at the sector level. It relied predominantly on

 These data are based on the old GDP series, which was revised substantially in 2011 and showed substantial
changes in the data, including growth rates for the various sectors.

                                                        1
investments through rural development and agriculture projects, which fostered fast agricultural
growth and export diversification. Yet the use of budgetary rather than project resources is
critical for Ghana to plan and implement a coordinated, internally consistent development policy
that also addresses the agricultural sector’s needs at the local government level. In response to
the financing gap for GPRS II and the need for sector-level budgetary resources, a first AgDPO
series was prepared, with a specific focus on increasing and improving agricultural outcomes.

In 2008, just as AgDPO 1 was being prepared, the global food price crisis was unfolding. Nonoil
imports increased as a result of higher consumer demand and rising food prices. To preserve
planned expenditures to enhance agricultural production and productivity, the government
requested additional financing. The originally envisaged envelope for AgDPO 1 of US$ 15
million was increased to US$ 25 million.

       AgDPO design

The AgDPO was designed as a three year program to support the new 2007 Food and
Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II). The first operation was a single-tranche
credit for SDR 15.8 million (US$ 25 million equivalent) and the first of a programmatic series of
three credits, each with an envisaged envelope of US$ 25 million equivalent. The AgDPO’s
policy objectives are also aligned with the updated Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
objectives for FY08–12. 2

The revision of FASDEP presented an opportunity for development partners to align their
support for the agricultural sector to the new policy. The Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) was first among the development partners to provide sector budget support
under its Support to FASDEP (SFASDEP). 3 Sector-oriented budget support from the World
Bank and CIDA affirmed the principles of harmonization and provided a framework for policy
dialogue and decisions linked to the overall implementation of FASDEP II and GPRS II.
Bilateral and multilateral donor assistance also continued to play an important role in the
implementation of GPRS II and FASDEP II.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

The development objectives of the programmatic series were to increase agriculture’s
contribution to growth and poverty reduction while improving the management of soil and water
resources. The AgDPO focused on accelerating agricultural growth to meet GPRS II goals and
poverty alleviation through pro-poor growth in agriculture. To achieve this result, the sector
would have to go beyond its reliance on cocoa exports and expansion in cultivated area as
sources of growth; it would need to create enabling conditions to increase growth in total factor
productivity and diversify production systems.

The key indicators approved were:

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

Neither the PDO nor Key Indicators were revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Under the Sector Objectives, consistent with FASDEP II, the following policy objectives were
supported by the AgDPO:

      Sector Objective 1: Food security and emergency preparedness
          a. Improved food security through reduction of postharvest losses.
          b. Improved food security through increase in per capita production of key staple
              crops.

      Sector Objective 2: Improved growth in incomes and reduced income variability
          a. Improved irrigation performance through the implementation of a new irrigation
              policy and an increase in the management of irrigation facilities by water users.
          b. Increased development of FBOs and their integration in markets and value chains
              through the introduction of supporting legislation and capacity building.
          c. Improved access to agricultural credit through improved planning.
          d. Improved management of fisheries through the introduction of supporting
              legislation and enhanced implementation capacity.

      Sector Objective 3: Increased competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic
       and international markets
          a. Improved export diversification through strengthening value chains for key
              exports while including smallholder farmers.

      Sector Objective 4: Sustainable management of land and environment
          a. Environmental compliance (natural resource management) through adoption and
              mainstreaming of sustainable land management practices.



                                              3
       Sector Objective 5: Science and technology applied in food and agriculture
        development
           a. Improved agricultural productivity through farmer participation in research
               priority setting, leading to higher adoption rates.

       Sector Objective 6: Enhanced institutional coordination
           a. Improved quality of budgetary processes and sector efficiency in public financial
               management through implementing recommendations from public expenditure
               review and improving budget execution rates.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

During the period under review, the government adopted the Comprehensive African
Agricultural Development Program (CAADP), which provided a continent-wide planning
framework for development of, and investment in, the agricultural sector. The CAADP
framework for Ghana was consistent with FASDEP II and therefore with AgDPO 1 and 2. The
subsequent development of the Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP)
in October 2009 led to a decision at the Regional Operations Committee meeting for the AgDPO
2 to discontinue the on-going AgDPO series and initiate the preparation of a new AgDPO series
to reflect the newly defined policy priorities and resource requirements and support
implementation of METASIP. The discontinuation of the first AgDPO series and start of a new
series reflected the Bank’s flexibility and responsiveness to the client’s needs, and it
demonstrated the value of flexible support to a dynamic sector such as agriculture.

Government participation in and stakeholder endorsement of the Agricultural Finance Strategy
and Action Plan (AFSAP) was a prior action for AgDPO 2.4 The government had recognized that
the supply of and demand for credit essentially constituted a private sector activity and had taken
steps to understand all stakeholders’ perspectives on the constraints to increasing access to and
utilization of agricultural credit. A major change in the institutional approach was that MoFA
and MoFEP participated intensively in developing the AFSAP as a multistakeholder strategy for
increasing agricultural credit. Active participation by the government, particularly by the two
most interested ministries, was considered the most critical measure to influence long-term
policy regarding agricultural credit.

 Note that this prior action superseded the original, which was a baseline assessment by the government of access to
agricultural credit. The change occurred because political momentum behind AFSAP emerged among stakeholders
only after the process started and after AgDPO 1 had been approved.

The Board approved the first of the two programmatic DPOs on June 30, 2008, a Credit of SDR
15.8 million (US$ 25 million equivalent) to support FASDEP II. Following Board approval, the
Financing Agreement for AgDPO 1 was signed on July 11, 2008 by the Borrower and the
International Development Association (IDA). The Credit was declared effective on August 5,
2008. As noted, in response to the 2008 food price crisis, the government requested an increase
from US$ 15 million to US$ 25 million. This request was received only during Negotiations
(which explains the delay of the signed Minutes of Negotiations). Whereas the CAS had
envisaged three operations of US$ 15 million each, it was decided at the same time to sustain the
increase across all future operations.

The second of the series, AgDPO 2, was approved by the Board on June 3, 2010, a Credit of
SDR 16.5 million (US$ 25 million equivalent). Following Board approval, the Financing
Agreement for AgDPO 2 was signed on September 8, 2010 by the Borrower and IDA. The
Credit was declared effective on December 7, 2010.

The first DPO in the amount of US$ 25 million equivalent was disbursed in August 2008, based
on the Recipient’s completion of the following prior actions:

      Sector Objective 1: Food security and emergency preparedness
          a. MoFA completed a survey of postharvest losses focused on value chains in
              accordance with the FASDEP food security objective.

      Sector Objective 2: Increased growth in income
          a. The irrigation policy was submitted to the Cabinet.
          b. A legal framework was developed to support the development of FBOs: (i) A
              draft cooperatives bill was prepared and (ii) a Memorandum of Understanding
              was concluded between the Recipient’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture and
              Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development. The memorandum provided
              for the implementation of the Recipient’s District Corporation Regulation, for the
              purpose of enabling the establishment and operation of FBOs as district
              corporations.
          c. Fisheries Regulation LI 1832 was submitted to Parliament to strengthen
              governance in the sector.

      Sector Objective 3: Increased competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic
       and international markets
          a. Export diversification was supported through improvements in value chains:
                  i. A request was issued for expressions of interest to transfer management of
                     Shed 9 Multipurpose Fruit Terminal at Tema to the private sector with the
                     aim of improving efficient management of the cold chain facility and
                     encouraging private sector participation.
                 ii. Smallholders were included in export value chains through improved
                     organization and access to improved technologies. Many farmer groups
                     (106) were established to operate nurseries for smallholder pineapple
                     production.


                                               5
      Sector Objective 4: Sustainable management of land and environment
              No prior action was scheduled for Sector Objective 4 until AgDPO 2.

      Sector objective 5: Science and technology applied in food and agriculture
       development
          a. Participation of farmer representatives in setting priorities for adaptive research
              through Research Extension Liaison Committees (RELCs) was increased.

      Sector objective 6: Improved institutional coordination
          a. A Strategic Plan for 2008–10, based on the Medium Term Expenditure
              Framework, was submitted for approval.

The second DPO, in the amount of US$ 25 million equivalent, was disbursed in December 2010,
based on the Recipient’s completion of the following prior actions:

      Sector Objective 1: Food security and emergency preparedness
          a. Recommendations on reducing postharvest losses were incorporated in MoFA’s
              Sector Plan (2010–15), thereby ensuring these actions will be funded.

      Sector Objective 2: Increased growth in income
          a. Irrigation policy implementation, through:
                 i. A survey of irrigation facilities, formal and informal, completed to
                      establish a baseline.
                ii. An action plan for increasing management of irrigation facilities by water
                      user associations (WUAs), adopted by MoFA.
          b. The Cooperative Bill was submitted to the Cabinet (not to Parliament, as
              originally envisioned).
          c. An action plan for improving access to agricultural credit was prepared by
              stakeholders, including MoFEP and MoFA.
          d. A Draft Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy was prepared and discussed with
              stakeholders.

      Sector Objective 3: Increased competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic
       and international markets
          a. Commitment to increasing private sector participation in agriculture continued
              through:
                   i. Management for Shed 9 was competitively recruited and the facility
                      became operational on a commercial basis.
                  ii. Contractual arrangements between smallholders and the private sector
                      were facilitated by removing market information barriers through the
                      introduction of a web-based database on outgrowers.

      Sector Objective 4: Sustainable management of land and environment
          a. MoFA discussed and adopted the Sustainable Agricultural Land Management
              Strategy.


                                               6
           b. A strategic environmental assessment to identify actions needed for the
              implementation of the revised FASDEP was completed.

       Sector objective 5: Science and technology applied in food and agriculture
        development
           a. A baseline study on the rate that technologies were adopted by farmers
               participating in demonstrations was done to identify key variables to motivate
               behavioral change. The study did not meet MoFA quality standards, however.

       Sector objective 6: Improved institutional coordination
           a. A Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) was completed to inform
               institutional performance and reforms, including the identification of areas for
               improvement in the short and medium term.
           b. The Government of Ghana released at least 80 percent of the committed 2008
               MoFA national budget to Items 3 and 4 and released at least 60 percent of 2009
               allocations by the third quarter of 2009.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

   Background analysis

During design and implementation, both operations drew on social and economic analysis,
specific analytical work, as well as work on public financial management (see references in
Annex 6). Poverty aspects drew on preliminary, and later final, results of the 2006 Ghana Living
Standards Survey (GLSS-5), identifying recent trends in poverty and human development,
confirming the need for sustaining increases in agricultural productivity for maintaining the long
term trends in growth, urbanization and poverty reduction. Program design also drew on
background papers of the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) entitled Ghana: Meeting the
Challenge of Accelerated and Shared Growth, which focused on necessary actions to reach the
Government‘s stated goal of attaining middle-income status by 2015. The recently 2008 WDR
on Agriculture noted that to grow and reduce poverty, Sub-Saharan African countries will need a
well performing agriculture sector. These findings guided the program to be supported by series.
The operations also responded to the IEG report on agriculture assistance which recommended
that the Bank focus attention on achieving improvements in agricultural productivity by a)
establishing realistic goals for expansion of irrigation; b) recognizing the need to increase
productivity of rain-fed agriculture through improvements in land quality, as well as water and
drought management; c) helping to design efficient mechanisms, including public-private
partnerships, to provide farmers with critical inputs, including fertilizers, water, credit, and
seeds; and d) supporting the development of marketing and transport infrastructure. The PRSC
and the FY06 and the FY07 External Reviews of Public Financial Management (ERPFM) also
confirmed that public expenditure is a critical element of implementing the new policy and
ensuring the efficient use of scare public resources.

The FASDEP review process, the AgSSIP ICR analysis and related beneficiary assessments, and
FBO fund impact assessment also informed the formulation of the first AgDPO series. Studies
by IFPRI, based on their computable general equilibrium model, identified the significant

                                                7
potential for agricultural growth by closing existing yield gaps as well as additional opportunities
for value addition. These studies also confirm the wider literature on the substantial poverty
reducing impact of such growth. The USAID-funded AgCLIR diagnostic (Agriculture
Commercial, Legal and Institutional Reform), identified measures to increase private investment
in agriculture including measures to strengthen links with out-growers. This reinforced previous
analytical work that identified the important contribution to be played by FBOs. Analytical work
by the Bank has highlighted the threats to Ghana’s marine fisheries and the urgent need for
improved management of the fishing fleet. Several assessments of the initial implementation of
the fertilizer voucher program identified a number of areas for improvement, while also
reflecting the differing positions among stakeholders.

   Positive factors

The introduction of the first AgDPO series responded to the financing needs of the government
and MoFA and was designed to complement investments by other development partners. The
Agriculture Sector Working Group (ASWG), comprising government and development partners,
provided the platform for necessary dialogue and coordination. This group was also instrumental
in adopting the CAADP planning process and eventually launching the CAADP Compact,
including the sector investment plan. During the period under review, the ASWG also held an
annual Joint Sector Review; its recommendations provided input into the policy discussion
related to AgDPO and the more general sector policy dialogue. The task team leader engaged
actively in the ASWG as co-chair with the government representative; this collaboration was
critical for establishing an effective policy dialogue between the Bank and Government of Ghana.

From the point of view of MoFA and MoFEP, the DPO series has provided flexibility and
discretion over the allocation and use of resources for the agricultural sector’s priorities. As an
instrument, the first DPO series was viewed positively by the Government of Ghana. Its
complementarity to traditional investment lending was appreciated, especially because it
facilitated sector dialogue that allowed MoFA to remain focused and maintain the momentum in
rolling out agreed policy and institutional reforms under FADSDEP II.

The general consensus among MoFA staff is that the policy areas were relevant because they
were consistent with the six FASDEP II policy objectives. The specific prior actions and triggers
represented policy and program priorities within these policy areas and provided needed focus.

It is MoFA’s contention that budget support from CIDA and the AgDPO series did not displace
government resources. Rather, it enabled MoFA to fund the implementation of government
programs, such as the fertilizer subsidy program designed originally in response to the food and
fertilizer crisis. MoFA expenditures on various programs increased significantly during 2004–10,
rising from 30 percent to nearly 70 percent of the ministry’s budget.

MoFA staff specified that the ministry had enhanced its capacity for planning and executing its
programs. CAADP-oriented support mechanisms, including the AgDPO series, enabled and
empowered MoFA to lead the design of FASDEP II as well as its implementation instrument,
METASIP, which now provides the framework for investment in food security and agricultural
development.

                                                 8
9
   Negative factors

Despite the added resources and enhanced implementation capacity arising from the AgDPO
series, district-level MoFA staff pointed out that extension staff remained under-resourced to
perform their core duties. This observation suggests that budget support has not filled the
resource gap at that important government-farmer interface. Administrative constraints in the
form of limited have been identified by CIDA as part of the problem.

With respect to planning and completing prior actions, MoFA staff identified a need to
mainstream prior actions into MoFA’s current planning activities. This mainstreaming has not
occurred, and although the policy focus was appropriate, DPO-related planning has added a task
instead of blending it into ongoing planning processes.

The disbursement of AgDPO 2 was delayed considerably. The Board package was planned to be
submitted for approval around July 2009. During that time the macroeconomic framework was
considered inadequate, however, delaying Board approval to June 3, 2010. Moreover, the
financing agreement was not signed until September 8, 2010, and effectiveness not declared until
December 7, 2010, suggesting that additional delays occurred in internal Government of Ghana
processing, partly caused by a long summer recess of Parliament, which cannot be attributed
entirely to the inadequate macroeconomic framework.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Responsibility for implementing policy reforms under AgDPO 1 and 2 resided with MoFA, with
additional financial and contractual responsibilities performed by MoFEP. Bank supervision was
aligned with MoFA’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and the activities of other
donors, focusing on annual reporting and the Joint Sector Review process by all stakeholders.

The design of the AgDPO results framework has been organized around FASDEP II Sector
Objectives and the MoFA M&E framework. Out of the 10 PDOs, performance of six objectives
was tracked using existing data from the MoFA M&E system. Data for four objectives
(improved irrigation scheme performance, improved food security through post harvest losses;
environmental compliance through adoption of soil and water conservation technology adoption;
and improved agricultural productivity through production technology adoption) were either
partially or not at all covered and required modifications to the existing M&E system. The
implementation of these modifications involved a number of baseline studies and subsequent
data collection systems were planned as part of the design and technical support process.
However, execution of the studies was delayed and, in the case of the technology adoption
studies, the methodology did not allow quantitative measurement. As a result, achievement of the
four objectives could not be measured as per the originally proposed indicator. Implementation
of all other indicators as part of the MoFA M&E system was sound.

During implementation, ongoing analytical work under the Joint Sector Review process, policy
studies by IFPRI, and other analytical work was utilized to augment MoFA sector performance
data. Reports on macroeconomic developments assessed progress in implementing the
macroeconomic framework agreed among the Government of Ghana, International Monetary

                                              10
Fund (IMF), World Bank, and MDBS. Those reports formed the basis for assessing the adequacy
of the macroeconomic framework for the two operations.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

As indicated, the signing of the CAADP Compact and the development of METASIP in October
2009 were followed by the decision to discontinue the first AgDPO series after the second year
and replace it with a new series. On May 26, 2011, the Board approved AgDPO 3, the first
(US$ 57 million equivalent) in a new programmatic series of three operations.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating: Relevant. The objectives of AgDPO 1 and 2 are directly relevant to Ghana’s current
agricultural development policy, FASDEP II. The policy emphasizes the need for achieving
improved food security and income growth through agricultural commercialization, sustainable
management of land and environment, enhanced science and technology development and
adoption, and improved institutional management and coordination. The PDOs directly reflect
FASDEP’s policy objectives (see section 1.4). Moreover, the objectives reflect the program areas
of METASIP that was developed during the AgDPO series. Hence, the objectives and the design
are highly relevant. In addition, the PDOs are aligned with the CAS.

As the global food price crisis was unfolding during preparation of AgDPO 1 in 2008, the
changing circumstances amplified the importance of the food security and emergency
preparedness objective. The originally envisaged envelope of US$ 15 million was increased to
US$ 25 million at the government’s request. The increase enabled MoFA to finance programs
aimed at rapidly increasing food crop production and agricultural productivity, most notably the
fertilizer subsidy program that has become partly responsible for achieving increased adoption of
fertilizer technology and has resulted in increase food production and productivity.

During preparation of AgDPO 2, the need to align AgDPO 3 more closely with METASIP—the
recently adopted sector investment plan—became clear. The Bank and government agreed that to
better accommodate the government's specific implementation priorities moving forward, the
first series would be discontinued with AgDPO 2, and a new series would be prepared. As
reflected in the CAS Progress Report, this strategic response was expected to have the following
benefits: (i) it would align Bank support more closely with the government's new agenda; (ii) it
would provide a more compelling case to scale up assistance beyond the levels originally
envisaged in the CAS, in recognition of the financing gap identified in the newly articulated
investment program under the CAADP framework; and (iii) it would facilitate better alignment
of more specific policy measures to be supported within the government's policy and institutional
reform agenda.

Hence, at different times during the series, the Bank’s implementation assistance was able to
identify the government’s changing need, and make adjustments accordingly to ensure that the
operations remained important to achieving Ghana’s and the Bank’s development objectives.

                                               11
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately satisfactory. Overall, the AgDPO was successful in achieving its objectives.
Efforts supported by the operation concentrated on enhancing agricultural technology adoption
and productivity, improving market access, improving water and soil management, improving
performance of the fisheries sector, and enhancing public financial management of the
agriculture sector. Two out of nine objectives’ achievements are rated unsatisfactory. Seven
objectives are rated satisfactory, of which two are rated highly satisfactory. In assessing
outcomes, it must be recognized that the programmatic series of three operations was not
completed and that only AgDPO 1 and 2 were implemented. In line with the policy areas
supported by AgDPO 1 and 2 as presented in section 1.4, achieved outcomes are summarized as
follows:

Sector Objective 1: Food security and emergency preparedness
    a. Improved food security through reduction of postharvest losses
While a baseline study was completed in 2008, a regular assessment of postharvest losses by
MoFA field staff could not be implemented. During the pilot phase methodological challenges of
measuring actual losses were identified that called for a different monitoring approach.
Meanwhile, an action plan for reducing postharvest losses in specific crops is being designed for
implementation in 2012. A survey will be carried out in 2013 to commence tracking the impact
of specific interventions.

    b. Improved food security through increase in per capita production of key staple
        crops
The ambitious target of a 30 percent per capita increase in production of key staple crops from
2007 to 2010 was achieved. Increases by crop were: maize, 53.55 kilograms per capita (a 42
percent increase); milled rice, 8.14 kg/cap (47 percent); cassava, 448.65 kg/cap (22 percent);
sorghum, 6.8 kg/cap (93 percent); yams: 192.14 kg/cap (26 percent); and groundnuts: 13.25
kg/cap (62 percent). Cassava and yam production increased less than 30 percent but more than
20 percent from already high levels. These commodities have appeared in the food balance sheet
as surplus commodities during recent years.

At the aggregate level, staple food production (in metric tons) increased as follows: maize,
1,871,700 (53.48 percent); milled rice, 294,960 (59.14 percent); cassava, 13,504,100 (32.16
percent); sorghum, 324,400 (109.51 percent); yams, 5,960,500 (36.21 percent); and groundnuts,
530,900 (75.93 percent).

Agricultural production increases were higher in the three northern regions than in the rest of the
country. The share of maize production in Northern, Upper West, and Upper East Regions
increased from 11 percent to 19 percent of national production, and the share of rice production
increased from 49 percent to 67 percent of national production between 2007 and 2010.

Despite the lack of measurable achievement in reducing postharvest losses, per capita increases
in production have been substantial, particularly in the North where food insecurity and poverty
is concentrated. Achievement of the first objective is satisfactory.


                                                12
Sector Objective 2: Improved growth in incomes and reduced income variability
   a. Improved irrigation performance
Using the 2008 baseline study that mapped 3,388 informal irrigation sites in the country, the
combined land intensification ratio has declined by 22% between 2008 and 2010, due to a lack of
measurable progress in the management of informal schemes. However, the strategy of the
Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA) was to focus on improving the management of
formal schemes for which they had direct managerial responsibility and control, and here the
performance had improved by 23%, from 0.71 in 2007 to 0.86 in 2010. Further roll-out of the
Joint Irrigation Scheme Management (JISM) which is expected to see improvements in the
operation of the informal sector was expected to follow later on in the series. With the thousands
of informal sites, annual data collection on area cultivated has been incomplete since the baseline,
which partly explains the low ratios.

A new irrigation policy and an action plan for increasing management of irrigation facilities by
Water User Associations (WUAs) were finalized during the period under review, enabling
subsequent management reforms. As a result, a total of 235 WUAs were formed during 2010
with a membership of 14,052, bringing the total number of WUAs to 709 with a total
membership of 23,329. While the overall irrigation performance, as measured by the land
intensification ratio, has not improved to meet its three year targets, progress during the first two
years has been made.

    b. Development of FBOs and their integration in markets and value chains
Government has made progress in strengthening the role and functioning of farmer-based
organizations (FBOs), both through capacity building and actively facilitating FBOs to be
included in commercial out-grower and contract-farming enterprises. A 10 percent annual
increase in FBO capacity for production, postharvest management, and marketing has been
achieved. The number of functioning FBOs increased by 47 percent, the number of FBOs
accessing financial services increased by 125 percent, and the number of FBOs accessing
marketing information increased by 168 percent. Since 2008, under the Agricultural Services
program (supported by CIDA), a total of 1,480 farmers from 296 FBOs have been trained on
enterprise development as part of capacity building of FBOs in Ghana. Women farmers formed
40% of beneficiaries of the capacity building effort. As a result of the registration exercise of
FBOs in the country, over 5,000 farmer-based organizations were validated for inclusion in the
national database. The FBO policy framework that will serve as a guide for the development and
operation of FBOs at all levels along the agricultural value chain in Ghana has been developed in
close consultation with stakeholders

   c. Improved access to agricultural credit
Significant progress has been made towards increasing agricultural lending during the first two
operations of the AgDPO, despite the effects of the global financial crisis. The share of the
banking sector’s lending portfolio for private sector agriculture was 7.26% in 2010, compared to




                                                 13
   6.47% in 2007 (see Table 1).5 This proportionate increase should be evaluated in the context of
   recent economic growth and increased private sector activity. Total private sector lending
   (lending by Deposit Money Banks [DMBs] and Rural Community Banks, [RCBs] combined)
   increased by 104% between 2007 and 2010, while private sector lending to agriculture increased
   by 129%, suggesting an increasing interest by commercial banks’ in the agricultural sector as a
   lending market. This trend is expected to continue as agricultural lending instruments are being
   introduced during the successor AgDPO series. Agriculture lending among rural community
   banks has expanded by 27% during the period under review, a relatively modest increase
   compared to Deposit Money Banks whose agricultural lending portfolio increased by 135%.

   Although the overall target of 8% was not achieved during the first two operations, the increase
   in agricultural lending by 129% in absolute terms during the first two operations is significant, as

     For this analysis the most recent data from the Bank of Ghana on lending by Deposit Money Banks has been used,
   and agriculture credit now includes lending to the cocoa marketing board (COCOBOD) for cocoa marketing and
   onward lending to private cocoa buying companies. As recommended in the AgDPO2 project document,
   information on lending by Rural Community Banks, not captured in the Bank of Ghana statistics, has now been
   included. As a result, the original 2007 baseline value has been updated from 4.46% to 6.47%.


                                                          14
well as increased lending through rural community banks, especially in the light of the global
economic crisis during which private sector lending contracted at the global level.

    d. Improved management of fisheries
New fisheries regulations were passed and internally generated funds from the fisheries sector
rose by more than 10 percent per year. Revenues from the Fisheries Directorate increased by 80
percent, while revenues from the Fisheries Levy increased by over 350 percent. These
developments represent important steps towards building institutional capacity for improved
governance of the fisheries sector.

Management of irrigation schemes has improved for formal schemes, but not informal schemes.
The agriculture lending target was not quite achieved, but a disproportionately high increase in
agriculture lending in absolute terms has occurred. The target increase in FBO capacity for
production, postharvest management, and marketing has been achieved, and revenues from the
fisheries sector have exceeded their targets. Taking into account that the series was not
completed, and that progress was made in all four sub-objectives, achievement of the second
objective is moderately satisfactory.

Sector Objective 3: Increased competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic and
international markets
    a. Improved export diversification through strengthening value chains for key exports
Shed 9, the multipurpose fruit terminal in Tema Harbor, is fully operational. The government
followed through on private sector management of the fruit terminal, which is a critical
component in the value chain.

An increase in nontraditional agricultural exports of 28% has been achieved during the first two
operations (expressed in Ghana Cedis). While the Ghana Cedi depreciated, the export value
expressed in US Dollars declined by 16%.6 However, despite the economic downturn in Ghana’s
export markets, total export volumes declined only slightly by 5%. This overall result indicates
that Ghana has been able to retain its competitiveness during difficult times.

Achievement of the third objective is moderately satisfactory.

Sector Objective 4: Sustainable management of land and environment
    a. Environmental compliance (natural resource management)
The baseline study found that adoption of soil and water conservation practices was low,
measured on a scale of 1–5 (very low–very high). During the first two years of the AgDPO
series, the government focused on the preparation and dissemination of a manual on sustainable
land management. The manual was disseminated among all regional and district extension
service providers and trainers. Various sustainable land management practices are currently

 Using the latest available date from the Ghana Export Promotion Council, the 2007 baseline value of
nontraditional agricultural exports has changed from Ȼ 180.2 m (US$ 169.2 m) to Ȼ 185.2 m (US$ 197.2 m).


                                                      15
disseminated and promoted, including water harvesting, promotion of crop rotation with
nitrogen-fixing crops, and the promotion of fertilizer and its correct use. In addition, based on the
Agriculture Sustainable Land Management Strategy and Action Plan (2009-2015) that was
prepared in 2008, the Ghana Strategic Investment Framework for Sustainable Land Management
was developed in 2010. It has identified priority ecosystem target areas in which investments in
land use, soil and watershed management will be made.

Even though the promotion of sustainable land management is ongoing among many thousands
of farmers, the extent to which the 3% annual adoption target is being met or exceeded cannot be
accurately measured.

Achievement of the fourth objective is unsatisfactory.

Sector Objective 5: Science and technology applied in food and agriculture development
    a. Improved agricultural productivity
The adoption of fertilizer technology between 2008 and 2010 has been significant. Total
fertilizer consumption has increased by 250%, from 100,000 tons in 2008 to 250,000 in 2011.7
Since 2008, the fertilizer subsidy program has targeted non-cocoa smallholder farmers with the
sale of fertilizer subsidized at prices, starting with 43,000 tons in 2008 and increasing the
program to 91,000 tons in 2010. Recently conducted qualitative analysis has confirmed that the
number of fertilizer users has increased during the same period, as have application rates (IFPRI,
2011). According to MoFA survey data, the widespread adoption of fertilizer has resulted in
substantial yield increases between 2007 and 2010 for maize (23%) and rice (59%). Yield
increases for sorghum (73%), cassava (21%), and yams (14%) have been achieved, resulting
from the adoption of improved varieties that have been developed during recent years. While it is
not possible to accurately measure the achievement of the 30% adoption target, the yield and
production data confirm that significant fertilizer and seed and planting material technology
adoption has occurred during the first two years of the AgDPO.

The significant increase in the use of fertilizers between 2008-10, along with the reported
increases in yields, suggest that significant technology adoption has taken place although
achievement of the 30% adoption target has not yet been objectively verified. In view of this,
achievement of the fifth objective is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Sector Objective 6: Enhanced institutional coordination
      a. Improved quality of budgetary process and sector efficiency in public financial
         management
The level of budget execution is largely a function of the level of fund releases made by MoFEP
to MoFA. An additional measurement is the level of actual expenditures against the funds
available. The target of 100% budget execution has been met as it relates to GoG resources.
MoFA’s budget release rate for GoG resources increased from 83% in 2007 to 112% in 2010

(see Table 2).8 Whereas Personnel and Administration budgets have been met or exceeded in the
past, Services and Investment, from which key MoFA programs are funded, were traditionally
underfunded. However, budget execution of Item 4 (Investment) using GoG funding sources
increased from 50% in 2007 to 112% in 2010. Budget execution rates for resources from donors,
over which GoG has no direct control, increased from 45% in 2007 to 57% in 2010. The overall
ratio of expenditure against releases has improved from 93% in 2007 to 97% in 2010.

Given the improvement in budget execution involving resources that are under the control of
GoG, and taking into consideration the increased commitment to resource availability and
expenditure of Investment, achievement of the sixth objective is satisfactory.

In addition to the specific PDOs, the AgDPO has contributed to the following sector outcomes:

      poorest. Agricultural GDP grew by around 6 percent per year over 2007–10 (Table 1),
      continuing two decades of growth coinciding with the liberalization of the sector.9 In earlier
      years, agricultural growth was driven primarily by area expansion, supplemented in more
      recent years by productivity gains. In line with the structural transformation of agrarian
      economies, nonagricultural sectors grew more rapidly, with the result that the share of
      agriculture in overall economic activity declined. The recent revision to national accounts
      shows that agriculture now accounts for 30 percent of GDP (down from 39 percent under the
      old measure).

* Projection.

     During the period under review, agricultural production increased substantially at the
      national level, surpassing the target per capita increase of 30 percent. Increases for food
      grains were especially substantial. Statistics from MoFA indicate that maize production
      increased from 1.22 million to 1.87 million tons and rice production from 185,000 to 295,000
      tons, owing to area expansion (close to 10 percent for maize and approximately 30 percent
      for rice from 2007 to 2010) and yield increases (1.46 and 2.16 t/ha in 2000 to 1.89 and 2.71
      t/ha for maize and rice respectively in 2010). Most significantly, the fertilizer subsidy
      program launched in collaboration with the private sector in 2008 has contributed to a
      doubling of the fertilizer market (and fertilizer use) from approximately 50,000 tons of
      fertilizer in 2007 and 2008 to 95,000 tons in 2010 and a projected 130,000 tons in 2011.10

     Between 1992 and 2006, poverty declined from 52 percent to 29 percent.11 During that
      period, most of the reduction in poverty occurred in the South, where large productivity gains
      in agriculture (cocoa in particular) and demographic change freed human and financial
      resources to be invested in higher value-added sectors, especially the urban informal sector.

   Based on industry estimates by Yara, a leading fertilizer importer and distributor. The estimates do not include the
fertilizer market for cocoa, which has expanded from 50,000 tons in 2008 to 100,000 tons in 2010.
11
   Poverty rates are computed using the national poverty line. Estimates using the international poverty line of
US$ 1.25 a day put the poverty rate at 30 percent in 2006, down from 39 percent in 1999.

     Yet, more than half of Ghana’s poor reside in the three northern regions, where one-fourth of
     Ghana’s people live.12 Efforts to address the special needs of these regions have included
     MoFA’s fertilizer subsidy program that commenced in 2008 and which appears to have made
     a positive impact. During the period under review, agricultural production increases were
     higher in the three northern regions than in the rest of the country, suggesting that some of
     the government’s efforts to address constraints in these regions have yielded results. The
     share of maize production in Northern, Upper West, and Upper East Regions increased from
     11 percent to 19 percent of national production, and the share of rice production increased
     from 49 percent to 67 percent of national production between 2007 and 2010.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The objectives of the AgDPO remain highly relevant to
Ghana’s priorities in the agriculture sector, and some have indeed been incorporated in the new
ongoing AgDPO series. Overall, the AgDPO successfully helped to achieve key outcomes
related to the PDOs. Significant growth in the agricultural sector has been achieved, which has
contributed to economy-wide structural transformation. While poverty remains concentrated in
the northern regions despite economic growth and structural transformation at the national level,
disproportionately high food production and productivity increases were achieved in the northern
regions. Significant progress was made in the sector supported by an operation that was designed
as a three year programmatic DPO, but discontinued after two operations. However, progress
was less than envisaged concerning the management of informal irrigation schemes, uptake of
soil and water management technologies, reduction of post harvest losses, and measuring
production technology adoption. The overall outcome rating is therefore moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The AgDPO supported the government’s efforts to address rural poverty in the northern regions.
Fertilizer subsidies, the block farm program, and crop purchases under the buffer stock program
respectively made agricultural inputs more affordable, provided employment, and provided a
market where normally the private sector would not operate. Staple food production increased
disproportionately in the three northern regions.

Since 2008, under the Agricultural Services program (supported by CIDA), a total of 1,480
farmers from 296 FBOs have been trained on enterprise development as part of capacity building
of FBOs in Ghana. Women farmers formed 40% of beneficiaries of the capacity building effort.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As observed earlier, MoFA found that the recent budget support expanded its capacity for
planning and executing its programs. CAADP-oriented support mechanisms, including the

                                                19
AgDPO series, empowered MoFA to lead the design of FASDEP II and its implementation
instrument, METASIP, which now provides the framework for investments in food security and
agricultural development. Budget support also helped MoFA fund and implement government
programs like its fertilizer subsidy program, originally designed to respond to the food/fertilizer
crisis. According to MoFA, funding to districts and regions to implement agricultural
development programs increased significantly as a share of the ministry's budget between 2004
and 2010, from 30 percent to 67 percent.

The development of legislation in the irrigation, seed and fisheries sectors under AgDPO 1 and 2
has paved the way for further reform that has started to take place during the present AgDPO
series, such as the preparation of an investment framework for the irrigation sector, the
implementation of a new seed and fertilizer law, and the implementation of a licensing cap for
the industrial fishing fleet.

During the AgDPO series under review, many new farmer-based organizations were established
and their capacity strengthened. In addition, with the fertilizer subsidy program in place, an
enabling environment was created under which the private sector input distribution network
expanded.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

No unintended outcomes and impacts were identified.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate. Outcomes related to sector growth and poverty reduction appear to be
sustainable given that the government’s policy of supporting market-driven, private sector-led
development, including agricultural technology development and dissemination is truly anchored
in FASDEP II. MoFA is currently pursuing an agricultural commercialization program and
enhancing its fertilizer subsidy program by including a component on seed technology. The new
AgDPO series approved in May 2011 is designed to support the ongoing CAADP
implementation with a continuing focus on policy and institutional reforms supported under the
first series. The government’s consistent agricultural policy and continued resource mobilization
through METASIP, combined with sustained support through the new programmatic AgDPO,
suggest that the risk to the development outcomes achieved under the first AgDPO series is
moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank's performance in preparing the operation was satisfactory. In
close collaboration with MoFA and other development partners, the preparation process focused
on identifying critical gaps and opportunities for support in the agricultural sector, based on a
robust body of analytical evidence. The AgDPO’s objectives were consistent with, and some
were derived from, the government’s specific development priorities under the sector policy,
FASDEP II, and the CAS. During preparation, the Bank assessed the operation’s risks and
benefits and used a participatory approach that involved sector stakeholders in identifying
priorities. Although the task team could draw on lessons learned from other DPOs in other
sectors, this series was the first agricultural sector DPO in Africa. The operation supported
selected reforms and policy actions, and the list of prior actions included actions and reforms
deemed essential to its successful implementation. The adequacy of the macroeconomic
framework was assessed in collaboration with the IMF.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank's performance during the implementation of the operation was
satisfactory. The task team focused on the operation’s developmental impact. As the task team
leader was based in the Bank’s country office in Accra and intensively engaged in the sector
policy dialogue, interaction with government officials and development partners was continuous.
Progress on prior actions was monitored closely, technical advice was provided on the various
M&E tasks, including on the various baseline studies. The task team proactively provided
technical assistance to the government and engaged in policy dialogue. For example, the team
participated in the preparation and dissemination of the recent poverty study.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry and performance of
supervision were satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The government’s commitment to and ownership of reforms
was adequate and satisfactory. All prior actions were met, with one exception, but a number of
outcomes could not be measured as per the results framework because data for four objectives
(improved irrigation scheme performance, improved food security through post harvest losses;
environmental compliance through adoption of soil and water conservation technology adoption;
and improved agricultural productivity through production technology adoption) were either
partially or not at all covered and required modifications to the M&E system. The
implementation of these modifications involved a number of baseline studies and the



                                               21
development of subsequent data collection systems which were delayed and/or whose
methodology did not allow quantitative measurement.


6. Lessons Learned

Based on extensive discussions with MoFA, MoFEP, and members of the ASWG, the lessons
learned from AgDPO 1 and 2 can be summarized as follows:

   Sector Development Policy Lending for the agriculture sector has proven to be an effective,
    flexible instrument that empowered the Government of Ghana to implement a country-owned
    policy and the related programs. An important lesson for future operations is to ensure that
    the policy agenda underlying the operation is complementary to the Bank’s and other
    development partners’ investment lending operations, thus creating synergies that enhance
    the policy making process as well as program implementation.

   The design of AgDPO policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are major
    undertakings that need to be better integrated in MoFA’s planning process. During future
    operations, the establishment of prior actions and triggers and the related reporting
    requirements must be internalized at various levels within MoFA, along with adequate
    reporting requirements. Likewise, results frameworks should include existing indicators to
    measure performance to the extent possible, reducing the risk of data unavailability.

   Coordination between the World Bank’s and CIDA’s budget support programs prevented
    duplication and contributed to sector planning and coordination. It calls for the development
    of an overall policy priority framework, akin to a larger policy matrix that identifies key
    actions required to implement METASIP. Specific prior actions and triggers can be drawn
    from this framework for future Bank and non-Bank budget support operations.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

   The government has experienced the AgDPO as a funding instrument that is adaptable to
    national priorities and promotes ownership of development interventions. The
    implementation arrangements are consistent with the principles of aid effectiveness, country
    ownership, leadership, management for results accountability, and use of national systems.
    Budget support using DPL modalities provides for policy focus while providing resources for
    the sector that are not tied to specific activities.

   MoFA has recognized that the design and implementation of the AgDPO policy agenda
    needs to be better integrated in MoFA’s planning and monitoring and evaluation process.

   MoFA emphasized that late and/or unpredictable disbursement, as occurred with AgDPO 2
    in 2009, disrupts government programs and defeats the purpose of budget support. Yet, the

                                               22
   World Bank’s operational policies specify that a stable macroeconomic environment—which
   could not be confirmed in 2009—is a precondition for budget support. This constraint and its
   implications were communicated to the Government of Ghana throughout the preparation
   process for AgDPO 2. Following the signing of the Financing Agreement, efficient
   processing by the government, such as approval by the Cabinet and Parliament and the
   issuance of the Legal Opinion by the Attorney General, will also shorten the lead time
   between signature and disbursement.

(b) Cofinanciers

Not applicable.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

The following observations were made by CIDA:

The observation made in this report that budget support may not have filled the resource gap at
the government-farmer interface may be true, but part of the issue is with the administrative
capacity to support extension staff in the field. For example, during 2008-09, 600 motorbikes and
a number of mobile vans were provided for extension. The motorcycles were not distributed until
much later, and distribution and use of the vans has also been delayed.

CIDA noted that within MoFA, DPO-related planning has added a task instead of blending it into
ongoing planning processes may be an indication of planning capacity or institutional challenges
which should be addressed. In CIDA’s case the “trigger targets? are meant to be developed from
MoFA and should therefore be integrated into the planning system. CIDA emphasizes the need
for a comprehensive policy matrix from which AgDPO prior actions and CIDA trigger targets
are identified, and which corresponds with METASIP and the M&E framework.

While recognizing that AgDPO focuses on agricultural outcomes, CIDA notes that the results are
also important in terms of having made a contribution towards building the institutional capacity
of MoFA.

  FIRST AND SECOND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS

Introduction

   1. The World Bank introduced Development Policy Lending for the agriculture sector in
      2008 in parallel with CIDA who are providing budgetary support for the implementation
      of the Food and Agriculture Development Policy (FASDEP II). The first series of
      Agriculture Development Policy Operations (AgDPOs) was initially designed for three
      years (2008-2010) with annual disbursements of $15 million. Before the first
      disbursement was made, it was revised upwards to $25 million in response to the food
      crisis in 2007/2008.     The DPO followed the closure of the World Bank funded
      Agriculture Services Sub-sector Investment Project (AgSSIP) which closed in April,
      2007. The operation was designed to support the reforms, policies and activities initiated
      under AgSSIP. Following the signing of the CAADP Compact in October 2009, and the
      development of the Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP), the
      first agriculture DPO series was terminated after the second disbursement in 2010 and
      replaced with a new series that reflect the policy priorities and resource requirements for
      the successful implementation of METASIP.

Objective
  2. The main objective of the first and second AgDPO series (AgDPO 1 and 2) was to
      support Government’s efforts to encourage an agriculture led growth to achieve poverty
      reduction in a sustainable manner through the implementation of the country’s national
      and sector development strategies. Agriculture in the country is largely practiced by the
      rural poor, and as such it provides the greatest economic opportunity for poverty
      reduction. This justifies Government’s financial commitment in the sector to facilitate the
      transformation of this targeted group.

   3. AgDPO 1 and 2 supported the implementation of the Food and Agriculture Sector
      Development Policy (FASDEP II) which seeks to enhance the environment for all
      categories of farmers, while targeting poor and risk prone and risk-averse producers. The
      DPOs were aligned with the six key policy objectives of FASDEP II (i) food security and
      emergency preparedness; (ii) increased growth in incomes; (iii) increased
      competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic and international markets; (iv)
      sustainable management of land and environment; (v) science and technology applied to
      food security and agricultural development; and (vi) improved institutional coordination.
      They were consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank and
      Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) – an agreement by the Development Partners to
      effectively coordinate their activities in the country.

Design

   4. The first operation (AgDPO 1) disbursed in 2008, built on lessons from the
      implementation of AgSSIP and FASDEP I. Its design was also consistent with the first
      component of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-5) focusing on sustainable
      private sector-led growth through increased competiveness, productivity and effective
      participation of Farmer Based Organizations in the agriculture sector. The design took
      into consideration the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) by Government which
      outlines Government’s priority areas of development. AgDPO 2 built on AgDPO 1
      furthering and consolidating the actions within the policy matrix.

   5. The design adopted a participatory approach involving all key stakeholders. This
      enhanced consensus and ensured the achievement of the prior actions. As budgetary
      support, its design focused on broader policy and institutional issues necessary to
      catalyze effective implementation of the sector strategy and ensure results. Design,
      appraisal and approval processes were short compared to traditional projects. While the
      DPO funds are earmarked for the sector by the government, they are not earmarked for
      specific activities in MoFA annual plan and budget. Viewed from a cash flow
      perspective, the one-time disbursements have enabled MoFA to fund the input support
      programme and other capital intensive activities.

   6. The approval process, although similar to traditional loans, is not as time consuming
      because of the use of existing institutions and country systems in implementation,
      reporting and accountability. This is a significant advantage in terms of reducing
      transaction costs and freeing time for government officials to concentrate on policy and
      program implementation. A positive contribution to aid effectiveness, annual
      disbursement of the credit based on the completion of policy prior actions and the use of
      the policy matrix which explicitly states the objectives, indicators and outcomes, makes
      implementation, monitoring and reporting efficient and effective.

Implementation
  7. While the support was not specifically targeted to any specific programme in the
      agriculture sector, specific policy areas consistent with the FASDEP II objectives with
      corresponding actions to be implemented were agreed. The matrix below shows the
      policy areas and the specific actions implemented under the two operations.

Overall Experience with the Operations
  8. The AgDPO has encouraged overall focus on the implementation of sector policy and its
      outcomes instead of or in addition to narrow project performance. During design
      emphasis is made on key policy and institutional aspects of the sector that will contribute
      to effective implementation of the sector priorities. The design process is less
      cumbersome and less time consuming compared to traditional projects. In line with the
      Paris Declaration Principles, review of the sector performance is done under the auspices
      of the Joint Sector Review instituted by MoFA in 2008 in collaboration with its
      development partners.

   9. There has been active participation and collaboration of all partners in the
      implementation of the DPOs, the key ones being the Ministry of Finance and Economic
      Planning and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and its relevant directorates. The
      Agriculture Sector Working Group made up of key actors in the agriculture sector,
      including Development Partners, have been involved through sharing of information at
      the monthly meetings and discussion of outcomes at the annual Joint Sector Review.

   10. Single tranche disbursements are commendable – they reduce transaction time and costs
       and allow injection of substantial funding resources into the sector at one go.

                                               33
Outcomes of AgDPO 1 and 2
   11. The Table below provides the results framework for AgDPO I & II. The outcomes
       reported can be directly attributed to the two Operations but are also a result of
       complementary program interventions in the sector. Production levels of most crops over
       the last three years (2008-2010) have increased significantly, ranging from 32% for
       cassava to 109% for sorghum. Maize, rice and groundnut recorded increases of 53%,
       59% and 76% respectively. Functioning Farmer Based Organizations access to market
       and credit services increased during this period and non-traditional exports showed mixed
       performance.

   12. The AgDPO 1&2 together with the CIDA budgetary support provided additional funding
       to MoFA to help implement its activities. The increased funding enabled MoFA design
       and implement programmes such as (1) the fertilizer subsidy; (2) the Youth in
       Agriculture Programme; (3) the Agriculture Mechanization Centres and (4) the National
       Buffer Stock Programme. MoFA has also been able to increase funding to the districts
       enabling extension agents to reach farmers with technological messages. Funding to the
       districts and regions increased significantly over the last six years (2004-2010) from 30%
       to close to 70% of the Ministry’s budget.
   13. MoFA has over the last couple of years enhanced its capacity for planning and execution
       of its programmes. Specifically MoFA led the design of the FASDEP II and its
       implementation instrument the METASIP which now provides the framework for
       investment in food security and agriculture development.
   14. The institution of the Joint Sector Review which is co-chaired by MoFA and DPs is
       contributing to enhanced sector coordination and strengthening monitoring and
       evaluation – consistent with management for development results. For example, the
       evaluation of the four key programmes in the sector mentioned above which was a
       recommendation from the 2010 Joint Sector Review will provide input into decision
       making to make these investments more effective to make the desired impact on farmers’
       income, agriculture productivity and growth.
   15. The sector budgetary support has also enhanced financial reporting in MoFA which is
       continuously improved for greater accountability.
   16. Further strengthening is required in coordination, effective planning and monitoring and
       evaluation feeding into decision making.

MoFA’s Performance and Lessons Learned
  17. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture in close collaboration with the World Bank
      and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning collaborated effectively in
      the preparation and implementation of the project. From the design stage, there
      was collaboration in identifying the policy actions that will contribute to the
      objectives of the METASIP. The DPOs gave more discretion and flexibility over
      allocation and use of resources for MoFA’s own priorities thus enhancing
      ownership. They contributed to increased financial resources to the sector
      enabling the Ministry execute its plan and budget. The DPOs in particular have
      significantly contributed to MoFA’s ability to support increased use of agriculture
      inputs to raise productivity.

   18. Linking disbursements to achievement of prior actions leveraged Government
       decisive action on policy and institutional issues. The DPO approach reduced the
       work involved in project preparation, approval and implementation, reducing the
       contact time between funding agency and implementing agency in terms of
       obtaining no objections for planned activities. The use of country systems in line
       with the Paris Declaration is commendable, contributing to aid effectiveness. The
       process strengthened policy dialogue with other agencies like the Canadian
       International Development Agency and with the other development partners
       active in the sector, leading to the decision to design a policy action framework
       for the agriculture sector that is integrated into the sector M&E system for
       accountability.

The World Bank’s Performance and Lessons Learned
   19. The Banks performance is satisfactory. It facilitated the design and approval
       processes effectively, ensuring that the Government meets its prior actions for
       early disbursements. It has also been flexible in adjusting the policy matrix to
       reflect real-time policy and program developments.

   20. The Government was, however, disappointed that after negotiations with the
       World Bank in 2009, AgDPO 2 funds were not disbursed until the end of 2010.
       This undermined the predictability of the budgetary support and hampered the
       implementation of sector activities. Agriculture sector activities are time and
       season-bound, and delays of disbursements for planned activities offsets the
       effective execution of these activities and expected outcomes.

Proposed Arrangements for Future Operation of the Project
   21. The arrangements on the design, appraisal and approval are largely satisfactory
       and should be continued. However, the timing should be improved to ensure that
       funds are disbursed in the first or second quarter of the year to enhance
       implementation of activities. It is also proposed that for further harmonization, the
       review of future operations should be done jointly with any other sector budgetary
       support agencies, currently only CIDA, and fed into the Joint Sector Review
       process.




                                            43
   22. Although prior actions are intended to leverage policy and institutional actions to
       contribute to the achievement of sector objectives, they should be limited to
       actions within the jurisdiction of MoFA. Actions beyond MoFA should be
       handled under the Multi Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) process. This is
       because the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP), which
       coordinates the (MDBS) process has the financial leverage over all MDAs to
       coordinate such cross-sectoral actions.

Conclusion and Recommendations
   23. It is important to emphasize that Development Policy Operations are more
       adaptable to country priorities and promotes ownership of development
       interventions. The implementation arrangements are consistent with ideals of aid
       effectiveness, country ownership, leadership, management for results
       accountability and use of country systems. The process is less complex and
       demanding compared to project lending, thus freeing time for implementation and
       decision making. The prior actions which are jointly identified by the Bank and
       the Ministry, for example, provide an added opportunity for policy and
       institutional issues to be addressed to support the implementation of programmes.

   24. The funding gap for the implementation of METASIP is estimated at one billion
       Ghana Cedis. This requires additional investment of about 200 million annually.
       It is anticipated that as the sector demonstrates improved results, other
       development partners will join the World Bank and CIDA in policy/programme
       based lending for the implementation of the Medium Term Agriculture Sector
       Investment Plan (METASIP).
