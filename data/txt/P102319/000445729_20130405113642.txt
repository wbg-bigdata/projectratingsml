I. Disbursement Profile
1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1.      At the time of project design in 2006-2007, Southern Sudan was amongst the
poorest regions in the world, with 90 percent of the population earning less than US$ 1
per day. The 20 year war had destroyed physical capital, institutions and had prevented
the emergence of entrepreneurs. The Government of the Republic of Southern Sudan
(GRSS1), which was installed in 2011 as the first government of a new nation – South
Sudan. The Government was committed to sustained peace, through the provision of jobs
and growth of the private sector. Private sector development was a constitutional
objective in the Interim Constitution. This was based on experience from other post-
conflict settings which suggested that a competitive and growing private sector offered an
opportunity to the South Sudanese to extricate themselves from poverty through
employment, through capital investment, and to generate tax revenues necessary to invest
in service delivery and reduce dependence on the petroleum sector or other transfers. The
emphasis on private sector growth presented the GRSS with a dramatic challenge,
requiring action on a number of fronts, such as the enabling environment, financing,
building skills and infrastructure.
2.      At the time of project appraisal, GRSS had embarked on a number of critical
actions, establishing the key responsible line ministries (Commerce, Trade and Supply,
Industry and Mining), reviewing all major foundational laws supporting private sector
development, including commercial laws, investment law, bankruptcy laws and contract
law.
Rationale for Bank Assistance

3.      The PSD project was based on the results of the Joint Assessment Mission
(JAM)2, carried out jointly by the World Bank and the United Nations, which explained
that “promoting private sector development was central to the challenge of sustainable
peace and development in Southern Sudan, would require substantial policy and program
efforts.? The JAM recommended a regulatory framework for the private sector,
microfinance programs and market centers. The preparation of the project was led by the

     The GRSS was established after the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed in January 2005.
     Before independence in January 2011, the government was the Government of Southern Sudan. This
     ICR will use the acronym, GRSS, when referring to the Government over the entirety of the project
     period.

     This was published in a synthesis report on March 18, 2005. There is currently no Country Assistance
     Strategy for South Sudan. The World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for South Sudan was
     approved by the Board on March1, 2013.

Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Supply3, the Bank of Southern Sudan, the Ministry of
Industry and Mining and Central Equatoria State (CES).
4.     The magnitude of the challenge called for a robust multi-year, multi-donor,
programmatic response. Accordingly, the investments proposed in the project
complemented and worked in partnership with programs of donors, including USAID,
which had supported legislative development as well as economic growth and
microfinance programs through various consulting firms; advisory support being
provided by DFID on trade and private sector development; USAID, UNDP and FIAS
support to the Ministry of Legal Affairs and Constitutional Development; UNDP’s rule of
law program; UNIDO and JICA’s vocational training support; and FAO and USAID
support on agricultural marketing.



1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.     The development objectives of the project were to: (i) develop an enabling
environment for private sector growth; and (ii) to sustainably increase formal
employment in Southern Sudan.
6.      There was a discrepancy between the wording of the development objectives in
the Final Project Proposal and the Grant Agreement. The wording of the objectives
within the Grant Agreement stands.
7.      The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following outcome
indicators:
      PDO1: Develop an enabling environment for private sector growth
      1. Number of businesses registered in Southern Sudan (Target: 25 percent increase
         per year over five years)
      2. Number of licenses issued in Southern Sudan (Target: 10 percent increase per
         year over 5 years)
      PDO2: Sustainably increase formal employment
      1. Employment by formal, registered private sector in Southern Sudan (Target: 20
         percent increase per year over 5 years)


8.     The above PDOs were complemented by the following Intermediate Results (IR),
for which the respective intermediate indicators were adopted:
        1. IR1: Develop policy and M&E capacity in targeted ministries
               1.1. Private sector development strategy endorsed by Cabinet or Parliament

3
    This Ministry was subsequently renamed the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment (MCII).
    The remainder of this document will use the acronym MCII to denote this Ministry.

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

9.      The PDO was not revised. However, the original outcome indicators were
changed (dropped, replaced or modified) by the project restructuring in June 2011. The
revised PDO outcome indicators are presented below:
      PDO1: Develop an enabling environment for private sector growth
      1. Number of businesses registered in Southern Sudan (Target: 8,900) - Revised4
      2. Streamline number of steps to register a business (Target: 4 steps) - New
      PDO2: Sustainably increase formal employment
      1. Formal employment by the enterprises supported by the BPC loans (Target: 40
         jobs) – Revised5
      2. Growth in the number of clients served by MFIs (Target: 39,000) - New
      3. People with access to finance through targeted MFIs and BPC (disaggregated by
         gender) – New
10.    Of the 27 original intermediate indicators 13 were dropped and 14 indicators
remained after restructuring, as follows:
        1. IR1: Develop a national microfinance policy and supporting regulations
                1.1.    Microfinance policy is presented to Cabinet

        2. IR2: Establish an efficient investment climate
                2.1.  Public-Private Dialogue Forum is established
                2.2.  M&E Systems developed are functioning and regularly updated by the
                     MCII
                2.3. Number of businesses supported through BPC
                2.4. Laws to improve the enabling environment for business are presented
                     to Cabinet

        3. IR3: Develop viable microfinance institutions
                3.1. Southern Sudan Microfinance Development Facility is established
                3.2. Number of new microfinance institutions (MFIs) operational in
                     Southern Sudan
                3.3. Number of loans by gender
                3.4. Value of loans by gender
                3.5. Portfolio at Risk

        4. IR4: Facilitate creation of higher value-added industries


4
    Previous target was set at a 25 percent increase per year for 5 years.
5
    Previous target was set at 20 percent increase per year for 5 years.


                                                       4
             4.1.   Industrial Competitiveness Strategy is completed
             4.2.   Mining Act and supporting regulations are developed
             4.3.   Staff of the MCII and MEM are trained

      5. IR5: Facilitate the establishment of a functioning wholesale market
             5.1.   Design of the wholesale market is completed

11.     The main reasons underlying the change in the PDO and intermediate indicators
for the project were the lack of adequate or baseline data and the unsuitability of the
original indicators to measure the real impact of project activities. For instance, annual
percentage increases of business registrations were difficult to measure given the lack of
baseline data. In addition, because of data unavailability on licenses issued, the project
decided instead to measure the ease with which businesses could be registered. Similarly,
as employment figures for registered enterprises were not possible to obtain, the new
indicator measured employment created by the business plan competition beneficiaries.
And lastly, the post-restructuring list included new indicators on the number of MFI
clients and people with access to finance (disaggregated by gender) that were important
additions to measure the impact of project activities on financial access.
12.     The results framework was revised in June, 2011, six months before the project
was scheduled to close (the project was later extended by an additional year). Project
implementation was very slow at the start and only picked up speed in 2009-2010 with
the hiring of the project coordinator and procurement of key consultancies. It was only by
this time that it became clear that it would be next to impossible to measure the outcomes
associated with the inputs and outputs. Thus, restructuring was actually quite timely
given the slow rate of implementation in the first two-three years of project period.
13.     There was also a strong rationale for setting new targets at the point of
restructuring in the project. While a large part of the funds had already been disbursed,
the project development objectives could not be properly tracked since the outcome
indicators were difficult to measure. The set of indicators in the revised results
framework allowed the project to track outcomes in line with project inputs and outputs.
The first PDO, referring to the number of businesses registered, remained unchanged,
except that it was the absolute number of registrations that were being measured instead
of comparative changes given the lack of baseline data. The original PDO measuring the
annual percentage change in the number of licenses issued did not provide any additional
information. On the other hand, the modified indicator, that measured the steps taken to
register a business, provided an indication of the ease with which the enabling
environment for business registrations had been improved.
14.     The measurement of employment created by formal, registered enterprises was
not possible, given the resources that would be needed to collect information on
individual firms, especially in the absence of any official survey or census of firms in
South Sudan. Instead, the project refocused its attention on measuring the jobs created by
enterprises supported by the Business Plan Competition. And importantly, it included
indicators that provided an assessment of the private entrepreneurial opportunities created
by the provision of microfinance loans. The loans supported a viable and growing


                                            5
number of grassroots’ entrepreneurs in different parts of South Sudan, in areas both urban
and rural. And while a large majority of these small businesses were in the informal
sector, they led to full-time employment for the entrepreneurs and their staff who were
able to establish credit histories and save and re-invest in productive ventures. Thus, the
original PDO indicators were changed and the new indicators were designed, such that,
under the prevailing conditions, they could fully capture the achievement of each of the
PDOs.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

15.     The Final Project Proposal identified a number of potential beneficiaries relating
to the different project components and sub-components. In terms of capacity building
and technical assistance, the key beneficiaries were the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and
Supply6, the South Sudan Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (SSCCIA),
the Ministry of Industry and Mining (MEMI), the Bank of Southern Sudan (BOSS) and
Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs). Micro, Small and Medium-Scaled Enterprises
(MSMEs) were to benefit from access to finance, training, access to markets and a better
business environment. The target beneficiaries did not change when the project was
restructured.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)


16.    At approval, the project had five components (four technical and one
administrative) as follows:
17.     Component 1: Trade and Investment Policy Framework (US$ 1.85 million). The
MCII was the implementing agency for this component. This component consisted of
four sub-components. The first (long-term policy capacity) was aimed at establishing an
efficient investment climate by building capacity within the MCII to develop, articulate
and execute a coherent legal and policy framework to foster private sector development.
The second sub-component (establishment of public-private dialogue forum) aimed at
creating a structured, regular dialogue between the public and private sectors on the legal
and policy agenda related to private sector development. The third sub-component
(catalyzing entrepreneurship) focused on providing resources, financial and technical, to
new South Sudanese entrepreneurs to mobilize them into sustainable economic units. The
fourth sub-component (monitoring and evaluation) aimed at designing and executing a
system of monitoring indicators to measure the growth and the health of the private
sector.
18.    Component 2: Establishing Commercially-Viable Microfinance Institutions (US$
1.52 million). The BOSS was the implementing agency for this component. This
component aimed to stimulate the creation of a viable microfinance sector to provide
banking services to the unbanked and economically-active poor. The component


6
    The Ministry was later renamed the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment – the MCII. This
    acronym will be used throughout this document.


                                                  6
consisted of three sub-components. The first (policy and enabling environment for
microfinance) aimed to support the development of the legal and regulatory framework
for microfinance. The second (Southern Sudan microfinance development facility
manager) aimed to establish a facility that would support the establishment of new MFIs
through the provision of financing, training and donor-resource management. The third
sub-component (technical assistance and financing to microfinance providers and to the
sector) was to support the start-up and expansion of microfinance providers and services.
19.     Component 3: Building Industrial Capacity (US$ 1.50 million). The MEMI was
the implementing agency for this component. This component consisted of four sub-
components. The first (building industrial strategy and policy capacity) aimed to enhance
the capacity of the Government to support industrial strategy and policy formulation. The
main focus was on the MEMI. The second sub-component (analysis of competitiveness
and assessment of mineral potential) aimed at identifying the industrial and resource
potential of the country, mainly through surveys of existing and potential capacity and
through the promotion of investment opportunities. The third sub-component
(development of private sector support institutions) aimed at developing a network of
support institutions to serve the common interests of the formal and the informal private
sector. The fourth sub-component (catalyzing business linkages through BDS) aimed at
addressing bottlenecks to the development of an entrepreneurial class through the
provision of training in technical and business skills.
20.     Component 4: Marketing System Development (US$ 5.41 million). The Ministry
of Finance within the State Government of Central Equatoria was the main implementing
agency for this component. The main objective of this component was to establish a
market institution to lower transaction costs, to facilitate the flow of products,
information and credit between producers and consumers, and to demonstrate an effective
public-private partnership for infrastructure. The three sub-components (establishment of
a wholesale market, establishment of associated assembly market system and rural-urban
linkages, and building backward linkages and market information systems) were
designed to produce an efficient marketing system for promoting and commercializing
agricultural production. The planned activities included the leasing of land, construction
of the wholesale market and the provision of the associated legal and regulatory
framework.
21.     Component 5: Project Management (US$ 0.52 million). The MCII was the agency
overall coordinator for this component. The component aimed at financing the necessary
personnel and resources for the project. This included the project coordinator, financial
management and procurement personnel, and administrative support for each of the four
technical components. This component was also meant to finance office, vehicles and
equipment for the project.
1.6    Revised Components

22.    The project was initially meant to have been implemented in two phases – I and
II. US$ 20.2 million was allocated in total for both phases of the project. US$ 11.05
million was allocated for Phase I, of which the GRSS was meant to contribute US$ 4.3
million. The project was meant to be implemented over 5 years, with 18 months aside for


                                            7
Phase I. As Phase II was meant to deal primarily with the Wholesale Market Component,
this phase did not take place as the market was not built in Phase I.
23.     The components as envisioned in the design remained generally intact throughout
project implementation. However, some planned activities were dropped – mainly within
the fourth component, i.e. the building of the wholesale market and the associated market
assembly system and market information systems.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

24.    Other significant changes involved restructuring of the project, two extensions of
the closing date for a cumulative period of 12 months, reprioritizing activities, and
changes to the sources and the volume of funding. These changes are described below in
chronological order.
25.     In July 2009 the Gender Action Plan (GAP) provided a grant of US$ 1 million, to
be shared equally between the Business Plan Competition (BPC) and the Access to
finance sub-components. These additional funds were to benefit 25 women entrepreneurs
selected under the BPC and assist in strengthening institutional and financial capacity of
MFIs to enhance their ability to provide microfinance services to female entrepreneurs.
26.    The Grant Agreement was amended in September 2009 to provide additional
MDTF funding of US$ 1.67 million to cover the shortfall of GRSS contributions, thus
bringing the total MDTF funding under Phase I to US$ 8.457 million.
27.    On June 16, 2011 the MDTF was restructured to extend the closing date from
June 30, 2011 until January 31, 2012, when it was clear that more time would be required
to complete outstanding project activities. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce
prepared an action plan including an implementation plan to meet the revised project
closing date.
28.      On December 14, 2011, the MDTF was restructured, for the second time.
Additional financing amounting to US$ 0.675 million was drawn from the Multi-Donor
Trust Fund for Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS) and the closing date of the project was
further extended from January 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012. The additional financing was
required to finance the completion of original project activities which were due to an
unanticipated cost overrun and financing gap in the MDTF-SS funded PSD project. The
activities included: (i) completing the establishment of an M&E system for private sector
development in South Sudan, and training of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and
Investment (MCII) personnel in using the system to generate baseline data and indicators;
(ii) following up the performance of BPC winners; (iii) completing the contract for the
management of the South Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SSMDF) and
monitoring the performance of microfinance institutions; (iv) supporting the public-
private dialogue; and (v) supporting project management.
29.   Component 4 relating to the construction of the wholesale market was not
completed since the funds allocated to this component were grossly insufficient.
However, the preliminary designs for the wholesale market were finalized. Funds from



                                            8
Phase II of the PSDP in the amount of US$ 0.5 million were re-allocated to support the
establishment of a public private partnership law to help identify a private sector investor
under a PPP framework to build and operate the wholesale market7.



2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry


30.     The project was developed under OP8.0 (rapid response to a crisis or emergency)
and served the strategic interests, both immediate and intermediate, of the country. It built
on the comprehensive evaluation of the Joint Assessment Mission and the Bank’s
experience in post-conflict countries. In addition, the specific approach for the four
components was arrived at after several workshops and reviews with a range of
stakeholders for each of the project components. The team reviewed and identified
lessons learnt from previous engagement with the GRSS (see Annex 9 for supporting
documentation). However, the Final Project Proposal did not refer to lessons learnt from
the then on-going IDA-IFC pilot program for the development of micro, small and
medium enterprises in Africa, which had had a mixed experience with interventions
centered on improvements in the business environment and access to finance. In addition,
the project structure was somewhat complex with four components, each with a different
implementing agency, given that the country was a fragile state.
31.     A Quality at Entry (QAE) review on this project was prepared in October 2007.
The project was rated 2 (satisfactory) with regards to the clarity and realism of the PDO,
and the extent to which past experience and the Bank’s own knowledge base was
reflected in the project’s approach. Although the QAE rated the clarity and realism of the
PDO as satisfactory, the likelihood of achieving the development objectives was rated as
3 (moderately satisfactory). Indeed, the Final Project Proposal pointed out that conditions
in the country - a post-conflict country in combination with the significant uncertainties
in the macroeconomic framework, evolving nature of sectoral policies, security
environment and nascent governance arrangements – posed a risk to the achievement of
the PDO and outcomes. However, the QAE rated the risk to development outcomes as
moderate, since there was strong commitment of GRSS, and of donors, to undertake the
four project components. In fact, the project was an excellent example of a high-risk
high-return operation, with the risk-reward tradeoffs highly appropriate to the
country/sector context. The QAE did raise concerns with regards to the implementation
arrangements in that it considered the time frame to be unrealistic given the country
conditions. However, since the primary focus of the project was on capacity building, this
risk was not considered to have serious consequences.
32.    Although the Final Project Proposal recognized the difficult operating
environment, it under estimated the extent of the risks to implementation. In particular,


7
     Under Phase II of the project, this is yet to take effect.


                                                          9
not enough attention was paid to properly evaluating the capacity of the implementing
agencies at project design, and the possible challenges to attracting a competent pool of
consulting firms and talent was also grossly underestimated. In addition, the project did
not build in a framework for monitoring and evaluation for each of the components, and
very few resources were set aside for systematic monitoring of outcomes at every stage of
project implementation.
33.    Given that South Sudan was a new country being built from scratch, it is not clear
to what extent the risks to implementation could have been estimated with confidence.
Government capacity was very weak and there was dearth of basic infrastructure. At the
same time, because of the devastation caused by decades of conflict, there was an urgent
need for Bank intervention, and expectations on the donor and the client side were high.

2.2    Implementation

34.     The project was implemented over a period of five years, from effectiveness on
May 24, 2007 until closing on June 30, 2012 (following a one-year extension). The
project was supervised by three different Task Team Leaders (TTLs) over the life of the
project. The TTLs at project design and closing were based in Washington, DC, while the
TTL during most of the implementation period was based in Khartoum, Sudan. The four
components of the project were managed by four different project implementation units
(PIUs), all of which reported to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU was
based at the MCII, which was also responsible for Component 1. The Bank of Southern
Sudan was responsible for Component 2, the Ministry of Industry for Component 3, and
the Ministry of Finance in the State Government of Central Equatoria for Component 4.
Although a high-level steering committee had been proposed in the original PAD and
was constituted, it did not meet or function properly to ensure effective oversight.
35.     The implementation structure described in the Final Project Proposal was
straightforward, with each of the PIUs coordinating with the PCU. The PCU was to be
staffed by the project coordinator, a financial officer and a procurement officer, and the
PIUs were to include a project manager and administrator. However, the implementation
of the project immediately faced problems, in large part due to the difficulty in recruiting
staff for the dedicated PCU and in the recruitment of key policy advisors. In particular, it
was very difficult to attract talent because of the post-conflict nature of the environment
and the problem was only marginally ameliorated with offers of higher salaries. Even
when personnel were identified and hired, there was high turnover and retaining talent
was a significant bottleneck. In addition, there were significant delays in procurement
owing to weak capacity and uncertain procedures in reviewing and authorizing
government contracts at the Ministry of Legal Affairs and Constitutional Development
(MOLACD). In fact, owing to the slow implementation progress the mid-term review
was postponed from November 2008 to October 2009.
36.     The project coordinator was hired in August 2009 and policy advisors to the MCII
and to the BOSS started work in July 2009, after two years of project implementation.
Project coordination during the first two years was carried out by the PSD Directorate of
the MCII. Since a suitable procurement specialist could not be found, procurement
transactions were handled by a private sector consulting firm. The PSD Directorate took


                                            10
over the tasks of the financial management (FM) until a FM specialist could be hired (the
previous hire was in July 2008 who left after two months in the position). Project
disbursements were managed by a private sector accounting agent until their contract
expired at the end of 2008. Thereafter, all withdrawal applications were routed through a
Project Financial Management Unit in the MoF. After much prompting from MDTF
donors, by May 2009 the Government waived the MOLACD clearance requirements8 for
all contracts and procurement processes accelerated going forward.
37.     Despite these challenges total MDTF disbursements under the project amounted
to US$ 8.06 million as of December 15, 2010, which accounted for 95.3 percent of the
original grant of US$ 8.46 million9. The GRSS contributions remained at US$ 0.6 million
and had not increased since June 2009 when the Government requested the MDTF to
contribute the shortfall in counterpart funding owing to the fiscal crisis resulting from the
global financial crisis10. Since the funds were almost fully disbursed by the end of 2010,
and in view of the unanticipated cost overruns (see section on Efficiency and Annex 1 for
details) the project was restructured (for the second time) in December 2011 and
additional financing amounting to US$ 0.675 million was made available and the closing
date was extended by (yet another) six months.
38.    Because project implementation involved several entities, the progress of each of
the components is described below.
Component 1: Trade and Investment Policy Framework
39.     The first component was implemented by the MCII, primarily by the Directorate
of Private Sector Development. Under the first sub-component, which was aimed at
developing long-term policy capacity, legal bills on insurance, competition and
counterfeit goods were developed and submitted to the Ministry of Legal Affairs for
legislative procedures. In addition, a trade and investment policy document was drafted
and submitted to the Council of Ministers. Implementation of this sub-component was
slow to start since the hiring of consultants was fraught with difficulties – there were
several delays in procurement owing to lack adequate responses to job advertisements
and protracted salary and other negotiations.
40.    The MCII decided to use the services of the IFC/FIAS to manage the sub-
component dealing with the creation of a structured and regular public-private dialogue.
The South Sudan Business Forum (SSBF) was established in January 2009, after a few
delays in recruitment of staff, and was officially launched by the President of South
Sudan a few months later. Owing to uncertainty in funding, there was high staff turnover
by the end of the project. A MoU between the Government and the private sector to



8
     The MOLACD clearance requirements included reviewing all government contracts above US$ 20,000,
     contracts to be signed by consultants at MOLACD offices (requiring the former to travel to Juba), and
     fees of US$ 750 for reviewing contracts.

     See ISR 7, dated March 2011.
10
     The global financial crisis led to a drop in oil prices, and this affected the Government’s oil revenues
     and subsequently its contribution to the project.


                                                      11
establish the legal structure and secretariat has been signed and the details are to be
finalized in March, 2013.
41.     The implementation of the sub-component dealing with catalyzing
entrepreneurship was brisk. Applications to the Business Plan Competition (BPC) were
received in the first half of 2008, and the proposals were evaluated, short-listed applicants
trained, and by October 2009, 45 winners were selected and awards were made starting
early 2010. The Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) Sudan Ltd 11 was the financial
intermediary for the grants, which were provided as loans with a 4 percent rate of
interest. On the successful repayment of the principal and the interest, the BPC winners
had the option of opting for another loan at the same rate of interest (which was very
competitive compared to market rates) or the funds were to be made available as a grant.
There were delays regarding the disbursement of funds, and this was particularly
problematic for those BPC winners who were in the agri-business sector and dealt with
seasonal produce.
42.     The fourth sub-component was aimed at developing an M&E system for the PSD
Directorate to monitor the performance of the private sector. After several delays, a
private firm was awarded the contract in January 2009. Implementation of this sub-
component was slow. Quality of staff at the firm was variable, and turnover was high,
which slowed down the rate of ownership and take-up of the M&E framework within the
MCII. After pressure from the PSD Directorate and from the supervision missions,
implementation picked up towards the end of the project.
Component 2: Establishing Commercially-Viable Microfinance Institutions
43.    This component was managed by the Bank of Southern Sudan (BOSS) and
implementation was generally brisk once procurement issues were dealt with. There were
a number of delays in the recruitment of the senior policy advisor for microfinance, and
while the draft of the microfinance bill was finalized in May 2011, the bill continues to
languish with the BOSS for review and onward submission to the Council of Ministers.
44.     BOSS held a pilot round of microfinance competitions in February 2008, and
provided training and loan capital to a number of MFIs. At the same time, the Frankfurt
School of Management and Finance was selected to manage the South Sudan
Microfinance Development Facility and began operations in April 2009. The new board
of the SSMDF met for the first time in June of the same year, and assumed oversight of
the microfinance competition. Apart from the provision of capital and training to MFIs,
the SSMDF has also been active in stimulating demand for its services in several states
and continues to provide a number of resources to MFIs.
Component 3: Building Industrial Capacity
45.     The third component was implemented by the Ministry of Industry. A private
consulting firm was contracted to carry out an analysis of industrial competitiveness. The
final report, based on detailed sector-based surveys, was submitted in April 2011 on three

11
     Henceforth referred to as KCB.


                                             12
competitiveness clusters12, and was considered highly relevant and useful. A different
private sector consulting firm was contracted to provide technical assistance for capacity
building in mining and submitted its final draft of the legal and regulatory framework in
January 2011. This framework led to the draft of the mining bill, which was submitted to
Parliament at the end of the project and which became law in November 2012.
46.    The sub-components associated with policy support to the Directorate of Industry
(within the MCII) and to the private sector, and the development of the market for
business services was managed by UNIDO (the contract was signed in May 2008).
Implementation was poor – there were a number of delays and shortcomings in the
procurement of goods and personnel, capacity building to the private sector was sorely
lacking and the market for business services was not developed. There were also serious
concerns regarding record-keeping of financial disbursements13.
Component 4: Marketing System Development
47.     This component was implemented by the Ministry of Finance in the Government
of the Central Equatoria State (CES). The land lease was signed between the Bari
community and the CES Government in October 2008 14 . However, early on in the
project, it had already become clear that additional funding would be required for this
component, owing to costs of landscaping, construction and service costs being vastly
under-appraised during project design15. A contract was signed with Newtech Industrial
and Engineering in March 2009, and the firm submitted the final designs for the
wholesale market, including design of legal tender for public-private bidding, by October
2010, after which no new activities were undertaken under this component.
Component 5: Project Management
48.     The project encountered a number of delays in procurement at the start. This was
partly owing to weak capacity of the MOLACD with regard to the clearance of finalized
contracts, and partly owing to problems in finding skilled consultants and firms given the
difficult post-conflict operating environment and resources allocated. Since necessary
personnel, such as the project coordinator, financial management specialists were not
hired early on16, this led to slow implementation in the first two years of the project. With
the hiring of the project coordinator, implementation picked up speed 2009 onwards. In
addition, the project office block was constructed and office furniture, equipment and
computers were delivered in a timely fashion. Project disbursements were also managed




12
     Livestock, cereals and high-value fruits and vegetables.
13
     For instance, payments were made to the University of Juba for English-language training services
     without any formal contracts.
14
     The PIU did not submit a report documenting the consultations of the CES with the Bari Community for
     the land lease arrangement.
15
     See Aide Memoire 5 (August 2008)
16
     Offers made were turned down due to higher salaries being paid elsewhere in the country. In fact wages
     in South Sudan were three time higher than in neighboring Uganda.


                                                    13
well, initially by a private accounting firm and later by the Project Financial Management
Unit at the MoF17.
2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

49.     M&E Design and Implementation: The outcome indicators chosen by the team in
the original Final Project Proposal were in line with the PDO. However, the project
design did not factor in the extent to which data requirements and collection would be a
challenge in an environment as difficult as the one in South Sudan. Each of the outcome
indicators required data to be collected on an annual basis to be able to track year-on-year
progress. With the exception of the first component, no M&E system was built into the
design of the project so as to collect and track the required data on a regular basis. While
an attempt was made to include M&E activities within individual consultant TORs, no
guidance or resources were provided in a systematic way for continuous monitoring. In
addition, the 27 intermediate indicators chosen in the original Final Project Proposal were
far too many, and again some of these required continuous data collection. The second
project restructuring simplified the outcome and the number of intermediate indicators,
which provided for much better monitoring and evaluation of the project, while at the
same time continuing to reflect the original PDOs.
50.     M&E Utilization: The use of the M&E framework was adequate during the
project period for the first component but not sustainable beyond. The M&E system
designed by the contracting firm for the first component did a passable job, but not
enough ownership was built within the MCII to continue these activities beyond the
lifetime of the project. During the lifetime of the project baseline data on the new
outcome indicators was collected and progress monitored by the different PIUs to the
best of their capacity. However, in the absence of a focused approach and lack of
dedicated personnel to monitor and track, data collection was sporadic and limited to
when resources could be made available. For example, while it was easier to track
progress of policy drafts and the movement of bills, data on the BPC winners was not
always available18. The SSMDF collected information on the portfolios of the MFIs it
provided resources to, but data on how final beneficiaries used the microfinance loans
was not collected by the individual MFIs themselves.
2.4       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

51.     There were no safeguard issues under the project since the fourth component
relating to the construction of the wholesale market did not take place.
52.    With regards to procurement, the project dealt mainly with the selection of
consultants and the purchase of some goods, furniture and vehicles. The project was in

17
     In fact, at the request of the Project Financial Management Unit, the ceiling in the Designated Account
     was increased from US$ 0.6 million to US$ 1.5 million so as to cover the increased pace of payments.
18
     The Kenya Commercial Bank was meant to systematically track the progress of the BPC winners over
     time, but it failed to do so owing to (a) the high costs of transport which made it difficult to monitor
     those who were based away from the big cities, and (b) the lack of mobile communications for several
     BPC winners.


                                                     14
compliance with Bank guidelines, although the lack of a dedicated procurement specialist
within the project did lead to a number of delays, and the private agent contracted to
handle procurement did not perform well. For instance, the quality of documenting and
technical evaluation reports was low and additional information had to be requested.
There were some issues with contract management that reflected the low capacity of the
project unit, for instance, cash was paid out in advance for some purchases. Delays in the
recruitment of consultants were explained by the difficulties in attracting talented firms
and persons to a post-conflict environment. This was especially problematic since the
resources budgeted were far from adequate – for instance, the difference in salary for
technical assistants in South Sudan versus those working in Uganda were three-to-one.
Although the project took into account the post-conflict environment, it vastly
underestimated the true costs of procurement.
53.      Throughout the life of the project good financial management systems were
maintained. The overall risk rating for the project was moderate owing to the mix of
inherent and control risk, wherein the former was substantial but the latter was low since
the Project Financial Management Unit was in place and staffed with skilled personnel.
Quarterly Interim Financial Reports and annual audits were done in a timely manner. In
addition, on-site supervision missions were conducted once a year and desk review of
activities was undertaken on a continuous basis19. FM ratings were satisfactory and this
was true of all ISRs. A pooled account was maintained with counterpart funds and this
was also well managed – monthly financial statements were prepared, withdrawal
applications were done in a timely manner and at no point were project activities stifled
because of a lack of funds. Disbursements were slow at the start but then picked up and
were at 100 percent at project closing.
2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

54.      Most of the activities implemented under the MDTF-SS Private Sector
Development Project have continued under the South Sudan Transition Trust Fund
(SSTTF) Private Sector Development Project, which became effective a few months after
the closure of the MDTF project. The project team extended much time and effort in mid
to late-2010 to procure funding from the oversight committee for continuation of
activities under the next phase. The SSTTF project continues to support the private and
financial sectors through the Business Plan Competition, the South Sudan Microfinance
Development Facility, and the South Sudan Business Forum. The project has retained
most of its core staff, proving the required continuity to facilitate project implementation.
Lastly, the MCII and the project continue to monitor the progress of the policies and bills
developed under the MDTF project, communicating through the Ministry's management
when follow up is required with other government entities.




19
     This was also facilitated by having the FM specialist in the field, which provided easy access and
     support to the project on troubleshooting issues.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

Relevance of Objectives: High

55.     Private sector development remains a constitutional objective for the Government
of South Sudan, particularly since it gained independence in 2011. The PDO of
establishing an enabling environment for private sector development and increasing
formal sector employment was, and remains, a significant development priority for South
Sudan. A key lesson of post-conflict experience in Africa is that peace and security must
be cemented by economic opportunity. The Joint Assessment Mission also stated that
promoting private sector development was central to the challenge of sustainable peace
and development. Indeed, the wealth-sharing provisions of the 2005 Comprehensive
Peace Agreement strongly echo the message that peace would be undermined if there
were insufficient opportunities for employment.
56.     Not only were the objectives highly relevant at the time of project design, they
continue to remain relevant now and in the near future. The World Bank’s Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) FY13-1420 for South Sudan is informed by the Bank’s strategy in
Africa, which calls for the building of economic resilience and competitiveness in post-
conflict countries and by the “New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States21?. It includes
the creation of an enabling environment for the private sector to generate jobs and
economic opportunities as one of the critical development tasks that will be needed in the
future. In addition, the South Sudan Development Plan 2011-13, which clearly articulates
the Government’s priorities, states as one of its main objectives “Diversified private
sector-led economic growth and sustainable development which improves livelihoods
and reduces poverty?. Thus, the relevance of the project objectives, then and now,
remains very high.
Relevance of Design: Modest
57.     As mentioned in Section 2, the design of the project was underpinned by
comprehensive evaluations and reviews with a range of stakeholders. The four
components of the project reflected the PDO and the core interventions had a clear causal
relationship with the intended outcomes. Specifically, component 3 (building industrial
capacity) and component 4 (marketing system development) were focused on the first
part of the PDO, i.e. developing an enabling environment for private sector development.
The different sub-components of components 1 and 2 (trade and investment policy


20
     See here: link.
21
     The “New Deal? Initiative was announced in November 2011 where the G7+ group of 19 fragile and
     conflict-affected countries (including South Sudan), development partners and international
     organizations endorsed an agreement on a new global direction for engagement with fragile states.



                                                  16
framework and establishing commercially-viable microfinance institutions) focused on
the second part of the PDO, to increase formal employment and also on the enabling
environment.
58.     The interventions were clearly linked to outputs and outcomes. For instance, the
grants provided by the BPC targeted mostly mid-size start-ups, while the loans provided
by the microfinance institutions targeted small businesses, both of which were aimed at
generating employment and providing opportunities to South Sudanese entrepreneurs.
The relevance of the design was also apparent given that the activities of other partners,
such as the IFC, were closely intertwined with the MDTF-funded sub-components. In
addition, the design of the project wherein the PCU oversaw the activities of the different
PIUs, helped in coordination and lower transaction costs for the client.
59.     However, while the project design recognized the weak capacity of the
Government and the nature of the post-conflict operating environment, insufficient
attention was paid to some of the details which led to a few problems during
implementation. The design could have considered the degree of cost escalations and
might have closely assessed the difficulties faced in other post-conflict settings, and the
impact on procurement and implementation arrangements. Also, although capacity
building was built into each component of the project, a more careful assessment of the
capacity of the implementing institutions should have been carried out well in advance.
60.     Notwithstanding these design issues, it should be recognized that the situation in
South Sudan at the time of project design was extraordinarily difficult. The region had
been in the midst of conflict and turmoil for almost five decades. In fact, the region was
in the process of putting in place the institutions for a newly-independent country. There
were political economy pressures on the project team to aim for the highest objectives in
a war-torn region and client expectations were high. At the same time, there was little or
no infrastructure or professional capacity on the ground. As Section 3.2 will detail, this
was an extremely high risk environment wherein the opportunities for returns on
investment were also very high.
Relevance of Implementation: Substantial

61.     There were several delays in the implementation of the project, as described in
Section 2.2, and the life of the project was extended by 12 months by two separate project
restructurings. As noted, the design of the project under-estimated the difficulties of
operating in a post-conflict environment, and in particular of finding skilled consultants
and personnel to run the PCU. In spite of these problems, implementation accelerated in
2009, disbursements picked up, and the project was able to meet almost all of the core
and intermediate targets.
62.     The Bank’s implementation support was responsive to changing needs. For
instance, additional funds from the Gender Action Plan were tapped to provide 25
additional women with grants through the BPC sub-component. Similarly, the client and
project teams demonstrated flexibility by shifting resources from activities that were no
longer enthusiastically supported. For example, once it became clear that the project
design had vastly under-estimated the costs of constructing the wholesale market,


                                            17
resources were moved to other components. Thus the team was flexible enough and
willing to invest more where there was success and to pull back where there was less
ownership or readiness. In addition, the 2011 project restructuring put in place better, and
more-readily measurable, indicators to track progress.
3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

63.     A solid case can be made that the project substantially achieved its development
objective to develop an enabling environment for private sector growth and to sustainably
increase formal sector employment. These achievements are remarkable given the post-
conflict landscape in which the project was designed and implemented. Even in the
capital city, Juba, there was little or no infrastructure (especially transport, housing and
power); buildings to house government ministries were in the process of being
constructed, and legal and regulatory structures were lacking. At the same time, MDTF
projects were to be ambitious and expedient in the face of political expectations,
especially those of the client.
Develop an enabling environment for private sector growth

PDO indicators:
     The number of businesses registered in South Sudan
     Streamlined number of steps to register a business
Intermediate results indicators:
    ≠ Microfinance policy is presented to Cabinet
     Public-Private Dialogue Forum is established
    ≠ M&E Systems are functioning and regularly updated by the MCII
    ≠ Laws to improve the enabling environment for business are presented to Cabinet
     South Sudan Microfinance Development Facility is established
     Industrial competitiveness strategy is completed
     Mining Act and supporting regulations are developed
     Staff of the MCII and MEM are trained
     Design of the wholesale market is completed

64.     The first part of the PDO was attained as reflected by the achievement of the two
associated PDO indicators, and most of the intermediate outcome indicators. The
achievement of these two PDO indicators can be directly attributed to project activities.
Indeed, the achievement of the first indicator follows from the achievement of the
second, wherein streamlining the steps to register a business in South Sudan led to a rise
in the number of formal registrations.
65.      At the project outset, registering a business required dealing with four different
levels of government in South Sudan. Indeed, after the SSBF was created in 2009, one of
the first issues raised was the simplification of steps to register a business. The issue was
discussed in working groups, composed of private and public stakeholders, and was
discussed with the Ministries of Finance, Justice and Commerce, leading to the drafting



                                             18
and enacting of bills into law22 dealing directly with business entry. The procedure to set
up and register a business was accordingly streamlined 23 (PDO outcome) as a direct
result of the consultations held as part of the public-private forum (intermediate output)
established by project activities. The streamlining of procedures and the growth in the
number of registrations is noteworthy given that it was a product of World Bank and IFC
activities working in tandem, wherein the former contributed to the setting up of the
forum and the latter to funding procedural activities 24 . While the meteoric rise in
registrations (from 44 in 2006 to over 10,784 in February 2012) was facilitated by the
easing of procedures and the setting up of a business registry (currently maintained by the
Ministry of Justice and funded by the IFC), most of the increase25 can also be attributed
to special grain import declarations by the Government in 2008, which allowed only
registered companies to be awarded contracts. However, although the increase in
business registrations might have been driven by exogenous changes in regulations, the
project was directly responsible for facilitating the development of an enabling
environment for formal private sector growth.
66.     Project inputs and activities also led directly to outputs in the form of drafts of
policies and bills. However, as the non-achievement of 3 out of 9 of the intermediate
outcome indicators shows, some of these outputs have not yet resulted in laws. A notable
achievement is the Mining Bill that is now law, and whose main tenets were drafted
under component 3. Owing to the presence of and the dependence on natural resources,
this was a crucially important piece of legislation for South Sudan. However, other bills
are yet to be submitted to Cabinet and are not yet enacted. The delay is attributed to a
lack of a champion in Government to make sure that the bill goes through Parliament.
This can be attributed partly to the long list of bills and policies waiting to be approved
by the Parliament, and partly to the frequent changes of key staff at the ministerial level
and offices. For the time being, these bills continue to be debated and modified within
different parts of Government.
67.     The need for these bills arose from consultations with private and public sector
actors while the project was being implemented using the SSBF as a setting for
discussion. However, the project could have firstly, ascertained whether there was strong
interest in codifying these into law; secondly, identify the types of legal provisions that
different actors were willing to support; and finally it might have facilitated a process to
bring together all the actors that were necessary to design the bill and enact it into law.




22
     These included the Companies Act, Partnerships Act, Limited Partnerships Act and Business Names
     Act.
23
     It now takes 24 hours to register a business in South Sudan.
24
     The IFC provided consultants and paid their fees, while the World Bank financed operational expenses,
     including staff salaries.
25
     The rate of growth of business registrations a month jumped from approximately 1 percent to 13 percent
     from 2007 to 2008, and strongly continued thereafter.


                                                    19
Only then would it have been eminently within the scope of project activities that a law
that would have been passable would have been drafted26.
68.     Some of the intermediate indicators deal with the setting up of institutions and
how well they function. In this, there have been some notable successes. The SSBF has
served very efficiently as a forum to facilitate public-private dialogue, especially through
the creation of sector and issue-specific working groups, which in turn have led to a
number of reform initiatives being discussed and enacted. Indeed, the institution is
engaged at the level of Parliament and no bills that might impact the private sector can be
concluded without consultations with the SSBF The SSMDF continues to be a
sustainable 27 institution and is formidable in its ability to provide loan capital and
technical assistance to MFIs in South Sudan. For example, a number of microfinance
lenders interviewed during the ICR missions praised the regular training activities
provided by the SSMDF, and the technical assistance provided to enable these providers
to increase efficiency was also found to be very useful28. The SSMDF also monitors the
performance of MFIs and given the lack of an approved microfinance policy, it serves as
a crucial link between the Bank of South Sudan and the MFI market in South Sudan.
69.      The M&E systems developed within the MCII were not functioning well at the
time of the ICR mission, owing to lack of resources and adequate numbers of trained
staff. While some staff within the Commerce and Mining Ministries were well-trained,
any sustainable impact on the enabling environment would require a much wider range of
technical assistance interventions in light of the weak capacity in most government
institutions. And lastly, the design of the wholesale market was well received, and indeed
the original design of the component raised much awareness, expectations and excitement
and continues to remain relevant. However, owing to the lack of funds, and without a
central-state government cost and revenue sharing arrangement, the possibility of a
private-public partnership for the construction of the market seems improbable at this
stage.
Sustainably increase formal employment

PDO indicators:
   Formal employment by the enterprises supported by the BPC loans
  ≠ Growth in the number of clients served by MFIs
   People with access to finance through targeted MFIs and BPC
   People with access to finance through targeted MFIs and BPC of which the
       beneficiaries are female


26
    Part of the problem was the cross-cutting nature of private sector development, which required
    coordination across ministries to champion the proposed bills. An effective steering committee could
    have served this function.
27
   Sustainability here refers to the high demand for the services of the institution and to a competent and
    well-functioning staff. However, given the lack of government funds and a substantial private sector, the
    ability of the institution to survive without donor assistance would be tenuous for another few years.
28
    In particular, one of the MFIs, FSL, mentioned how the technical assistance provided by the SSMDF
    helped them to identify the loopholes within their business model and helped them to build a healthy
    portfolio.


                                                     20
Intermediate results indicators:
     Number of businesses supported through BPC
     Number of new MFIs operational
    ≠    Number of loans by gender
    ≠    Value of loans by gender
    ≠    Portfolio at risk (microfinance)

70.     For second part of the PDO, that dealing with increasing formal employment, 3
out of 4 of the PDO indicators were met. Formal direct employment created by the
enterprises exceeded 148 workers in May, 2012 29 , far above the target value of 40
workers. In fact, the impact of the BPC grants went far beyond the creation of formal
jobs. According to a BPC Beneficiary Analysis conducted in March 2011, the firms
indirectly benefitted communities in which they were operating, through the provision of
financial credit, seeds and farming equipment, medical supplies, and through support to
widows, orphans and students.
71.      The remaining three PDO indicators reflect the number of clients served by the
MFIs, and the number of persons with access to finance, disaggregated by gender, either
through targeted MFIs or through the BPC30. The total number of clients of MFIs that
were given loan capital by the SSMDF31 was 30,487 (of which almost three-fourths were
women). While, the SSMDF did not account for the entire loan portfolio of these
institutions, it can be argued that the impact of the project went far beyond the provision
of capital. Project activities provided the first tranche of funding to the largest MFIs in
the country (which accounted for 98 percent of the market). In addition, the SSMDF,
when it took over from the Bank of Southern Sudan, became a vehicle to stimulate the
growth of microfinance through state-level knowledge visits, trainings and meetings. It
also continues to provide technical assistance to most mid-sized and large MFIs in South
Sudan on a regular basis. Notwithstanding these gains, the target value of 39,000 clients
served by MFIs was not met at the time of closing, although the number of clients served
by MFIs totaled 46,701 in October 2011 (see ISR 8 dated December, 2011). This was
because BRAC, one of the largest MFIs with over 25,000 clients and which received US$
0.2 million in funding from the SSMDF, had to write off 60 percent of its portfolio in
mid-2011. There were no systemic reasons behind the default, and BRAC’s misfortune
was a result of the collapse of Nile Commercial Bank that handled its deposits32.




29
     See BPC Awardees Monitoring and Progress Evaluation Report. The figure of 148 is based on a sample
     of 16 BPC winners who were interviewed and in all probability constitutes a very low base for the
     actual number of formal jobs created.
30
     Growth in the number of clients refers to the total number of MFI clients within South Sudan. People
     with access to finance refer to those who received funding as a direct result of project activities and
     funds.
31
     The SSMDF disbursed a total of US$ 1.6 million to 6 MFIs from 2008 to 2012.
32
     There was no deposit insurance system at the time, and these accounts were BRAC’s microfinance
     program operational accounts. The MFI is now trying to recover some of the losses following up
     aggressively with the Nile Commercial Bank, the Bank of South Sudan and the GRSS.


                                                     21
72.     The number of persons who took out loans33 and who were direct beneficiaries of
the project totaled 8,499 at project closing, of which 62.5 percent were women. Targeted
MFI clients are a sub-set of total MFI clients, and the ratio of targeted clients to total
clients equals the ratio of SSMDF loan capital to total capital 34 . These numbers far
surpass the target values for the PDO indicators. Workshops conducted with beneficiaries
during the ICR mission also revealed the different ways in which these micro-loans have
helped to lift families out of poverty, for instance, by helping small businesses start,
recover or grow, by creating credit histories for previously un-banked persons and by
encouraging savings habits, especially among women. In addition, the MFI clients
received basic financial management and business skills’ training along with the loan
capital, assistance which many considered crucial in their ability to use the loan amounts
wisely.
73.     While the link between the jobs created by the BPC sub-component is clear, it
could be argued that the link between micro-finance loans and the PDO is not obvious.
This argument assumes that formal employment could mean employment created by
formal firms or employment that is accompanied by formal benefits, such as salaries and
other benefits. In this case, given the post-conflict nature of the environment, the PDO
could be interpreted to mean that people were employed on a full-time and productive
basis, and not on an informal or part-time basis. Given this definition, it is clear that the
jobs created by the microfinance loans were mostly of an entrepreneurial nature, although
there is no data on how many of these were formally registered if at all. A number of
people were gainfully employed as entrepreneurs and they were part of the system in that
their businesses maintained accounts, handled cash, hired employees and maintained
credit histories. For more details on the microfinance market and its impact as gleaned
from focus group meetings and interviews conducted on the ICR mission, see Box 1.
74.      The intermediate results indicators refer mostly to the extent to which project
activities have impacted entrepreneurial opportunities within South Sudan. The number
of businesses supported by the BPC totaled 45, as envisaged by the target. The support
provided by the project went far beyond just the provision of capital. For example, the
shortlisted applicants were provided with a two-week long training on different aspects of
business management (finance, record keeping, human resources management, etc),
which was rated as very useful and which led to improvements in the functioning of start-
ups and of existing businesses . The BPC winners have also acquired credit histories and
would be in a position to access loans with the KCB and other commercial banks in the
future.




33
     45 of the total number (of which 25 were women) were the BPC winners who took out loans with the
     Kenya Commercial Bank. The remainder took out loans with different MFIs.
34
     Take the example of the MFI called Rural Finance Initiative (RUFI). The SSMDF accounted for 43
     percent of RUFI’s total loan portfolio. Thus, the number of people (women) that were targeted through
     project activities and with access to finance equals 43 percent of RUFI’s total number of clients (female
     clients), i.e. 43 percent of 1,942 (1,126), which equals 837 (485).


                                                      22
                             Box 1: Microfinance in South Sudan and the Project
     The environment for credit in South Sudan is unlike any other. Owing to nearly five decades of
     conflict, a large part of the population is nomadic. The poor lack basic business skills and training and
     have little knowledge of dealing with credit institutions. The country is sparsely populated and
     transport and communications infrastructure is abysmal, while the security situation remains tenuous.
     To add to this dispiriting mix of challenges, because of their experience with the donor community the
     South Sudanese associate foreign institutions with aid and hand-outs that do not need to be repaid,
     leading to skewed expectations.
     To survive and flourish in this environment, microfinance institutions have had to wield a variety of
     techniques. A substantial part of their time and resources is spent in familiarizing people with the idea
     of credit, imparting basic accounting skills and regular capacity building for their staff members. In
     addition to financial capital, the SSMDF has provided extensive capacity building to a number of MFIs
     and their staff in this regard. Most MFIs loans are in the form of group or community loans, wherein
     the members are jointly responsible for regular repayments in the absence of any collateral. The
     average loan size tends to be small (USD 200) and repayments are made on a weekly basis. MFIs tend
     to focus their activities in select geographical areas since the cost of monitoring activities is high (fixed
     addresses and mobile phones are rare), and the relationship between the loan officer (who is usually
     local and speaks the language) and the clients is crucial.
     The impact of MFI activities has been enormously encouraging. Typically, loans are taken by small
     groups of households, often by women, who use the money to pay school fees, and for building small
     businesses. While there are examples of start-ups failing, sometimes owing to health-related shocks to
     income, a large proportion have prospered and have graduated to individual loans. There is demand for
     asset loans with longer repayment periods, for investments in building, machinery and vehicles. For
     instance, one community used a proportion of the micro loans to build school buildings and employ
     teachers. In short, the market for microfinance has contributed to the growth of a nascent private sector
     and directly alleviated household and community-level poverty.


75.    The total number of MFIs operational in South Sudan increased from 4 in 2007 to
over 10 in 2012. While the increase in the number cannot be held directly attributable to
the project, an average of 20 percent of the loan portfolio of the earliest and the largest
MFI players in the market came from the project. The SSMDF also helped stimulate the
demand for microfinance loans by spreading information about the activities of MFIs and
by providing training to local personnel hired by different MFIs.
76.     The project did not meet entirely the targets for the number and value of loans by
gender. While the number of loans to both men and women fell short of the targets, the
value of loans to women far exceeded the target. The overall shortfall for the number of
loans is partially explained by the writing off of BRAC’s portfolio. However, a number
of other problems plagued the microfinance market, most of which were related to the
difficult operating environment35 and which were outside of project control.
77.    The project targeted an acceptable level of portfolio at risk (PAR) at 12 percent
for microfinance institutions. This figure is what is considered minimally acceptable in




35
     For example, the MFI SUMI lost a large part of its portfolio when the Government decided to destroy
     squatter settlements in Juba at short notice. In addition, resumption of hostilities, high rates of inflation
     and non-payment of salaries have lowered the rates of new loans since 2012.


                                                         23
the long run and so anything above this would imply unsustainable levels of risk36. The
weighted PAR as of June 2012 was 14.71 percent, higher than the acceptable limit.
However, the weighted PAR is driven by a single outlier, i.e. by the extremely high risk
of BRAC’s portfolio (61 percent). If BRAC is excluded, the weighted PAR for the
remaining MFIs is at 8.83 percent, much below the limit.
78.     The indicators measuring performance of the microfinance component were
numerous, and the ones measuring the number and performance of all MFIs run the risk
of conflating project impact with exogenous trends. However, the indicators were also
targeted at measuring different aspects of the development of the microfinance market in
South Sudan. In the absence of any real MFI market at the start of the project and with
the setting of the SSMDF to build capacity across all MFIs, it could be argued that these
indicators were worth measuring to track the performance of the project. The very large
number of indicators did preclude regular data collection and subsequent monitoring.


3.3       Efficiency

Rating: Modest

79.     The Final Project Proposal included economic and financial analysis for the
wholesale market component only, as the remainder of the project focused mainly on
technical assistance. Since the wholesale market was not constructed due to lack of funds
the analysis is no longer applicable, and alternative considerations are used to
substantiate the different aspects of project efficiency. The rating is based on an analysis
of the component cost breakdown provided in Annex 1.
80.      The final costs at project closure were US$ 10.62 million37, which, at the outset,
compare favorably with the estimated costs of US$ 11.05 million at appraisal. Despite
these financial results there were some changes over the life of the project which raises
value-for-money concerns. Of the original cost estimate, US$ 6.78 million were to come
from MDTF funds, and US$ 4.27 million were to be contributed by the GRSS. However,
GRSS was only able to contribute US$ 0.6 million, and additional funding had to be
secured from the MDTF, whose final contribution totaled US$ 10.02 million.
Importantly, since the wholesale market was not constructed, about 94 percent of the
funds from that component were re-allocated to other components, all of which faced
high cost overruns. In particular, the costs of the different consultancies were much
higher than what had originally been budgeted for. Given the project’s reliance on
multiple consultancies, efficiency was affected not only by monetary costs but also by



36
     The 30-days past due PAR below 5 percent is considered as a low default risk (excellent performance),
     while anything between 11-13 percent is considered relatively risky (weaknesses can be remedied
     within the normal development of business). Anything above 15 percent is considered unsustainably
     risky (the institution is having fundamental problems). See Management Information Systems for
     Microfinance Institutions, by Charles Waterfield and Nick Ramsing, Consultative Group to Assist the
     Poorest, 1998.
37
     US$ 10.02 million from the MDTF, and US$ 0.60 million from the GRSS.


                                                     24
substantial transaction costs accrued through the length of time required to meet
procurement procedures and fill the positions 38 . While some of these consultancies
tapped important expertise and contributed greatly to the project objectives, some did not
provide a good return on investments.
81.     Notwithstanding these issues and the unrealistic budget assumptions, the project
funding did yield significant achievements. Laws targeting the business environment in
South Sudan have made it easier for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to start
operations and increased access to finance has helped many entrepreneurs to grow their
businesses. This has led to a discernible and direct impact on the ability of the private
sector to rely on its own for growth and employment. Institutions like the SSBF and the
SSMDF have fostered better working relationships between the public and the private
sectors, especially with regard to policy consultations. In addition the project also
leveraged Bank and other development partner resources. The best illustration of this was
the close collaboration with the IFC with regard to the public-private dialogue, a
partnership which continues to bear fruit with regard to successive laws being enacted
after consultations within the SSBF. In addition, the project team tapped resources from
trust funds and partner initiatives such as the Gender Action Plan. All these outcomes
bode well for the economic return of the project.
82.     The final costs relating to project management were over four times the appraisal
estimates, i.e. US$ 2.21 million, compared to the estimated US$ 0.52 million. The big
difference can be explained by the costs of hiring trained personnel and operating costs
far outstripping those budgeted at the time of appraisal. This problem was systemic
across different projects operating around the same time in South Sudan, owing to the
post-conflict nature of the environment39. The cost of construction of the office block
(US$ 0.38 million), purchasing of motor-vehicles, office furniture and maintenance was
also included in this component, which had not been planned for in the project design.
83.     While the final disbursement figure was 100 percent, amounts totaling
approximately US$ 0.18 million were cancelled since they were not spent. This was
owing to changes in the exchange rate, and also because some of the operating cost
reimbursable funds were not used by some of the consultants. Based on ICR mission
interviews, there were no outliers observed in terms of recognized norms for
consultancies or training. Total Bank administrative costs for project supervision (not
including ICR preparation) were US$ 1.17 million, which equaled US$ 0.23 million
annually on average. This is over twice the Africa regional average, which can be
explained the intensive level of supervision in a fragile country with very weak capacity,
the number and costs of missions, and the recruitment of full-time staff in the country
office to facilitate close interaction and follow-up with the client.


38
     Indeed, in a number of cases, a candidate or firm would be shortlisted for the position, only to turn
     down the offer.
39
     Other projects that were operating around the same time and that had to make amendments to the
     original budget and to the allocation of funds across components to suit the realities of project
     management and implementation were the Core Fiduciary Systems Support Project (TF56336,
     TF97653), the Umbrella Health Project (TF96243) and the Rapid Impact Emergency Project (TF55976).


                                                    25
84.     It bears repetition that all of these achievements took place in an extremely
demanding post-conflict environment, where costs, not just of procurement, but also of
transportation, housing and services were very high. Not only did these lead to cost
escalations but also delays, as the project team had to re-visit budgets and considerable
resources went into negotiating contracts. Given the resources at hand, and the time and
effort involved in using these efficiently to produce outputs and outcomes, the
achievements are especially remarkable.
3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. This takes into account the
substantial relevance of objectives, design and implementation at the time of design as
well as at completion, the substantial achievement of project development objectives, and
modest project efficiency. The above factors have been elaborated in Section 3 of this
ICR, and provide the main justification for the rating. The project receives a moderately
satisfactory rating mainly because of modest relevance of design and modest efficiency in
the use of resources. This constitutes a “moderate? shortcoming in the project
achievement and hence justifies the rating, according to evaluation criteria for ICRs.
3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

86.      The overarching impact on poverty for the project as a whole is difficult to assess,
since no social impact study was conducted at the time of appraisal, making it impossible
to measure the post-project impact. However, an attempt was made during the ICR
mission to qualitatively assess anecdotal evidence for particular project components. The
support provided to MFIs in South Sudan through SSMDF in the form of loan capital had
a direct impact on some of the poorest social groups in South Sudan, the majority of them
women. Meetings conducted with beneficiaries of different MFIs during the ICR mission
revealed the extent to which micro-loans had enabled entrepreneurs, especially women,
to start small businesses and save money for reinvestment, or for social expenditures such
as school fees, health and food consumption. A number of MFIs rely on community and
group-based lending models (in particular BRAC lends only to women) and this led to
large spillovers within the local community. For instance, one group of women in Kajo-
keji (a small town near Juba) used a small proportion of the funds to pay for salaries for
school teachers.
87.     The project also mobilized funding from the Gender Action Plan to provide 25
women with grants under the BPC sub-component. The additional funds also helped
these grant-winners to set up a women’s entrepreneurs association, which continues to
function as an independent body, facilitating business contacts and knowledge exchange
across businesswomen in South Sudan. In addition, while this was not the intention of the
project, almost 69 percent of the total loans by the MFIs were made to women. And
although, there was no data collected on the breakdown of job created by gender,


                                             26
anecdotal evidence based on ICR interviews and focus group meetings suggests that
female entrepreneurs tended to run service-sector businesses (such as restaurants and
hotels) and a majority of the staff hired were female40.
(b)       Institutional Change/Strengthening

88.      A number of project activities were geared towards building capacity within
different ministries – Commerce and Industry, Mining and Industry. In particular, under
Component 3, i.e. building industrial capacity, many staff were trained in information
technology and project management skills. In addition, M&E training was provided to the
team in-charge of maintaining these systems for the MCII in the future. While there was a
discernible, short-term impact of these project activities on the functioning of the
institutions, it remains to be seen if this impact will continue to spillover to others in the
medium and long-term.


3.6       Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

89.     Three beneficiary focus group meetings were organized during the November-
December 2012 ICR mission. Two of these meetings focused on beneficiaries of MFI
loans, in Juba (7 participants) and in the town of Nimule (>40 participants), while the
third focused on the BPC winners (5 participants). The aim of the discussion was to gain
a clear understanding of how the provision of finance, either through micro-loans or
through business plan grants, and capacity building was perceived by the beneficiaries
and if there were any important issues that needed to be flagged.
90.     Participants in all three meetings recognized the importance of the technical
assistance and training that was provided along with the loans and grants, which was
instrumental in laying the foundations and skills for proper utilization of the funds. For
most of the participants, this was the very first experience of accessing credit and the
importance of their new credit histories was also highlighted. The BPC grantees
emphasized the need for better coordination between the central and state governments,
especially if the provision of finance was made to those in rural area. The MFI clients
highlighted the need for micro-savings and insurance products, and the need for better
assessment of assets and credit histories to make switching across different MFIs easier.
Annex 5 provides a detailed summary of the issues raised during the meetings and the
participants’ recommendations for the future.




40
     The high female statistics could also be a function of the post-conflict environment where many families
     lost the male breadwinner in years of war.


                                                     27
4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

91.    The risk to sustaining the project’s main accomplishments and development
outcomes is moderate, based on the following areas: capacity building within
Government (risk to longer-term impact: high), creation of new institutions (risk to
continuation of activities: moderate), and contribution to private-sector policy (risk to
changes in policy: negligible).
92.     The development of the enabling environment for the private sector and the
creation of employment remain high in the list of Government priorities. Thus, the risk to
changes in policy is negligible. In addition, there are a number of draft legislative bills
that are expected to become law, and which also directly impact the functioning of
markets, e.g. counterfeit goods, competition etc.
93.      The project also created new institutions, in particular the SSBF and the SSMDF.
Both institutions have shown themselves to be indispensable in the discharge of their
responsibilities – the SSBF to providing a forum for private-public discussions, and the
SSMDF as an institution to assist and monitor MFIs. The risk to the continuation of their
activities is moderate, mainly since there has been a shortfall in funding for the SSBF
after project closing and without proper legal status 41 there is some question of the
sustainability of its activities.
94.     Project activities also contributed to capacity building in existing institutions
within the Government. The risk to the longer-term impact of these activities is
significant. The numbers of staff trained under project activities are too few to
sustainably impact the functioning of these institutions over time, and in the absence of
enough spillovers, there is a risk that staff turnover might leave things virtually
unchanged.


5.        Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1       Bank Performance

(a)       Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

95.     The project design was anchored in a series of consultations and analyses. The
project objectives and the main activities as designed were consistent with the GRSS and
World Bank strategies. The project design also reflected a substantial level of strategic


41
     Currently, the SSBF lacks a clear legal structure, i.e. a functioning secretariat and board. An MoU
     between the private sector and the Government has been signed, but it needs to be passed by the MCII
     for the process of legalization to be completed.


                                                     28
relevance at the time of preparation, and the project continues to be relevant at the time of
ICR preparation. The design of the project included a broad range of activities, bringing
together many beneficiaries and institutions within Government. Significant attention was
paid to the fiduciary framework and to risk assessment.
96.    The quality at entry, however, is rated as moderately unsatisfactory given the
following shortcomings:

     The project would have benefitted from a much more careful consideration of the
      risks associated with the lack of in-country technical capacity and the Government’s
      readiness. Ideally, detailed comparisons with other post-conflict situations 42 with
      regard to the sorts of costs and difficulties associated with operational capacity and
      quality would have been useful.

     The implementation horizon of 18 months for the project (Phase 1) was quite
      unrealistic (also pointed out by the QAE review), given the difficulties on the ground
      and the complexities of the project. Phase 1 of the project, from approval to closing,
      lasted for 5 years.

     A more streamlined and incremental design would have been appropriate in the South
      Sudan setting. Starting with a few simple activities and using these as building blocks
      towards more complex activities may have been an approach to consider in the low
      capacity, high risk environment described.

     The choice of indicators at project design was inappropriate given the lack of data and
      baseline numbers. Accordingly, the results framework was modified in 2011 during
      project restructuring. There should have been more emphasis on M&E systems in the
      design of the project with more resources, money and personnel dedicated to
      monitoring.
97.     It should be noted that the context within which the project was designed was
quite exceptional. Some of the problems on the ground were similar to those in other
post-conflict environments in that there were problems of security and rapid escalation of
costs. But since South Sudan was a new country, and a region that had been devastated
by decades of war, it lacked basic infrastructures43, clear structures of government, with a
nomadic population and those of productive age involved in conflict. The relevance and
need for Bank assistance was high, but so were the pressures under which the team were
required to design and deliver an ambitious project. As noted by the 2013 ISN for South
Sudan, initial pledging events and aspirational rhetoric raised expectations and the MDTF



42
     For instance, project documents from Bank experience in West-Bank and Gaza, Afghanistan, East
     Timor could have been considered. However, South Sudan was unique in that this was a new country,
     with no previous institutional capacity or legacy and with little or no infrastructure, even with regard to
     the capital city – Juba.
43
     As detailed by the Interim Strategy Note for South Sudan, the infrastructure base is a small fraction of
     its neighbors and one of the lowest on earth. This applies to transport density, power generation and
     transmission and telecommunications infrastructure.


                                                       29
projects were loaded with mandates but were unprepared for the vast scale of problems.
These factors contributed to some of the deficiencies related to the quality at entry.


(b)       Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
98.     Supervision was conducted regularly with the number of missions per year,
varying between two to five a year44. Over the course of the project’s life, there were
three different TTLs, and there were no discontinuities in the dialogue with the
Government. The project benefited greatly from the fact that during implementation (and
almost all the way to project closing) the TTL was based in Khartoum ensuring close
interaction between the World Bank team and the PIU. The Aide Memoires from
supervision missions indicate that most missions were conducted as scheduled, that the
teams had a clear appreciation of the issues and the reports were thorough and candid in
their assessments. The Bank also took action when problems were identified in project
implementation, including those in procurement.
99.     In addition, the project was flexible in that it adjusted its need for time, resources
and other parameters as soon as it became clear that these problems needed to be dealt
with. For instance, as soon as the pace of implementation picked up and it was clear that
the original indicators were no longer feasible to measure, the project was restructured to
provide a clearer set of indicators to measure the impact of the project. The resources that
were allocated at the start proved to be insufficient for the post-conflict context and the
restructuring provided additional funds and time for better implementation.
100. However, there were some shortcomings that impacted the overall quality of Bank
supervision:

     The team disproportionately concentrated effort on issues related to procurement.
      This was necessary45 but the team should have focused similar effort on M&E (see
      Box 2 for the importance of monitoring). This could have been done by ensuring a
      clearer M&E framework and system for every component of the project and by
      designing the inclusion of a dedicated M&E officer in the PCU.

     ISR ratings seemingly reflected the achievements of outputs rather than outcomes.
      The IP ratings correctly reflected the implementation progress, but M&E data was not
      available for the DO ratings for all but the last two ISRs46, basing progress on project
      activities rather than results. In addition, the action items outlined in the supervision



44
     There were approximate two-three missions for most years, although there were 5 missions in 2009.
     This is explained by the visits made by the TTL from Khartoum when project activities and
     implementation picked up speed in 2009.
45
     This was especially true given the weak capacity, the post-conflict environment and subsequently, the
     heavy burden of bank procurement procedures. .
46
     The last ISR was archived after project closing.


                                                    30
       documents could at times have been more forceful, given that some sub-components
       (particular within component 3) failed to perform.

      In terms of costs versus benefits the project was not proactive in taking bold steps
       such as cancelling contracts that were not delivering according to the terms of
       reference. However, given the difficulties in procurement, this would also have run
       the risk of substantive delays in implementation and it is not entirely clear how under-
       or non-performing consultancies in post-conflict situations should be dealt with given
       the very real need for project activities and outputs in these environments.
Notwithstanding these shortcomings, and reflecting the difficult conditions, tight
deadlines, inadequate budgets and limited Government capacity, the team carried out its
supervision tasks well. The team was competent and dedicated, spent much energy and
resources on overcoming implementation obstacles given the weak capacity in the GRSS
and the need for just-in-time support on a constant basis47. In addition, the task team
leader during implementation was based in Khartoum and there was a full-time team
member in Juba, which allowed for concentrated and cost-effective supervision.
(c)        Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

101. The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory given the
moderately unsatisfactory rating for quality at entry and moderately satisfactory for
supervision. The project was implemented in a post-conflict environment that was fraught
with a number of difficulties, mainly pertaining to the ability to find skilled people and
firms in a timely and cost-effective manner, and subsequently, the ability to come up with
a credible and well-functioning M&E framework. In addition, the guidelines48 indicate
that if the overall rating for the project is moderately satisfactory, then a case can be
made for a similar rating for overall bank performance.
5.2        Grantee Performance

(a)        Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

102. The Government’s support and ownership were important at the project
preparation stage. In addition, the two requests from the GRSS for extending the project’s


47
      The ISN notes that successful implementation of MDTF projects in South Sudan required intensive
      support going well beyond the Bank’s normal support role, including (1) adequate face-time contact
      between Bank staff and their local counterparts to explain roles and build trust, (2) intensive and
      proactive engagement by TTLs, (3) monitoring agents to provide an extra set of eyes and ears, and (4)
      continual awareness of the fiduciary challenges that Bank procedures imposed on the Government.
48
      Impact Evaluation Group ICR Guidelines Pages 34-37 state that when the rating for one dimension is in
      the satisfactory range and the other dimension is in the unsatisfactory range, the rating for overall bank
      performance normally depends on the overall outcome rating.


                                                       31
closing date signaled interest and appreciation of the project activities. This also reflected
the Government’s continuous commitments to the objectives of the project throughout
the implementation phase. Although the ICR mission was carried out almost 6 months
after project closing, the GRSS extended its full co-operation and took an active interest
in the preparation and smooth execution of the mission. The preparation of Government
input for the preparation of this ICR and comments on the draft were also received in a
timely manner.
103. The main Government counterpart was the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and
Investment (MCII). The Ministry’s project management capacity was quite limited and
yet in the absence of a suitable project coordinator, the Directorate of PSD did a fair job
of managing project activities. The performance of the BOSS, which managed the micro-
finance component, was also satisfactory owing to strong ownership of the project. These
achievements are impressive given the weak capacity of the Government.
104. While the personal commitment and dedication of selected individuals at the PSD
Directorate and the BOSS are noteworthy, similar ownership of the project was lacking
more generally. Indeed, strong Government commitment to an effective, high-level PSD
steering committee would have speeded up project implementation. There were also a
number of procurement-related delays, attributed to weak capacity at the MOLACD, and
delays with pushing bills through parliament due to lack of coordination between the MoJ
and MCII. In addition, the MCII did not always extend its cooperation with regard to
matters of staffing and space, which lead to delays and hindered the proper functioning of
consultants and staff.

(b)    Implementing Agency

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

105. The PCU only became fully operational in 2009 after the hiring of the project
coordinator and other key staff. Owing to the different components, it required significant
capacity to coordinate the moving parts and this expertise was missing for the first two
years of the project. Moreover, because of uncertainty of funding towards the end, there
was some staff turnover, which might also hinder the transfer of knowledge to subsequent
projects and activities.
106. The management of monitoring and evaluation activities was found to be lacking,
especially in the face of an over-ambitious results framework. There was no dedicated
M&E officer and this led to a sporadic and mostly ineffective system for monitoring of
activities, with most of the emphasis on outputs and processes instead of outcomes and
results. This was mostly a factor of insufficient resources set aside for M&E activities,
but also because of lack of ownership for such activities within the counterpart ministries.
107. Once the key staff was in place the pace of implementation and activities
accelerated and the PCU demonstrated considerable commitment to achieving the
development objectives. The project coordinator also maintained clear accounts of
project activities, although reports on the wholesale market land-lease consultations were
unavailable for inspection during the ICR mission. There was also significant learning-


                                             32
by-doing on the side of the Ministries and the project team, especially in terms of
procurement and financial management, and this remains one of the legacies of the
project49. The impression from various interviews conducted during the ICR mission is
that the majority of the staff consisted of capable professionals and this is evidenced by
the fact that many are being sought out by development partners and the private sector.
(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Grantee Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

108. The overall grantee performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, given that the
performance of the grantee is above the line and that of the implementation agency is
below the line, wherein the overall outcome rating (i.e. moderately satisfactory) is taken
into account. This rating takes into consideration the strong commitment of the
Government to the overall objectives of the project and to successful implementation of
its activities, and it also reflects the shortcomings of the implementing agencies in
ensuring timely and accurate accounting of results.



6.        Lessons Learned

109. This ICR emphasizes the important lessons drawn from the project, particularly
those that would be applicable in other post-conflict environments:

     Projects designed in post-conflicts regions need a heavy dose of realism.
      Complicated projects with a large number of components and sub-components are
      unlikely to fare well in post-conflict countries. Programs in such countries should be
      sequenced instead of pursuing multiple goals simultaneously. This is particularly with
      regard to the capacity of the counterpart to implement the project. The very weak
      capacity within institutions should be assessed at the outset and then should be
      buttressed with significant technical assistance.

     Constant supervision is indispensable and resources ought to be organized
      accordingly. Projects in post-conflict countries will require constant supervision,
      owing to the nature of the environment and the need for much just-in-time support.
      The role played by team members based in the country office is crucial. In addition,
      monitoring agents, such as those currently operating across multiple projects in South
      Sudan, can help monitor expenditures, procurement and conduct periodic reviews of
      project outcomes.

     The costs and difficulties of attracting and retaining qualified personnel are
      considerable. Projects in difficult, post-conflict environments, besieged by security
      and infrastructure problems, need to assess and budget adequate resources early on to


49
     The ISN for South Sudan notes that building supervision and implementation capacities in core
     government bodies and line ministries has been one of the effects of a number of MDTF-SS projects.


                                                    33
      be able to get the right people and firms on board. The outcomes of the MDTF project
      would have been significantly improved if it has the resources to recruit from the
      right pool of talent. However, even with a large pool of resources, it is not entirely
      clear that talent would be attracted to fragile states50.

     M&E Systems should be established and funded before others. Well-functioning
      monitoring and evaluation is crucial to achieving outcomes, especially in data-poor
      and uncertain environments, where attention is too easily and invariably focused
      towards the immediate problems of implementation rather than the larger problems of
      monitoring (see Box 2 for the importance of monitoring).

     High-level Steering Committees are key. This is necessary to establish project
      ownership at the right levels of Government, to ensure sustainability of activities after
      completion, and to have appropriate oversight in place when things start to go awry.

     World Bank procedures must be capable of responding to post-conflict
      environments. Given the weak capacity of the implementing agencies, an inordinate
      amount of time and effort is dedicated to being in compliance with Bank procedures.
      While the need for quality control in high-risk environments is also high, it should be
      recognized that quick wins are also essential. The ISN for South Sudan identifies how
      flexible arrangements for legal, financing, procurement and other operational
      management could support timely implementation of program activities.




50
     Indeed, as noted by the ISN procurement in South Sudan takes place in a low governance and non-
     transparent environment, which in turn has seriously hampered the ability to deliver efficient and
     effective outcomes. These are problems that cannot be addressed simply by expanding project resources
     for hiring staff and consultants.


                                                    34
                        Box 2: BPC and the Importance of Monitoring
The aim of the Business Plan Competition was to identify and support start-ups and existing
businesses that would (a) have spill-on effects on the rest of the community through employment,
and (b) serve as a successful example of entrepreneurship in the South Sudanese context. The
competition received applications from across the spectrum – geographical, sectoral and from new
and existing firms. 45 winners were chosen and USD 20,000 per winner was disbursed by the
Kenya Commercial Bank. The funds were provided as a loan which would be returned as a grant
to the BPC winner on repayment of the original amount.
The monitoring of BPC winners was to be carried out by the KCB, which was responsible for
collecting repayments and for checking on the progress of the firms. However, only repayment
records were maintained and there was no systematic monitoring of BPC winners. A large
proportion of the loans went to start-ups, there was no way to track winners if they re-located their
place of business and there were no incentives to repay. Consequently, 27 of the winners could not
be traced since the first tranche of the loans was granted (ranging between USD 12,000-14,000).
Of the remainder, 11 BPC winners regularly paid off their loans with the KCB, while the rest were
made irregular payments. In short, just about 1/4 th of the original grant winners remained true to
the contract of the competition. The rest could not be tracked or were struggling to make
repayments.
The most important lesson from what ought to have been a hugely successful project component
was that without proper systems in place for monitoring project inputs run the risk of being
squandered. In this case, the firms that were followed up with created employment and contributed
in other ways to their communities, but not much is known of the rest. Budgets for monitoring and
evaluation need to be funded upfront, and a matching grant or guarantee on behalf of the firm
and/or commercial bank would also build-in incentives to attract those serious about making big
investments to grow their businesses. Proper monitoring combined with well thought through
incentives might help in reducing attrition.

Component 1: Policy, Regulation and Promotion of Investment and Trade

Sub-Component 1.1: Trade and Investment Policy Framework

111. This component aimed at the provision of policy advice focused on the
establishment and continuous improvement of trade and investment policies in South
Sudan consistent with the Government’s private sector development priorities. A Senior
Policy Advisor after a significant delay in July 2009 to develop the legal and regulatory
framework for Trade and Investment policy. The draft was finalized and submitted to the
Economic Cluster of the Council of Ministers in May 2011 for deliberation and possible
submission to Parliament.
112. A legal consultant was also hired in May 2010 and submitted drafts for the
following bills in November 2010 – Competition, Counterfeit Goods, Insurance and
Financial Institution Instruments. These bills have been submitted to the Ministry of
Justice for legislative procedures but are yet to be enacted into law.

Subcomponent 1.2: Public-Private Dialogue Forum

113. The main aim was to provide a forum for public-private dialogue focused on
resolving policy problems that affected the competitiveness of the private sector in South
Sudan. The South Sudan Business Forum (SSBF) was launched in 2009. The project
utilized the services of IFC/FIAS to benefit from IFC’s global experience in Public
Private Dialogue. Funds for this component were used to purchase equipment and to pay
for staff. The IFC provided technical assistance and training to SSBF staff. Working
Groups were formed in five priority policy areas: (i) land, agriculture and agro-industry;
(ii) financial services; (iii) SMEs; (iv) trade and taxation; and (v) infrastructure
development, all of which had strong private and public sector representation. One of the
earliest issues raised was the steps to simply business registration, and the issue was


                                               38
discussed at length at the SSBF. The consultative forum played an important role in
pushing for the enactment of various bills aimed at easing business entry.
114. The SSBF serves as an example of successful World Bank-IFC collaboration,
wherein the Bank funded the administrative and other costs of running the SSBF, while
the IFC provided technical assistance. The SSBF continued to work as a successful
organization throughout the life of the project. It delivered outreach activities at sub-
regional level, worked closely with the Chambers of Commerce to identify key priorities
for the private sector and was engaged at the parliament level in that bills impacting
private sector development could not be concluded without consultations with the SSBF.
115. Owing to resource uncertainty at the end of the project, many SSBF staff were
poached by private sector firms and at the time of the ICR mission the organization was
yet to be formally legalized, and the details of its Board and organizational structure were
to be worked out by March 2013.
Subcomponent 1.3: Catalyzing Entrepreneurship
116. This sub-component involved the Business Plan Competition (BPC) which aimed
at generating mobilizing key entrepreneurs in South Sudan to compete for start-up grants
to create increase awareness, build confidence and create role models. The BPC was
launched in February 2009, and received a total of 1,610 applications from all 10 states in
the country, and across all sectors, agriculture, services and manufacturing. Of these 60
applicants were short-listed and were provided training in business development skills by
the New Sudanese Indigenous NGO’s Network (NESI Network). Of these 60 applicants,
20 BPC winners were finally selected. The project received additional funding from the
Gender Action Plan, which enabled 25 additional female BPC winners, bringing the total
number to 45 – the breakdown of the winners across different states is shown in Figure 1.
117. The winners invested in diverse sectors including agricultural production, agro
industries (e.g. bakery and leather crafts), health clinics, computer services, tailoring, and
hotels. Interviews held with five of the BPC winners revealed that whilst the training
received was tremendously useful, there was no additional technical assistance provided
once the first tranche of the loan had been provided. Indeed, there was little or no
monitoring and evaluation of the winners. The KCB, which reneged on its agreement to
keep tabs on the grantees, only collected information on repayments. As of November
2012, 19 of the winners were paying back their loans (of which 2 had paid back a 100
percent of the start-up capital), while the remainder had not made any repayments since
the loan amount was granted.
118. While it is clear that some of the awardees made good use of the start-up capital
(some of whom, mostly in the services industry, continue to perform well), most BPC
winners seem to have disappeared with the first tranche of funding and can no longer be
tracked, leave alone their progress evaluated. The bulk of analysis presented on BPC
winners and the corresponding employment created is based on the assessment of less-
than half of the original winners and there is little or no information on the remainder.

119. The experience of this sub-component strongly underlies how important, nay how
critical, a system of monitoring and evaluation is to proper functioning of the project. In
addition, the ICR would strongly recommend that any additional BPC competitions in the
future should clearly advertise loans, and not grants. Interviews with BPC winners, with
the KCB and with the Chambers of Commerce lead to the conclusion that World Bank
‘grant competitions’ invariably attract applications from those not planning to go ahead
with the business plan once the first tranche of funding is provided. Making sure that the
funds are made available as a loan would ensure that only those really interesting in using
credit to invest in businesses will apply.

Sub-Component 1.4 M&E System

120. The objective of this sub-component was two-fold: (i) establishing a framework
for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the goals of private sector
development; and (ii) establish an M&E system for measuring the performance of the
PSD Project.
121.     A private consulting firm was hired in November 2008 to undertake the contract
and did a poor job of implementation. There were several delays in the design of the
framework, and frequent turnover among staff made coordination with the PIU difficult.
There were severe problems in data collection, as the firm had not envisaged the scale of
costs owing to logistic and security issues. The contract was amended to reflect higher
costs, but the final output provided by the firm was not satisfactory. This was primarily
because the final design of the M&E framework was not of very high quality, and
importantly, it only reflected M&E activities for the project and not for the performance




                                                   40
of the private sector activities managed by the PSD Directorate of the MCII. At the end
of the project, there was little or no evidence of a well-functioning M&E system.


Component 2: Access to Microfinance

Subcomponent 2.1: Capacity building, Policy and Enabling Environment

122. This sub-component focusses on the development of the legal and regulatory
framework for microfinance. A micro-library was also set up within the BOSS, with
books on loan from libraries in the UK. This library provided resources and references
for training. The BOSS also established the Microfinance Unit and a number of staff
were recruited. Senior members were sent to the Bank of Uganda for training on
microfinance
123. A senior microfinance policy advisor started work in June 2009 and provided a
Microfinance Policy draft by October 2010. The BOSS was not fully satisfied with the
output, because while it covered the operational aspect of MFIs well, it did not quite
address the legal aspects well enough. Accordingly, a peer reviewer was identified and
hired to review and refocus the draft document. The final draft was delivered to the client
in November 2010 and is yet to be submitted onwards to the Council of Ministers.
Interviews held during the ICR mission with members of the microfinance unit within the
BOSS reveal that the MFI market has changed fast since and the policy draft might need
to be updated yet again.
Subcomponent 2.2 SSMDF

124. The aim of the component was to establish the South Sudan Microfinance
Development Facility (SSMDF) under the Bank of South Sudan. The Frankfurt School
of Management was hired and started work in April 2009 to set up the SSMDF and to
build the capacity of the organization. The SSMDF was legally registered as a company
in July 2009, took over the microfinance competition and other activities soon thereafter.
The Frankfurt School did a good job in managing the early years of the SSMDF, and
provided valuable technical assistance and training to its Board and its staff. The
Frankfurt School completed its contract in May 2011, and thereafter support was
provided to the SSMDF in the form of expert consultations. The management of the
SSMDF was then taken over wholly by its Board and staff.
Sub-Component 2.3: Technical Assistance and Financing

125. The objective of this component was to support the start-up and expansion of
microfinance providers and services throughout South Sudan. The first round of
microfinance competitions was held in early 2009, and four MFIs were shortlisted. Once
the Board of the SSMDF was established, the organization assumed oversight of the
competition, the provision of loan capital and technical consulting services to MF
providers.



                                            41
126. Since its establishment, the SSMDF has disbursed US$ 1.67 million worth of loan
capital and technical assistance to 6 MFIs within South Sudan. In addition, it has
provided corporate governance training (aimed at potential Board members) and
microfinance training (for its staff and MFI loan officers), as well supporting the initial
assessments of MFIs interested in potential funding. The organization has also actively
created awareness and stimulated demand for its services through local media,
promotional activities across different states, and meetings with state-level MFIs etc. The
SSMDF also monitors the performance of and maintains regular accounts on MFIs that
were provided with loans or TA.
Component 3: Building Industrial Capacity

127. This component aimed at strengthening the capacities of the public sector
(Ministry of Industry and Mining) and the private sector in view of developing the
industrial potential of South Sudan. UNIDO was the main contracting firm that was hired
in September 2008, which was initially managed by the MEMI and then moved to the
MCII.

Sub-Component 3.1: Building industrial strategy and policy capacity

128. A Chief Technical Advisor was hired to provide capacity building and support to
the Directorate of Industry within the MCII. By May 2009, it was clear that the
performance of the advisor was very unsatisfactory, no outputs had been produced and
his contract was not renewed. The Business Development Services consultant took over
this position.
129. Things began to slowly move with personnel change. Over 30 staff of the
Directorate was provided with a variety of capacity building. This included English-
language training at the University of Juba and in Uganda, Project management and ICT
training at the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute in Tanzania, and study
tours of government ministries and the private sector in Northern Uganda. However,
there were a number of delays because of the change in leadership and because of slow
and inaccurate procurement of equipment.
Sub-Component 3.2: Sector identification and competitiveness strategy

130. The OTF Group was sub-contracted in April 2009 to work on an analysis of
sector-specific competitiveness to lay the foundations for industrial strategies for South
Sudan. Three sectors were identified for analysis – livestock, cereals and high-value fruits
and vegetables – sector assessment surveys were conducted in all ten states, and
stakeholder and media workshops were conducted in different states. The final
comprehensive Sector Strategy Medium Term Industrial Plan for South Sudan was
delivered in April 2011, and was of high quality and was well received.
Sub-Component 3.3: Mineral Study

131. Adam Smith International was sub-contracted in May 2010, after several delays,
to work on the mineral study. The MEMI had initially requested a geological survey to


                                            42
support the development of the mining industry. However after review, it was agreed that
a suitable institutional and policy framework for the sustainable management of mineral
resources needed to be in place before large scale private sector investments in the
mining sector can be undertaken and the TOR was redesigned accordingly. The final
legal and regulatory framework was submitted by January 2011, was very well received
and was submitted onwards to the MoJ for deliberations. This study formed the basis for
the Mining Bill which was enacted as law in late-2012.
Sub-Component 3.4: Development of private sector support institutions

132. This sub-component aimed at providing support to institutions that directly affect
the growth and efficiency of the private sector and represent its interests. UNIDO was
meant to provide capacity-building and other assistance to the South Sudan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry Association (SSCCIA). However, no assistance, technical or
otherwise, was provided under this sub-component for the first two years and activities
planned under this sub-component were cancelled and funds were reallocated.

Sub-Component 3.5: Catalyzing business linkages through BDS

133. This sub-component hoped to address the bottlenecks to entrepreneurial growth
and the development of viable business ideas. However, instead, following talks with the
SSCCIA and the MCII, UNIDO went ahead and carried out door-to-door surveys of
enterprises in Juba, Malakal, Upper Nile and Wau and created business directories that
were made available to the Government, NGOs and the UN to provide more information
on local options available for purchasing and contracting decisions.
134.
In summary, the performance of this component was severely lacking in most respects.
While the outputs of the competitiveness and mining analysis were satisfactory,
UNIDO’s overall performance in managing its sub-components was very poor. The
consultants were slow to start work, and there were several delays with the procurement
of equipment and provision of capacity building. UNIDO was not well-prepared for the
difficulties on the ground, for instance lack of power, lack of language skills etc, and
ended up working on tasks that it was not suited for – such as English-language training,
procurement and ICT work. Some of the activities (for example the business directories)
were not planned for and were a poor substitute for what the money was originally
intended for (i.e. for building business development services centers). In addition,
UNIDO was asked to provide project accounts and financial reports for the disbursements
and this was not made available.
Component 4: Wholesale Market Development

135. This component aimed at establishing a market institution that would lower
transaction costs and facilitate the flow of products, information and credit between farm
producers and urban consumers. It also intended to demonstrate an effective public-
private partnership for infrastructure.



                                           43
136. It was clear early on in the project (see Aide Memoire August 2008) that this
component was under-budgeted. This was because the cost of landscaping, construction,
materials and services were much higher than initially anticipated at project appraisal.
The construction of the market was moved to Phase II of the project.
137. The land lease for the wholesale market was signed in October 2008 between the
Central Equatoria Provincial Branch of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Bari
Community. In addition, staff of the MCII completed market study tours to South Africa
to learn how markets could be better designed, operated and organized. A private firm
was hired as the design engineer in March 2009 and the final designs for the wholesale
market and the financial feasibility study were submitted to the PCU in October 2010. A
design specialist from South Africa was also recruited to review the work of the design
engineer and the designs were considered to be of high quality. In order to prohibit
encroachers, the land leased was fenced by the PIU.
138. The document documenting the consultations between the Bari Community and
the CES was not submitted by the PIU for review, and was not available during the ICR
mission. According to the legal document, in return for the land leased, members of the
Bari community were to benefit from the economic impact of the wholesale market. The
Bari community leader was interviewed during the ICR mission, and he expressed deep
concern and frustration that the construction of the market had been stalled, and that the
land leased for the project had been fenced in and could not be put to other, more
practical and economic, uses.

                  Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
The Final Project Proposal included economic and financial analysis for component 4, i.e.
the Wholesale Market Center. However, since the market was not constructed the
analysis is no longer relevant. The remainder of the project contained technical assistance
and thus alternative considerations are used to substantiate the different aspects of project
efficiency. This is discussed in section 3.3 (Efficiency) of the ICR.

                      Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results
Business Plan Competition (BPC) Beneficiaries

An open invitation was made to BPC winners, and 5 people attended the beneficiary
focus group meeting held on November 28, 2012 in Juba. Of these, 3 were operating in
the services sector (computer services and food industry) and 2 in the agri-business
sector; 3 of the firms were start-ups. There were 4 male entrepreneurs and 1 female. 3 of
the businesses were based in Juba and two outside of the city and in other states.

The following key results emerged from the meeting:

-   All of the participants found that the business and project management training that
    was provided during the BPC process was extremely useful, and led to tangible
    improvements in their ability to manage their businesses.
-   The BPC grants were used to purchase equipment, hire employees, construction of
    buildings, and on operating expenses such as fuel for generators, veterinary services,
    transportation services etc. In particular, the participants felt that the grants had
    added considerable value to their enterprises and that there had been spill-on effects
    on the rest of the community through employment generation and by enhancing
    community perception of entrepreneurship. All of the participants also had
    established credit histories with the Kenya Commercial Bank, and now had the
    ability to raise loans elsewhere.
-   Not all of the businesses flourished, and the reasons were varied. For one participant
    working in the agricultural sector, the lack of qualified veterinarians within the wider
    community affected the ability of his livestock to recover properly after a disease
    outbreak. Another entrepreneur sunk money into building electric poles to link her
    food factory to the power grid, but lost her investment since the supply of power was
    poor and sporadic and she was forced to set aside additional funding for a generator.
    In summary, it seems that the lack of factors such as adequate infrastructure or skills
    in the country made it difficult for some of the businesses to do as well as they might
    have in a better business environment.
-   The participants also made a number of valuable suggestions for future business plan
    competitions:
       o There should be more competition in the choice of the lending institution .
         The participants felt that KCB did a poor job in providing services and in
         monitoring their progress, given the high bank charges for processing funds
         or changing currencies etc.
       o State governments need to be involved early on in the process. BPC winners
         based outside of Juba faced a number of difficulties in connecting with the
         KCB and with others in their cohort, and received little or no support from
         state government officials or business associations.



                                            48
       o The BPC process should be made more transparent. The participants
         strongly believed that inadequate information was made available at the start
         of the selection process regarding the structure and the timing of funding that
         was to be provided, the currency in which it would be made available, and the
         requirements at the end to ensure receipt of the grant.


MFI Client Beneficiaries

An open invitation was made to the clients of different MFIs to which SSMDF had
provided loan capital and technical assistance. Project funds and activities supported the
SSMDF, which in turn provided loan capital and technical assistance to 6 MFIs in South
Sudan, and these microfinance providers then went on to provide micro and small loans
to their clients. The aim of the focus group meetings was to determine how project
activities had affected outcomes for the end-beneficiaries.

Two separate focus group meetings were held. The first was held in Juba on November
30, 2012 and 7 clients, all female, from the MFIs BRAC and RUFI (Rural Finance
Initiative) attended. The second meeting was held with RUFI clients in Nimule on
December 1, 2012 and over 40 people showed up, with an almost equal number of men
and women.

Below is a summary of the key results that emerged from both focus group meetings:

-   The clients who were provided with basic training in accounting and record
    management were better able to utilize the loan and manage repayments. Many
    participants emphasized the need for credit education in South Sudan, since a strong
    savings or credit culture is lacking in the country.
-   Participants used the microfinance lending to run mainly small, informal businesses,
    a large proportion of which were in trading small amounts of goods. The funds were
    used to buy goods, equipment, or fuel or to construct structures. There were also a
    number of instances where the loans were used towards personal consumption
    expenses such as school fees, or unforeseen expenses such as hospital bills. In such
    cases, it was usually the group that covered the repayments for the individual.
-   Group or community lending worked as a better model for micro-loans that were
    mainly aimed at starting up small businesses. Small and individual defaults were
    dealt with internally and the group’s credit standing with the MFI was not affected.
    On the other hand, a number of participants also expressed a strong desire for
    individual-based loans of larger amounts, which could then be put towards expansion
    of business, or purchase of large equipment.
-   The participants also highlighted a number of areas within which additional support
    was needed:




                                           49
o MFIs should assist members to change foreign currencies. A number of
  participants were buying goods from across the border in Uganda to sell in
  South Sudan, and many have lost money changing foreign currencies.
o MFIs should take deposits. Many participants also wanted the MFIs to
  provide them with access to deposits and other savings instruments, since
  they did not have access to banking services.
o MFIs should provide insurance products. Fluctuations in currencies, ill-
  health, deaths, or losses owing to fires, thefts etc, have the potential to wipe
  out family and group savings. Participants emphasized the need for insurance
  products to protect themselves from these and other unforeseen
  circumstances.
o MFIs should provide larger and more flexible loans. This is especially true
  for those who have built up a credit history with the MFIs, and who are keen
  to take out loans for construction or investments in capital goods, or even
  education loans, where a larger sum is required upfront, but repayments might
  need to be staggered.

                      Annex 6: Summary of Grantee's ICR
The report “Private Sector Development Project – Government ICR? was submitted to
the ICR author on January 9, 2013. The follow paragraphs briefly summarize the main
tenets of the Government ICR, and the full text of the ICR is provided in the list of
supporting documents.

The ICR introduces the project, emphasizing that the President of the Republic of South
Sudan officially launched the project on January 29, 2009, giving it very high visibility in
the country. In short, the project achieved substantial results in improving the policy and
regulatory environment, access to finance, and capacity building. The focus of the
Government ICR is on the background of the project design, the objectives,
implementation arrangements and key achievements. The ICR ends with key challenges
and recommendations with regards to future interventions.

In 2007, the Government received a Grant co-financed by the MDTF and the GRSS to
support implementation of the Southern Sudan Private Sector Development Project
(SSPSDP). The objective of the Project was to develop an enabling environment for
private sector growth and to sustainably increase formal employment in South Sudan.
The project implementation period lasted 5 years, beginning in April 2007 and ending in
June 2012.The total cost of the first phase of the project was US$ 11.06 million, of which
USD 0.6 million was contributed by GRSS and the balance was contributed by the
MDTF. The original approved grant was for US$ 6.78 million, which was then revised to
US$ 8.96 million. An additional US$ 1.1 million was contributed from the Gender Action
Plan and was also channeled through the same Designated Account. The main
implementing agencies were the MCII, the BOSS, the MEMI and the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning in the Central Equatoria State.

According to the Government ICR, satisfactory achievements have been attained in all of
the four components of the project. The ICR then goes on to list the individual
achievements in each of the components. The major achievements highlighted by the ICR
are provided below.

Major Achievements:
- The Senior Policy Advisor to the MCII developed a trade and investment policy
   draft, which was presented to the relevant stakeholders and was submitted to the
   Cabinet for approval.
- The BPC created awareness of role models for entrepreneurship in South Sudan.
- SSBF established to facilitate public-private dialogue, has worked well and will be
   formally constituted and inaugurated soon.
- The SSMDF is operational, working well and is expanding in terms of its portfolio
   and services.



Shortcomings:


                                            51
-   Staff trained within the MCII in M&E skills has been transferred to different
    departments where these roles are not in practice.
-   UNIDO did not perform well, and has not provided its audited accounts as per the
    requirements of the Grant Agreement and this has resulted in a qualified opinion on
    the project accounts from the external auditor.

The Government ICR also highlighted the following key implementation challenges:

-   The project was under-budgeted. This resulted to not implementing all sub-
    components and some activities under sub-components.
-   The capacity of the implementing agencies to implement donor-supported projects
    was not sufficient at the beginning of the project. This caused many delays with
    regard to implementation.
-   Lack of project oversight (for instance in the form of a steering committee) and
    guidance during implementation resulted in stressful reporting directly to the Cabinet
    and Assembly.
-   The systems put in place to implement the project remain World Bank systems that
    are not harmonized with Government systems. As a result, Government ownership
    was hindered.

In line with the challenges, the Government ICR has the following recommendations for
future improvement of World Bank projects:

-   Budgets for project should be sufficiently allocated to enable smooth
    implementation.
-   Capacity of the implementing agency should be determined early in project design so
    that implementation is smooth.
-   The project should have a functional oversight committee to guide implementation.
-   Donor-funded projects should be harmonized within the existing government system.
    Any best practices required by the donor should be enforced within the existing
    system to allow full ownership by the government.
