MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDOh'ESIA
FOR A DAM SAFETY PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$55.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's st.ndard variable interest rate, and would help finance a
Dam Safety project in Indonesia.
2.         Dams in Indonesia.  At present about 120 large 1/ and numerous
small dams are in operation in Indonesia. The dams have significantly
contributed to the country's development: they serve about I miliion hectares
of irrigated lands, generate 6,000 Gwh of electricity, protect large settled
downstream areas from floods, and are a major source of water supply for urban
conters. Over 100 of the dams are single purpose, of which over 90 serve
irrigation schemes and 10 generate power. About 15 are multipurpose dams,
serving both irrigation and power, and in 10 cases also serving water supply
and/or flood control. Nearly 100 of the dams are owned by the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) and operated by the provincial Water Resources Services
(PWRS) under the technical oversight of MPW's Directorate General of Water
Resources Development (DGWRD). Seven multipurpose dams are operated by the
Jasan Tirta and Jatiluhur parastatal water authorities which are both under
the oversight of the Minister of Public Works. Another nine dams are operated
by the State Electricity Co,poration (PLN) and the remaining dams by several
mining companies. About one third of all large dams were built more than 25
years ago.
3.         Dam Safety.  The responsibility for inspection and monitoring of
dams for safety lies at present entirely with the owner-operators. At the
larger power and irrigation dams, staff is assigned full time to read
monitoring instruments, keep operational records, and inspect the facilities
for signs of distress. While these activities are vital for ensuring safety,
a clear need exists for the establishment of a formal system of independent
inspectiona and reporting on the safety and operational condition of the dams.
Many countries have adopted formal dam safety regulations and publicly
supported inspection programs in order to ensure adequate flood handling
capabilities and structural soundness of the existing dams. In Indonesia such
regulations and organiza,ional arrangements still are lacking. This weakness
has been recognized by the Government of Indonesia (GOI).
4.         Past Experience and Lessons Learned.  The Bank has supported
several water resources projects in Indonesia which included the construction
of large dams. However, many others were limited to the construction or
rehabilitation of downstream irrigation works or water supply distribution
systems, using existing or new dam reservoirs not financed by the Bank. Dam
l/   Dams having a height of 15 meter or more and/or a reservoir capacity of at
least 500,000 cubic meters.



-2-
Safety Panels were organized to review the plans, designs and construction for
new dams, such as the Bank financed Kedung Ombo Dam (Loan. 2543-IND). The
Bank also has assisted GOI during the last decade in carrying out regular
safety inspections and evaluations on existing dams t",at would serve new Bank
funded irrigation and municipal water projects. Under the agreement for the
West Tarum Canal Improvement Project (Loan 2560-IND) consultants performed in
1992/93 a safety inspection of the Jatiluhur Dam, a key structure for
irrigation and water supply in West Java. The consultants found that the dam
was not of sufficient strength to withstand some of the loading conditions
that could occur. For a number of years the dam's operators had been
restricting releases because of apparent weaknesses, thus reducing the
practical usable storage capacity.   An independent panel of experts has
confirmed the consultants' findings. Based on the evaluations by the
consultants and the panel, MPW has concluded that major remedial work should
be performed at the dam.
5.         The Bank's involvement in the inspection and safety evaluation at
Jatiluhur led to detailed discussions with the MPW on the broader issue of
country-wide dam safety. During 1992, MPW employed consultants to inspect and
assess the safety status of several other dams under its jurisdiction. The
extent of remedial work needed for these dams led to a full evaluation of
Indonesia's dam safety procedures and a decision to institute a country-wide
dam safety program. In 1993, the MPW issued a decree setting out the basic
provisions for expanded dam safety activities and for the creation of dam
safety institutions. The DGWRD was charged with the preparation of a dam
safety program.
6.         GOI Strateav.  The Government wishes to upgrade its capability to
manage the country's water resources in order to: (a) ensure adequate supplies
for human consumption; (b) mainta'in food security; (c) relieve poverty;
(d) balance regional development; and (e) utilize water resources efficiently
and in an integrated and sustainable manner. With the increasing demands for
water, Government gives priority to upgrading operations of existing
infrastructure and proposes to establish a regulatory body to ensure safety of
existing and future dams, starting with those owned and operated by MPW/PWRS
and eventually expanding the oversight function to cover all dams in
Indonesia.
7.         Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Th3 Bank is in
broad agreement with the Government's objectives for irrigation and water
resources development. The project is fully consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on April 12, 1994. The
project would: (a) strengthen public sector management by establishing
regulatory institutions to protect the country against the risk of dam
failures; and (b) contribute to effective management of water resources
through the provision of basic safety facilities and implementation of
remedial works at Indonesia's existing large dams to enhance their safety
status. The project is part of a coordinated lending program for water
resources development, with each operation focussed on important and
complementary objectives. The other projects are:
(a) the approved Groundwater Development Project (Loan 3588-IND) and
the appraised Integrated Swamps Development Project (FY94) would



both exploit the natural resources in less developed regions and
promote the objectives of regional equity and poverty;
(b)  the approved Watershed Conservation Froject (Loan 3658-IND)
focuses on natural resources management in critical watersheds;
and
(c)  the appraised Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Management
Project (FY94) would focus on efricient water resource utilization
in selected Java basins and improve the productivity of existing
infrastructure.
Due to its close association with water resources related programs in
Indonesia, and given its support for the establishment of dam safety
institutions in several other borrowitng countries, the Bank is well placed to
assist Indonesia with the development of a national dam safety program.
8.         Prolect Oblectives.  The main objective of the project is to
reduce the risk of dam failures in Indonesia through the establishment of dam
safety institutions, the provision of basic safety facilities at existing dams
where such facilities are now lacking, and the implementation of remedial
works at dams with safety deficiencies. The dam safety program would start on
the MPW dams and later be expanded into a national program covering all dams
in Indonesia.
9.         Prolect Deacription.  The proposed project would be implemented
over a six year period (1994 - 2000) and include the following main
components:
(a)  support for the recently established dam safety organization
consisting of a Dam Safety Commission and a Dam Safety Unit,
including provision of equipment and training of staff;
(b)  provision of basic dam safety facilities for existing dams,
including communications and alarm systems, instrumentation to
record basic data relevant to the safe operation of the dams and
reservoirs, evacuation planning, and emergency actions;
(c)   implementation of remedial works to upgrade the safety of
Jatiluhur Dam and eleven other dams for which final and
preliminary designs have been prepared, and for other existing
dams following completion of inventories, hazard ranking, and
identification of the needed works during project implementation;
and
(d)  support to DGWRD to manage the project, including provision of
technical assistance, equipment and vehicles.
10.        Prolect Financing and Implementation.  Total project costs are
estimated at US$97.4 million. The proposed loan of US$55.0 million equivalent
would finance 62 percent of the total costs, exclusive of taxes (US$7.6
million) and vehicles (US$0.5 million) which GOI will finance   GOI would
provide US$42.4 million equivalent. The DGWRD in the Ministry of Public Works
would implement the project and be responsible for all procurement actions,



- 4 -
including technical assistance. Every year DGWRD would prepare for Bank
review a work plan and budget for the following year's project activities. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are presented ir Schedule A,
and the amounts and methods of procurement in Schedule B. A timetable for key
project processing events is in Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 12815-IND, dated May 6, 1994 is being distributed
separately.
11.        Proiect Sustainability.  The newly established Dam Safety Unit
would evolve into a public regulatory agency and require continuous funding by
GOI of its recurrent costs. The annual operating expenses would be relatively
small when compared to the potential losses due to dam failures in the absence
of a national dam safety program. The owner agencies would remain legally
responsible for the performance of their dams and would have the obligation to
fund remedial works as deficiencies are discovered by the safety inspections
and evaluations.
12.        Environmental Assessment.  Overall, the project would help protect
the environment through the establishment of permanent dam safety institutions
and by raising the safety level of the country's dams. The construction of
remedial works carries the possibility of localized environmental impacts,
depending on the magnitude and type of work performed. Each work would be
evaluated separately and, where necessary an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) would be performed prior to the initiation of construction. The
remedial works for the Jatiluhur dam would involve opening of a rock quarry
and transportation of large volumes of construction materials to the dam site
for which an EIA would be completed prior to award of contract. The remedial
works would not be expected to necessitate the acquisition of land for new
rights-of-way, and therefore the issue of resettlement of people is not
expected to arise. However, should land acquisition be required, GOI would
notify the Bank on the acreage of acquisition, the present use of the land,
and the effects on people, including relocation, if needed. A determination
would be made at that time of the necessity for MPW to prepare a resettlement
plan. Such a plan, if needed, would be prepared in accordance with policies,
planning principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria agreed
with the Bank.
13.        Agreed Actions.  The Chief of the Dam Safety Unit and the Project
Manager have been appointed in April 1994. Agreement has been obtained from
GOI at negotiations on the following actions:
(a) operational guidelines for the Dam Safety Commission and Dam
Safety Unit will be issued by May 31, 1995;
(b) GOI will establish not later than April 1, 1997, a national dam
safety regulatory agency with jurisdiction over all dams in
Indonesi&;
(c) consultants for institutional strengthening and training, and for
construction supervision of Jatiluhur Dam remedial works will be
engaged by January 15, 1995 according to the Bank's Standard
Conditions of Contract for Consultants;



(d)  GOI will submit resettlement plans to the Bank for review and
approval for any works requiring the resettlement of people;
(e)  GOI will submit to the Bank for its review and comments annual
project work plans and cost estimates by September 30 of each
year, and budget proposals for the agreed work plans by December
31 each year;
(f)  GOI will carry out a technical audit every year, starting not
later than April 1, 1994, after reviewing with the Bank the terms
of reference for it; and
(g)  GOI will submit to the Bank for review and comments not later than
March 31, 1998, a proposal for a funding structure for operation
of the national dam safety program by the designated authorities,
and thereafter prepare and carry out an action plan taking into
account the comments by the Bank.
14.        Program Objective Categories.  The project's focus is on public
sector institutional development and the upgrading and maintenance of existing
infrastructure.
15.        Prolect Benefits.  The project would increase the efficiency in
the operation and maintenance of dams and reduce the risk of damage and losses
due to failures.
16.        Risks.  There are no major risks for the project.  The introduc-
tion of a formal dam safety program would reduce the probability of dam
failure and the associated loss of life and property. There is a relatively
small risk that it may take longer than at present anticipated for the new dam
safaty institutions to become fully operational and for their staff to be
trained to the level required to manage a nation-wide program. However,
Government fully recognizes the importance of setting up a regulatory body to
enhance the safety of the nation's dams. There is no reason to expect GOI to
reduce its support. The Dam Safety Commission would be the key body to guide
the dam safety program toward a national level with clear public
accountability for safety while leaving operational accountability with the
dam owners. Proper orientation and training of the members of the Dam Safety
Commission would be a critical element of the project during the first one or
two years of its implementation.
17.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
