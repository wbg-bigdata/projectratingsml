DAM SAFETY PROJECT
LOAN AND PRoJEwr SuMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Indonesia
Loan Amount:          US$55.0 million equivalent
Terms:                Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:    The main objective of the project is to reduce the risk of dam
failures in Indonesia through establishment of national dam
safety institutions and carrying out a program to improve the
safety of existing dams. The project would be implemented
over a six-year period (1994 -2000) and include the following
main components: (a) support for the recently established Dam
Safety Commission (DSC) and Dam Safety Unit (DSU) at
central Government level and Dam Monitoring Units (DMU) at
central and local dam owners' levels; (b) provision of basic dam
safety facilities at dams where at present such facilities are
lacking; and (c) implementation of remedial works at dams with
safety deficiencies. Training and technical assistance would be
provided to assist the Directorate General of Water Resources
Development (DGWRD) with the implementation of the
proposed project.
Benefits and Risks:    The project's main benefit would be a reduction in the risk of
dam failures and there are no major risks associated with its
implementation. There is a relatively small risk that it may take
longer than at present anticipated for the new dam safety
institutions to become fully operational and for their staff to be
trained to the level required to manage a nation-wide program.
However, Government fully recognizes the importance of
setting up a regulatory body to enhance the safety of the
nation's dams. The Dam Safety Commission would be the key
body to guide the dam safety program toward a national level
with clear public accountability for safety while leaving
operational accountability with the dam  owners.  Proper
orientation and training of the members of the Dam Safety
Commission would be a critical element of the project during
the first one or two years of its implementation.

CHAPTER 1
PROJECT AND SUBSECTOR BACKGROUND
Background
1.1         Dams have been constructed in Indonesia since the early 1900s, initially for
irrigation purposes, but increasingly as multi-purpose dams for irrigation, power
generation and flood control. The development of Indonesia's water resources has been
a key factor for rapid rural development, transition to rice self-sufficiency, and a notable
drop in poverty levels. Agricultural growth has outpaced population growth by 1 percent
per year for two decades, while even more rapid expansion of the services and
manufacturing sectors have shrunk agriculture's share of GDP to 20 percent. Faced with
growing non-agriculture water demands and diminished prospects for new irrigation,
particularly on Java, the main challenges are sustaining existing infrastructure and
increasing the efficiency of water use. The rapid economic development also has increased
the awareness among the public for the need to protect society against potential disasters
due to dam failures. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has therefore requested Bank
assistance for a Dam Safety Project which would help establish permanent dam safety
institutions, provide basic safety facilities to all dams where such facilities currently are
lacking, and implement remedial works at schemes with safety deficiencies.
Dams in Indonesia
1.2         At present about 120 large 1/ and numerous small dams and weirs are in
operation in Indonesia.  The dams have significantly contributed to the country's
development: they serve about 1 million hectares of irrigated lands, generate 6,000 GwH
of electricity, protect large downstream areas from floods, and are a major source of water
supply for urban centers. Over 100 of the dams are single purpose, of which over 90
serve irrigation schemes and 10 generate power. There are about 15 multi-purpose dams,
serving irrigation and power, and in 10 cases also serving flood control and/or water
supply. Some 100 of the 120 dams are located on Java, including 13 of the 15 multi-
purpose dams. The largest arable land resources are on Java and over 90 of the dams are
being used for irrigation. Most of the older dams on Java are relatively small and were
built to supply local irrigation systems and villages. The more recently built dams tend
to be larger and serve larger areas. About one-third of the existing large dams were built
before 1970.
1/ Dams having a height of 15 meters or more and/or a reservoir capacity of at least 500,000 cubic
meters.



- 2 -
1.3         About 95 of the dams are owned by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
and operated by the Provincial Water Resources Services (PWRS) with technical oversight
by MPW's Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD). Prior to
1965 almost all dam projects were planned, constructed and operated under the direction
of MPW. Since then the hydropower facilities were separated from MPW and placed
under the State Electricity Corporation (PLN). The PLN is the second largest dam owner
and operates at present nine dams. The Jatiluhur Authority operates 1 dam, the Jasa Tirta
(Brantas Authority) 6 dams, and other public and private owners another 10 dams. Details
on age, size and ownership of Indonesia's large dams are given in Annex 1, Table 1.
1.4         Several technical factors need to be considered with regard to the safety of
the existing dams.  First, where past maintenance programs have been weak, the
probability of failures increases. Second, potential losses below dams due to failures are
increasing with expanding populations and property development, often located near the
banks of the downstream river channels. Third, the technical knowledge of dam design,
hydrologic analysis, monitoring instrumentation, and quality control of materials and
construction have improved over the past three decades. Many of these advances have
occurred after the completion of some of the older facilities. Moreover, Indonesia is
located in an active seismic zone which requires special attention in dam design and
maintenance to assure greater strength or flexibility of the dams. The knowledge and
methodology of estimating the potential magnitude of floods and earthquakes has improved
over the past two decades and the stability and safety of some of the older facilities need
to be reassessed in regard to these two factors.
Institutional Framework for Damn Safety
1.5         The responsibility for inspection and monitoring of dams for safety lies at
present entirely with the owner-operators. At most of the larger power and irrigation
dams, staff is assigned full time to read monitoring instruments, keep operational records,
and inspect the facilities for signs of distress. While these activities are vital for ensuring
safety, a clear need exists for the establishment of a formal system of independent
inspections and reporting on the safety and operational condition of the darns. Many
countries have adopted formal dam safety regulations and publicly supported programs of
inspection, evaluation and regulation to consistent standards in order to ensure adequate
flood handling capabilities and structural soundness of the existing dams. In Indonesia the
requisite regulations and organizational arrangements to ensure consistent dam safety
actions still are lacking at this time. The DGWRD has therefore been charged with the
preparation of a dam safety program which initially would cover all MPW-owned dams
and eventually be expanded to include all large dams in Indonesia (see para. 5.1). This
would require the establishment of a separate dam safety organization with a staff of
technical specialists who are independent from the operating units. The envisaged dam
safety organization would be a regulatory agency with the task of setting standards, making
periodic inspections, conducting evaluation of the safety status, issuing notices of
deficiencies to the owners, followed by monitoring of the corrective work performed.
Such an organization should also review the designs and construction of new dams to
assure that the necessary safety features are included.



-3-
1.6         The International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD), made up of
technical professionals and multi-country commissions from all over the world, produces
technical guidelines and model dam safety programs. The ICOLD guidelines and other
technical publications comprise the basic requirements for successful dam safety programs
which Indonesia intends to follow. However, there are regional and local conditions that
must be considered in the process of specifying the guidelines and standards for Indonesia.
A country-wide commission of large dams exists in Indonesia which has access to all
ICOLD reference materials.
1.7         Over the last decade staff of the Research Institute of Water Resources
Development located in Bandung have received training in dam safety inspections and
evaluation procedures. In some situations they have carried out safety assessments on
MPW dams. However, they have not the administrative authority to direct owner agencies
to take the necessary remedial actions. Many of the staff of the Institute are now involved
in research programs and are qualified to provide the nucleus for a new dam safety
organization.

CHAPTER 2
BANK INVOLVEMENT
Bank Involvement in Dams in Indonesia
2.1         The Bank has supported a large number of irrigation, hydropower and water
supply projects in Indonesia during the past 25 years. Some of these projects included the
construction of dams but in most projects the head works already existed and the
investments involved only down stream conveyance and distribution facilities. As the
demand for dry season water supplies and power continues to increase in the country, the
long-term operation of storage dams and ensuring their safety gains more importance. A
summary of irrigation lending appears in Table 2.1.
2.2         During the last decade, the Bank has assisted GOI in carrying out regular
safety evaluations on existing dams that would serve new Bank funded irrigation and
municipal water projects. Under the agreement for the West Tarum Canal Improvement
Project (Loan 2560-IND), the Bank required a safety evaluation of the Jatiluhur Darn
whose operation was to provide the water for a new irrigation system as well as for
expanding municipal supplies for the Jakarta metropolitan area. The Jatiluhur Dam has
a net storage capacity of 2.4 billion cubic meters, a potential irrigated area of 300,000
hectares, and a power generating capacity of 900 Gwh per year. The safety inspection,
investigation and evaluation was performed in 1992/93 by a foreign consultant firm which
concluded that the dam was not of sufficient strength to withstand some of the loading
conditions that could occur. The consultants also noted that for a number of years the
dam's operators had been restricting releases because of apparent weaknesses observed
when the reservoir level was lowered. Subsequently, a dam review panel was created to
advise MPW on the results and conclusions of the investigations. In January 1993, MPW
(the owner of Jatiluhur Dam), the consultant, the panel, the original design firm, and the
Bank held a joint meeting to review the history of design and construction of the dan,
discuss the subsequent observations and records, review the results of the current
investigations, and evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed remedial actions. Based
on the evaluations made by the consultant and the panel, MPW concluded that major
remedial work should be performed at the dam.
2.3         The Bank's involvement in the inspection and safety evaluation at Jatiluhur
led to detailed discussions with MPW on the broader issue of country-wide dam safety.
During 1992, MPW employed foreign consultants to inspect and assess the safety status
of several other dams under its jurisdiction. The extent of remedial work needed for these
dams led to a full evaluation of Indonesia's dam safety procedures and a decision to
institute a country-wide dam safety program. In February of 1993, the MPW issued a
decree setting out the basic provisions for expanded dam safety activities and for the



-5 -
creation of a dam safety organization. Subsequently, a special committee of MPW staff
was assigned to outline a program for dam safety and propose a program suitable for
funding by the Bank. Assisted by two consulting firms, the Directorate of Irrigation-I
(DOI-1) prepared an initiating report for a proposed dam safety project which would
include the establishment and support of a dam safety organization and implementation of
remedial work for dams with identified deficiencies, including Jatiluhur Dam. During
1992 and 1993, about 36 MPW-owned dams were inspected and evaluated by consultants.
Subsequently, designs for remedial works have been prepared for 13 dams, including
Jatiluhur.
Issues and Lessons Learned
2.4         While dam safety measures have been addressed in past Bank-funded
projects with dams, available evidence suggests that maintenance programs have declined
over time resulting mainly from financial constraints. There are no mandatory government
policies and procedures requiring continuation of timely monitoring, analysis and
evaluations of the safety status of dams. Many of the staff that had been trained for these
activities have by now left for other organizations, taken jobs in the private sector, or have
been given other assignments. Consequently, the degree of attention now being given to
each dam varies considerably and is quite inconsistent. The large dams, especially PLN's
revenue earning power dams which can support good maintenance programs, appear to
have been cared for quite well and have good monitoring and record systems in place.
However, on irrigation projects with older dams, scant financial resources have been
applied toward maintenance and as a result many of them show deterioration and signs of
distress. The lesson learned in countries with well established dam safety programs is that
regulatory agencies responsible for overseeing the programs are indispensable.
Government Strategy
2.5         The Government wishes to upgrade its capability to manage the country's
water resources in order to: (a) ensure adequate supplies for human consumption;
(b) maintain food security; (c) relieve poverty; (d) balance regional development; and
(e) utilize water resources efficiently and in an integrated and sustainable manner. With
the increasing demands for water, Government gives priority to upgrading operations of
existing infrastructure. The Government proposes to establish a regulatory body to ensure
safety of existing and future dams, starting with those owned and operated by
MPW/PWRS and eventually expanding the oversight function to cover all dams in
Indonesia.
Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.6         The Bank is in broad agreement with the Government's objectives for
irrigation and water resources development. The project is fully consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on April 12, 1994. The project
would: (a) strengthen public sector management by establishing regulatory institutions to
protect the country against the risk of dam failures; and (b) contribute to effective
management of water resources through the provision of basic safety facilities and
implementation of remedial works at Indonesia's existing large dams to enhance their



-6 -
safety status. The project is part of a coordinated lending program for water resources
development, with each operation focussed on important and complementary objectives.
The other projects are:
(a)   the approved Groundwater Development Project (Loan 3588-IND) and the
appraised Integrated Swamps Development Project (FY94) would both
exploit the natural resources in less developed regions and promote the
objectives of regional equity and poverty;
(b)   the approved Watershed Conservation Project (Loan 3658-IND) focuses on
natural resources management in critical watersheds; and
(c)   the appraised Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Management Project
(FY94) would focus on efficient water resource utilization in selected Java
basins and improve the productivity of existing infrastructure.
Due to its close association with water resources related programs in Indonesia, and given
its support for the establishment of dam safety institutions in several other borrowing
countries, the Bank is well placed to assist Indonesia with the development of a national
dam safety program.

TIE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.1         The main objective of the project is to reduce the risk of dam failures in
Indonesia through: (a) establishment of dam safety institutions; (b) periodic inspections
and safety evaluations of all large dams; (c) provision of basic safety facilities at existing
dams where such provisions are now lacking; and (d) implementation of remedial works
at dams with safety deficiencies. The dam safety program would start with inspection,
evaluation and remedial work on the MPW dams and in due course be expanded into a
national program covering all dams in Indonesia.
Project Area
3.2         The project area encompasses the entire country of Indonesia. Due to the
concentration of the population and extensive agricultural operations in Java, over
80 percent of the large dams are located there, with the remainder scattered geographically
around the country (Annex 1).
Project Description
3.3         The proposed project would be implemented over a six-year period
(1994 - 2000) and support the recently established Dam Safety Commission (DSC) and a
Dam Safety Unit (DSU), and one central and about 11 local Dam Monitoring Units
(DMU). Equipment, staff training and technical assistance would be provided by the
project in support of this effort. The project would also provide basic safety facilities for
all existing dams now lacking such facilities, and carry out remedial works at Jatiluhur
Dam and other MPW dams with safety deficiencies.
Detailed Features
3.4         Dam Safety Institutions (Base Cost US$2.6 million, see Annex 2). The
project would provide office space, computers, printers, files, technical reference
materials, transport and basic office and field equipment for the operation of the following
dam safety institutions:
(a)   Dam Safety Commission, consisting of representatives of all dam owners,
Indonesia's Commission of Large Dams, and other agencies with public
safety interests; the DSC would oversee the activities of the DSU, review



9-
and approve dam safety guidelines and standards, and supervise
enforcement of dam safety legislation;
(b)   Dam Safety Unit, established initially as an entity within DGWRD under the
new Directorate of Water Utilization and Conservation and which eventually
would evolve into an independent regulatory agency; the DSU, with an
initial technical staff of about 20 persons would conduct inspections and
evaluate the safety status of all dams in Indonesia, prepare guidelines and
standards for dam safety requirements, and provide technical training and
guidance to owners' staff in charge of operation and maintenance of the
dams.
(c)   central Dam Monitoring Unit in Jakarta, to be established within DGWRD
under the new Directorate of Technical Guidance and which would consist
of three technical staff; the central DMU would direct the routine safety
inspections and evaluations for all MPW/PWRS dams, keep basic records
for the dams as specified by DSU, and liaise with DSU on all safety
matters; and
(d)   about eleven local Dam Monitoring Units, of which about eight in the
provinces and three for large schemes (i.e., Jatiluhur, Solo and Brantas);
the local DMUs would have about two to four technical staff each and be
responsible for routine surveillance, inspection and accurate reporting of all
required information.
3.5         Training (Base Cost US$1.2 million, Annex 3). The training would include
on-the-job training by consultants during the early years of the project, formal workshops,
seminars and instruction provided by visiting specialists, and study tours for the selected
engineering personnel to other countries that have active and effective dam safety programs
and agencies that manage them. Training equipment and materials would be provided by
the project. The training activities would be more prominent in the early years of the
project but would continue throughout the project period.
3.6         Basic Safety Facilities (Base Cost US$7.2 million, see Annex 4). The
project would provide basic safety facilities for all dams where such facilities are now
lacking. This would include:
(a)   carrying out of surveys of all dams and associated structures to provide
information for detailed inspection;
(b)   installation of communications equipment to improve routine operational
communications and ensure advance notice of flood conditions;
(c)   installation of instrumentation, including seepage recorders, stand pipe
piezometers, reservoir level gauges and recorders, and rain gauges, in order
to improve the recording of basic data relevant to the safe operation of the
dam and reservoir;



- 10-
(d)   clearance of dam and surrounding areas to allow detailed inspection of dam
and associated structures; and
(e)   emergency actions, where required, to ensure safety of dam and associated
structures.
The central DMU would collaborate with dam operating units and/or consultants to collect
the required information and to procure and install the needed basic safety facilities. The
basic facilities would be identified and installed early in the project period in order to assist
in the collection of data needed to determine if any major remedial works are required.
3.7         Remedial Works (Base Cost US$59.5 million, see Annex 5). Following
detailed safety inspections carried out in 1992 and 1993, the project would provide for
remedial works on 22 dams in order to upgrade their safety condition. The largest portion
of the identified work is for the Jatiluhur Dam and adjacent facilities (base cost of about
US$19.5 million). The works would include strengthening of the main dam, raising and
strengthening of the reservoir embankments, repair of two tail race conduits, and
improving access roads. Under the Central and West Java Irrigation Development Project
(Loan 2649-IND) and West Tarum Canal Improvement Project (Loan 2560-IND) final or
preliminary designs have been prepared for remedial works at another 11 dams (Category
A), and preliminary cost estimates following detailed inspection have been prepared for
another 10 dams (Category B). During project implementation inventories and hazard
rankings would be prepared, safety inspections conducted, and remedial works
requirements identified, at all other large MPW/PWRS dams (Category C). A provision
equal to about 40 percent of the total cost of the remedial works has been made for works
at the Category C dams.
3.8         Project Management (Base Cost US$0.3 million). The project would
provide for office space, equipment, transport, and other facilities for a small project
management team, comprising about ten staff, which would be located in a new
Subdirectorate of Large Structures under the Directorate of Technical Guidance.
3.9         Consultants Services (Annex 6).  The project would provide for the
following consultants services:
(a)   for institutional capacity building: assistance in establishing dam safety
institutions and training of staff, requiring about 150 foreign and 280 local
staff months (base cost US$4.7 million);
(b)   for implementation support:
(i) construction supervision of remedial works at Jatiluhur Dam,
requiring about 65 foreign and 150 local staff months (base cost
US$1.8 million); and
(ii) surveys, investigations, designs and supervision of installation of
basic dam safety facilities, and design and construction supervision
for remedial works at dams other than Jatiluhur; DGWRD's own
staff are expected to perform up to 25 percent of this work while



- 11 -
local consultants, in some instances assisted by foreign consultants,
would perform the balance through a series of annual contracts (base
cost US$4.7 million).
In order to expedite the start of project activities after project approval, the consultants
referred to under (a) and (b)(i) above should be employed by January 15, 1995. An
assurance to that effect has been obtained from GOI during negotiations.
Status of Preparation and Implementation Schedule
3.10        The project has been prepared by DGWRD assisted by several teams of
consultants. The draft preparation report covering institutional strengthening, basic dam
safety facilities, and remedial works for dams, other than Jatiluhur, was issued in
September 1993 and formed the basis for the appraisal. Designs for remedial works for
11 dams have been completed while the detailed inspection has been completed for another
10 dams. With regard to Jatiluhur Dam, the draft tender documents for remedial works
were completed in December 1993 and are now being finalized following comments by
the Bank. Prequalification of contractors has been completed. Remedial works at
Jatiluhur Dam are scheduled to start in mid-95. Terms of Reference for the two main
consultancies have been reviewed by the Bank and are now finalized. The short lists of
firms have been approved by the Bank. The project implementation schedule is at Annex
10.
Environmental Impact
3.11        The project would help protect the environment through the establishment
of permanent dam safety institutions and by raising the safety level of the country's
existing dams. The Subdirectorate of Large Structures of DGWRD would conduct a field
review and environmental screening, to be documented in a brief report, for each dam to
be included in the remedial works program. If the screening would reveal potential
negative environmental impacts, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) would be
prepared in accordance with MPW standard procedures (PP51) and processed through the
Environmental Control Agency (BAPEDAL). Any mitigation measures required would
be performed prior to signing of the remedial works contract, or made a part of the
remedial works contract and performed by the contractor.
3.12        The remedial works on the dams are not expected to necessitate the
acquisition of additional land for new rights-of-way, and therefore the issue of resettlement
of people is not expected to arise. However, should land acquisition be required, GOI
would notify the Bank on the acreage of acquisition, the present use and ownership of the
land, and the effects on people, including relocation, if needed. A determination would
be made at that time of the necessity for MWP to prepare a resettlement plan. GOI has
agreed that such plan, if needed, would be prepared in accordance with policies, planning
principles, institutional arrangements, and design criteria agreed with the Bank (see
Annex 5) and would be subject to review and approval by the Bank. Assurances to this
effect have been obtained from GOI during negotiations.

CHAPTER 4
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Costs
4.1         Total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$97.4 million
of which US$27.9 million would be foreign exchange and US$7.6 million duties and taxes.
Base costs are expressed in 1994 values. Physical contingencies are estimated at 5 percent
for remedial works at the Jatiluhur main dam, 15 percent for identified but as yet not fully
studied remedial works at ten dams, and 10 percent for all other civil works and for
equipment and vehicles. No physical contingency has been added to the global cost
estimate for unidentified civil works (Category C dams). Price contingencies are based
on an estimated annual local inflation rate of 5.5 percent and a foreign inflation rate of 2.5
percent from FY95. Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1 below and detailed in
Annex 7.

Financing Plan
4.2         The proposed Bank loan of US$55.0 million equivalent would finance about
56 percent of total project cost, or 62 percent of project cost exclusive of taxes, duties and
vehicles which would be purchased by GOI. GOI would finance the balance of US$42.4
million equivalent, or 44 percent of project cost. The project financing plan is summarized
in Table 4.2 below and detailed in Annex 9, Table 1.

Procurement
4.3         General. Procurement of goods, works and services, with the exception of
vehicles, would be undertaken by DGWRD units at the national and provincial levels in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. GOI would use its own resources to
fund the purchase of vehicles (US$0.5 million) in accordance with a schedule agreed with
the Bank. An assurance to that effect has been obtained from GOI during negotiations.
4.4         Civil Works. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures would be
used for the award of three separate contracts for the remedial works at Jatiluhur Dam and
reservoir (US$23.0 million). Prequalification of contractors for these works has been
completed which was acceptable to the Bank. Remedial works at the other dams (US$43.6
million) and the provision of basic dam safety facilities (US$7.2 million) would be
individually much smaller in scope than the works at Jatiluhur. Also, these works would
be geographically dispersed and thus unlikely to attract interest from foreign contractors.
Therefore the works would be awarded under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures
acceptable to the Bank and open to foreign contractors. However, ICB procedures would
be followed when the cost estimate of the works would exceed US$3.0 million per
contract. Where feasible, remedial works at adjacent dam sites would be combined in one
contract. For bid comparisons under ICB procedures, local contractors would be allowed
a 7.5 percent margin of preference. Small remedial works and provision of basic safety
facilities up to a maximum of US$50,000 for each dam may be executed by the owners'
own maintenance crews on force account. The Bank's standard bidding documents would
be used for ICB contracts and GOI's standard bidding documents, acceptable to the Bank,
would be used for LCB contracts.
4.5         Equipment. Equipment (US$0.7 million) would be procured following
LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, or on the basis of international and for local
shopping for items estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract up to an aggregate
amount of US$500,000. In the latter case at least three quotations from foreign and/or
local suppliers would be obtained.
4.6         Training and Consultants Services. All training activities (US$1.3 million)
would be carried out by direct contracting, or within existing Government training
facilities. Consultants providing technical assistance for the establishment of dam safety
institutions (US$5.2 million) and for construction supervision of remedial works at
Jatiluhur Dam (US$1.8 million) would be selected after inviting proposals from
international and national firms which already have been shortlisted by GOI, and are



- 14 -
acceptable to the Bank. Other consulting services for surveys, investigations, designs and
construction supervision (US$6.1 million) are relatively small in size and scheme specific
and would be arranged primarily through national consultants. An assurance has been
obtained from GOI during negotiations that all consultants would be selected in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines and engaged according to the Bank's Standard Conditions of
Contract for Consultants.
4.7          Review of Procurement. Bank prior review would apply to the following
contracts: (a) civil works US$1,000,000 and above; (b) equipment US$100,000 and
above; and (c) consultants US$100,000 and above for firms and US$50,000 and above for
individuals. Other contracts would be reviewed ex-post and at random. Prior review is
expected to cover 50 percent of all civil works and LCB procured equipment by value.
These percentages are acceptable in view of the demonstrated experience of the borrower
in procurement matters and previous practice on similar Bank-financed projects in
Indonesia. A summary of the procurement arrangements is shown in Table 4.3 below.

Disbursements
4.8         All project activities are expected to be completed by March 31, 2000, and
the Loan closing date would be September 30, 2000. Disbursements from the Loan would
be made for:
(a)   55 percent of expenditures on civil works;
(b)   100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment
and materials, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally
manufactured equipment and materials, and 65 percent of locally procured
items; and
(c)   100 percent of expenditures on consultants services and training.
4.9         Disbursements under the project would be made against Statement of
Expenditures (SOE) for contracts for works valued at less than US$1,000,000, equipment
valued at less than US$100,000, consultants services valued at less than US$100,000 for
firms and US$50,000 for individuals, and for training activities. Contracts disbursed
under SOEs would be based on model bid documentation approved by the Bank.
Disbursement for all other expenditures would be on the basis of full documentation.
Documentation for SOE expenditures would be retained by implementing agencies and the
Directorate General of Budget (Ministry of Finance) and be made available for review by
Bank supervision missions.
4.10        Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be
established in the Bank of Indonesia to be maintained by the Director General Budget in
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Special Account would be maintained in US dollars
with an initial deposit of US$3.0 million (equivalent to the average disbursements during
a four month period). The Special Account would be for withdrawals, in all categories,
relating to all foreign and local currency expenditures as long as the withdrawals do not
substantially deplete the balance in the Special Account. The Government would request
once per month replenishment of the Special Account or if its balance falls below 80
percent of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first.
Accounts and Audits
4.11        The Project Manager in the new Subdirectorate of Large Structures in
DGWRD would have overall responsibility for setting up and monitoring the use of an
uniform project accounting system for all project expenditures incurred at the national and
provincial levels. The Subdirectorate in Large Structures would maintain accounts for
equipment procured on behalf of the project and for training and technical assistance. The
Kanwil offices of MPW in the provinces would maintain accounts of project related
expenditures incurred on the various dam schemes, and transmit accounts reports to the
Subdirectorate of Large Structures on a regular basis. Assurances have been obtained
from GOI during negotiations that: (a) the project's records and accounts, including the
SOEs and Special Account, would be audited annually by the Government Audit Agency
(BPKP), or another qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank; and (b) certified copies of the
audit reports would be submitted to the Bank starting December 31, 1995 for fiscal year
1994/95, and subsequently no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The



- 16 -
audit reports would contain a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs submitted during
each fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.
4.12        DGWRD would carry out technical audits of the remedial works, basic
safety facilities and training components of the project. The terms of reference for these
audits would be prepared, and organizational arrangements proposed, by GOI not later
than June 1, 1995. The technical audits, acceptable to the Bank, would be carried out
every twelve months during the implementation of the project, commencing not later than
April 1, 1996, and copies of the audit reports would be furnished to the Bank for
information commencing not later than October 1, 1996. Assurances to this effect have
been obtained from GOI during negotiations.

CHAPTER 5
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Organization and Management
5.1         The Directorate General of Water Resource Development (DGWRD) in the
Ministry of Public Works would be the executing agency for the project. A major
reorganization of DGWRD is currently underway and is scheduled to be completed by
June 15, 1994. Understandings were reached during project appraisal, and confirmed
during negotiations, that the new Dam Safety Unit (DSU) would be located in a different
DGWRD directorate than the central Dam Monitoring Unit (DMU) and project
management.  The DSU, together with the Dam Safety Commission (DSC) were
established under a Public Works Ministerial Decree issued in February 1993. The two
entities would constitute the nucleus for an independent public dam regulatory agency
covering all dams in Indonesia and is expected to be located initially within the new
Directorate of Water Utilization and Conservation of DGWRD. An assurance has been
obtained from GOI during negotiations that not later than April 1, 1997 GOI would
establish a national dam safety regulatory agency with jurisdiction over all dams in
Indonesia.  Eventually, it is expected that the dam  regulatory agency would be
organizationally separated from DGWRD. The central DMU would monitor all
MPW/PWRS dams on behalf of the owner and, together with project management, be
located in a proposed new Subdirectorate of Large Structures in the new Directorate of
Technical Guidance of DGWRD (see Chart 1).
5.2         The DSC would have a membership of about 12-14 persons and serve as the
advisory board for the dam safety program. The Chairman and members of the DSC have
been appointed under a Decree of the Minister of Public Works issued in April 1994. The
Chief of the DSU would be the Secretary of the DSC and the Director General of
DGWRD would initially be the Chairman. The DSC would meet at least quarterly.
5.3         The DSU  is the technical agency responsible for carrying out the
inspections, evaluations, reviews, preparation of guidelines and standards, safety training
for the dam owners' O&M staff and preparation of annual program reports. The DSU
would be organized in four sections, i.e., field monitoring and inspection, dam design and
review, data and records, and training coordination. Its staff of about 20 technical persons
would be assigned on a project basis according to experience and availability (see Chart 2).
An assurance has been obtained from GOI during negotiations that operational guidelines
for DSC and DSU, acceptable to the Bank, would be issued not later than May 31, 1995.



- 18 -
5.4         The central DMU and project management would be located in the proposed
new Subdirectorate of Large Structures in the Directorate of Technical Guidance. The
Chief of the subdirectorate would be the Project Manager (PIMPRO) and be responsible
for the planning and implementation of all project components, including contracting of
remedial works, procurement and installation of basic dam safety facilities, and
organization of the staff training program. He would direct the project consultants,
coordinate work programming and reporting, and would be the primary liaison with the
Bank (see Chart 3). The Chief of the DSU and the Project Manager were appointed in
April 1994. The DGWRD has a good record in the execution of works. The main
objective of the ongoing reorganization is to strengthen and integrate planning and design
of water resources at the regional level. As a result, DGWRD is likely to emerge stronger
once the process has been completed.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.5         During project implementation, and also thereafter, DSU would keep
detailed records of the dam safety program activities. Annually, the DSU would prepare
a report summarizing the year's activities, progress made, and details on the dams
requiring remedial work still to be carried out. The records system would include the key
information on remedial work performed along with the inspection records. One of DSU's
primary activities is to continually evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the dam safety
program. As development below dams increases and the dams age, risks would need to
be assessed continuously and policies possibly adjusted. The DSC would evaluate these
data and the DSU's overall performance and decide on any adjustments in the program that
may be needed.
Annual Work Plan and Budgets
5.6         Project activities would be financed in accordance with existing GOI
procedures for financing Bank-assisted projects. Budget allocations for project activities
would be based on annual work programs prepared by DGWRD and agreed to by
BAPPENAS. To ensure that adequate funds would be provided for planned project
activities, GOI would submit to the Bank for its review and comments: (a) not later than
September 30 each year, a work program and cost estimates for the following fiscal year;
and (b) by December 31 each year, budget proposals for the agreed work programs.
Budget allocations would be based on the agreed work programs taking into account the
Bank's comments. Assurances to this effect have been obtained from GOI during
negotiations.
5.7         During the project period, the operating cost of the DSU and the DSC would
be covered under MPW's annual budget. Eventually, when the DSU would have
developed into a national dam regulatory agency, the possibility of establishing an
independent source of funding for its operating cost, preferably by the dam owners, would
be determined. A transparent fee structure for certification of new dams or reissuance of
inspection certificates for existing dams, would help ensure the independence and
sustainability of the regulatory agency and indicate to present and future owners the costs
and risks of operating their dams.  Assurances have been obtained from GOI at
negotiations that by March 31, 1998 a proposal for a funding structure for the operation



- 19 -
of the national dam safety program would be sent to the Bank for review and comment,
and that thereafter an action plan would be prepared and carried out taking into account
the comments of the Bank.
5.8          The large majority of the dams, where remedial works would be carried out
under the project, are used for irrigation. Recovery of capital cost is as yet not considered
a feasible proposition. Priority is being given to the financing of the cost of system
operation and maintenance through the introduction of a user fee system. A major portion
of the remedial works would be carried out at the multi-purpose Jatiluhur Dam and
reservoir which, in addition to supplying at present some 260,000 ha with irrigation water,
generates about 900 Gwh annually and supplies raw water to the Jakarta Metropolitan area.
The facilities at Jatiluhur are operated and maintained by the parastatal Jatiluhur Authority.
This Authority owns the power station, offices, staff houses and O&M facilities, while
GOI owns the main dam, dikes and access roads. The Authority sells raw water to Jakarta
and power to PLN at contracted rates and cost sharing arrangements which do not include
depreciation or capital cost of the GOI-owned facilities at Jatiluhur. Taking into account
these existing arrangements, the Bank agrees that the Government funds the remedial
works at Jatiluhur at 100 percent equity, as for all other Government-owned irrigation
dams.
Supervision Missions
5.9         The Bank would supervise the project semi-annually. Details on timing and
proposed composition of the missions is presented in Annex 11.

CHAPTER 6
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefilts and Justification
6.1         The project would increase efficiency in the safe operation and maintenance
of dams. The main benefit would be a reduction of risks of dam failure. Such a failure
would result in: (a) damage to downstream property and environment; (b) possible loss
of life; (c) sudden loss of benefits from the reservoir supply; and (d) replacement cost of
the dam itself or construction of an alternate water supply. The project provides public
safety and to postulate benefits on the basis of the probabilistic computation for the
potential of a dam failure is not common practice. However, during the final design,
alternatives would be compared and least cost solutions would be sought for the needed
remedial works.
Project Sustainability
6.2         The Dam Safety Unit to be established under the project would evolve into
a public regulatory agency and require continuous funding by GOI of its recurrent costs.
The annual operating expenses would be relatively small when compared to the potential
losses due to dam failures in the absence of a national dam safety program. The owner
agencies would remain legally responsible for the performance of their dams. They would
have the obligation to fund remedial works, either from their revenues (PLN, private
owners) or through annual budget allocations (MPW), as deficiencies are discovered by
the safety inspections and evaluations.
Project Risks
6.3         There are no major risks for the project. The introduction of a formal dam
safety program would reduce the probability of dam failure and the associated loss of life
and property. There is a relatively small risk that it may take longer than at present
anticipated for the new dam safety institutions to become fully operational and for their
staff to be trained to the level required to manage a nation-wide program. However,
Government fully recognizes the importance of setting up a regulatory body to enhance the
safety of the nation's dams. There is no reason to expect GOI to reduce its support. The
Dam Safety Commission would be the key body to guide the dam safety program toward
a national level with clear public accountability for safety while leaving operational
accountability with the dam owners. Proper orientation and training of the members of
the Dam Safety Commission would be a critical element of the project during the first one
or two years of its implementation.

comments not later than June 1, 1995, draft terms of reference and
proposed organizational arrangements for the performance of technical
audits (para. 4.12);
(g)   GOI would establish, not later than April 1, 1997 a national dam safety
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over all dams in Indonesia (para. 5.1);
(h)   GOI would, not later than May 31, 1995, issue operational guidelines for
the Dam Safety Commission and Dam Safety Unit, acceptable to the Bank
(para. 5.3);

(i)    GOI would submit to the Bank for its review and comments: (i) not later
than September 30 each year, a work program and cost estimates for the
following fiscal year; and (ii) by December 31 each year, budget proposals
for the agreed work program, taking into account the Bank's comments
(para. 5.6);
(j)    GOI would submit to the Bank for review and comments not later than
March 31, 1998, a proposal for a funding structure for operation of the

DAM SAFETY PROJECT
BACKGROuND OF DAMs IN INDONEsiA
1.           Dams for storing water have been built in Indonesia since the early 1900s,
with the older dams primarily serving irrigation schemes. Today there are more than 120
large and numerous small dams and weirs in Indonesia. Of these about 60 are greater than
15 meters in height and are considered to be large dams by the International Commission
on Large Dams (ICOLD). Another 60 dams with a height of less than 15 meters have a
gross reservoir capacity of at least 500,000 cubic meters. Approximately one-third of the
60 large dams were constructed prior to 1970. Almost all of the older dams were earthfill
or rockfill and most were single purpose for irrigation. During the post-1970 period
however, several multipurpose dams have been constructed. Figure 1 below shows the
age distribution of the 60 large dams and illustrates that more than half of the large dams
in Indonesia are older that 15 years.

- 24 -                           ANNEX 1
2.           For much of the 1970's Indonesia was the world's largest importer of rice,
but by the mid-1980's it had achieved self sufficiency in rice production. Dry season
irrigation has significantly contributed to this expanded production and reliable water
storage facilities are now critically important for sustaining agricultural production. In
addition, the country depends on dams for hydropower production, flood control and
municipal and industrial water supplies. With a rapid expansion of the urban population,
the need increases for reallocation of water from irrigation to municipal use, as well as
expansion of storage capacity to serve all users. The safe condition of the country's dams
is of major importance and has been receiving increased attention by the Ministry of Public
Works over the past few years.
3.           Indonesia has not as yet experienced major dam failures. However, it is
acknowledged that the safety status of dams often change over time and frequent checks
are needed to confirm their condition. The country is located in a region of active
seismicity which contributes to the difficulty of estimating the forces to apply in the
original designs and in the assessment an existing dam's stability. It is not uncommon for
technical methods of analysis to change with time, based on experiences in other seismic
regions, and new criteria should be used. Although the dams are subject to routine
surveillance by the operating personnel, there is no formal consistent and comprehensive
system of inspection, reporting and evaluation. The valleys downstream of the dams
continue to attract additional population and in many river basins, large numbers of people
are now exposed to the risk of dam failure. The hazard level below most of the dams has
increased over the last two to three decades and this trend will continue in the future.
Some dams represented only small hazard levels when initially constructed but are now
positioned above considerable property and business development and populations. The
combination of increased hazard and the natural tendency for dams to deteriorate
structurally with time, results in an increased risk of greater potential loss of life and
property due to dam failures.
4.           ICOLD has produced international standards for dam safety, guidelines for
governig legislation and descriptions of dam safety programs. Indonesia is represented
in ICOLD and normally sends representatives to conferences and annual ICOLD meetings.
These representatives have become very supportive of a national dam safety program.
5.           The larger dams associated with the expansion of hydropower and the large
irrigation projects have typically been designed by foreign consulting firms. There is,
however, an expanding technical expertise within the country of engineers with technical
training and experience of working with foreign engineers on projects with dams. This
project targets that base of technical expertise for the selection of staff for the dam safety
unit.
6.           The following Table 1 presents pertinent data on the location, type, size,
function, spillway capacity and ownership of Indonesia's large dams.

Chairmanship would be held by the Director General of Water Resources Development
(DGWRD).



- 32 -                         ANNEX 2
6.           Establishment of Quarterly Meeting and Training Schedules. The DSC
members will receive extensive training both in Indonesia and in foreign countries.
Training topics will include:
(a)   the importance of dam safety; the causes and consequences of dam failures;
the responsibilities of dam owners, dam safety officials and government
officials; public safety considerations; and the elements of an effective dam
safety programn;
(b)   guidance on the requirements and resources necessary to establish an
effective dam safety program; the importance of dam maintenance and its
relationship to dam safety; the development of dam operations and
maintenance procedures necessary to ensure dam safety; and the necessity
for dam inspection programs;
(c)   the critical importance of emergency action plans and the numerous and
varied governmental entities involved in the successful development and
implementation of such plans; and
(d)   the procedures involved in the promulgation of dam safety regulations and
legislation necessary for the implementation of the national dam safety
program; the responsibilities and liabilities inherent in the role of dam
owner; and the legal consequences of dam failures.
7.           Commencement of Training. Training activities will commence upon
establishment of the full DSC membership and will be conducted at periodic intervals in
order to orient new DSC members and to keep established DSC members current on the
latest dam safety concepts.
8.           Review of Dam Safety Unit Activities. The DSC will establish the general
guidelines that govern DSU operations and will review DSU activities for compliance with
established national dam safety goals; approve proposals from the DSU for regulations and
guidelines; provide advice and recommendations to the Minister for Public Works on
suggested resource allocation requests developed by the DSU; and, in general, be
responsible to the Minister for the achievement of national dam safety goals.
9.           Approval of Dam Safety Guidelines Prepared by the Dam Safety Unit.
Upon receipt of draft regulations and guidelines from the DSU, the DSC will conduct a
complete review to ensure compliance with established dam safety policies. Such review
will not only utilize the broad professional experience and knowledge of the DSC members
themselves, but may utilize special skills from legal advisers and technical consultants that
are made available on an ad-hoc basis to deal with a particular technical issue.
10.          Development and Approval of National Dam  Safety Regulations
(PERMEN) and National Legislation. As the dam safety program develops from the
initial start through the integration and incorporation of all darns throughout the nation it
will be necessary to draft and implement regulations and legislation at the national level.
This process will begin in the DSU with identification of needs that become evident as



- 33 -                         ANNEX 2
DSU develops its regulatory capacity. These needs may range from establishing technical
criteria that are applicable to all dam owners and which will provide uniform standards
throughout the country to establishing regulatory criteria which set forth what legal
authorities exist to enforce dam safety laws and decrees and what sanctions should be
imposed upon dam owners that do not comply with findings of the DSU and/or DSC.
11.          Based upon operational experience the Chief, DSU, will draft proposed
regulations or legislation. These proposals will be presented to the full Dam Safety
Commission with a request for adoption. The DSC will evaluate the proposal and may
choose to seek outside technical assistance. The DSC may also conduct hearings or other
fact finding activities in order to be more fully advised on the impact and need for the
proposed regulations. Along with technical and legal considerations, the DSC will
consider economic and environmental impacts and implications of the proposal. Once all
relevant facts are considered, the DSC may recommend that the proposed regulations or
legislation be enacted as drafted, or amend the proposal to conform more closely with the
national interest, or return the proposal to the Chief, DSU, for further evaluation, or
simply choose not to proceed with the proposal at the present time.
12.          Develop the National Program for Dam Safety Awareness. Due to the
high visibility of the DSC and its ability to access the national government at the decision-
making level, the DSC is uniquely positioned to have a major impact on dam safety
awareness. Dams play a very important role in the economic life of Indonesia by
providing irrigation water for crop production, water for the industrial sector, electricity
generated by hydro-electric facilities and used for private and industrial purposes, drinking
water supplies to major cities and towns, flood control benefits, and, recreation
opportunities. Yet, dams if left poorly maintained can be serious threats to life and
property. These facts must be made known to the general population of Indonesia through
a well-planned and executed public awareness program. The DSC, utilizing the technical
proficiency of the DSU and by calling upon public relations specialists within the
government and the private sector, will develop an integrated national dam safety
awareness program that can be used in the school system, the public and private work
force and the national media.
B. DAM SAFETY UNrr
13.          The Dam Safety Unit (DSU) is a regulatory agency and, as such, must
remain separated, as much as possible, from dam owner agencies in order to provide an
unbiased and objective assessment of the true status of the dams within the jurisdiction of
the program. With regulatory responsibility comes enforcement authority. The DSU will
be expected to provide the necessary technical evidence that will be the basis for sanctions
against dam owners in the event of non-compliance with program mandates.
14.         The proposed DSU structure comprises five sections as follows:
(a)    Field Monitoring and Inspection;
(b)   Dam Design Review;
(c)    Data and Records;



- 34 -                         ANNEX 2
(d)   Training Coordination; and
(e)   Administration.
15.         In operational terms, the DSU would adopt a matrix organizational structure
with project teams selected for specific duties on the basis of technical requirements of
specific tasks. The specific technical capabilities of the DSU staff would be expected to
fall within the following main categories:
(a)   Hydraulics and Hydrology;
(b)   Geotechnical and Geological Engineering;
(c)   Mechanical and Electrical Engineering; and
(d)   Materials and Construction Engineering.
Staffing levels are projected to be 16 full-time equivalents during the first 3-4 years of the
progran with these levels expanding to approximately 20 full-time equivalents as the
programn assumes true national level status and begins to conduct its regulatory role over
all jurisdictional dams within Indonesia (see Charts 1 and 2).
Summary of Dam Safety Unit Activities
16.         The DSU will participate in the following activities:
(a)   initial establishment of the dam safety progran;
(b)   development of the dam inventory and records management progrun;
(c)   preparation of hazard classification and inspection priority;
(d)   carry out dam safety inspection program;
(e)   development of dam safety assessments;
(f)   owner notification of required actions;
(g)   review and approval of remediation plans;
(h)   review and approval of final plans and specifications;
(i)   construction inspection;
(j)   enforcement actions;
(k)   development and approval of emergency action plans;
(1)   preparation of guidelines and procedures;
(m)   budgeting and programming;
(n)   reporting;
(o)   training; and
(p)   development of a public awareness strategy.
Detailed Description of Dam Safety Unit Activities
17.         Initial Establishment of the Dam Safety Unit. The DSU must be viewed
by dam owners as being extremely competent from a technical standpoint in order to gain
the respect of the community that it is expected to regulate. Selection of highly qualified
technical personnel who are then provided additional training, in-country as well as
overseas, is a key requirement to ensure the necessary level of expertise. A strong sense
of technical competence combined with a high 'esprit de corps" will enable the DSU to



- 35 -                          ANNEX 2
resist the inevitable pressures brought about by vigorous enforcement of the dam safety
regulations.
18.          Development of the Dam Inventory and Records Management Program.
A complete inventory of dams must be conducted nation-wide. This inventory will form
the basis for all further actions relating to dam-safety. During the inventory process the
physical parameters of the dams will be ascertained, estimates of hazard-classification
made, initial assessment of conditions and need for rehabilitation developed, and a priority
for comprehensive safety inspections established. The inventory will rely upon dam
owners to furnish as much information as is available for each dam and the physical site
visit should be conducted jointly by DSU personnel and owner staff.
19.          Of parallel importance to the inventory process is the development of a
complete records maintenance program that logically catalogs all information pertaining
to a particular dam and makes the information readily available. This records maintenance
system will consist of computerized data bases as well as hard-copy material that must be
preserved.  Before each dam safety inspection, the inspection team will review all
documents pertaining to the dam that are relevant to the inspection including previous
inspection notes and reports. These files are not simply archival in nature but are a
dynamic history of each dam that grows and changes with each event that affects the
structure itself or creates knowledge about the structure. Photographs should be taken
during construction and inventory inspections and included in the record files.
20.          Hazard Classification and Priority Listing. To assist in the ranking of
dams for inspection and to determine the various technical criteria that are to be applied
to dams, it is necessary that a hazard classification be assigned. The hazard classification
is developed, predicated upon what results would occur in terms of loss of life and
property damage if the reservoir were full and the dam failed under non-storm event
conditions. Hazard rating does not refer to the present condition of the dam.
21.          Normal hazard classification ratings are as follows:
(a)    High Hazard:  Normally utilized when failure of the structure can
reasonably be expected to cause significant loss of life and create severe
property damage and economic dislocation.
(b)   Moderate Hazard: Utilized when failure of the structure is expected to
cause minimal loss of life, but substantial property damage.
(c)    Low Hazard: Assigned to dams whose failure will not cause loss of life
and the property damage and economic consequences of failure are small.
22.          The hazard classification is a subjective assessment based upon evaluation
of the downstream conditions and the determination of the economic consequences of loss
of the use of the dam. Hazard classification is the primary indicator of priority for dam
safety inspections as well as for allocation of fiscal resources needed for remedial work
for the dam.



- 36 -                          ANNEX 2
23.          Dam  Safety Inspection Program.  Periodic safety inspections are
conducted by DSU experts independently of the inspections performed by the dam owner
staff. The dam owner is encouraged to have personnel accompany the DSU staff as a
training opportunity and to allow face-to-face communication at the site. The frequency
of inspection for each dam is controlled by the hazard classification and the condition of
the structure itself. The goal of the dam safety program is to inspect all dams on the
inventory at least once every five years but dams in the high hazard category may need
to be inspected more frequently. If the dam has certain features that require skills not
existent in the DSU, a special consultant will be retained to provide the necessary technical
evaluation. During the initial start-up period for the DSU, consultants will be required on
all inspections as a way to train the DSU staff and to assess the skill acquisition process
of the individual staff members.
24.          Development of Dam Safety Assessments. Upon completion of the Report
of Inspection, the DSU staff must develop a documented assessment report of all actions
required to be taken to bring the dam into compliance with established policies and
guidelines.   The recommendations must be broadly written so as to allow the owner
the flexibility of utilizing all acceptable engineering solutions but must be precise in stating
what must be achieved. An implementation schedule must be provided notifying the owner
of the latest times that certain activities must be accomplished. The assessment report is
forwarded to the Chief, DSU, for his review and concurrence in the findings and
recommendations.
25.          Owner Notification of Required Actions. Upon completion of the Dam
Safety Assessment Report by the DSU, it must be forwarded immediately to the dam
owner for implementation. The implementation schedule may be negotiated if the owner
can demonstrate cogent reasons that prevent completion of work items on the schedule set
out in the report.
26.          Review and Approval of Remediation Plans. Upon receipt of the Dam
Safety Assessment Report, the owner will develop a comprehensive remediation plan to
implement the dam safety measures required. This plan must accompany preliminary
designs for structural remediation and will include procedures and schedules to ensure
compliance within the time-frame set out in the assessment report. The DSU review
remains broadly focused on dam safety goals and objectives and does not dictate how the
task will be done. This allows maximum flexibility for the owners to develop innovative
and cost-effective solutions. When the DSU determines that the remediation plan meets
all relevant dam safety guidelines, written approval is forwarded to the owner authorizing
preparation of final designs and specifications and implementation of other remedial
actions.
27.          Review and Approval of Final Plans and Specifications. The DSU has
the responsibility to review and approve all final designs and specifications for work that
affects the structural integrity of any jurisdictional dam, whether the work contemplated
is remediation of an existing dam or construction of a new one. Standards for review
should be established early in the development of the DSU in order to provide dam owners
with guidelines within which to operate.



-37 -                          ANNEX 2
28.          Construction Inspection. Construction supervision and inspection is the
responsibility of the dam owner but the DSU has the obligation, in its regulatory role, to
monitor construction activities. This monitoring role should be performed by members
of the DSU that have been involved in the inspection of the dan and in the review and
approval of the plans and specifications because of the in-depth knowledge that these staff
members possess with respect to the dam. Construction inspection activities performed
by the DSU are not continuous in nature but are performed periodically as time and
resources permit.  Often they are guided by critical construction activities that are
important to observe.
29.          Enforcement Actions. As a regulatory agency, the DSU will be required
to enforce the various regulations that are promulgated by the Darn Safety Commission as
well as those which originate from the DSU. Because of this requirement it is very
important that the DSU personnel be well qualified in their respective fields of expertise
in order to have credibility with owners and with the court as they can be expected to give
expert testimony in any action brought against owners.
30.          Development and Approval of Emergency Action Plans. Even though
the probability of dam failures is usually small, planning is required to:
(a)   identify conditions that could lead to failure and initiate emergency
measures to prevent such failure; and,
(b)   if this is not possible, identify ways to minimize the extent and effects of
such failures.
Tlhe operating and mobilizing procedures to be followed upon indication of an impending
dam failure or major flood should be carefully predetermined and documented.
31.          An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) commensurate with the dam size,
location and hazard classification should be formulated for each dam. The plan should
require an evaluation of the damage potential created from a postulated dam failure by use
of flood inundation maps, should develop a sequential list of emergency actions,
coordinated with local civil preparedness and law enforcement officials, and should contain
a formal procedure to detect, evaluate and mitigate any potential safety problem. Owners
of dams should evaluate the possible modes of failure for each dam, be aware of indicators
or precursors of failure for each mode, and consider the possible emergency actions
appropriate for each mode and the effects on downstream areas of failure by each mode.
Evaluation should recognize the possibility of failure during flood events as well as during
normal operating conditions and should provide a basis for emergency planning actions in
terms of notification and evacuation procedures where failure would pose a significant
danger to human life and property. Plans should be prepared in a degree of detail
commensurate with the hazard and instructions should be provided to dam operators and
attendants regarding the actions to be taken in an emergency. Planning must be coordinated
with local civil defense and police officials to enable those officials to become aware of
the catastrophic nature of dam failures and to develop workable plans for notification and
evacuation of local communities when conditions threatening dam failure become apparent.



- 38 -                          ANNEX 2
32.          While development of EAPs is a responsibility of the dam owner, the DSU
must provide guidelines for their development and should be available to assist with
technical advice during the plan formulation. Once the plan is developed to the satisfaction
of the owner, including coordination with local officials, it should be submitted to the DSU
for formal approval.
33.          Preparation of Guidelines and Procedures. An important aspect of the
DSU function will be to prepare guidelines and procedures in support of the various dam
safety related activities. These documents are essential in order to provide uniform
implementation of dam safety policy and will ensure that the information and procedures
established during the development of the national program can be readily reviewed and
amended as the dam safety program develops.
34.          As a minimum, guidelines covering the following topics will be developed:
(a)   inspection and reporting guidelines;
(b)   instrumentation and monitoring guidelines;
(c)   stability requirements for design loads;
(d)   operation and maintenance guidelines;
(e)   emergency action plan guidelines;
(f)   inflow design flood and seismic criteria; and
(g)   other technical guidelines and criteria relating to dam design and dam
safety.
Documentation will include procedures, guidelines, forms of records, reporting form
formats and standard forms and checklists as required to enable the DSU to perform its
mission.
35.          Budgeting and Programming. As the executive arm for the national dam
safety program, it will be the responsibility of the DSU to develop a comprehensive annual
budget to ensure full implementation of the program. This budget must cover the
operational requirements of the DSU staff as well as the needs of the DSU.
36.          Reporting. The DSU will be involved in substantial reporting requirements
to the DSC to other elements of the Government, to the general public, and to the national
and international dam safety community. Periodic reports will be required from the DSU
by the DSC in order to allow the DSC to perform its oversight function of the dam safety
programn. Budget, personnel, and other administrative reporting will be required of the
DSU from the Ministry of Public Works. Additional reports will be necessary to inform
the general public of the dam safety assurance program and because of the high level of
technical expertise of the DSU staff, technical reports on various technical matters will be
of great interest to the consulting and academic communities on both a national and
international level.
37.          Training. The DSU will be responsible for arranging for, and in some
cases conducting, training for the DSC members, dam owners staff, provincial dam safety
personnel, DSU's own staff, and consultants. The objective of the training program is to
upgrade the expertise of all those involved in dam safety by presenting courses dealing



- 39 -                          ANNEX 2
with dam safety assurance and organization, dam safety inspections, design aspects of
dams including hydrology and geotechnical issues, construction techniques, instrumentation
of dams, maintenance and operational aspects of dams , and design and monitoring of dam
remedial works.
38.          It is essential that a comprehensive long-term training plan be developed
that will enable those concerned with dam safety to remain current with accepted technical
procedures pertaining to dam safety and to provide training for new personnel entering the
arena of dam safety.
39.          Development of a Public Awareness Strategy. The DSC is responsible
for developing a national dam safety awareness program designed to inform the general
population of the importance of dams to the economic well-being of Indonesia and to
advise the public of dam safety procedures and activities. The responsibility of the DSU
will be to assist the DSC in these activities by providing technical assistance where needed
and by conducting training programs that benefit all segments of society.
C. DAM MoNIToRING UNITS
40.          There is a need to strengthen the owners' capacity to implement the
necessary remedial works. The inspections and evaluations of the DSU would identify the
items that are deficient and it then becomes the owners' responsibility to respond. MPW
agencies need more capacity to carry out the surveys, investigations, designs of remedial
works, contract administration and construction supervision.   A  proposed new
Subdirectorate of Large Structures would be in charge of implementing the remedial works
program for MPW dams. In addition, a central Dam Monitoring Unit (DMU) to be
located in this subdirectorate, and a number of provincial DMUs, would assist in
coordinating the initial inventory of MPW dams, gathering data, selecting basic safety
facilities and collecting and evaluating field monitoring information. After the project is
completed, this monitoring activity will continue under the direction of the central DMU.
41.          For the duration of the implementation period of this project, the Head of
the proposed new Subdirectorate of Large Structures would be the Project Manager. This
person would direct the entire range of activities from establishing the dam safety
institutions, arranging for dam inspections and evaluations, to the implementation of the
remedial works program. The Project Manager would also direct the procurement of
associated equipment for the project and be the primary contact person with the Bank.
The DSU on the regulatory side would be separate organizationally from the proposed new
Subdirectorate of Large Structures charged with handling of construction and maintenance.
The Subdirectorate of Large Structures would be responsible for construction of new dam
projects as well as implementation of remedial works on existing dams. The proposed
organizational arrangements are shown in Charts 1 and 3.
42.          The proposed new Subdirectorate of Large Structures would be responsible
for environmental screening of dams, and for preparation of Environmental Impact
Assessments, Environmental Action Plans and Resettlement Plans, should they be required.

1.          The objective of the proposed training program is to develop a high level
of expertise in the dam safety institutions (DSC and DSU) and to upgrade the expertise of
Ministry of Public Works and other dam owners' staff capability in dam safety assurance
matters. Training of the members of the DSC and the staff of the DSU and the dam
owners is considered to be of fundamental importance both in terms of the immediate
requirement for inspection and safety assessments of dams and in terms of the programs'
long-term sustainability. The strategy, approach and methodology proposed for the
training program include extensive over-seas and in-country training, broad coverage of
all technical disciplines in a class-room environment, and extensive hands-on field
experiences guided by experienced international consultants. Training topics include dam
safety inspections, design aspects of dams (structural, hydrologic and hydraulic),
construction techniques, instrumentation, and design and monitoring of dam remedial
works.
2.           Technology for design, construction and inspection of dams continues to
develop. Staff engaged in dam safety matters must be educated in new techniques and
trained in their use as an on-going activity. The strategic aim of the proposed training
program, therefore, is to promote a shift from dependency on external expertise across the
range of dam inspection, surveillance and operation and maintenance activities to a position
of greater self-sufficiency and capability of MPW staff to address the longer term needs
of the dam safety program. The selection and retention of skilled individuals is the most
critical factor in the successful implementation of this strategy.
3.           The key elements of the training program will include the following topics:
(a)   dam safety program establishment, including the organization, function and
responsibilities of the DSC, DSU and DMUs;
(b)   inventory, registration and hazard classification;
(c)   detailed site inspections;
(d)   stability evaluations;
(e)   hydrologic assessment and evaluation of flood handling capability;
(f)   dam design and construction;
(g)   dam rehabilitation;
(h)   emergency action planning;
(i)   operation, maintenance and surveillance;
(j)   environmental screening; and
(k)   resettlement plans.

INDONESIA
DAM SAFETY PROJECT
BASIC DAM SAFErY FACIxITIES
1.           Many of the older dams in Indonesia were not originally equipped with
features that are now considered indispensable. In addition, after long use with minimal
maintenance and care, there is frequently very little left of the original records and
drawings that define the dam's physical characteristics. In other cases, erosion, wear and
tear, and deterioration of portions of dams have modified the basic conditions of the dam
over the years. An assessment will be made of missing basic facilities and basic data of
the dam and appurtenances early in the project period. A program will then be initiated
to add these basic facilities and to gather the technical data prior to the more formal safety
inspections and design of remedial work. Most common deficiencies are measuring
devices and instrumentation, communications equipment, back-up operations equipment,
the original drawings of the dam, and records of past physical modifications. The needs
for each dam will vary and it will require a process of careful inventory, prioritization and
allocation of funds to implement this component of the project. The objective is to start
with the activities which can reduce the risk of dam failure, prior to the time more
extensive remedial works can be carried out. In some cases the addition of the basic safety
facilities may be the only action required for an existing dam.
2.           Early in the project period, one of the primary activities will be the overall
inventory of dams throughout the country. This inventory will be conducted under the
direction of the Dam Safety Unit (DSU) in close cooperation with the Dam Monitoring
Unit (DMU), the operations staff at each dam and the consultants. The inventory will
involve a visit to each dam and collection of as much information as possible on the dam's
physical features from the existing operating personnel at the dam site. These inventory
inspections will not make a full evaluation of the dam's safety status but will determine
the additional information needed, and will outline the basic facilities needed for future
detailed inspections and evaluations.
3.           Once the inventory process is nearly complete, the DSU and DMUs will
consult to determine the priority of sites to receive the basic safety facilities and to outline
a program for implementation. The new Subdirectorate of Large Structures will be in
charge of implementing the program and may use a series of consultancy contracts to assist
in this process. These facilities should be in place and the data collection initiated prior
to the formal inspection by the DSU. Any additional facilities that may be required would
be included in the subsequent dam remedial work for the inspected dam. The Dam Safety
Unit will also give the dam operations and maintenance staff advice and guidance on
monitoring and protection of the instrumentation or equipment provided.



- 45 -                           ANNEX 4
4.           The basic dam safety facilities are broadly defined as items that assist the
operation and maintenance personnel at the dam to assess emergency situations and to
respond with timely actions that can often mean the difference between failure or saving
a dam. One of the more critical aspects of most dams is to be able to monitor and control
the flow releases during a major flood. Thus equipment that can assure that the operator
has access to information at this time and can quickly respond is important. Reservoir
level markers, data on the storage volume for every increment of reservoir rise, backup
operator devices such as handwheels, gate motor operators, standby power supplies for
flood gates, and communications equipment to allow those at the site to report and
coordinate critical actions during flood operations.
5.           Another type of basic facilities is adequate instrumentation for monitoring
the dam's performance. The most common items needed to be measured at a dam are the
seepage and main dam section movement or settlement. Sudden changes in these two
elements are very positive indicators that something is happening to the dam that requires
either investigation or remedial action. During the inspection for the inventory, an
assessment will be made of the instrumentation for seepage flow measurements. Probable
measuring points and size of the measuring devise will be noted.  In larger earth
embankments, peizometers may be needed to measure hydrostatic pressures within the
embankment at various locations. These will be noted and added under basic safety
facilities. A system for establishing an elevation control and measuring the dam
settlements, crest erosion or structural deformation will often be required. In some cases
it may be practical to install this only after remedial work is performed if such remedial
work requires major additions or raising of the embankment sections. In all cases the
furnishing and installation of these additional measuring devices will be provided if they
do not presently exist in the dams.
6.           Table 1 of this Annex presents a categorization of the types of equipment
and actions that would be provided under this component of work. It is estimated that
basic facilities would be provided, or additional survey and data gathering performed, for
about 60 percent of the dams within the project period.

INDONESIA
DAM SAFETY PROJECT
REMEDIAL WORKS
Nature of Works
1.          Many of the dams in Indonesia have not received the needed level of
maintenance and care to keep the facilities in top working and safety conditions. With
water resources utilization and management becoming more vital to the future development
of the country, it is imperative that the country's dams be made safe and upgraded to
provide continued service. The process of inventory and prioritization of the inspection
and evaluation program by the Dam Safety Unit will be dependent on the hazard
classification and the initially noted deficiencies. There may be a number of dams which
have been neglected in regard to maintenance but still are stable and effective in their
function. While lack of maintenance will eventually weaken a dam's performance
capability, it may still pose only a small risk from the standpoint of dam safety. The
project purpose is not to rehabilitate all dams to their original condition but to assess their
safety and assure they do not present a high public risk due to their condition. It will be
difficult to separate items of work on the dams between what is rehabilitative and what is
remedial for the purpose of safety.
2.           The remedial work to upgrade dams for safety reasons most commonly
involve their structural elements or their capability to safely pass the appropriate flood
events. The proper functioning of control valves and other electrical and mechanical
equipment is also important as is the capability of the dam operation and maintenance staff
to know the physical condition of their dam at all times. The nature of the remedial work
to be performed under the project will vary considerably from dam to dam and the specific
design is determined only after detailed investigations, analysis and evaluation by
competent dam engineers. The project therefore includes a provision for consultant
services in regard to detailed surveys, field investigations (and possible field exploration
and materials testing), and professional dam engineering analysis. The preparation of the
remedial designs is often as difficult as the preparation of the original dam design. In
some cases the technical analysis may require the services of highly specialized dam
engineers, available only from foreign sources. It is therefore expected that foreign
engineers, local engineers and in-house MPW staff will all participate in preparation of
remedial works designs and contract documentation preparation.
Implementation
3.          Implementation of the remedial works component may take a variety of
forms. The most common will be to prepare a civil works type contract and solicit bids
from firms with the capacity and experience to carry out the remedial work. This will



- 48 -                          ANNEX 5
require professional construction supervision by DGWRD and in most cases close
cooperation with the dam operations staff.  In addition the continuing operational
requirements of the dam often limits or restricts the actions that can be taken or requires
the remedial work to be spread over a longer time period to avoid serious disruption of
water deliveries. On the construction side there is the possibility that the maintenance
crews can implement some of the desired work. Under this project the general dam safety
consultant will need to provide guidance to the Subdirectorate of Large Structures in
determining how each remedial work should be carried out. There will also be situations
where the survey, investigations and designs for three to five dams might be contracted
to one consultant. In other cases the work may be highly complex and of a high level of
importance and thus require the services of an experienced international consultant firm.
Readiness for Implementation
4.           The most prominent dam to receive remedial action is the Jatiluhur Dam
which is located on the Citarum River, approximately 150 kilometers upstream of Jakarta.
All other dams have been placed in categories by degree of readiness for implementation
of remedial works (Categories A, B, and C). Remedial works for Jatiluhur and 11 other
dams have been designed. These 'Category A" dams are the following:
Cacaban                              Ngancar
Malayahu                             Cengklik
Penjalin                             Greneng
Nglangon                             Simo
Darma                                Batok
Sanggeh
It is expected that the remedial works for these dams could be tendered and placed under
contract within the first six months of the project. Construction periods will be different
for each but the average time for completion after start of work is estimated to be
approximately nine months. Due to these dams having near final designs backed by field
surveys, a physical contingency factor of 10 percent has been applied to the cost estimates.
For Jatiluhur Dam, the main contract for the strengthened rockfill section has been
prepared following detailed surveys and estimates, thus a 5 percent physical contingency
factor was used in the cost estimate. For the two other contracts at Jatiluhur, a 10 percent
factor was employed.
5.           In April-June 1992, 25 dams were inspected by the project preparation
consultant team. Ten of those dams were deemed to be in need of remedial work in
advance of the others and conceptual designs were outlined and rough cost estimates
prepared. Additional investigations and design work will be needed at such sites. The
following dams have been placed in 'Category B" in regard to the degree of readiness:
Gembong                              Ketro
Krisak                               Klego
Batujai                              Embung Bringe
Pacal                                Sampean Baru
Gondang                              Setu Patok



-49-                           ANNEX 5
Due to the need for more investigations and designs for these dams, a 15 percent physical
contingency factor was used in the cost estimates. It is estimated that four of these dams
could be investigated, surveyed, designed and remedial works performed within a year of
project initiation.  The other six are estimated to require two years for complete
implementation. The location of the Category A and B dams is shown in Map 25605
attached to this report.
6.           About 70 dams have been classified as 'Category C" dams. Some 20
ICOLD dams are included in this category. Subject to inspection, investigation and
completion of design, required remedial works would be undertaken from FY1996/97
through FY 1999/2000.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
7.           The remedial works are not expected to necessitate the acquisition of
addidonal land for new rights-of-way, and therefore the issue of resettlement of people is
not expected to arise. No additional land is required for Jatiluhur or any of the Category
A dams for which works designs have been completed.
8.           Should land be needed for any of the Category B and C dams, a plan would
be prepared in accordance with the following requirements to be agreed at negotiations:
(a)    Remedial works will be designed in a manner which will help minimize
displacement and adverse effect on incomes of affected people.
(b)   All remedial works requiring resettlement/relocation will provide for
appropriate compensation for assets based on market value (including
logistical support for moving, and relocation as required).
(c)   Action plans will provide for all measures and compensation required to
restore the standard of living of all affected people, as fairly and equally
as possible, whether their land rights are customary or formal.
(d)   Preparation of these action plans will be based, inter alia, on consultation
of affected people, surveys of land titles and ownership of dwellings and
of affected residents.
(e)   The action plans will have a clear implementation timeframe and
construction works will not start within or adjacent to the relocation area
before required resettlement has been completed.
(f)    The process will be transparent.  Information relating to the people
affected, the compensation they are entitled to, the available options or
alternatives and the grievance and appeals procedures will be provided by
the project manager and made readily available to the executing agency and
the Bank.



- 50 -                         ANNEX 5
(g)   The action plans will specify the organizational responsibilities for
implementation and supervision and measures needed to strengthen the
capabilities of agencies involved in accordance with the requirements of the
prevailing GOI laws and regulations.
(h)   The final cost estimates will include all costs required for the satisfactory
implementation, and the management and monitoring of the land acquisition
and resettlement/relocation plans and Bank approval will be subject to all
necessary funds having been budgeted for.
9.           With regard to the question of appropriate compensation based on market
value [item (b) above], before developing methodologies to be used for establishing market
value of properties, DGWRD will seek relevant information from the Bureau of Statistics,
the taxation authorities and the Land Agency, and will exchange views with the Bank on
the findings and proposals developed based on these findings.

Construction Supervision at Jatiluhur
3.           The consultant services for construction supervision of remedial works at
Jatiluhur Dam are scheduled over a period of about 27 months, starting January 15, 1995,
and involving about 215 staff-months. The team is expected to include four senior
expatriate engineers with expertise in dams, construction, concrete and geotechnics, for



- 53 -                            ANNEX 6
a total of about 65 staff-months. There would be ten Indonesian engineers on the team,
covering dams, construction (3), concrete, contracts, roads, quality control, geodetic, and
environment, for a total of about 150 staff-months. The consultants' expertise is required
for:
(a)    assistance and advice to the Project Manager during the tendering process,
including tender evaluation, if and when required;
(b)    day-to-day assistance and advice in construction supervision and quality
control;

throughout the project period for the planning, investigation, design, and implementation
of the remedial works and basic safety facilities components at dams other than Jatiluhur.
Normally, the required services will be available from Indonesian firms. However,
occasionally the need for foreign technical advice may arise during project implementation.
The main consultant for institutional strengthening and training will assist DGWRD with
the drafting of terms of reference for the various services needed. The areas of expertise
will cover:
(a)    surveys, e.g., site surveys of existing structures, cross sections and
longitudinal profiles of existing embankments and channels;
(b)   investigations, e.g., foundation, soil mechanics, and hydrological studies;
(c)    designs,  covering  hydraulic,  structural,  mechanic  and  electrical
requirements of the proposed works;
(d)    preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental
Action Plans; and
