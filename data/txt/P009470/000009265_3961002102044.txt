MEMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A FOREST RBESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of
Bangladesh for SDR 36.4 million, the equivalent of US$49.6 million, on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for
forest resources management.
2.        Backit    .  Some 3 million ha, or about 24X of Bangladesh's total
land area, is classified as forest, but only about 0.9 million ha is covered
with trees. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) owns about 2 million ha of
forest land; the rest comprises village forests and homestead woodlots. Most
of the state forest, about 1.5 million ha, is managed by the Forest Department
(FD) in the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF). Bangladesh's annual
wood production is estimated at 9.5 million m3, of which 20X is converted
mainly to sawn timber, while 80% is smallwood used primarily for fuel. Only
2 million m3 is produced from the state forest; the remainder comes from
private sources, mainly homestead plantations. Annual per capita consumption
of wotod is about 0.1 m , one of the lowest in the world. Wood is unavailable
in many rural areas, with the result that agricultural residues and dung
provide about 901 of rural energy sources. Parastatel corporations own and
operate all the country's large sawmills and the pulp and paper mills. The
private sector owns about 1,630 small sawmills and some plywood and match
plants. All wood industries face irregular and inadequate wood supplies.
3.        GOB's overall objectives in the forestry sector are to optimize
sustainable production of goods and services from the existing limited forest
lands, expand the current forest cover, and improve the overall environmental
condition of the country. The Government's strategy aims at improving the
forest's productive and protective base through better management, investment
in coastal plantations, rehabilitation of degraded forest areas, and promotion
of people's participation in managing and utilizing forest resources.
Proposed actions focus on (a) bringing all forest resources under objective-
oriented management; (b) establishing plantations, including coastal
plantations, to stabilize newly accreted lands and protect from cyclones;
(c) identifying and managing protective areas to conserve nature;
(d) improving planning, implementation, monitoring and environmental
management capabilities of sector institutions; and (e) expanding the
information base by undertaking research programs. To develop a long-term
perspective for the sector, GOB is preparing a Forestry Sector Master Plan,
which will draw extensively on the policy dialogue carried out between GOB and
IDA during the preparation of the proposed project, and which is expected to
include the policy and institutional reforms covered by the project. 1J
4.        The sector faces a number of problems.  Extreme pressure on the
land by the large agrarian population is the main cause of current
A/ Master Plan preparation is being supported by an operation financed by
ADB, UNDP and PAO. IDA will provide input at all critical stages of Plan
preparation and actively contribute to the resolution of policy and
institutional issues including those that are not addressed under the project.



deforestation, while uncontrolled utilization, including illogal felling, is a
key factor in resource degradation. These problems have been exacerbated by
the long time taken by GOB to lntroduce a people-oriented approach to forestry
development. Weak management capability of sector institutions, shortages of
technical staff, and limited and interrupted funding of planned sector
investments are also important factors hindering development.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Inmolvement.  IDA's sector
dialogue with GOB and its financial support to the sector have concentrated on
the need for a sustainable supply of forest products and services. In this
context, IDA has financed two projects: the Msngrove Afforestation Project
(Cr. 1042-BD), which closed in June 1986, and the ongoing Second Forestry
Project (Cr. 1634-BD), which is scheduled to close in June 1992. Tne projects
have been generally successful in meeting their objectives, and they have
taught several lessons for future forest development. In particular,
experience gained under both projects points to the need for improved
arrangements and procedures in areas such as program development and approval,
monitoring and accountability, and budget preparation. It has also become
clear that forest development will not be sustainable unless local people and
their needs are fully integrated. In addition, environmental aspects must
play a more prominent role in the planning and decision-making process. The
experience under these projects has also underlined the need for sound
policies on (a) forestry education and recruitment, to enable FD to upgrade
its professional and technical capabilities; and (b) pricing, to properly
value the forest products sold to state-owned industries.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project would form an integral
part of IDA's ongoing sectoral support strategy, which focuses on a
sustainable supply of forest products and services through the establishment
of forest plantations, better management of existing resources and improved
effectiveness of sector institutions. It would enable GOB and IDA to
consolidate initiatives undertaken in the first and second IDA-financed
forestry projects. IDA's involvement would help ensure that the improvements
made and lessons drawn from these projects would be appropriately integrated
into the sector's future development and that experience from other countries
could be brought to Bangladesh's forestry operations. In particular, IDA
would be able to contribute to the establishment of (a) a functional and
accountable FD, equipped with up-to-date resource management technology and
well-trained staff; (b) a sound forest policy, responsive to environmental and
social goals and realities of the country; (c) education and training
facilities capable of supplying the sector with qualified staff; and (d) an
effectively managed area system for nature conservation. In addition, the
project would be an instrument to attain the development and conservation
goals outlined in the Bank's 1991 Forest Sector Policy Paper, especially with
regard to (i) encouragement of sustainable forest resource use and
d'scouragement of deforestation, (ii) forest resource expansion, (iii) local
people's participation in forest management, and (iv) nature preservation.
The project would also help IDA achieve its poverty alleviation objectives.
7.'       Prolect Objectives. The project's primary objectives would be to
(a) establish and maintain a forest management system that is fully responsive
to the country's economic, environmental and social goals; (b) improve the
productivity of Government-owned forests to help meet the country's wood and
energy needs; and (c) protect the country's environment. These objectives
would be achieved by (i) improving and further institutionalizing the Resource
Information Nanagement System which evolved under the Second Forestry Project;



- 3 -
(ii) integrating environmental and socio-economic facturs into resource
management; (iii) implementing a pilot scheme for people's participation in
forest development; (iv) expanding forest resources through plantation
establishment and improved management; (v) formulating management plans for
nature conservation areas, and supporting investments in selected sanctuaries
and parks; (vi) streamlining FD's organization, and creating within FD an
effective environmental management capability; and (vii) supporting
professional and technical education and training, and mangrove research.
8.        Project Description.  The project, to be implemented over seven
years, would comprise four components: (a) Forest Resources Management,
(b) Forest Resources Expansion, (c) Nature Conservation, and (d) Institutional
Support. The Eorest Resources Management Component would help ensure that
allocation and intensity of forest uses would be regulated in accordance with
sound forest management plans (FM?s). It would finance additional planning
capacity within FD; new forest resource inventories; improved data collection
and processing systems; preparation of new, and revision of existing, FMPs;
pilot activities to involve local communities in forest development and
protection; and silvicultural treatment of forest stands. The Forest
Resources Expansion Component would support the establishment of some 60,000
ha of new mangrove and conventional forest plantations to rehabilitate
degraded forest areas, regenerate harvested stands, and consolidate newly
accreted land along the Bay of Bengal. This component would also continue
tending programs for young plantations established under the Second Forestry
Project.  Under the Nature Conservation Component, management plans would be
prepared for all national parks and wildlife sanctuaries where adequate
natural values exist. The project would meet the investment requirements for
the three Sundarbans sanctuaries and provide US$500,000 to help meet
investment needs in the remaining protected areas. The plans for these areas
would be used for soliciting additional funding from international donor
agencies. The Institutional Support CouMonent would help FD reorganize its
headquarters and expand its field organization in line with the needs of FD's
key functions and the needs of the project. It would also establish a new
Environmental Management Wing within FD. The component would further support
the education of professional foresters at the Institute of Forestry of the
Chittagong University (IFCU), and the training of technical staff at FD's
training facilities. The Bangladesh Forest Research Institute (BFRI) would
receive assistance for continuing and expanding the mangrove research started
under the Second Forestry Project, and for revitalizing its mangrove
silviculture division in Khulna. The project's cost is estimated at
US$58.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$16.2 million (281)
and duties and taxes of US$3.3 million. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Bangladesh Pre shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10377-BD, dated
May 21, 1992, is being distributed separately.
9.        Project Implementation.  MOEF would have overall responsibility for
project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and would establish a
Project Steering Committee to assist the Ministry in these tasks. PD, IFCU
and BFRI would be in charge of day-to-day project implementation, with the
latter two responsible for strengthening professional foresters' education and
mangrove research, respectively. The implementation capacities of these
agencies are not fully adequate to meet the needs of the project. For areas



4-
where improva_ents are required (such as planning and monitoring) and for new
activities (such as participatory forest development and environmental
management), the project would provide for institutional strengthening and for
the engagement of technical experts and tht expertise of non-governmental
organizations (NOOs).
10.       Project Sustainabilit!.  The project would include technical
assistance, training and education programs designed to strengthen the
capacity and capabilities of the implementing agencies. It would also ensure
that (a) forestry operations would be regulated through appropriate,
environmentally sound WfPs; (b) people's participation in forest development
and protection would be given adequate attention; and (c) wood and concession
prices charged to public sector ent.ties would be set at appropriate levels to
prevent over-exploitation of the forest resources.
11.       Ag4na -Actions.  During negotiations, agrementg were reached with
GOB that: (a) before undertaking logging in natural forests, environmental
assessments be carried out and adverse impacts mitigated in accordance with
agreements with IDA; (b) PD adopt appropriate procedures for program and
budget preparation, approval, and funds release; (c) a technical assistantce
team with membership and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA be established
by December 31, 1992; (d) MOEF's Planning and Monitoring Cell be fully staffed
by October 31, 1992; (e) PD's revised organizational structure be adopted by
October 31, 1992, and staff to fill the key positions under the new structure
be selected by December 31, 1992; (f) for participatory forest development, PD
enter into contracts with NGOs, satisfactory to IDA, by October 31, 1992;
(g) FD establish, by December 31, 1992, a core teaching staff consisting of
appropriately trained teachers with a suitable minimum tenure; (h) MOEP's new
staffing and recruitment policy -- designed to upgrade PD's professional and
technical skill level -- be put into effect by October 31, 1992; (i) FD's
future forest operations be regulated by and carried out strictly in
accordance with MNPs; (j) FMPs be prepared, implemented and revised in
accordance with a Forest Management Manual, satisfactory to IDA; (k) BPRI's
silviculture division be fully staffed by December 31, 1992; (1) GOB would not
adopt any Forestry Sector Master Plan recommendation which may have a material
and adverse impact on project implementation; (n) GOB undertake two detailed
project implementation reviews; and (n) wood and concession prices charged to
public sector institutions be set at market prices in accordance with an
agreed timetable.
12.       Conditions of effectiveness would be (a) approval by GOB of the
Project Proforma; (b) establishment of the Project Steering Committee;
(c) issuance of a GOB order, satisfactory to IDA, on land allocation for
mWangrove plantations; (d) establishment of a land allocation committee; and
(e) implementation of the agreed timetable for raising to market levels the
wood and concession prices charged to public sector entities.
13.       knvlromental Ane&ls.  An environmental analysis has concluded
that the project would be unlikely to have a negative environmental impact.
Nevertheless, the project would include the following activities to improve
the environment: (a) establishing within FD the capacity to develop sound
environmental standards and criteria for forestry operations -- appropriately
taking into account effects on tribal groups residing in or adjacent to
forests -- and to carry out enmironmental assessments and formulate
preventative and mitigating measures where adverse impacts would arise from
such operations; (b) financing a Nature Conservation Component designed to



- 5 -
expand and improve the management of wildlife sanctuaries and other protected
areas; and (c) supporting a pilot scheme designed to advance people's
participation in forest development to counter forest degradation and enhance
community welfare.
14.       Prgora  Obgective Categ2rles.  The project would provide about
83,500 person years of employment to rural people and improve the incomes of
villagers by adopting forest management practices which would be responsive to
local needs. It would also integrate environmental aspects (including the
concerns of tribal groups) into forestry operations and support several
specific nature conservation activities. In addition, it would enhance
women's roles. Under the project's pilot scheme for participatory forest
management, special measures would be taken to ensure that women would
function not only as laborers, but also as active managers in pilot
activities.
15.       Project Benefits.  The project's main direct benefit would be the
production of wood for industrial use and fuel consumption. Total incremental
production over the project's life is estimated at about 15 million m3, with
an economic value of about US$652 million. The incresased availability of
fuelwood would reduce the use of imported kerosene; agricultural waste
products used for fuel would be used more for fodder; and dung could be used
as featilizer. The project would also provide 1,150 permanent staff positions
and create labor requirements for about 83,500 person years. I would further
strengthen the capacity of sector agencies to effect sustainable,
environmentally and socially sound forest development. In addition,
significant environmental and social benefits would be expected from the
project's nature conservation and participatory forest development activities.
The project's economic rate of return is estimated at 161.
16.       Risks. There are no major risks.  However, natural events,
especially cyclones and storm surges, could damage young and established
plantations. Due to wide spacial distribution of coastal plantations, such
damage would likely be limited. (It should be considered that, in cases of
such natural disasters, the affected plantations would normally provide
protection to inland properties.) Further, plantations could be damaged by
uncontrolled activities of nearby communities. This risk would be minimized
by promoting and establishing peoples' participation in forest resources
development. Finally, poor performance of implementing agencies could reduce
the level of the expected benefits. To minimize this risk, technical
assistance, training and monitoring would be provided under the project to
improve the performance of project institutions.
17.       Rocomndatio. I am satisfied that the proposed development
credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recomvend that the Executive Directors approve it.
