3.3 Original Components:
The project has the following components:
(a)    Forest Resources Management. This component would help ensure that the allocation and
intensity of forest uses would be regulated in accordance with appropriate forest management plans
(FMPs). It would establish additional planning capacity within the Forest Department (FD); carry out
new forest resource inventories; improve data collection and processing systems; prepare new FMPs, and
revise and update existing FMPs, as required; develop and implement pilot activities to involve local
communities in forest development and protection; and undertake silvicultural treatment of forest stands;
(b)    Forest Resources Expansion. This component would fund some 60,000 ha of new mangrove and
conventional forest plantations through rehabilitating degraded forest areas, regenerating harvested stands,
and consolidating newly accreted land along the Bay of Bengal. In addition, tending programs for young
vlantations established under the Second Forestry Proiect would be continued;
(c)    Nature Conservation. Management nlans would be orenared for all national narks and wildlife
sanctuaries where adequate natural values exist. The component would meet the investment requirements
for the three Sundarbans sanctuaries and provide US$500X000 to hen meet investment needs in the
remaining protected areas. The plans for these areas would be used for soliciting additional funding from
intpmntinnil dnnnr nuenniet; nnd

The project design adequately addressed the objectives and recognized many of the design
shortcorings and implementation lessons learned from the iDA-funded Second Forestry Project and
incorporated interventions and covenants to address them. However, in the Forest Resource Expansion
component, althougn it consiaerea that secona ana tra tminnmgs unaer tne project woula oe
'self-financed', the design did not ensure that a secure funding mechanism was in place for these operations
to maintain and manage the plantations effectively after the project closes. Tne design also did not include
any substantial interventions for improving yields through tree improvement and more adaptable
silvicultural operations. Components could have been better structured'to ensure proper linkage between
existing plantation silviculture and the establishment of new plantations recognizing that forest resource
expansion is not merely a matter of planting and maintaining trees, but doing this within a planned
management context. The design adequately considered the Bank's operational directives on safeguard
policies; specifically with regard to the environment, indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement.
3. 4 R1evised CopnMJumenis:
Essentially, the components remaine-Ad unaltered, nlthnoug6h the scale of activties did cha.nge as field
circumstances altered, and in response to the ongoing implementation experience. The project design
specified two deta-iled implementation re;vews. At the fi-st rev-ie in 1996, the folow-i-g r""" were
made: (i) mangrove plantation target was reduced from 32,900 ha to 26,000 ha because of a reduction in
siltaton and nonravailability of adequat.e newly..aceted land; (;i) t..he ;u.A,. s-i, p   *. get was
increased from 27,000 ha to 33,000 ha to re-plant the area severely damaged by the 1994 cyclone; (iii) the

(PBMES) for forestry operations was developed and piloted.
Following the second review in June 1999, further revisions to components were made: (i) the
mangrove plant'wu ion wrget 01 33,000 [ha1 was rVe-esLblisheu, uccause uo a iarge area oI siit accretion
following the 1998 floods; (ii) the industrial plantation target was increased to 38,000 ha to bring
addiiuonau degraded forest land under tree cover, (iii) pilot PFD sites were increased to rune, covering 85u
ha and with 675 participants responding to the increasing success of PFD activities and increased
community interest and FD commitment; (iv) preparation of an inventory of Chittagong Hill Tracts forests
was initiated following 1997 Peace Accord which, inter alia, allowed resumption of FD activities in the
area; and (v) the PBvMuS was expanded to cover all forest, enviromnent and management plan divisions in
Chittagong Forest Circle.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is rated as satisfactory. The project objectives were consistent with GOB
segic    pro-- tie in theiF.o r - i ve=Ye n   ar 1D- ..we!! as .. , +_  -'s  C+, A -   -_ Ti+nS-
and Forest Policy. The project also formed part of the Bank's sectoral support strategy for the country.
The design assessed the capacity of te implementing agency and recognized tUhe sh--tcomings and lessons
from the previous forestry project. It adequately assessed the risks associated with the project, particularly

should have been included to ensure adequate and timely funding for silvicultural operations during and
after the project as well as to initiate changes in the operational management of plantations to ensure a
more commercial and objective-based approach to plantation development and management
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. I flhcomfn/ahh,o,,,ant ofuo,.ti,,o
Achievement of objectives and outDuts under the project was satisfactory. The basis for an
improved forest management system has been established, with the preparation of updated inventory and
mapping of the country's forest resources; preparation of integrated forest management plans for each
Forestry Division; -expansion and updating of the Resource Information Management System (RIMS);
establishment of social and environrnental divisions within FD; integration of forest fringe commnunities
into participatory forest development; reorganization of the Institute of Forestry as the Institute of Forestry
and Envirnmental Scienres, Chittagong Universitv (aFESCI N; and strengthening mangrove research
system in BFRI. Wood production potential has been increased, with 71,000 ha of trees established

The project has a positive social and economic impact on landless and disadvantaged forest fringe
d-wellers throughi the PFv. The pr-ovision of forest lad for agrculural and hortic-ulura crops,
supplemented with initial payments for forest development and management has greatly improved food and
income security for this group. F-utUre income should be 1inceased -when tue wood prod-ucts are Harv-ested,

adaptation, for future participatory forestry programs.
However, although specified in the management plans, IFNMP resource data is not being regularly
updated despite this being an essential element in plantation management. Moreover, the environmental
and social data that has been collected, have not yet been used to update the RIMS. A further shortcoming
of this component is that the silvicultural operations are not being carried out in accordance with
management plans. The first thinning of 5,000 ha of plantations established under the previous project was
funded by FRMP and completed. However, only 17% of targeted second thinnings and 11% of third
thinnings were completed. These latter thinnings should be self-financing, and were expected to have been
funded by GOB, but only minimal budget was provided to the FD, inadequate for the scale of operations
needed. Silvicultural treatment of previously established mangrove plantations was achieved, but only 35%
of the targeted climber cutting in mangroves was done, due to financing and environmental constraints.
B.     Forest Resource Expansion. This component is rated satisfactory, as planting targets for both
mangroves and industrial plantations were exceeded. An area of 33,570 ha of mangroves was established
under the project in the coastal areas, against an SAR target of 32,900 ha. The plantations appear to be
satisfactory with survival of 70 to 90% from an initial dense planting of some 7,000 seedling per ha. This
continual expansion of the mangrove forests along the Bangladesh coast will serve multiple purposes,
including wood resources and new land for agriculture and grazing in a country where these resources are
scarce. They also provide enhanced fish breeding habitats as well as protection of life and property against
cyclonic winds and storm surges. About 36,500 ha of industrial plantations were planted, which was much
higher than the original target of 26,900 ha, but fell slightly short of the 1999 revised target of 38,000 ha.
Just over half the plantations were short rotation (18 years), while the rest was planted with teak and other
long-rotation (40 years) hardwoods. Overall though. trees appear to have been successfully planted with
reasonable survival rates. However, budgetary restrictions and a lack of flexibility for discretionary
silvicultural treatments have meant that the correct species were not always planted, and weeding may not
have been on time or has been inadequate, thereby affecting growth and yield. The project has helped
develop root trainer nursery techniaues; with about 500.0(0 seedlings now being produced per annum. But
apart from this, no other tree improvement activities were undertaken by the project.
C.     Nature Conservation. This component is rated as satisfactory. The main focus of this component
was the preparation and adptinn of rcnsenvation mannaement pnlns for .the thrnee sncthiuaries nf
Sundarbans to provide a more secure basis for biodiversity conservation within this ecosystem. In addition,

D.     Institutional Support. This component is rated as satisfactory. An initial reorganization of FD in
the first year of the project, established an Environmental Management Wing and two divisions as well as
an additional Forest Management Planning Division. A subsequent reorganization, which occurred in the
last year of the project, further strengthened wildlife and nature conservation as well as participatory
forestry development, planning, resource information management and monitoring. The amendment to the
Forest Act, sanctioning sharing of forest products from forest reserves with local communities, was an
essential key element in facilitating the promotion of PFD. A proposal to recruit only forestry qualified
persons for professional forestry positions was not finally accepted because of Public Service Commission
refusal to amend the current rules although allowance has been made for promotion of senior technical staff
through to junior professional level. Professional foresters education at the IFESCU was well supported
through civil works, curriculum development and staff fellowships for PhD studies. The Institute is now
well established to provide Bangladesh's future professional forestry training needs. The Forestry School in
Chittagong was further developed, through civil works and curriculum development, to train foresters
under a new three-year diploma program, with 150 students graduating during the project period.
However, the positions of Principal and Chief Lecturer are yet to be filled and half the forty staff are on the
revenue budget and assured of job security. The Forest Academy has successfully carried out in-service
training of forest officials and NGO staff during the project and is reasonably established in terms of
permanent staff and facilities to continue beyond the project.
The mangrove research program has generated valuable technology for mangrove nursery
management and plantation establishment, as well as knowledge on successional mangrove and
non-mangrove species for raised char lands. Under the project, BFRI has revised its mangrove research
program and strengthened the natural mangrove and plantation mangrove work at Khulna and Barisal.
BFRI has also carried out research on mangrove pest identification and control; organized a National
Mangrove Workshop involving FD. University and NGO narticinants; and conducted a studv on
participatory management of raised land in mangrove plantations.
A Programming, Budgeting, Monitoring and Evaluation System (PBMES) was developed under

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic re-evaluation of the project considered returns to the silvicultural treatment of areas
of existing industrial plantations, new industrial afforestation, the maintenance of industrial and mangrove
plantations established in the latter years of the Second Forestry Project, and the expansion of mangrove
plantations. As with the SAR, separate analyses were not done for the components concerning nature
conservation, institutional support and PFD.
On the basis of the currently estimated incremental timber, pole and fuelwood production, and
attributing some protective benefits to mangrove plantings, the overall economic rate of return to the
project is estimated at just under 13 percent compared with an ERR at appraisal of 16 percent. The
re-estimated ERR for industrial nlantations is 17.5 nercent comnared with an anoraisal estimate of 22
percent and the ERR for mangrove afforestation is re-estimated at 12 percent compared with 24 percent at
apprij sal=6
-rr~~~~~~~~~



Several reasons account for the differences, including: (a) the growth rates used at appraisal were
unrealistically high, particularly for mangroves and short rotation species; (b) silvicultural practices in the
industrial plantations were poorer than expected; (c) the rotation for mangroves was increased from 17 to
40 years because of the higher emphasis now being placed on tidal surge protection aspects, although the
intangible and environmental benefits from mangrove plantations have not been included in the analysis due
to lack of sufficient data. In addition. disease in the main mangrove snecies planted- and a harvest of only
60 percent of the trees adversely affected yields.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No financial rate of return was calculated in the SAR.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
iLne rroject'- ins'utuuonai develoopment impact was mouesi. snere nave Deen mstituuorai
developments within the FD through the project, including reorganization of FD and establishment of the
Wildlife and Nature Conservation Wing, and the Social Forestry Wing; additional capacity created for
forest resource planning and monitoring; strengthening of forestry education and training institutes; and a
provision of a considerable amount of in-service training. The amendment to the Forest Act was a major
policy breakthrough, as this allows the FD to more effectively undertake wildlife management, nature
conservation, forest management planning and participatory forestry. There has also been a change in
attitude in the FD towards the need for, and benefits of, enabling' the participation of local communities in
forest development and management.
However, what materialized during project implementation falls short of appraisal expectations,
particularly with regards to having a fully functional reorganized FD, reasonable wildlife and nature
conservation management as well as forest management institutional capability in place. FD continues to
face the problem of inadequate numbers of professionally qualified staff. Prior to the 2001 reorganization,
there were 114 professional forester's positions in FD, but only 85 of these were filled. At that
reorganization, these posts were increased from 114 to 221, but to date, only 68 new professional staff
have being recruited for the new structure, giving a total of only 153 of the 211 professional foresters posts
filled. In addition, continuation of the policy of promotion by seniority and not merit, means the FD is not
optimizing the potential benefits from professional forestry education supported under the project In
addition, FD has been restructured with provision for additional 1443 posts of different categories from
development to revenue budget, however, many staff employed under the project were not transferred from
the development to revenue budget and have no secure tenure.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Frequent hartals (strikes) particularly throughout 1996, hampered project implementation to some
extent. A cyclone in 1994 caused damage to plantations. including some established under FRMP. in the
Chittagong Circle. On the other hand, major floods in 1998 resulted in increased accretion of land in the
coastal areas. enabline the tareet to be increased for mangrove afforestation-
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
GOB failed to provide adequate funds for commercial thinning and final felling of mature
plantations, adversely affecting the potential returns from this investment; and the overly restrictive
- 7 -



irnplementation and budgetary control hampered sound silvicultural and plantation management practices.
The prevailing GOB human resources management policy with respect to recruitment, salary structure and
conditions inpeded FD's ability to attract and retain motivated and qualified staff; and at IFESCU, lengthy
and cumbersome procurement procedures under the Chittagong University system caused considerable
delays in procurement.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Too frequent rotation of professional staff within FD led to problems in institutional memory and
hindered implementation. Failure to recruit adequate staff for many positions hindered opeaonal
planning and management by FD, and there was too much reliance on consultants to undertake core
project-supported activities and inadequate attention to knowledge transfer to FD staff, with the result that
institutional strengthening in key areas, such as resource information, procurement, monitoring of field
operations, and forest management planning falls short from what might have been achieved.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:

reduction coming from the exchange rate savings and a decrease in funding for forest resources
management. Forest resources expansion cost was increased due w inacead areas of boti industial and
mangrove plantations, with achievements greater than appraisal targets. The increases were offset to some
degree by savings in institutional support components with reduced TA expenditure and the agreu decision
not to proceed with purchase of some boats for FD. About SDR 2.4 million was cancelled due to reduction
in goods (vehicles) and some services, and exchange rate adjustment in 1997. At Credit ciosing, about SDR
33.4 million (about 98 percent of the revised Credit amount) had been disbursed leaving SDR 0.55 million
to be cancelled. Disbursements over the first three years of the project were only about hanl of SAR
projections, and the project was at risk due to significant delays in procurement and hiring of technical
assistance, which had created high disbursement lag.
6. Sustainability
i. ! Rntin,,nIp fnr .s,itainnhiIitAv rating:
The proiect sustainability is rated as likely for most project achievements. Established mangrove
plantations are likely to be sustained because coastal communities have become well aware of the
protection and environmental benefit afforded by the mangrove plantations, although in localized spots
there will always be pressure from illegal encroachment on accreted land for agriculture in areas such as
Nnakhali and Chittaeong Divisions. adiacent to nonulation concentrations. Environmental efforts in the
coastal areas and bio-diversity conservation in the Sundarbans reserved forest will continue and grow
throuth the AnB and CTFF sunnorted pnriect which builds on the achievements of FRM. The
participatory/community forestry program has a strong social development and poverty alleviation

However, sustainability is unlikely for project industrial plantation activity, unless GOB takes
action to ensure that funding will be provided over the next tbree years for maintenance and first thinning of
conventional and mangrove plantation established under FRMP. Recently, a revolving fund has been
created for felling and carrying logs to the Forest Depot where they are auctioned. This is a positive
development and has eased the funding situation for clear felling and commercial thinnings. Building on the
project achievements, including satisfactory upgrading and implementation of the management plans
developed under the project, the medium to long-term sustainable management of the conventional
plantations is likely only if GOB provides adequate and timely funding and/or establishes a self-sustaining
funding mechanism for future plantation development and management.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
All implementing agencies undertook project activities as part of their ongoing operations, without
the involvement of a dedicated project unit, so from a management point of view, no specific transition
arrangements are necessary. There will be need for extemal funding for activities such as nature
conservation and possibly participatory forestry, and this is now being provided in projects funded by ADB
and GEF. Staff of FD trained under the project should be capable of maintaining and using the new
resource management tools, provided GOB budget allocations are adequate.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
This is rated as satisfactory. The project was well prepared by an experienced team in
collaboration with the Forest Department.  The design accurately assessed the capacity of each
implementing agency, and recognized the shortcomings and lessons leamed. However, more definitive
actions should have been included to ensure adequate and timely funding for silvicultural operations during
and after the project as well as to initiate changes in the operational management of plantations to ensure a
more commercial and objective-based approach to plantation development and management.
7.2 Supervision:
This is rated as satisfactory. Bank supervision was regular and the two detailed implementation
reviews undertaken in 1996 and 1999 provided valuable assessments of progress and recommendations for
future action. The project was managed from the Bank Headquarters till 1996 and after that from the field
office in Dhaka. Although generally the Bank's team provided an appropriate skills-mix with continuous
level of supervision support and guidance to the client, it would have been useful to have included more
forestry and environmentalwildlife expertise at crucial times to follow up on technical recommendations
from the MTRs and consultants and to assess and advise on the more esoteric aspects of plantation
management and nature conservation. Basing the supervision in the field office enabled a more interactive
approach in assisting GOB clients as a development partner.
7.3 Overall Bankperfornance:
This is rated as satisfactory.  Tne Bank's performance is rateu satisfactory in design,
implementation and client orientation, consistent with the above-mentioned ratings.

Satisfactory. Although there were some deficiencies in the Government and Implementing Agency
performance, particularly with the former, it is felt that ovemll performance of the Govemment is
satisfactory, based on the performance of the implementing agencies.
8. Lessons Learned

*   Tne project has demonstrated that mangrve es tablish-A^ment on accreted si't beds can stabuilZe these beds
and lead to the formation of new land masses, suitable for settlement and agriculture, while at the same
time protecting against damage to life and property fronm cyclones an-.d tiidal surges as well as producin^.g
forest products. However, sustainable management of mangrove plantations will depend on these being
a sound legal basis for tenure, within an agreed policy for disposition of tue .angroves and accreted
land to best determine whether these should be converted to agricultural or grazing use or maintained
as a protective belt and/or for wood production.
*   Effective development and management of forests and protection of wildlife and protected areas ,in
Bangladesh is not possible without considering the needs and possible involvement of marginal and
landless people adjacent to the forests. The project has demonstrated that a good partnership can be
developed with Forest Department, local communities and NGOs to alleviate poverty through forestry
development. Effective and sustainable participation of local people in forest development and
mnanagement requires a clear understanding and acceptance by both FD and the involved people of each
others' responsibilities and an equitable sharing of benefits. It also requires adequate inputs to ensure
early financial self-sufficiency for the participants, plus mechanisms to avoid and resolve conflicts with
other, nonparticipating communities.
9. Partner Comments
(Aa) BorrowerM/imnplemrntinTg agency:
In general, MOEF and the executing agencies endorsed the conclusions of the ICR, but made the
following comments/clarifications: (i) manpower development for sustainable mangrove research did not
get adeauate attention in the project; (ii) economic rate of return calculated by the ICR team is less than the
FD's own calculations, probably due to use of different rates of growth and yield data; and (iii) Government
implementation verformance rating should be "Satisfactory" because the satisfactory performance of the
implementing agencies is the performance of the Govenmment, since the agencies are the government
departments.The executive summarv of the borrower's own project evaluation report is presented in Annex

1.     ASSESSMENT OF TE PROjECT OJlECTTVE, DESIGN., IMPLEMENTATTON AND
OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE
The Forest Resources Management Project was started for a seven-year period from FY1992-93 to
FY1998=99. T ater ;t -uas extendedd up two Decembe-1r 2A-A1 Th e pr ,.n,-pm- mot of 'he ta...i.n.4*l anA
coastal areas of Bangladesh with a view to increasing the forest resources under a sound and sustainable

and timber is fulfilled by the village forest. Annual wood production is estimated at about 9.5 million mn of
which 80% is used for fuel and the rest 20% is either used as swan timber or poles. Annual per capital
consumption of wood is about 0.1 In', one of the lowest in the world.
The forestry sector contributes about 5% of GDP, but this does not reflect the true contribution of this
sector. The rural population uses fuel wood and other minor forest products practically free of cost.
Forest also plays an important role in protecting watersheds, irrigation and hydral structure, also in keeping
its rivers and ports navigable. It also plays key role in protecting the coastal areas from natural calamities,
in reclaiming land from the sea. The role of forests in protecting the environment from pollution and its
contribution towards bio-diversity is not doubt immense. The World Bank-funded Forest Resources
Management Project had contributed much to build up a new resource base in the forestry sector of
Bangladesh.
Design, Implementation and Operation Experiences
Credit effectiveness: The Credit was signed in July 1992 and was effective since 1992. Project proforma
(PP) was sianed in about fifteen months later from the date of Credit effectiveness. But this delay did not
hamper the project implementation as a whole. The implementation progress of FRM Project was
satisfactory but with some considerable variances from the original schedule of activities.
Prnipct enqt and finkneing: The estimated Gnot of the nmiect at arnmraisal was SDR 36.4 millinn
equivalent for the three components, vis a vis FD, BFRI, IFESCU. After 4-year implementation of the

Prolect Components:
A.     Forest Resource Manaaement
Integrated Forest management Plans: To ensure sound forest management Forest Department
incorporated Integrated Forest Management Plan for different forest areas. Eight IFMPs for Sundarbans,
Sylhet, Chittagong, Cox' Bazaar Forest Divisions and the Noakhali, Patuakhali, Bhalo and Chittagong
Coastal Afforestation Divisions have been approved by MOEF and are under implementation.
Code of Practice for Forestry Operations: The environmental standards have been reviewed and the code
of practice for forestry operation in Bangladesh has been finalized. The report published and sent for field
use.
Conservation Management Plan: Of the 15 established conservation areas (CAs) in Bangladesh, CMPs
for three Sundarbans wildlife sanctuaries (East, West and South) have been approved by MOEF and are
being implemented under the ADB/GEF biodiversity conservation project The conservation plans of
another six protected areas (Madhupur, Rema Kalenga, Hazarikhil, Chunati, Himchari and Teknaf Game
Reserves) have been finalized, including participatory management approach under the ADB-fmnanced
Forestry Sector project. Remaining 6 CMPs will prepared and revised by Forest Department through three
Management Plan Divisions, accordingly office order has been given to the concemed Divisional Forest
Officers. Moreover, Conservation Plans for the newly created national parks, Kaptai and Sitakundo need
to be prepared.
Participatory Forestry Development: About 850 ha of pilot participatory forestry plantations involving
675 participant families have been established with the help of. CODEC ( a field level NGO) in the
degraded forest-land in nine sites in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar Forest Divisions. This is about
100% more than 1996 MTR recommendations of 450 ha to December 2001.
Programming, Budgeting, Monitoring System (PBMS): Expansion of PBMS has been undertaken and
computers have been provided to all 14 forest, environment and management plan divisions under FRMP.
But strengthening of this system providing more skilled personnel is essentially needed.
Resource Information Management System (RIMS): The Resource Information Management Svstem
(RIMS) has been interfaced with a Geographical Information System (GIS). The system is providing
excellent support for the Integrated Forest Management Plans. Block maps for each range have been
prepared for Cox's Bazaar, Sylhet and Chittagong Divisions and updated for the Coastal Divisions. A
forest inventory nreparation plan for the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT'h has been nrenared with the help of
an expert.
B.     Forest Resource Exmansion
Mangrove Plantation: Under FRMP, FD has established about 33, 568 ha mangrove plantations. The

Industrial Plantation: A total of 36,504.1 ha of industrial plantations have been raised to date under the
project. This compares well with the SAR target of 29,000 ha and a revised MTR target of 31,500 ha.
Maintenance of Plantation: The project had provisions for financing first thinning which had been done in
due time. But there was no provision for 2nd and 3rd thinning for plantation in the project, which had
hampered these two operations. It is essential to keep fund provision in the GOB budget to accomplish
these thinning operations of old plantations as a proiect component.
Feling : About 900 ha of matured plantations were felled in Sylhet during 1998-2001. Felling was also
due in other divisions. The major cause for delay in felling is the non-availability of sufficient GOB fund
for felling and carrying. For smooth operation of felling there might have provisions for in future proiect.

D.     Institutional Supnort
Amendments to the Forest Act (1972): Important amendments to the 1972 Forest Act have been made
by Parliament and gazette notufication was made on April i0, zuuu adnressing the participatory
management agreements sanctioning sharing of forest products with local communities.
The parliament also approved the Environental Act 2000 facilitating establishment of environmental
court for environmental degrdation offenses. This paved the way for sharing of forest produce with the
participants under contract.
Reorganization of Forest Department: A reorganization set up of the Forest Department with 8,681
positions (221 professional, 38 nonprofessional, 1988 sub-professional and 6472 support staff), including
88 new forestry cadre positions under revenue budget has been created. The TOR of each position has
been approved and gazetted. But the positions created under new set up is not sufficient compared to the
present need of the Forest Department So it should be reviewed to meet up the FD's proper forest
resource management.

need of more in-service training for official and staffs. MOEF has established a new forest school at
Ciutagong, wihuch Uhs bUeL iuleiiudu wiui uiec lecuiucai Educauon Board. in each year, 50 stuaents get
enrollment for three years diploma course. By this time, 4/5 batch completed Diploma in Forestry and
many of the got job in the ri and other NwOs. Hiring of teacher and staff for Forests School nas been
completed. But the appointment of principal and the chief instructor position is yet to be completed. A
nwuber of training programs has been organized on participatory forestry development in Forest School,
Sylhet and Rajshahi. The school has developed its own training programs instead of organizing training
only on request as at present. Tne School had a plan to start short-term in-service training for 405
forester/forest guards, and the Forest Academy, Chittagong also had a plan to organize service management
training to 70 ACFs recently transferred from the development to the revenue budget under ADB financed
Forestry Sector Project.
Mangrove Research: Satisfactory progress has been made in mangrove research. BFRI has revised the
annual research programs. The program is under implementation. About 31 research projects initiated
during FRMP have been completed. The mangrove research program has provided valuable technology for
mangrove nursery management and plantation establishment as well as knowledge on successive mangrove
and non-mangrove species for raised char lands. A National Workshop on mangrove R&D was organized
in May 2001 with over 50 participants from FD, University, NGO and BFRI. The proceedings of the
workshop published. BFRI has finalized the report on the pilot participatory management of raised land in
mangrove plantations in the Coastal Belt. BFRI has developed proposals to undertake social and
environmental research in the sanctuaries and other parts of the Sundarbans in collaboration with
NCWD-K and IFES. For sustainability of the mangrove research program, BFRI has initiated preparation
of medium and long-term project proposals and submitted to MOEF/GOB for approval.
Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences, Chittagong University (IFESCU): Professional
Foresters' Education: Implementation of project activities at IFES has been satisfactory. IFES has
produced 333 forestry graduates of which 19 are females. Nineteen students have already graduated with
M.Sc. in Forestry. IFES has initiated a B.Sc. program in Environmental Sciences along with its ongoing
program of B.Sc. in Forestry. A total of 289 students including 28 females are in the undergraduate
programs and 60 graduates in Forestry have been admitted for M.Sc. degrees. Three graduate programs
leading to Ph.D. degree are in progress. Three out of twelve faculty members sent abroad fro hipher degree
have completed their Ph.D. Another three faculty members have returned and joined the faculty and are
finalizing their dissertation for submission to the respective universities. Short-term study tours were in
good progress. IFES has published a book on mangroves in Bangladesh.

Achievement: The Project's main objective of expanding forest resources base has been achieved. Almost
7f0,400 h0 of ..loon  have been estaished =Ander this project. One of the direct benefits in terms Of
wood production as forecasted by the ICR committee will be of about 10.03 million m' of log. This is
considerably more than the appraisal estimate of 3.9 milion m of saw log. Tne additional supply of fuel
wood and poles will benefit the urban and rural poor. The ERR determined by the ICR committee for
industrial, mangrove and participatory plantations component, and for the project as a whole was higher
than those reported in the SAR. The increase in the ERR volumes may be attributed to higher yield per ha.
Considerable progress was also made in institutional strengthening of FD to carry out operational
programmes and improve professional forestry education, training and research in Bangladesh.
Project Sustainability: FD as a government forestry department has been playing vital role in country's
forest resource base development For sustainability of the forest resources generated by FRM Project,
continuous support from Government and donors is needed. With the existing manpower of FD this is not
possible to maintain, develop and protect the forest resources. So, it has been felt that transferring of
project personnel in the revenue budget is essential for sustainable management of the completed project
activities. A short term (3 Years), FRMP follow-up project has already been approved and another long
term project has also been submitted to Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) for necessary action.
Economic and financial rate of return: A good Forest resources base has been established through the
implementation of this project. Hence, a good economic rate of return has been achieved and
non-guantifiable benefit of the proqect has been realized. The estimated ERR of the project is 19%. For
plantation raised, the estimated ERR also 19%. The financial rate of return for the project estimated at
18%.
Lesson learned
As a lesson learnt of the project. the following issues were considered as (a) Financial rule for expenditure
procedure of the donor should be in the line of borrower's financial rule to avoid unwanted conflict between
the parties. bh) Choice of Species: Wide varietv of species wnuld help in success of nlantation. It should be
site matching and depending on the people's need. (c) Success of plantations along the periphery of forest
boundary has become a threat due to illicit-felling and encrachme t  To combat this situation.
joint/participatory forestry management may be extended in the buffer zone areas. (d) Monitoring system
of FD is still weai. It bhas tn be strengthened and activated with.the sifficient stuffs and loaigtirs. (e)
Process for recruiting consultant should be simplified. (f) Frequent change of PD and project staff hampers
the project activitr. So in futare project, provision for tenul aspect of PD and project staff should have to
be considered. (g) recruitment of project personnel should be on pennanent basis. Due to the uncertainty
of Jobs, projec staff uly :        .     graded ad also m-shandled  A                i n
project staff in the revenue may be kept in the future Project Proforma. (g) Financial Management:
