                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.     The Community Nutrition Project (TF095274) is being amended to revise and
simplify the Project’s results framework, to extend the closing date from September 30,
2012 to September 30, 2013, and to reallocate Grant proceeds to continue support for
supply-side activities.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.     The Community Nutrition Project (CNP) was prepared under World Bank (WB)
emergency procedures and was supported by two sources of financing: (a) the Food Price
Crisis Response Trust Fund (TF095274) of US$2 million with a closing date of 30
September, 2012; and (b) the European Union Food Crisis Rapid Response Facility Trust
Fund (TF097071) of US$2.12 million equivalent which closed on February 29, 2012.

3.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve coverage of essential
maternal and child health services and improve mother and child caring practices among
pregnant and lactating women and children less than two years old in the seven southern
and central provinces. The PDO remains relevant and unchanged.

4.      The project’s implementation status and the progress towards achieving the PDO
were both rated as “Moderately Satisfactory? in the November 2011 Implementation
Status Report (ISR), reflecting significant improvements since the previous ISR and the
likelihood that the development objectives will be met. The current disbursement rate is
US$564,462.21 (equivalent to 28%) out of the total funds of US$2 million. Despite initial
delays resulting from low capacity and lack of familiarity with WB procedures on the
part of the implementing agency, the Project has made notable progress as reflected
below:

   Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs): CCT enrollment events have now been held in
    all 62 health centers (HCs). To date, 15,962 women – about 71.1% of all who were
    eligible in the catchment areas of the pilot HCs – have enrolled in the program. Of
    those currently enrolled, 4,281 were pregnant women. Retroactive enrollment
    incentive payments and retroactive utilization payments have commenced in some
    HCs in Attapu and Champasak. The designated account ceiling has been increased to
    US$400,000 to allow for both retroactive and regular enrollment as well as
    utilization-based payments in all pilot HCs. CCT monitoring visits have also begun
    (both by the CNP team and by the internal auditing firm, ACCMIN);
   Community-Based Nutrition (CBN): 1,500 targeted village facilitators have received
    training and monthly community-level meetings have commenced. Reported
    attendance rates have generally been high: an average of over 40 participants per
    meeting among those reporting, of which an average of 34 were women. Regular
                                           1
    monthly supervision meetings between district and provincial Lao Women’s Union
    (LWU) and Health Poverty Action (which is a non-governmental organization
    providing technical assistance for this component) representatives are being held;
   Supply-Side Support and Capacity Building: at least one HC staff from 59 of the 62
    selected HCs have been trained in each of the five modules training program; 230
    staff have been trained on supportive supervision and at least one supportive
    supervision visit has been conducted in all 62 HCs; 49 new Community Based
    Distributors (CBDs) have been trained to provide micronutrient and key maternal
    and child health messages in addition to family planning services; and 45 existing
    CBDs have also been trained in micronutrient distribution.
   Ethnic Group Development Plan: the Plan was disclosed in three national
    newspapers and was also distributed to local project implementation units at both
    Provincial Health Office and Provincial LWU offices in the seven southern provinces
    in April, 2012. Consultation workshops are planned at three selected HCs during the
    week of July 23, 2012.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

5.      Results Framework. The results framework was prepared during project design
before implementation details and specific activities had been finalized and it is being
restructured to harmonize with data currently being captured by instruments such as the
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. Of the original 11 PDO indicators, five are being
dropped due to data unavailability or lack of relevance with CNP activities:

   Percentage of children 6-59 months who received vitamin A supplement during the
    last year;
   Percentage of women and children < 5 who received iron supplements in the last 6
    months;
   Percentage of women who practice post-partum food restrictions;
   Percentage of children 6–23 months of age who receive foods from 4 or more food
    groups; and
   Percentage of women participating in community meetings with appropriate hand
    washing behavior.

Other indicators are being revised in order to make them more precise and aligned with
existing standardized measures so as to enhance comparability.

6.     Financing. The reallocation will enable the Government of Lao to have sufficient
funds for supervision and monitoring of the pilot CCT and CBN programs for the
extended implementation period.

7.      Closing date. A one year extension of the Grant (TF095274), from September 30,
2012 to September 30, 2013, is being sought in order to allow sufficient time to
implement the CCT and CBN components, and to gain a better understanding of the
feasibility and challenges faced by this pilot. This will be the first extension of the
Grant’s closing date.


                                           2
8.     Safeguards. The project has been categorized as a safeguards category C. The
changes proposed in the restructuring paper do not alter the activities supported, affect
the safeguards category, or trigger any new safeguards. The Project has adopted the
Ethnic Group Development Plan to comply with the Bank’s Operational Policy 4.10 on
Indigenous Peoples. Related activities are being implemented satisfactorily.
