Project Objectives
and Description:       The objective of the project is to meet an important part of the rapidly growing
urban demand for household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the
ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. This objective
would be met through: (a) the implementation and monitoring of 300,000
hectares of environmentally sustainable community-managed forest resource
systems in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions of Senegal, creating a protection
zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park (Biosphere Reserve); (b) the
promotion of inter-fuel substitution and improved stoves initiatives; and (c) the
strengthening of the institutions involved in the management of the sector, and
the promotion of the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic
institutions, and NGOs community) in the operation of the sector. The project
would finance: (a) an assessment of vegetation cover, an assessment of
availability of dead wood and other preparatory activities; (b) community-based
forest management activities in 300,000 ha; (c) promotion of rural-based micro-
enterprises and private sector and NGO-based inter-fuel substitution activities;
(d) consultant services for supervision work, delivery of services and various
technical studies; (e) technical assistance; and (d) materials, equipment and
goods.
Project Benefits:       The project would: (a) sustainably produce some 860,000 tons of fuelwood
(equivalent to 155,000 tons of charcoal) during the implementation period and



iv
would thereafter establish a permanent system capable of producing more than
300,000 tons of fuelwood (equivalent to 55,000 tons of charcoal or half of the
annual consumption of the city of Dakar) per year on a sustainable basis; (b)
reduce woodfuels-related deforestation in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions
by some 10,000 ha/year, reduce net C02 emissions by 510,000 tons/year and
reduce the loss of biodiversity by the establishment of sustainable forest systems
and the establishment of a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba
National Park (international "Biosphere reserve"); (c) generate employment and
economic development opportunities in 250 rural villages in the Tambacounda
and Kolda regions, paying special attention to gender equity; (d) generate a total
of more than US $10.0 million in direct revenues to 250 villages from the trade
of woodfuels, and generate additional revenues to the communities from related
natural resource management and exploitation activities (agriculture,
pastoralism, herding, agro-forestry, etc.); (e) on a sustainable annual basis after
the end of the project, generate direct revenues in excess of US $3.0 million to
the participating villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional
revenues from related natural resource management and exploitation activities;
(f) reduce C02 emissions by 42,000 tons/year by the distribution of 225,000
improved charcoal stoves; (g) increase the availability and access of low income
households to more reliable and efficient charcoal stoves and to modern fuels;
and (h) strengthen the planning, policy making and implementation supervision
capacity of the traditional energy sector institutions, while increasing the
participation of the civil society (private sector, academic institutions, and NGOs
community) in the management and operation of the sector.
Project Risks:          There is a moderate risk that existing charcoal traders and laborers would resist
transferring part of the industry's activity to the rural communities. To mitigate
that risk, the project includes two sub-components to support the adjustment of
existing traders and several monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track
possible implementation interference. There is also the possibility that
traditional traders could switch charcoal production to other areas of the country
but this risk is considered negligible. The risk that the rural populations might
not be able to achieve full sustainable management of the forest resources cannot
be ruled out. Nevertheless, even a partial achievement of the objectives would
still result in an important transfer of welfare to the rural communities with
unquestionable economic development opportunities and social benefits and
significant national and global environmental benefits. There would be no
involuntary resettlement as a result of the project.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
SUSTAINABLE AND PARTICIPATORY ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROJECT
I.  BACKGROUND
A. GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
1.1.   Senegal's topography is generally flat, and altitude is less than 50 meters above sea level
over 75 percent of the territory. Senegal has a semi-arid tropical Sudano-Sahelian climate, with
a relatively narrow temperature span. The rainy season is limited to a single summer monsoon
and rainfall has declined significantly in the last 40 years. It fluctuates widely from one region
to another, ranging from 1,000 mm/year in the south to less than 300 mm/year in the north.
Vegetation runs from bushy steppes in the north to forest stands in the south and southeast. The
central regions consist of Sudano-Sahelian and Sudano Savannah. Senegal's soils are dry and
sandy in the north, ferrous in the central regions and lateritic in the south. In general, fertility is
very poor and the soil is extremely vulnerable to wind and erosion from rain.
B. DEMOGRAPHICS
1.2   In 1988, Senegal's population was 6.9 million. Of which 39 percent was living in urban,
making Senegal the most highly urbanized country in the Sahel region. Women make up 51.4
percent of the total population and children under age 15, 30 percent. National demographic
growth is estimated at 2.9 percent per year (3.8% in urban areas and 2.1% in the countryside). If
current demographic trends remain unchanged, total population will rise to some 12.6 million by
the year 2010, of which 6.1 million will be urban (48%), with 3.4 million people clustered in the
Dakar region alone. Urban growth will increase demand for food, fuel, timber and other natural
goods and services. If the productivity of natural resources does not increase and they are not
managed sustainably, it will be necessary to increase imports of food, energy, construction material,
etc.
C. THE ECONOMY
1.3    At independence Senegal had one of the most developed economies in West Africa. Its
economy deteriorated, however, due to a gradual loss of regional markets, prolonged drought and
weak management. In 1994, Senegal's gross national product (GNP) was estimated at US
$3,710 million and its per capita GNP was US $611.
1.4.   Senegal's adjustment efforts date back to 1980 and were supported  by four Bank
macroeconomic adjustment operations (SALs) in 1980, 1986, 1987, and 1990, and two sector
adjustment operations (SECALs), including one in the financial sector in 1989 and another in the
transport sector in 1991. These adjustment operations contributed towards stabilizing
macroeconomic conditions and achieved a partial liberalization of the economy. A fourth SAL
was introduced in 1990 which focused on the removal of labor market rigidities, the reduction of



2
government subsidies, and the implementation of a more aggressive privatization program.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, however, the economy experienced a serious decline with a
contraction of output in key sector. Low economic activity resulted in a shrinking tax base which
forced the government to reverse import tariff reduction and to increase the taxation of
petroleum products. In 1992-93, the economy declined even further as the difficulties of
pursuing an adjustment strategy based on internal deflationary policies became more acute. The
fiscal deficit and the balance of payment positions worsened; the fiscal balance (excluding
grants) declined from a 0.2 percent surplus in 1991 to a 3.9 percent deficit in 1993. During the
period 1988-1993, Senegal's economic growth stagnated at an average of 1.7 percent per annum.
1.5   In an attempt to reverse this economic deterioration, in mid 1993 the government
adopted a series of internal adjustment measures including cuts in public sector wages.
However, these measures were not sufficient to restore the competitiveness of the economy and
its growth prospects. The decline in investments and exports, widespread smuggling and custom
fraud, and increasing macroeconomic imbalances made inevitable the January 1994 devaluation
of the FCFA. With the devaluation, Senegal has now gained a unique opportunity to restore
competitiveness and export-led growth, taking advantage of its strategic location and its sizable
human resource base. Increasing GDP growth, reducing inflation and stabilizing prices, and
reducing the current account and budget deficits are the principal macroeconomic challenges
facing Senegal for the foreseeable future. Generating a strong supply-response by the private
sector, increasing labor productivity, improving natural resource management patterns to reduce
environmental degradation and loss of productive capacity, revitalizing urban enclaves and
promoting rural development opportunities will all have to be actively pursued if those
challenges are to be met.

A. ENERGY SOURCES AND CONSUMPTION
2.1.   Senegal has a modest but relatively diversified energy resource base. Under present
conditions, however, its use is associated with either major environmental risks (forest-based
fuels - fuelwood and charcoal) or substantial investment outlays for exploration (hydrocarbons,
lignite) and mobilization (hydroelectricity, solar and wind power).
1.    Fossil Fuels
2.2    Senegal is largely dependent on expensive imported petroleum products. Fossil fuels in the
form of heavy petroleum was discovered in the 1950s at the Dome Flore in Casamance (100
million tons) and natural gas and light petroleum in the 1960s at Diam Nadio Kabor near Dakar.
Between 1987 and 1992 these reserved produced 61,000 barrels of crude and 31 million m3 of
natural gas. In 1991 a deposit of 400 million m3 of gas was discovered at Diam Nadio and is
being used for power generation. An additional gas deposit estimated at 10 million m3 was
discovered at at the same location in 1996, but it will take some time before it can be economically
mobilized. Since there is no residential piped gas infrastructure in Senegal the new natural gas
discovery will not be a factor in foreseeable household interfuel substitution schemes. There is a
reserve of peat of some 39 million m3 along the Dakar coast at St. Louis.
2.    Hydro
2.3    The country's hydroelectric potential, based on the Senegal and Gambia rivers, is estimated
at about 1,000 MW capable of producing 280 Gwh in an average year. The development of the
Senegal River under the OMVS should make it possible to have a supply of hydroelectric power
generated by facilities at the Manantali site in Mali. It is expected that this could provide Senegal
with 280 GWh/year (out of total domestic consumption of some 900 GWh) and would save
SENELEC (National Electricity Company) some 150,000 tons of fuel per year of the current
consumption of 300,000 tons.
3.    Traditional Fuels (Fuelwood and Charcoal)
2.4    The potential supply of energy wood is not well known. In 1980, forest land was
estimated at 12 million ha (60% of the country's area), with very variable types of stands:
closed and open forest represent 20 percent of the woodlands and Savannah and steppe 80
percent. Depending on the source and assumptions used, annual total productivity was
estimated for that same year to be between 13.4 million m3 (1991 PASF/terroir management
studies) and 8.6 million m3 (1981 PDDF). Availability was estimated in 1980 at 7.3 million
m3/year (PDDF) and accessible reserves at 3.1 million m3/year (PAFS, World Bank). Table 2.1
presents 1980 estimates of Senegal's forestry potential. It is estimated that some 80,000 ha of
forest stands disappear each year due to land clearing for agriculture, bush fires, the production
of charcoal, overgrazing and scarce rainfall. Annual deforestation for charcoal production alone
is estimated at more than 30,000 ha per year. In the last ten years, an average of 190,000 ha/year
was lost to forest fires throughout the national territory.

2.5    A recent study conducted by the government of Senegal with World Bank support
concluded that the availability of woody biomass in Senegal may have been previously
underestimated both in terms of volume of stocks and yield potential.2  Available forest stock
information (estimated on the basis of primary data collected prior to 1980) indicates that
there are some 44,000 km2 of woodlands and forests, 29,000 km2 of savanna woodlands,
43,000 km2 of savannas and 32,000 km2 of Sahelian steppe grasslands. Yields are now
estimated to be between 1 ton/ha/yr and 2 ton/ha/yr, depending on the geographic location and
specific stock composition. Under improved rainfall condition, natural stocks growth could be
even higher. Pending confirmation by a comprehensive assessment of vegetation cover in the
Tambacounda and Kolda regions (included in the proposed project), it is now estimated that
Senegal should still have sufficient forest resources to meet most -- if not all -- of the demand
for woodfuels for at least the next two decades under sustainable forest management schemes.
Implementing sustainable management would imply exploiting the existing forest stocks at or
below the annual growth (yield) level and would therefore result in maintaining the original
stocks over time.

4.     Other Potential Resources
2.6.   There is a relatively large availability of agricultural residues, but their energy use has
not yet prove to be more attractive than their use as fertilizers and/or cattle supplements. On the
other hand, byproducts from agro-industrial processing such as groundnut shells and bagasse offer
more attractive prospects and have been used by the industries that produce them (SONACOS and
CSS) to generate electricity for some time. With an average daily radiation of some 5.4 kWh/mi2
Senegal has a considerable solar energy potential for applications such as small scale electricity
production (PV), water pumping and heating and drying of fish and agricultural products.

5.     Energy Consumption
2.8.   Total final energy consumption in Senegal for 1992 was estimated at some 1.5 million
tons of oil equivalent (TOE), and a per capita energy consumption of 195 kilograms of oil
equivalent (KOE), which is relatively high compared to most West African countries. Out of the
estimated total energy consumption, forest-based traditional fuels (firewood and charcoal) --
mostly used for household cooking purposes -- represented 53 percent, petroleum fuels 34
percent, electricity 12 percent and agricultural residues I percent. The household sector is the
principal energy consumer (58%) followed by transport (20%), industry (17%) and the tertiary
sector (5%). Total charcoal consumption in 1992 was estimated at 330,000 tons (equivalent to
1.8 million tons of fuelwood), of which 76 percent is consumed in the principal urban areas. The
city of Dakar alone has an estimated consumption of almost 150,000 tons of charcoal per year.
Total consumption of fuelwood was estimated at some 1.5 million tons in 1992, 86 percent of
which is consumed in the rural areas. Tables 2.2 and 2.3 present final energy consumption by
energy resource and by economic sectors, respectively.

B. ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES
1.    Sectoral Institutions
2.9.   Institutional structure and actors. Energy policy choices, directions and coordination are
overseen by the National Energy Commission, an inter-ministerial entity chaired by the Prime
Minister. The National Energy Committee headed by the Minister of Energy implements the
directives formulated by the Commission. Administrative and technical oversight of the sector falls
under the Ministry of Energy, Mining and Industry (MEMI) with the exception of the supply of
woodfuels, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Nature
(MEPN). MEMI oversees certain parastatal companies and mixed-capital enterprises: SENELEC,
in charge of electric power production, transmission and distribution; SAR (African Refining
Company), responsible for imports and production of petroleum products; GPP (Petroleum Trade
Group), responsible for the distribution of petroleum products; PETROSEN (Senegal Petroleum
Company), responsible for oil exploration; and CTS (Senegal Peat Company), responsible for the
development of peat reserves.  Other ministries are key players, including the Ministry of the
Economy, Finance and Planning; the Ministry of Infrastructure and Land Transportation,
responsible for oversight of hydrocarbon transportation; the Ministry of Modernization and
Technology and the Ministry of Water Resources, both of which are involved in solar energy
programs; the Ministry of National Education, which has oversight of the CERER (Center for
Study and Research on Renewable Energy); ENSUT (National School for Advanced Studies in
Technology); and the "Cellule de Combustibles Domestiques", which is an inter-ministerial body



7
created in 1993 to serve as a formal link between the different governmental institutions and
operators in the sector.
2.10.  From the different ministries that play an operational role in the household and traditional
energy sectors, MEPN is by far the best organized and endowed in human and material resources
and is technically capable of fulfilling its assigned responsibilities. Currently MEPN is managing
some 300 projects through out the country, most of which are donor- supported and which include
capacity building and institutional development components. The Water and Forest Directorate
(DEF/MEPN) has implemented a gradual reorganization process over the last two years, giving
special priority to the strengthening of its regional structures. That process was implemented as
part of the ongoing process of administrative decentralization to increase the Forestry Service's
supervision and field extension services. While the forestry service, including the several technical
support units (forestry operations, planning, cartography, monitoring and evaluation, etc.) has
sufficient and technically qualified staff to undertake complex projects, the multi-sectoral nature of
participatory forest management systems will require the mobilization of additional expertise from
other governmental agencies (agriculture extension, rural development, women affairs, rural
infrastructure, etc.) and the NGO community.
2.11   MEMI, on the other hand, has serious limitations in its ability to effectively discharge its
assigned responsibilities as it lacks the necessary staff and resources to do so and has little control
over the operation of the enterprises it is supposed to oversee. With institutional development
support from the World Bank and the Dutch and German Cooperations the Energy Directorate has
recently managed to improve its situation, but the strengthening of its planning and policy making
and supervision functions are still badly needed. This will imply moving away from actual field
implementation of projects -- which has been the traditional means of securing resources -- and
focusing on more on analytical and planning functions and sector monitoring and supervision.
2.12   Coordination and institutional problems in the power sector are similar to those
encountered in the petroleum sectors. In addition to that, poor management of SENELEC has led
to a growing deficit of power generation capacity, deterioration of facilities, low level of access to
electricity, and high costs. SAR's refinery is uneconomic and has led to high prices of petroleum
products.
2.    Sectoral Policies
2.13   The national energy policy is set forth in the RENES program formulated in 1980 and
revised in 1991 and in the document issued by the Inter-ministerial Energy Council (1993). The
global objectives of the GoS energy policy are: (a) to limit consumption of imported energy; (b) to
rehabilitate the electric power production and transmission infrastructure; (c) to shift production
and consumption toward local energy sources; and (d) to reduce consumption of environmentally
destructive energy sources (wood and charcoal).
2.14   Official forestry policy, establishing new post-colonial guidelines for exploitation of
woodfuels, was initially addressed by the Master Forestry Development Plan (1981). The
Master Plan was then revised during the formulation of the Forestry Action Plan (1993) and is
now framed within the new forestry code of April 1995 (Decret 95-357). This new code
introduced major changes to the previous regulatory framework, including the recognition of the
rights of the local communities to exploit state-owned forest land and to capture revenues
directly from their regulated exploitation. In addition to those significant changes, the legislative



8
decrees sanctioning the administrative decentralization have already been signed, with which
local communities are, inter alia, further insulated from centralized decisions on forest and
natural resource issue.
2.15   The GoS has now articulated its energy policy around the following points:
*  the stabilization of the potential supply of woodfuels through the transfer of
responsibility for the management of natural forests from the Forestry Service to the
local community and the implementation of sustainable community-based forest
management systems;
*  the sustainable exploitation of existing natural forests and the rationalization of
forestry operations through the implementation of a national participatory natural
resource management program;
*  the diversification of fuels available to consumers, by developing the use of butane,
introducing peat-based charcoal briquettes to the market and studying the
possibilities for using kerosene for cooking;
*  savings in consumption (improved stoves) and in the transformation of wood into
charcoal (better carbonization methods); and
-  a shift towards full cost pricing of energy products so that the market prices reflect
the real economic costs.

III. THE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SECTOR
A. ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE HOUSEHOLD SECTOR
3.1.   There were an estimated 1.3 million households in Senegal in 1992 with an average size
of 6 persons. In Dakar alone there were an estimated 156 thousand households, with an average
household size of 12 persons. The consumption of energy by the household sector was estimated
in 1992 at about 0.9 million toe. That total was made of 1.5 million tons of wood, 330,000 tons
of charcoal (equivalent to more than 3.3 million tons or 4.2 million m3 of wood), 40,000 tons of
gas butane and some 10,000 tons of kerosene.3 Figure 3.1 presents a breakdown of energy
consumption by the household sector for 1992. Table 3.1 presents a breakdown of household
energy consumption by fuel and by region for 1987 and 1992. Table 3.2 presents a breakdown
of traditional fuels consumption in the household sector in terms of toe and wood equivalence
(m3).

3.2.   Household energy demand patterns are determined by a combination of factors including
but not limited to geographical location (urban/rural and distance/accessibility to supply
sources), family size, relation between level of household incomes and fuel prices (purchasing
capacity), market availability of fuels, and cultural habits (fuel choices and method of fuel use).
An analysis of the tables 3.1 and 3.2 and of various studies in the sector reveals the following key
trends:
3  Kerosene is used for lighting (sometimes for starting fires) and hence does not compete
with the others.

* The consumption of fuelwood dominates in the rural areas, gas tends to replace
charcoal as the primary household fuel in Dakar and Thies (given end-use efficiency
differences charcoal consumption is still higher than LPG on nominal terms), and
charcoal is still the main household fuel in the other secondary cities;

* Gas is making substantial inroads in the principal cities, but charcoal is still consumed
in large quantities because urban consumers tend to use several fuels, often
concomitantly;
* The consumption of charcoal is concentrated in the Cap Vert peninsula and in the
Thies region, which is home to most of the country's urban dwellers; and
* Charcoal represents about 27 percent of final consumption of traditional fuels but
accounts for 55 percent of the out-take of forest resources for energy use. Most of the
wood collected by rural dwellers comes from dead wood, whereas charcoal is produced
most of the time from the cutting of live trees. This highlights the high proportion of
forestry resources extracted for charcoal.
3.3.   Consumption of LPG has gone from 3,500 tons in 1974 to 16,000 tons in 1987 and then
to approximately 65,000 tons in 1996.  The penetration of LPG in Senegal has been promoted
by an aggressive program of cross-fuel subsidies, which is currently estimated at 5 billion FCFA
per year. The promotion of LPG in Senegal has been primarily supported by the subsidy policy
of the government since 1974 and by the CILSS/FED Regional Gas Program (1990-93).
Consumption of LPG has increased by some 12 percent per year for the last five years (well over
population growth) and by now more than 70 percent of urban households and 25 percent of
rural families utilize LPG on a regular basis. Nation wide it is estimated that close to 45 percent
of households have purchased LPG stoves. Furthermore, in 58 percent of households in Dakar
and 43 percent of households in Thies LPG have replaced charcoal as the primary cooking fuel.

3.4.   Kerosene is used in the household and informal sector essentially for lighting purposes
only. A couple of pilot activities were done in the mid 1980s by CERER and the World Bank's
Energy Management Assistance Program to test the feasibility of introducing kerosene as a
cooking fuel. Although small consumer trials showed that kerosene could be utilized for
cooking purposes, a stove fully suited to the local cooking needs was never found. At that time
the kerosene research was oriented towards finding the most energy efficient stove possible,
rather than the most "marketable" one, as defined by consumer acceptance.
3.5.   The consumption of wood energy in the informal and industrial (artisanal) sectors has not
been studied extensively and therefore is not well known. However, it is thought to be very low
(5%) in relation to the household sector and very frequently directly associated to it (informal
household-based enterprises). Small restaurants are the leading commercial energy consumer in the
cities. A survey conducted in 1991 showed that there were some 3,000 restaurants with an
estimated annual consumption of 4,200 tons of wood (half of Dakar's fuelwood consumption),
3,600 tons of charcoal (3% of household consumption) and 700 tons of gas (2% of household
consumption). Other urban users of woodfuels include tailors (ironing), cloth-dyers, pot makers
and blacksmiths. Bakeries are permitted to operate wood-fired ovens only in the rural areas.
B. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE TRADITIONAL ENERGY MARKETS
1.    Urban Traditional Energy Markets
3.6   The supply of woodfuels to the urban and peri-urban areas is based on geographically
concentrated and non-sustainable forest resource management practices (clear cutting). Given
the relatively low efficiency of wood-to-charcoal conversion (18%) due to inefficient
carbonization, total charcoal consumption in terms of wood is equivalent to 1.2 times the total
consumption of fuelwood. Charcoal for Dakar and Thies and the surrounding peri-urban areas is
essentially produced in the Kolda and Tambacounda regions, some 400 km away. Some
charcoal is also produced in Kaolack but it is destined for local consumption. In some cases
charcoal production is also authorized on an ad hoc basis in different areas of the country where
land clearing for agricultural production has taken place.
3.7.   Until April 1995, when a new Forestry Code was approved (Decret 95-357), the forestry
legislation gave the Forest Service the exclusive prerogative to assign commercial exploitation
rights over forest resources nationwide. These rights were historically given only to urban-based
traders resulting in the creation of a vertically integrated and oligopolistic industry with
widespread corruption problems. Among other issues, original annual charcoal exploitation
quotas were frequently surpassed with the Forestry Service lacking the manpower or monitoring
mechanisms to adequately supervise and enforce them. It is estimated that out of the some 1,800
legally registered "exploitantsforestiers" only some 20 traders actually work in and control the
production of charcoal.  The remainder registered traders buy charcoal production licenses
("quota charbon") and resell them afterwards to the traders that produce charcoal.  That
secondary -- and illegal -- transaction of those quotas takes place in a well organized black market
environment that resembles a well functioning stock or futures market. As even the laborers
"surghas" (Peuls from Guinea) employed in the cutting of the wood and the production of the
charcoal are brought in to the rural areas by the urban traders, it is estimated that less than 5
percent of the estimated FCFA 30 billion (US $60 million) annual turnover of the charcoal trade



13
remains in the rural areas. Charcoal is transported to the cities in 15-ton trucks belonging either
to the same charcoal trader or to private transporters who use the charcoal as return freight. At
the gateway to the cities, "coxeurs" (wholesalers) regulate the inflows of charcoal by directing
shipments to retailers. The coxeurs, which are not an officially recognized or regulated group in
the industry hold a strategic position as they control all distribution in the cities. It is estimated
that as few as 10 coxeurs control the charcoal flows into the urban markets. The "coxeurs"
purchase the load from the trader and then sell it on credit to the retailer. A large number of the
retailers are also Guinean Peuls and are salaried (non-commission) employees of the coxeurs,
whereby they only derive a small salary from the activity. The points of sale are called "diallo
kerin. " Figure 3.3 presents the structure of the charcoal labor chain in Senegal. Figure 3.4
present a typical 15-ton truck used in the transport of charcoal to the urban market.
Approximately 25 15-ton trucks come into Dakar each day carrying some 375,000 tons of
charcoal, equivalent to some 2,060 tons of wood.

3.8.   The commercial extraction of wood products is regulated by a ministerial decree that
determines the logging season (generally December to August) and the production quotas for
each region. The charcoal production quotas are based on charcoal outputs and not on wood
inputs and thus provides no incentive for wood conservation in the carbonization process. The
regional quotas are distributed among the 'exploilantsforestiers " that have a extraction licenses
(before the 1993 season, the official order also set reserve quotas allocated at the end of the
season on the basis of the needs of the urban areas). Based on the quotas, forestry inspection
officials delineate the authorized logging areas and assign the felling sites to the companies,
which must register the '"surghas" (employee certification), logging permits contingent upon the
payment of a forestry tax that are required for all operations, and lastly, transport permits that are
checked at the control posts on the main highways. Independent of the quotas set by ministerial
order, additional quantities of wood or charcoal can be sold. These come from operations at
private plantations or seizures of illegal charcoal made by forestry officials. While considerable
progress has been made in the last two years in the enforcement of the existing regulations, it is
necessary to improve the system further.
3.9.   In general terms the organization of the urban and pern-urban fuelwood trade (520,000
tons/year) resembles that of the charcoal trade but poses considerably smaller environmental and
social conflicts as it is based on the collection of dead wood over a much broader geographic
area. Registered "exploitant foretiers "obtain permits from the forestry Service to collect the
dead wood in situ and to transport it to the peri-urban and urban markets. Fuelwood is



15
transported in a combination of 15 and 30 tons trucks, where the latter are always used for the
transportation of loads coming in to the markets from distances over 250 kilometers.
2.     Traditional Energy Prices
3.10.  Prior to the FCFA devaluation of January 1994, the regulated price of charcoal in the
urban areas was FCFA 40 per kilogram, however, in practice retailers adjusted the weights and
sold the charcoal for close to FCFA 60/kg. This situation was tolerated by the Commerce
authorities because the official price had not changed since February 1986. The price of both
fuelwood and charcoal were maintained stable by the government for such a long time
essentially because of the fear that increasing them would generate civil disturbances and
political unrest. However, after the FCFA devaluation, and the ensuing price increase of most
basic commodities, made it possible to raise the price of charcoal without encountering major
consumer resistance. Paradoxically, while average commodity prices increased by 30 percent, the
price of charcoal was increased from FCFA 40/Kg to FCFA 95/Kg (US $190/ton), equivalent to a
130 percent increase with respect to the previous official price or then 60 percent compared to the
real market prices. It is important to note that since the revaluation of the charcoal prices, the
government has made a point of enforcing the requirement that retailers use scales to weigh
charcoal sold to customers. As a result of that, the incidence of price/quantity distortions has
apparently diminished somewhat.
3.11.  The price increase after the FCFA devaluation has had no positive impact on the rural
communities. The price increase was expected to be accompanied by a rise in the logging fee
(forestry tax). However, this measure was only recently adopted and until now the surcharge paid
by consumers paid after devaluation had disproportionately increased the income of the exploitants
forestiers and coxeurs vis-a-vis the other actors in the industry. Table 3.3 presents and estimation
of the structure of the price of charcoal before and after the January 1994 CFA franc devaluation.
From this table it is possible to observe that after the FCFA devaluation, the profit margin of the
exploitantsforestiers went up from 6 percent to 25.6 while the share of labor costs decreased from
21.7 percent to 12.7 percent. In addition to that, while there appears to have been a significant
increase in the share of the retailers' profit margin (from 8.5% to 19.4%) it is necessary to keep in
mind that the large majority of the charcoal retailers (diallo kirin) work for coxeurs at a fixed
salary, hence their real margin is far smaller than the one suggested by the figures in Table 3.3. It is
estimated that the real margin of the retailers is less than 6 percent, whereby the real margin of the
wholesalers (coxeurs) is of the order of 17 percent and not 3.5 percent.
3.12   Current regulated market price of fuelwood is FCFA 40/kg (US $80/ton). Prior to the
FCFA devaluation the price was FCFA 30/kg. Since the FCFA devaluation and the stricter
application by authorities of the price/quantity regulations, there is little distortion in real prices
other that the normal seasonal price variation reflecting relative higher collection and
transportation costs during the rainy season. The principal component of the fuelwood cost
structure is transportation (50%), followed by exploitants/wholesalers margins (35%). The
remainder 15 percent is divided between labor costs, taxation and handling costs. As a large
proportion of the laborers in the fuelwood trade are also temporary expatriate workers, the
fuelwood trade currently leaves little or no income in the rural areas.

3.    Rural Subsistence Supply Systems
3.13. The consumption of fuelwood in the rural areas (1.5 million tons/year) is largely
satisfied through geographically dispersed and sustainable subsistence practices (cutting of
branches, selective felling of small trees and collection of dead branches). Women and children
play a significant role in the collection of fuelwood. Rural consumption of charcoal is mostly
limited to the areas where it is produced and is normally traded by the producers for food and
lodging at the local communities. While rural consumption of woodfuels does not present
significant environmental or energy supply-demand problems in the immediate future, it is
necessary to assess the availability and accessibility of dead wood vis-a-vis the spatial dispersion
of rural populations on a national basis to identify geographic areas of potential future conflict
and develop pro-active medium-to-long term action programs to prevent them.
C. EXPECTED FUTURE TRENDS: THE CHARCOAL PROBLEM
3.14.  A recent survey (June 1994) conducted in Dakar after the FCFA devaluation showed that
the disproportionate increase in the regulated price of charcoal (100%) with respect to LPG (30%)
stimulated the substitution of woodfuels by LPG and a general trend toward increased fuel savings.
As a result, it is estimated that charcoal consumption in Dakar dropped from 150,000 tons in 1993



17
to 130,000 tons in 1994. However, as consumers in secondary cities are rapidly switching from
wood to charcoal, total charcoal consumption is still on the rise, albeit at an apparently slower rate
than before.
3.15.  Charcoal consumption in the cities is growing at just over half the rate of urban
demographic growth. That trend is expected to continue relatively stable resulting in that total
urban charcoal consumption would continue to rise at approximately 2% per year, potentially
reaching some 385,000 tons per year (equivalent to 2.1 million tons of wood) by the year 2000 and
470,000 tons (or 2.5 million tons of wood) by the year 2010. Under the current non-sustainable
forest resource exploitation practices these figures would represent an approximate charcoal-related
deforestation of 35,000 ha in 2000 and of 42,000 in 2010. For the city of Dakar alone, charcoal
consumption would reach some 150,000 tons in the year 2000 (equivalent to 13,800 ha) and
185,000 tons in the year 2010 (equivalent to 16,800 ha).
3.16.  On the other hand, if as a result of rapid economic growth and/or lower than expected
petroleum prices, the vast majority of urban households were to switch to LPG or kerosene as a
primary fuel and utilize charcoal as a secondary fuel, charcoal consumption would come down to
about half the expected level at 2 percent annual growth. In such a case, expected total charcoal
consumption would come down to some 190,000 tons in the year 2000 and to 230,000 in the year
2010. Similarly, charcoal consumption in Dakar alone would be some 75,000 tons in 2000 and
90,000 in 2010, respectively equivalent to a deforestation of approximately 7,000 ha and 8,400 ha.
3.17.  In simplified terms (assuming non-sustainable exploitation with zero to 40 percent natural
regrowth), the implication of the above figures is that under the most realistic scenario (2% annual
growth), is that between now (1997) and the year 2000 total charcoal consumption in Senegal will
result in an accumulated loss of anywhere from 60,000 ha to 100,000 ha of forest lands, and
between now and the year 2010 a loss of anywhere from 270,000 ha to 450,000 ha, the later being
equivalent to one half to two thirds of the total Tambacounda and Kolda forest lands.
D. SECTORAL ISSUES
3.18.  Senegal's present and foreseeable macroeconomic and socio-economic conditions
clearly suggest that the country will continue to depend on forest-based traditional fuels to meet
the lion's share of its urban and rural energy needs well into the next century. While ongoing
demand management (improved stoves programs and consumer education campaigns) and inter-
fuel substitution (LPG and kerosene) efforts need to be continued incorporating the lessons
learned to date, large increases of petroleum products imports cannot be sustained because of
budgetary constraints and because current and expected low household income levels severely
limit the potential for widespread inter-fuel substitution at non-subsidized market prices. Large
cross-fuel subsidy programs among fuels (like the current LPG subsidy) would imply increased
production costs and lower competitiveness of Senegal's economy, with wider macroeconomic
impacts. Within that context, and until widespread economic growth allows for large scale
substitution to take place, the principal challenge of the energy sector in Senegal will be to
transform the existing non-sustainable commercial woodfuels supply system into one capable of
supplying woodfuels -- particularly charcoal -- to the rapidly growing urban population in an
sustainable manner.



18
3.19.  Recent World Bank research work in Senegal has concluded that the availability of
woody biomass in Senegal may have been previously underestimated both in terms of volume of
stocks and yield potential. Pending confirmation by a proper vegetation cover inventory, it is
now estimated that, under proper forest management schemes, the existing natural forest stocks
should be able to sustainably meet most -- if not all -- of the demand for woodfuels for at least
the next two decades. Implementing sustainable management would imply exploiting the
existing forest stocks at or below the annual growth (yield) level and would therefore result in
maintaining the original stocks over time. Yet, as both the government and the private sector
lack the financial and human resources that would be necessary to adequately manage the
country's forest resources, sustainable management could only be achieved through the aciv
involvement of the rural population.  Under the new forestry code, the right regulatory
framework and the necessary technical assistance and supervision from the Forestry Service
(MEPN) and other relevant government agencies and NGOs with competencies on land-use and
rural development issues, the rural population should be able to assume the responsibility for the
sustainable management of their forest resources. The participation of the rural communities in
the commercial exploitation of the forest resources for the supply of woodfuels -- particularly
charcoal -- to the urban markets would result in the creation of significant employment and
economic development opportunities in the rural areas, with a considerable developmental
impact for rural women.
3.20.  The operation of the commercial woodfuels industry (particularly charcoal) has had
overtime a number of negative environmental and social impacts, such as: the gradual loss of
forest cover (approx. 30,000 ha/year) and thus of the ecosystem's carbon sequestration
capacity and biodiversity; the degradation of the rural environment (particularly of the soils);
the impoverishment of the rural areas; an acceleration of the rural exodus; and a massive transfer
of wealth from the rural areas to the urban areas. In addition to those negative impacts, it is
anticipated that within the near-to-medium future the Niokolo-Koba National Park (9,130
km2), which is an "International Biosphere Reserve Patrimony and Biosphere reserve" located in
the south-eastern corner of the Tambacounda and Kolda regions, will come under threat of
encroachment by charcoal exploitation practices. Should this be allowed to happen it would
have irreparable biodiversity and ecological consequences at the national and global levels. As
in the case of the management of forest stock, the government lacks the necessary resources --
and the private sector the interest -- to implement the required environmental protection
mechanism to safeguard the Niokolo-Koba National Park from that potential encroachment.
Here again, the responsibilization of the rural communities around the park area could lead to the
implementation of effective and sustainable biodiverstity protection measures. The combination
of the community-based forest management activities with the protection of the Niokolo-Koba
park could be achieved by implementing sustainable and participatory forest management units
forming a buffer zone around the park area.

E. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
1.    Main Past and Ongoing Programs
LPG Promotion
3.21.  In 1974 the Government launched an LPG promotion program intended to curtail the
rapidly growing consumption of charcoal in the cities. Relatively low single-burner LPG stoves
were introduced, and the controlled fuel price was set below cost. Under that program, annual
LPG consumption increased from about 3,500 tons in 1974 to 16,000 tons in 1987, implying an
average growth rate of 12% per year. In 1987 the Government added further stimulus to
consumption by reducing the LPG price by about 40%; the result was an acceleration of sales, to
reach over 50,000 tons in 1994. The annual growth rate in the period 1987-1994 averaged 18%
per year.
3.22.  The European Union (EU) provided further support to the government's butanization
program through a regional butane program (Programme Regional de Gaz - PRG) to the CILSS
member countries. The financial assistance to Senegal comprised investment in storage facilities
and money for promotion and consumer education. The funds were channeled through the
private distributors but, since the retail price was controlled anyway, the end use consumers did
not benefit and the incremental impact on charcoal use was nil. For various reasons, the PRG
was no success in other CILSS countries either, and in 1995 the EU formally discontinued the
Program.
3.23   Meanwhile, the countries of the CFA zone had to adjust their pricing policies for the
effect of the 100% currency devaluation in January 1994. The Government of Senegal protected
LPG consumers by increasing the controlled price by only 30% whereas it allowed an effective
price increase of domestically produced charcoal by 60%.
3.24.  Although the different LPG promotion programs have displaced an estimated 90,000
tons of charcoal per year and, as a result, stabilized charcoal consumption in Dakar at around
130,000 tons per year, the overall effectiveness has been mixed. The benefit of subsidies has
been captured only by higher-income urban households and small commercial establishments.
The annual level of the subsidies reached FCFA 5 billion (or $ 10 million) in 1995. It is argued
that the subsidy is not a burden on the national treasury because it is financed out of petroleum
product revenues. However, that implies in inequitable income transfers within the economy
and, since users of other petroleum products pay for the cross subsidy, it further has promoted a
distortion of the entire framework of energy prices.
Dissemination of Improved Stoves
3.25.  The dissemination of improved fuelwood and charcoal stoves in Senegal began in 1980
under the responsibility of the CERER, which developed two improved stoves (Ban ak Suuf and
Sakkanal) with reasonable performance and consumer acceptance. However, by 1987, CERER
had only been able to disseminate some 30,000 Ban ak Suuf fuelwood stoves in the rural areas
and less than 10,000 Sakkanal charcoal stoves in the urban areas. Between 1988 and 1994 little
progress was registered in the promotion of improved stoves. Currently, there are only few
improved stove projects in operation and they are mostly focused on charcoal. These projects,



20
however, are still too small to make a visible impact and/or are largely dependent on donor
support. It is estimated that only between 5 and 12 percent of Senegalese households have
improved stoves.
3.26.  Based on available information, the best program in operation today is the USAID-
funded Appropriate Technology International (ATI) Diambar charcoal stove program. This
program supports the production of stoves in Dakar and Thies. The Diambar stove, which
consists of a ceramic interior covered in sheet metal, is proving to be very efficient (30-40%)
under normal household use conditions and has a high consumer acceptability. A wider
dissemination of this promising stove, however, has been limited by availability of investment
credit to the small artisans who produce the ceramic and the metal shell. Current sales of
Diambar stoves are reported at 20,000 per year at prices that vary from 2,000 FCFA to 4,500
FCFA depending on the size. At the estimated 30-40 percent efficiency range, a wider
dissemination of the Diambar stove could result in a significant reduction in charcoal
consumption and expeditures at the household level.
3.27.  Other urban-based improved charcoal stove projects include the PAMEC project (metal
and leather artisans project) from MEMI's Directorate of Artisanat which support artisans in
Thies, Kaolack, Saint Louis and Louga; the ENDA-Graf which assists metal artisans in Dakar
and Rufisque; and different small stove-related women's groups support activities by the
Ministry of Women, Children and the Family.
3.28.  While many reasons have been offered for the limited success of most improved stoves
program in West Africa, recent work suggests that too much emphasis was given to technical
performance (energy efficiency) and too little to consumer acceptability. The majority of the
sociological field work undertaken did not have research objectives but rather was intended to
convince consumers to utilize improved stoves through "sensibilization campaigns". With few
exceptions consumers consistently were unable to perceive the benefit of improved stoves and
penetration remained a function of direct donor-financed promotion efforts. As soon as donor
financing was cut penetration stopped and households did not replace stoves when the time came
to do so. The sociological studies were used to influence the technical design of stoves (pot size
capability, type of food cooked, etc.) but not necessarily to design the stove's social
marketability. As a result even highly performing stoves under laboratory conditions lacked the
necessary consumer attractiveness (quality of material, presentation, marketing approach, etc.) to
generate commercial success stories. At the same time, while it was expected that consumers
would perceived the economic advantage of utilizing improved stoves, market price/quantity
distortions and speculation (the practice to sell presumable kilogram units with as little as 700
grams of actual weight) rapidly eroded the expected saving because fuelwood and charcoal are
not traded on the basis of standardized units but of money (i.e., 50 FCFA or 10 FCFA of
charcoal). As the non-regulated fuel units shrank through time by up to 30% there went with it
the possibility for consumers to perceive any concrete saving.
Forestry Projects
3.29.  Many aforestation projects have been carried out in Senegal the course of the last decade
to increase forest resources. At present, 30 programs are under way. The approach of these
projects was long dominated by reforestation on force account. This had only a limited impact
because of the high cost (US $500 - US $750 per hectare) relative to the benefits, the difficulty
of protecting the forestry stands against over-exploitation and the lack of participation of the



21
rural communities. Recent years have seen a gradual shift from reforestation operations on force
account to a more communitarian approach and with the integration of agro-sylvo-pastoral
activities. Today, a large number of those projects focus on rural forestry and half of them
include some training, information dissemination and education activities. By now some
150,000 ha. have been replanted since 1970. Despite the importance of the progress made, the
current reforestation rate (close to 20,000 ha/year) is still well below that of deforestation and
over the short-to-medium term the new plantations will not to play a significant role in the
supply of wood products (charcoal included).
Improvement of Carbonization Techniques
3.30.  A program to train charcoal makers in the use of improved kilns (the "Casamance" kiln)
was undertaken between 1980 and 1986. The program trained more than 7,500 charcoal
workers. For a relatively small investment (about FCFA 20,000), the kiln boosts the
carbonization yield by 20%. Nevertheless, the program was discontinued because successive
evaluations showed that the charcoal laborers ("surghas ") continued to use their traditional
carbonization methods in stead of the improved kilns. The principal reasons for this was the
"surghas" complete dependence on the commercial charcoal traders ("exploitants forestiers"),
who had no incentive to investment in kilns or to pay the additional cost to transport them into
the charcoal production sites. As charcoal production quotas were set on the basis of charcoal
quantities and not on the basis of areas or wood volumes, any additional production cost would
only reduced the trader's profit margins.
3.31.  As the new wood volume-based charcoal quota system comes into effect in 1997, it is
expected that traders will have a clear incentive to utilize improved kilns, as doing so would
maximize their revenues for the same level of effort and forest resources. While the traders
could be expected to upgrade their carbonization practices within the next 2 to 3 years, all
community-based charcoal production promoted by the proposed project will based on improved
technology. The use of improved carbonization methods will be monitored throughout the
proposed project and the economic and financial information obtained in the first three years of
the project will be used for the elaboration of a new woodfuels pricing and fiscal policy due to be
enacted by the government by December 2000 (para. 6.9.iii). The operation, monitoring and
enforcement mechanisms for the production of charcoal by the rural communities will be
stipulated within the "contract plans" (para.5.4.vii) that will be established between the
government and the participating communities. The overall enforcement of the charcoal related
regulatory and policy changes will be the responsibility of the Forestry Service. The Forestry
Service will act on the basis of the monitoring and supervision systems that will be implemented
by the project (forest resources exploitation, woodfuels trade flows and community
participation).
2.    Future Strategy
3.32.  In order to address the existing problems and contribute towards the effective
development of the traditional and household energy sectors in Senegal it will be necessary to
undertake a well focused set of priority actions. It is obvious that numerous other things can and
perhaps should be done to some degree, however, the limitation of human and investment
resources imposes the need to retain focus over a small core group of complementary priority
actions:



22
Institutional Issues and Options
*  to strengthen the existing sectoral institutions (primarily the Direction des Eaux et
Forets and Direction de l'Energie) and to upgrade their staff and means to plan,
coordinate, monitor and evaluate sectoral activities and measures; and
*  to elaborate and implement a sound communication strategy capable of maintaining
the entire population (government agencies and civil society at large) informed of
the developments in the sector, to lay the ground for necessary policy reform work
(changes in pricing, charcoal quotas, taxation, forestry codes, forestry application
decrees, land and tree tenure, etc.) and to effectively promote the different demand
management measures and inter-fuel substitution fuels or equipment (improved
stoves, gas, kerosene, etc.).
Traditional Energy Markets
*  implement large scale community-based sustainable forest management systems
capable of spatially fixing production of woodfuels for the rapidly growing urban
markets (particularly charcoal) and promoting integrated natural resource
management and biodiversity protection. In order to do this the following activities
would have to be undertaken: a comprehensive inventory of forestry and other
biomass resources, in conjunction with a survey of land use; participatory rural
appraisals in target communities to ensure their participation in the proposed
sustainable management plans;  and make the necessary adjustments in the
regulatory framework so as to create the right regulatory environment (land and tree
tenure, taxation, revenues, etc.);
-  promote the implementation of rural community-run improved charcoal kilns
(Casamance kilns) at concentrated fixed locations in order to increase the efficiency
of the charcoal carbonization and spatially organize its production; and
-  support the economic diversification (including commercial timber plantations,
urban and rural retail activities, LPG distribution, etc.) of the existing exploitants
forestiers to reduce the potential conflicts of the gradual transfer of an important
part of the industry and revenues to the rural communities.
Regulatory and Policy Issues and Options
*  enact the necessary legislation to replace charcoal quotas in the areas under
community management by sustainable annual production ceilings fixed by the
management plan agreed between the government and the communities and, as a
transitional measures, to ensure that the immediate vicinity of the villages in non-
managed zones should be protected from indiscriminate cutting by an exclusion zone
(e.g. a radius of several km);
* enact the application decree for setting-up of the Niokolo-Koba protection buffer
zone;



23
*  change the charcoal royalty system from its present charcoal output base to a wood
input base in order to promote increase carbonization efficiency.
*  review  and simplify the current woodfuels regulatory systems to reduce its
enforcement burden and to reduce the opportunities for process corruption; and
*  establish a modem and strengthened system for monitoring and controlling forestry
exploitation and flows of woodfuels, in order to ensure compliance with the forestry
management plans, provide reliable data on a regular basis, increase forestry revenue
and ensure the protection of the forest stocks and of biodiversity.
Energy Demand Management
*  introduce standard weights and measures and improved charcoal handling (including
the introduction of standardized bagging of charcoal at the retail level) in order to
protect consumers from price/quantity speculation by retailers and to reduction of
urban pollution;
-  remove all controls on charcoal retail prices as soon as enforceable standard weights
have been established and more competition has been introduced;
-  promote the production and marketing of improved charcoal stoves in the urban
center by the private sector and/or NGO community at non-subsidized market prices;
and
*  promote the use of improved stoves in the urban households through appropriate
sensibilization and consumer information campaigns;
Inter-fuel Substitution Options
*  review the procurement, storage and handling systems of the LPG and Kerosene in
Senegal, with a view to identify the areas and issues which can be improve (cost,
efficiency, transparency, and performance) in order to reduce either the need for
governmental subsidies or their final retail prices;
*  continue to support the dissemination of LPG by the private sector nationwide,
through the standardization of retail prices ("perequation"), limited financial support
to private sector entrepreneurs for the construction of decentralized depots and
suitable promotion operations; and
*  explore the potential of kerosene as a substitute fuel for the secondary cities of the
country where the consumption of charcoal is increasing rapidly.

IV.   BANK GROUP/GEF ROLE IN THE TRADITIONAL ENERGY SECTOR
A. HISTORY AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvIOuS BANK/IDA/GEF INVOLVEMENT
4.1.   The proposed project incorporates the principal lessons learned over the past two
decades in "household" energy and participatory natural resource management interventions in
West Africa, including projects in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mali and Niger. The lessons
incorporated include but are not limited to the need to:
(i)  focus the priority for action in the traditional energy/household energy sector on
the establishment of sustainable woodfuels supply systems capable of satisfying
the growing and concentrated urban markets;
(ii) enact a legal and regulatory framework that provides for the effective transfer of
the control over natural resources from the Government to the rural populations;
(iii) implement a simplified traditional and household fuels fiscal and pricing
regulatory framework which avoids loopholes and opportunities for market
distortions and "corruption";
(iv) follow a natural resource and rural development approach to the implementation of
community managed woodfuels supply schemes to ensure the materialization and
sustainability of social and economic development under the project;
(v) re-orient the role of governmental agencies towards policy formulation activities
and away from actual project execution, and promote an increased participation of
civil society (community, NGOs and private sector) in the implementation of non-
subsidized project activities (inter-fuel substitution, improved stoves, etc.); and
(vi) promote and maintain ample consultation/ participation of all the "stakeholders"
throughout the entire policy-project cycle, and implement a sound communication
strategy.
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK/GEF FINANCING AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE COUNTRY
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
4.2.   The project is a logical progression of the new traditional energy sector development
strategy developed with the Bank's assistance (RPTES Program) and is fully consistent with the
agreed Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of February 16, 1995. Its implementation would
result in advancements in key areas of the Bank's development assistance agenda for Senegal,
including -- but not limited to -- the rationalization and stabilization of the energy sector,
promotion of sustainable forest and natural resource management practices, creation of
participatory and gender-balanced rural development opportunities, private sector development,
NGO community participation and reduction of environmental degradation. Further, the project
would be fully consistent with the principles and recommendations of Agenda 21, the



26
Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD), the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Beijing Declaration.
4.3.   While the current institutional and policy environments of the forestry and energy
sectors in Senegal justify Bank involvement and support, up until recently both sectors were
plagued by serious problems, the least of which was a strong interference by political and
economic interest groups in policy and institutional matters and even in daily operational issues
within in the sector. Those problems, exacerbated by serious incidents like the clear-cutting of
the Mbegue forest in 1992, led to the suspension of a Bank forestry sector project in 1992
(PICOGERNA) and to the refusal by the Bank and other donors to finance investment proposals
presented by the GoS at an Energy Donors Round Table in 1992. Nevertheless, as in other
Africa countries, Senegal has experienced a considerable process of political and institutional
change in the last three years as a direct result of the ongoing push towards democratization and
administrative decentralization. Whereas some time will still be required for Senegal to put that
negative past behind, there is today a clear awareness in government that a repetition of incidents
such as the clear-cutting of the Mbegue forest would result on seriously destabilizing internal
and external political and economic repercussions.
4.4.   Clearly marking the changes that have taken place in Senegal in the recent past, the new
forestry code expressly provides for the transfer of responsibility from the Government to the
rural communities for the sustainable management and exploitation of the existing natural forest
resources, and establishes that all forest resources exploitation activities must now be consulted
with and approved by the affected rural communities. This fundamental regulatory change --
which would have been unthinkable a decade ago -- is fully consistent with the overall trend
toward administrative decentralization and has the full commitment of the Government at the
ministerial and technical levels. Nevertheless, the still powerful -- although rapidly diminishing
-- charcoal oligopoly that exists cannot and should not be dismantled overnight. An organized
process of gradual transition and increasing participation of the rural populations in the
woodfuels industry trade will be necessary in order to avoid sudden woodfuels market ruptures,
and the negative energy, social and political consequences that would result from them. Such a
gradual process is also necessary from environmental and energy efficiency points of view, as
the rural population will need some time to assimilate both sustainable forest management and
efficient carbonization practices and methods. Not allowing for such a gradual transition would
result in low natural resource sustainability, decreased carbonization efficiencies and potential
social and economic conflicts from the redistribution of part of the industry's income to the rural
communities.
4.5.   The sustainable woodfuels supply management component qualifies for GEF support
under the short term projects window of the operational strategy for climate change. The
component is a country sustainable development and global environment priority, likely to
succeed. It is also highly cost effective in the short term (US $ 4.30/t CO2 after 7 years and US $
1.04/t CO2 after 15 years). Its objective is carbon sequestration, which the strategy flags as a
possible future operational program and on which early experience is sought. The participation
of GEF in the project is necessary in order to assist the GoS in the financing of community-
participatory activities ("mesures incitatives ") and monitoring and evaluation systems designed
to generate and/or guarantee the materialization of incremental global environmental benefits
(climate change and biodiversity agendas). Through the implementation of sustainable forest
resources management systems, the project will provide -- within the project area and dimension
- for the production of 300,000 tons/year of fuelwood with a zero net emission effect, thus



27
significantly reducing ongoing CO2 emissions. In addition, the project would establish a buffer
zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park, increasing the protection to biodiversity.
Without GEF financing the GoS will lack the necessary funding to cover the proposed activities
and thus the global environmental benefits would not be realized. In addition to the above, a
highly cost effective improved charcoal stoves program activity (unit abatement cost of US
$0.34/t CO2 after 7 years) will be included within project's Demand Management component.
While this activity will n= be financed by GEF its implementation is fully consistent with GEF's
operational program for removing barriers to energy conservation and energy efficiency. The
barriers in this case are shortage of up-front capital and lack of knowledge. Annex 1 presents a
descriptive summary of the Niokolo-Koba National Park and its national and global
biodiversity significance. Annex 2 presents a summary of the monitoring and evaluation
activities of the GEF components. Annex 3 presents a detailed discussion and calculations of the
project's GEF incremental cost and expected global environmental benefits.

V.    THE PROJECT
5.1.   Background.  The proposed project was prepared by the GoS with assistance from the
Bank's Africa Regional Program "Review of Policies in the Traditional Energy Sector -
RPTES". Through the RPTES a national inter-ministerial team conducted between mid 1993
and late 1994, a comprehensive review of the traditional energy sector in Senegal, including the
evaluation of the principal inter-fuel substitution issues and options (kerosene and LPG).
Within that review, the regulatory, legal, pricing and fiscal frameworks of the sector and the
evolution of its structure and functioning were studied in detail. The inter-ministerial RPTES
team was led by the Directorate of Energy of the Ministry of Energy, Mining, and Industry
(MEMI) and was integrated by other senior staff from the Directorate for Water and Forests of
the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Nature (MEPN), Ministry of Commerce,
Ministry of Women Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Plan, and inter alia, the National CILSS
Commission (CONACILSS), which are all members of the "Cellule de Combustibles
Domestiques". By May 1995 the five RPTES participating countries presented their respective
policy conclusions and recommendations and a draft of investment project at the "RPTES Donor
Experts' Conference" at Maastricht, The Netherlands. After the Maastricht conference, the
Senegal RPTES team went to work on the polishing of their proposed sectoral investment
program based on the comments received from the several donor present. The basic project draft
design was extensively discussed among different government agencies, the NGO community
and several beneficiary consultation and participation activities have and will be done through-
out project implementation (see section Beneficiary Participation and Consultation).
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.2.   Project Objectives.   The objective of the project is to meet an important part of the
rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the
ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. This objective would be met
through:
(i)  the implementation and monitoring of 300,000 hectares of environmentally
sustainable community-managed forest resource systems in the Tambacounda and
Kolda regions of Senegal, creating a protection zone around the Niokolo-Koba
National Park (Biosphere Reserve);
(ii) the promotion of private sector inter-fuel substitution and private sector and NGO-
based improved stoves initiatives; and
(iii) the strengthening of the institutions involved in the management of the sector, and
the promotion of the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic
institutions, and NGOs community) in the operation of the sector.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
5.3.    Project Description.  The project consists of three components: (i) Preparatory and
Support Activities component; (ii) Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component;
and, (iii) Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options component.   The
project design includes a series of activities to ensure an effective participation of the rural
population ("measures incitatives") and thus guarantee the full achievement of the
environmental sustainability objective of the project.  The project also includes specific
monitoring and evaluation activities (forest exploitation and wildlife) designed to evaluate the
achievement of its global environmental objectives (maintenance of carbon sequestration
capacity, CO2 emission abatement and biodiversity conservation:
5.4.   Component I: The Preparatory and Support Activities component would have an
approximate duration of one calendar year and would finance technical assistance, equipment
and operational costs to carry out:
(i)   A comprehensive assessment of vegetation cover in the Tambacounda and Kolda
regions to generate the technical data necessary to design sound community-level
sustainable forest management plans and to select the specific geographical areas
to be covered by the project;
(ii) A series of participatorv rural appraisals to obtain the demographic, socio-
economic, and cultural information necessary to prepare, with the local
communities, the specific management plans. These Parse would pay special
attention to the identification of relevant women's development issues, specific
training and capacity building needs;
(iii) The design of monitoring and evaluation systems including: (a) a forest resources
exploitation monitoring system for the Tambacounda and Kolda regions to
evaluate the sustainability achieved by the community-managed systems and to
supervise the operation of the non-community based woodfuels traders and their
compliance with authorized exploitation plans; (b) a forest fire monitoring and
response system for the community-managed areas to assist in the reduction of
forest resource losses within the project area;  (c) a rural community-based
wildlife monitoring system to evaluate the compliance with and achievement of
the project's biodiversity objective; (d) a national woodfuels trade flows
monitoring system to enable the correct quantification of the market requirements
and the preparation of long-term woodfuels supply strategies at the national level;
(e) kerosene and LPG penetration monitoring systems; and (f) urban improved
stoves penetration monitoring system.
(iv) The elaboration of capacity building and training programs, with special emphasis
on the training and extension needs of the regional Forest Services offices,
community groups and NGOs;
(v)  Institutional development and capacity building  support to the different
govemmental agencies, community associations and NGOs that will participate in
the implementation of the project, with special emphasis in the training and
"recycling" of the Forest Service staff who will be directly responsible for the



31
implementation of the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component and
the staff of the Energy Directorate (MEMI);
(vi) Elaboration of technical studies and assessments on demand management and
interfuel substitution issues (kerosene stoves and penetrations strategies, improved
charcoal stoves, energy pricing, etc.);
(vii) The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the annual participatory
forest management modules, including the preparation of standard Government-
rural community "Contract Plans";
(viii) The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the Demand Management
and Inter-fuel Substitution Options Component, including the selection of the
private sector and NGO initiatives to be supported by the project; and
(ix) The design of a comprehensive project implementation communication strategy to
promote increased participation of civil society (community, NGOs and private
sector) in the management and operation of the sector.
5.5.   Component II:  The Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component would
finance technical assistance, small tools and field equipment for the rural communities, vehicles
and office and field equipment for the Forest Service (regional offices), forest fire control
equipment, and community projects (carbonization units, agro-forestry enterprises, etc. (micro-
realisations communitaires) to carry out:
(i)  The implementation of sustainable community-managed forest management
systems over and area of 300,000 ha within a total period of six years, from which
woodfuels would be produced. The project would seek to reinforce the buffer
zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park (international "Biosphere
Reserve"). This component would implement annually increasing "forest/natural
resource management modules", starting at 15,000 ha in the second year up to
100,000 ha in the seventh year;
(ii)  An assessment of the availability of and access to woodfuels for rural subsistence
consumption at the national scale, paying particular attention to the availability of
dead wood vis-a-vis the geographic dispersion of the rural population;
(iii) Technical support and extension services to the participating rural communities
and NGOs for the implementation of the participatory management modules and
for the exploitation/production and marketing of woodfuels and other potential
wood and non-wood products;
(iv) Support for the establishment of rural-based micro-enterprises, such as
community-operated carbonization units, agro-forestry processing units, etc.; and
(v)  The implementation of a comprehensive communication strategy in support of the
implementation of the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component.



32
5.6.   Component III:  The Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options
component would finance technical assistance, vehicles and office equipment for the Direction
de I 'Energie, purchase of 1,000 kerosene stoves for a pilot program; purchase of LPG bottles and
burners to carry out:
(i)  Support for the re-organization and modernization of the urban charcoal trade to
establish long-term supply agreements (contracts) between rural communities and
urban traders -- to guarantee the unconstrained entry of community-produced
woodfuels to the urban markets -- and to permit the standardization of the
marketing units and the cleaning of the urban environment (charcoal bagging);
(ii)  Providing technical assistance and limited financial support for the economic
diversification of existing urban charcoal traders ("exploitants forestiers").
Proposal received include enterprise diversification into LPG retail, gas service
stations, foodstuffs retail and light transport activities. The financial support to be
provided by the project would be limited to organizational and training activities;
(iii) The execution of specific technical and market-feasibility studies to support the
further promotion of LPG and Kerosene as substitute household fuels (the
kerosene study will complement a proposed GTZ-funded study within the recently
launched German-Senegalese Household Energy Assistance Project); and
(iv) Providing support for the continuation of inter-fuel substitution options (kerosene
and LPG) and dissemination of improved stoves by the private sector and NGOs.
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
5.7.   Project Cost and Financing.  The total project cost is estimated at US $19.9 million,
with a foreign exchange component of about US $18.7 million (94%). The financing plan
includes US $1.2 million from GoS (para. 7.1.iii), US $5.2 million from IDA, US $4.7 million
from GEF, and US $8.8 million to cofinanced by the Dutch Government. The GEF Council has
already approved the request for funding for the project (US $4.7 million) (para. 7.2.i). The
GEF funding includes US $500,000 from the Danish Environmental Program. It is important to
note that, as outlined above, the financing plan does not include the large in-kind financing from
the rural communities (sustainable forest management) and NGOs (community support and
improved stoves activities), nor the investments that are expected from the promotion of private
sector activities (modernization of the charcoal filiere and inter-fuel substitution).
5.8.   GEF Incremental Costs.  The incremental cost of the "GEF Alternative scenario" is
US $4.66 million. This represents the cost for the implementation of activities within the
Preparatory and Support Activities and the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management
components related to community-participation, integrated natural resources management,
institutional development and the monitoring and evaluation of global environmental benefits.
5.9.  It is estimated that over the project duration of 7 years the GEF Alternative Scenario
would achieve a total CO2 emission abatement of 1.1 million tons at an incremental cost of
US $4.30/ t C02- Over 15 years, the GEF Alternative scenario would result in a C02 emission



33
abatement of 4.5 million tons at an incremental cost of US $1.041t CO2 (see Annex 3 for a
detailed calculation of the project's Incremental Cost and Global Benefits).
D. BENEFICIARY CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
5.10. The sectoral development strategy and investment proposals prepared by the GoS were
widely discussed at all levels of Government and with the civil society, including the private and
academic sectors and the NGO community, during national participatory seminars and
workshops. A special national workshop for "exploitants forestiers" was held in 1994 and
periodic consultations were sustained since with key sector entrepreneurs to ensure their support
for the implementation of the envisaged policies and investments. Three regional workshops
(including delegations from Burkina Faso, Gambia, Niger, Mali & Senegal) were held to
promote a regional discussion of country policy findings and investment proposals and cross-
country comparisons and to allow for a direct exchange of experiences. Table 5.1 presents a
summary of the participation plan for the proposed project (para. 7.1.iii). Annex 4 presents a
descriptive summary of the project's participation action plan.
5.11. In December 1995 three "Project Design Workshops" (Government agencies, NGOs &
private sector and donor community) were held in Dakar to further review the proposed project's
design concept. A large NGO community consultation meeting was held in Dakar in late March,
1996 to prepare a series of direct beneficiary (rural community) consultation workshops which
took place in April 1996.
5.12.  Because of the nature of the proposed project, its participation and beneficiary
consultation aspects are of critical importance. The participation activities that would be
undertaken within the project have as main objective assuring that the implementation of the
project will be based on beneficiary representative participation (para. 7.1 .ii).
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.13. The Ministry of Environment and Protection of Nature (MEPT) and the Ministry of
Energy, Mines and Industry (MEMI) through the appointment of a National Project Director
(NPD) and the establishment of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be jointly
responsible for the overall implementation of the project (para. 7.2.ii). The implementation of
the Preparatory and Support Activities component would be under the joint responsibility of
MEPT and MEMI as this component includes preparatory activities related to areas of
competence of both ministries. The National Water and Forest Directorate (NWFD/MEPT)
alone would be responsible for the implementation of the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply
Management component of the project. The Energy Directorate (DE/MIME) would be
responsible for the implementation of the Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution
Options component. The existing "Cellule de combustibles domestiques" would serve as a
"consultative group" for the project and would provide the institutional conduit for multi-agency
coordination. Moreover, a small formal high-level "Steering Committee" for the project will be
set-up to oversee the implementation of the project and provide guidance on important issue that
arise. This Steering Committee will be formed by senior representatives of the Borrower, the
project's donor agencies and, possibly, representatives of the civil society.

Table 5.1: Summary of proposed Participation Action Plan (PAP)
Key Elements of the Plan
*  Based on a Consultative and Participatory Process: The design of this plan resulted from a
consultative process of Policy Formulation and Project Identification involving several key stakeholders.
In addition, a series of National and Regional Participatory Project Preparation Workshops were
conducted by the Government of Senegal between December 1995 and April 1996 to obtain feedback and
suggestions from representatives of civil society on the overall project strategy.
* NGO Oversight: The Government of Senegal will choose an NGO to be responsible for the monitoring
of the SPEMP-PAP. This "lead" NGO will be responsible for promoting, monitoring and reporting on all
participatory activities during the project implementation phase.
*  Phase of Preparatory and Support Activities: The first 12-18 months of the project will be dedicated to
participatory preparation activities, as well as other support activities. The participatory preparation
activities will allow communities to design their own community management plans as well as for the
project team to obtain additional social, economic, ecological, and functional information necessary for
project implementation. Once the actual implementation of the sustainable woodfuels management
systems begins, additional PRAs will be conducted in the rural communities that are expected to join the
project in the subsequent year.
*  Role of Women, Youth and NGOs4: Due to their critical role in resource management and development,
women, youth and NGOs have been identified as key participants and will play a fundamental role
throughout the life cycle of the project.
*  Participatory Methodology Training for Government Officials: General sensitizing of government
decision makers on participatory approaches and their impact on development is planned as a key
component of capacity building and institutional development activities for the Government of Senegal.
5.14   The project includes a Preparatory and Support Activities components which entails the
detailed design and preparation of all major project investment components. As such, the
Preparatory and Support Activities component is intended to serve like a "project preparation
facility (PPF)". A PPF was not considered for this project because of the relatively small size of
the overall operation did not warrant the establishment of a PPF. Rather, an initial component
through which design issues would be finalized and which would constitute _ condition of
disbursement for the investment activities of the two additional components (supply and
Demand) (para. 7.3). Table 5.2 presents an implementation calendar for the SPEMP project.
The implementation of the project -- and in particular the preparatory and support services
component -- will make full use of the accumulated Bank and non-Bank experience accumulated
thus far in the sub-region in similar forest/natural resources management projects. Among Bank
projects, the SPEMP activities will closely review: (i) Burkina Faso: Programme National de
Gestion Terroir (PNGT); (ii) Niger: Energy II; (iii) Mali: Household Energy Project (HEP); and
Mali: Programme de Gestion des Resources Naturelles (PGRN). Other non-Bank projects to be

(CBOs)



35
studies, include: (i) Burkina Faso (UNDP/FAO): Programme National de Amenagement
Forestiers (PNAF); (ii) Senegal (Dutch Cooperation): Previnova; and (iii) Gambia (GTZ):
Forestry Project.

5.15   The assessment of vegetation cover in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions will be
undertaken by the Inventory and Cartography Division of the Forestry Service with support from
the Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE) and of specialized consultant assistance. An initial review
of the different methodologies that have already been used in Senegal to undertake forest and
vegetation cover inventories will be made. On the basis of that, one methodology will be chosen
or design to undertake the intended vegetation cover assessment. It is envisaged that the chosen
methodology will be later adopted as the standardized methodology for subsequent
forest/vegetation cover inventories and assessments in Senegal. The reason for conducting a
vegetatimn assessment as opposed to a narrower forest resource assessment is to obtain the
information necessary to design the community-based natural resource management strategies
and plans envisaged by the project (forest, agriculture, herding, extraction, etc.).
5.16   The participatorv rural appraisals constitute the principal participatory activity of the
preparatory and Support Activities Component and are expected to provide the basis for the
identification and selection of the rural communities to be included in the project. The execution
of the PRAs will be done by locally active NGO groups under the supervision of the regional
Forestry Service agencies. The base methodology for the PRAs will be prepared by the Forestry
Service of the PCU with assistance of specialized consultants as required (individuals and/or
NGOs). The resulting methodology will be subject to specific IDA approval. The first batch of
PRAs should be completed by the end of the first year of project implementation. As conditions
in the rural communities are expected to change over time, only a limited number of PRAs will
be conducted during the Preparatory and Support Activities Component (approximately 40
PRAs). The remaining PRAs will be undertaken in years 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the project
implementation schedule. The initial 40 PRAs however are expected to provide the necessary
input to design "standard" participatory and sustainable forest management modules.
5.17   The design of monitoring and evaluation systems (forest resources exploitation; forest
fire; wildlife; national woodfuels trade flows, kerosene and LPG penetration; and improved
stoves) will be done by specialized consultants (individuals, private firms and/or NGO) under the
supervision of the PCU. This activity should be completed by the end of the first year of project
implementation.
5.18   The elaboration of capacity building and training programs and the preparation of a
detailed implementation plan for the annual participatory forest management modules (including
the Government-rural community "Contract Plans") will be done by the Forestry Service
with support from specialized consultants and technical assistance groups. Among other, it is
envisaged that FAO will play a role in the development and implementation of the intended
capacity development and training programs as a cooperation agency. This activity should be
completed within the first 18 months of project implementation.

5.19   The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the annual participatory and
sustainable forest management modules (including the preparation of standard Govemment-rural
community "Contract Plans ") will be done by the Forestry Service with support from
specialized consultants and technical assistance groups. The implementation plan would be
designed with the direct participation of the rural populations taking into account the
multifunctionality of the existing agro-ecosystems and thus the socio-economic parameters and
interests of the local community. This activity should be completed by the first year of project
implementation.
5.20   The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the Demand Management and
Inter-fuel Substitution Options Component will be done by the Energy Directorate with
specialized consultant support as needed, and should be completed by the first year of project
implementation.
5.21   The design of a comprehensive project implementation communication strategy for the
entire project will be done by specialized consultants under the supervision of the PCU. This
activity should be completed by the first year of project implementation.
2. Component II: Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management
5.22   The implementation of sustainable community-managed forest management systems
will be based on the legal transfer of the responsibility for the management and exploitation of
the forest resources to the rural communities. The expected implementation cycle of the
community-based participatory system in any given area/community is expected to last a total of
three years, going from full project involvement during the first year to gradual disengagement
staring on the second year until the third year, when mostly project funded monitoring and
evaluation systems would remain in place. As of the end of the first year of field implementation
the participating communities will be expected to assume an increasing responsibility over all
implementation aspects, including the funding from local revenue of follow-up technical
assistance. This sub-component will cover a total area of 300,000 ha -- reinforcing the protective
buffer zone that has been established around the Niokolo-Koba National Park -- within the six
years of field implementation period (year 2-7) in accordance with the approximate incremental
schedule presented in Table 5.3.
5.23   The national dead wood assessment will be executed by the Forestry Service with
specialized support from the Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE). The field work of the
assessment will be combined with the regular field activities of the regional Forestry Service
agents. This activity should be completed by the end of the second year of project
implementation.
5.24   The activities of technical support and extension for the implementation of the
participatory forest management modules and for the exploitation/production and marketing of
woodfuels (the introduction of improved carbonization technologies and other potential wood
and non-wood products) will be executed under different operational arrangement including, as
needed, a combination of Forestry Service agents, technical assistance support (FAO) and
selected specialized NGOs. In the case of carbonization activities, special attention will be given
to the monitoring and enforcement of the agreed improved methods and production standards.

7                  100,000                300,000
5.25   The support for the establishment of rural-based micro-enterprises (community-operated
carbonization units, agro-forestry processing units, etc.) will be done by the PCU under
supervision of the two ministries (MEPT and MEMI). Micro-enterprise proposals will be
identified by the participating communities and or NGOs and elaborated by them with/without
specialized consultant support (individuals/NGOs). These proposals will be evaluated by the
PCU and decided upon on the basis of their individual merit. The size of the individual proposal
will vary but will be limited to a maximum equivalent of US $4,000 per village at any point in
time. The support for micro-enterprise development would be mobilize only when there is a
clear and tangible cofinancing of the local community in cash and/or kind (labor, natural
resources, tools, etc.). In the case of improved charcoal production, decision on support will be
further subject to the identification of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for ensuring the
compliance at the community level with the charcoal related regulatory and policy framework.
The specific evaluation criteria, mechanisms and modalities for the mobilization of the micro-
enterprise development support will be finalized (satisfactory to IDA) during the Preparatory and
Support Activities Component. This sub-component will be executed throughout the full project
implementation year 1-7) by specialized consultants (individual and/or firm) under the
supervision of the PCU.
5.26   The implementation of the communication strategy for the Sustainable Woodfuels
Supply Management component. This sub-component will be executed throughout the entire
project field implementation cycle (year 2-7) by specialized consultants (individual and/or firms)
under the supervision of the PCU.
3. Component III: Demand Management and Interfuel Substitution Options
5.27   The support for the re-organization and modernization of the urban charcoal trade to
establish long-term supply agreements (contracts) between rural communities and urban traders
(to guarantee the unconstrained entry of community-produced woodfuels to the urban markets)
and to permit the standardization of the marketing units and the cleaning of the urban
environment (charcoal bagging);
5.28   The provision of technical assistance and limited financial support for the economic
diversification of existing urban charcoal traders ("exploitants forestiers ") will be based on the
proposal generated directly by charcoal traders. Thus far the proposals received include



39
enterprise diversification into LPG retail, gas service stations, foodstuffs retail and light transport
activities. The financial support to be provided by the project would be limited to organizational
and training activities and it would be executed by the Energy Directorate through specialized
private sector and enterprise development consultants and/or firms.
5.29   The execution of specific technical and market-feasibility studies to support the further
promotion of LPG and Kerosene as substitute household fuels will complement a GTZ-funded
study within the recently launched German-Senegalese Household Energy Assistance Project.
The main activity envisaged under this sub-component is limited to technical and market
feasibility research on kerosene stoves (including pilot testing of 1,000 stoves). This sub-
component would be executed by specialized consultants under the supervision of the
Directorate of Energy and should be completed within the third year of project implementation.
5.30   The provision of support for the continuation of inter-fuel substitution (kerosene and
LPG) and dissemination of improved stoves by the private sector and the NGO community will
be undertaken by the Directorate of Energy. Although it is expected that the private sector will
take charge of the implementation and funding of LPG and kerosene activities beyond the
proposed limited support activities (kerosene stove promotion and LPG decentralized depots), it
is possible that additional funding might be mobilized through GTZ or other sources to support
the expansion of kerosene as a least cost household fuel. All further LPG expansion activities
should be financed by the private sector. The support to the dissemination of improved stoves is
intended to provide limited investment funds to expand the market-based production capacity of
existing competitive stove manufacturer. No funding will be provided for stove scientific
research activities. Investment funding support will be approved only for stove options that
prove to be feasible on a non-subsidized production/full cost recovery basis. Based on the
proposals identified thus far, it is anticipated that the ATI DIAMBAR stove would qualify for
the intended investment funding support.
F. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
5.31   Cofinancing Arrangements. Cofinancing by GEF (US $4.7 million) and the Dutch
Cooperation (US $8.8 million) will be administered by the Bank, as agreed during negotiations.
All procurement under the project will follow Bank procurement guidelines.
5.32   Table 5.4 summarizes the project cost by disbursement category and proposed
procurement method. A detailed procurement plan and timetable are given in Annex 5.
Senegal's procurement laws and regulations are consistent with IDA procurement guidelines.
No special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in Credit documents for
international competitive bidding (ICB), as Senegal's procurement regulations allow IDA
procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.
5.33   Civil Works. The civil works program (US $1.0 million) includes a large number of
very small contracts for the implementation of supporting community projects such as well
diggings, construction of rural health centers and other civil work components of income
generating activities within the implementation of the Integrated Natural Resource Management
Modules (over an area of 300,000 ha) under the Sustainable woodfuel component (II). Civil
works contracts financed under the credit will be awarded through NCB procedures. Due to

spread and high transportation costs, these civil works contracts are unlikely to attract foreign or
large firms that use modem equipment. Foreign bidders, however, would not be precluded from
submitting bids. Civil works contract management for the supporting community projects will
be delegated to NGOs or other private entities as appropriate.
5.34   Equipment.  Equipment requirements (US $2.5 million) include vehicles under the
Preparatory and Support Activities Component (I), vehicles (4X4s and motorcycles) and fire
control trucks for the implementation of Integrated Natural Resource Management modules
under the Sustainable woodfuel component (II), and vehicles under the Demand Management
and Interfuel Substitution Options Component (III). Provided that the aggregate amount does not
exceed US $150,000 equivalent purchase through the United Nations Development Program's
Inter-Agency Procurement Services will be permitted for office equipment and vehicles.
5.35   Goods. Goods (US $5.4 million) include under the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply
Management Component, small tools and field equipment for the rural communities, office
and field equipment for the Forest Service (regional offices), small forest fire control equipment
and purchase of equipment for the implementation of supporting community projects. Under the
Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution options component, office equipment for the
DE, purchase of 1,000 kerosene stoves for the pilot program; purchase LPG bottles and burners.
Goods will be grouped into packages of at least US $100,000 each and procured through ICB in



41
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(January 1995, revised January and August 1996). Standard bidding documents developed by
the Bank will be used. A preferential margin of 15 percent or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods for all ICB procurement will be given
to domestic firms in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Small quantities of goods such as
office supplies, consumable materials, and small tools and field equipment for the rural
communities, which are available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into bidding packages of
at least US $25,000, because of the decentralized planning and implementation functions that
will be carried out by the implementation agents (regional project offices, NGOs, community
groups, etc.), may be procured through local shopping, based on price quotations of at least three
reliable suppliers. All bids will be submitted on a c.i.f. basis for imported goods and on ex-
factory basis for locally manufactured goods.
5.36   Consultant services. Consultant services (US $3.5 million) include long-term resident
technical assistance in the form of TA personnel for the DE (US $0.3 million) and consultant
services for training activities and execution of studies (vegetation cover assessment, design of
monitoring and supervision systems, energy demand, etc.). In particular, the training activities
for consulting services will be required include all the capacity building, institutional
development (governmental institutions, civil society and NGOs), and participatory activities of
the Project. Within the Preparatory and Support Activities Component (I) the main training
activities will entail capacity building and institutional development of the Forestry Service and
Energy Directorate staff and participatory rural appraisals work. Within the Sustainable
woodfuel component (II) key training activities will be focused on the rural communities and
NGOs that will be responsible for the direct implementation of the sustainable forest
management modules. Within the Demand Management Component (III) the main training
activities will include the staff of the Energy Directorate and support services to the Charcoal
Traders (economic reconversion sub-component). International and local consultants providing
specialist services would be selected through Quality-and Cost-based and Least Cost procedures,
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (February 1997). The
standard Letter of Invitation and Form of Contract as developed by the Bank will be used for
appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e.
those not exceeding six months, carried out by individual consultants. Individual consultants
will be recruited on the basis of comparison of at least three (3) CVs taken from a roster
organized by specialties. Single-source hiring of individual consultants, if any, is subject to
Bank prior review. The NGOs or other private entities who are delegated Construction
management for the implementation of community-support projects will recruit the necessary
consultant services in accordance with the above-stated procedures.
5.37   Review by IDA.  Contracts for works and goods above the threshold value of US
$100,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA prior review procedures. The review process would
cover 70 percent of the total value of the amount contracted for goods and 56 percent of the
amount contracted for civil works. Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the
threshold levels will apply to about one in three contracts. Draft standard bidding documents for
NCB will be reviewed by and agreed upon with IDA. Prior IDA review will not apply to
contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US
$75,000 and US $35,000 equivalent respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA review
will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of value, to single-source
hiring of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA or to amendments of
contracts raising the contract value above the prior review threshold.



42
5.38   Proposed Procurement Arrangements.  During negotiations agreement was reached
on monitoring of procurement as well as the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB and
the standard procurement documents for NCB to be developed, reviewed by, and agreed upon
with IDA. The Government will submit to IDA for review: (a) a draft procurement plan; (b) a
draft Procedural Manual for Management and procurement; and (c) a draft bidding document
for the construction program and major equipment, as well as draft letters of invitation for
consultants services, related to activities financed by IDA during the first project year. The
Government will submit to IDA the final versions of these documents and gave assurances at
negotiations that it will apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the
above documents.
5.39   Disbursements.   The project is expected to be completed over a seven-year period,
with the IDA Credit disbursed over 8 years, according to the categories shown in Table 5.5,
below. The estimated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 6. Disbursement of the Credit
will be fully documented except for expenditures which would be made against Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs) valued at less than US $100,000 equivalent for firms and US $50,000
equivalent for individual consultants. Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be
retained by the PCU for review by IDA supervision missions and for semi-annual audits.

managed by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). The authorized allocation for the SA would
be US $450,000 equivalent. IDA will make an initial deposit of US $250,000 equivalent into the
SA upon credit effectiveness and will replenish the SA upon receipt of satisfactory proof of
incurred eligible expenditures.  Replenishment will be accompanied by up-to-date bank
statements and reconciliation of the SA. To expedite the implementation of day-to-day activities

currency at the district level, a SGSA (Second Generation Special Account) will be opened at
each of the Kolda and Tambacounda regions. Each district Forestry officer will be responsible
for establishing a yearly budget for the activities to be carried out, and necessary funds would be
regularly provided on the basis of justification. Accounts of the SGSA will be reconciled every
quarter with the PCU accountant, and funds made against eligible expenditures will be
replenished through the project account. Justifications of expenditure eligibility will be handed
over to the project accountant and kept as supporting documents for the use of the Statement of
Expenditures procedure.
5.42   The PCU would establish and maintain its accounts in accordance with International
Accounting Standards, and would conserve all the documentation related to project expenditures.
A detailed proposal on the accounting system and procedures to be followed and a profile of
personnel needed and equipment required would be prepared by consultants. The conditions for
the establishment of a financial management and accounting system for the project, acceptable to
IDA, were agreed during negotiations. The PCU will at all times keep financial records in
accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect its operations and financial position.
These records would be made available to visiting Bank missions and independent auditors. The
project accounts, including the SA and the SGSA, will be audited annually, in accordance with
International Standard of Auditing, by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA. In order
to facilitate the post review of procurement decisions not subject to IDA prior review, the
auditor's TOR would include a provision for a separate opinion on the consistency of such
procurement decisions with Bank Procurement Guidelines and provisions. The audited accounts
and the auditor's report, including the Management Letter (Long Form) and a statement as to
whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended purpose and a separate opinion with
respect to statement of expenditures and the Special Account, as well as the SGSAs, would be
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year for the Project. Assurances to
this effect were reached at negotiations. Agreement was reached at negotiations on the selection
procedures for the awarding of a multi-year contract for the auditing the Project accounts (para.
7.1.iii).
5.43   Overall implementation of the project would be supervised on an annual basis by IDA
and disbursements would be contingent on the satisfactory compliance with all project
conditions. In addition to annual supervision, the project would be evaluated in accordance with
established IDA procedures at mid-implementation (first semester of the fourth year) and at its
completion.  Three specific monitoring systems have been included in the project to



44
systematically evaluate the implementation process of key components and the realization of the
expected national and global benefits. These are: (i) a forest resources exploitation monitoring
system for the Tambacounda and Kolda regions, to supervise compliance with established
exploitation plans and to evaluate the achievement of resource sustainability and to assess the
impact of the project activities in the adjacent areas (Niokolo-Koba National Park and other open
forests); (ii) a wildlife monitoring system, to evaluate the realization of the intended biodiversity
objectives and benefits, with particular emphasis on the monitoring of endemic and threatened
species; and (iii) a national woodfuels trade flows monitoring system, to evaluate compliance
with established woodfuels transport and market quota regulations (source, volume and
destination). In addition to these activities, the project would include a systematic monitoring
and evaluation of the: (i) promotion and penetration of kerosene and LPG as substitute household
fuels; (ii) dissemination and cooking performance of improved stoves; (iii) participation of civil
society (with emphasis on women) in design, decision making and implementation activities
within the project; (iv) developmental impacts on women; and (v) realization of institutional
development and capacity building objectives. All monitoring and evaluation activities will be
based on an ex-ante assessment, will be carried out through implementation to allow for
necessary design adjustments, and will be followed-up after completion to evaluate the long-term
sustainability of the project's national developmental and global environmental achievements.

VI.   PROJECT IMPACT
A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.1.   The economic analysis of the natural resource management activities in developing
countries has been the subject of much work and controversy. Different methodologies have
been elaborated for individual cases making use of available data (resource stocks, depletion and
regeneration rates, real prices, economic value, etc.) and relative social values (environmental
conservation, resource sustainability, social preferences, etc.).
6.2   In the absence of a clear methodological consensus (Bank or elsewhere), a simplified
economic analysis methodology was developed for the evaluation of the proposed project. The
methodology and evaluation results are presented in detail in Annex 8. The approach adopted is
based on the following basic guidelines:
Project components.  All three components of the project (Preparatory and support
Activities Component; Sustainable Supply Management Component; and Demand
Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options Component) where included in the
economic analysis as they are judged to be necessary and integral elements of the
proposed investment. Within that context, no differential valuation treatment was given
to investments for productive (forest management, improved kilns, improved stoves,
inter-fuel substitution options, etc.) or non-productive sub-components (data generation
and gathering, institutional development, capacity building, social support services,
communication strategy, etc.).
Time horizon and Discount rate. Given the long-term nature of the expected project
impacts, a minimum 20-year horizon was adopted for the evaluation of the project. A
discount rate of 12 percent was applied to all project components and sub-components.
Pject costs. All budgeted costs during project implementation (7 years) were included
in the economic analysis of the project. From years 8 to 20 continued implementation
costs where assessed at approximately 10 percent of year 7, gradually decreasing at a
relative rate of 10 percent per year until year 20.
Project benefits. While the proposed project is expected to result in a large number of
quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits, the economic analysis undertaken limited the
valuation to the following benefits: (i) value of "sustainable" wood production from the
implementation of the sustainable and participatory forest/natural resource management
systems; (ii) value of incremental charcoal production from the promotion of improved
kilns; (iii) value of global environmental impacts (CO2 abatement and biodiversity
conservation) from the implementation of the sustainable and participatory forest/natural
resource management systems; (iv) value of rural income generation and transfer from
the direct sales of fuelwood by the participating rural communities; (v) value of "other"
rural revenues from the development of parallel agro-forestry production activities in the
participating communities; and (vi) value of charcoal saying due to the promotion of
improved charcoal stoves. As the full elaboration and quantification of other project
activities (promotion of inter-fuel substitution options, economic reconversion of
charcoal traders, modernization of the charcoal industry, etc.) will be done during the



48
Preparatory and Support Activities component (Component I) it was judged premature to
make estimates on their respective possible benefits (the full cost of those activities was
however included in the project cost).
6.3    The 20-year horizon evaluation of the project resulted in an Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) of 37.3% and a net present value (NPV) at 12 percent discount rate of US $ 34.2 million.
According to these economic evaluation results, the proposed project would be a fully justifiable
and competitive developmental investment for Senegal.
6.4   Sensitivity analyses were done for five key parameters: (i) level of sustainable forest
yields (0.5 - 2.0 ton/ha/yr); (ii) fuelwood producer prices (US$ 10 - 30/ton); (iii) carbonization
efficiency of improved kilns (18% - 30%); (iv) level of "other" realizable rural income (15% -
40% of expected fuelwood sales); (v) Charcoal market prices (US$ 190 - 360/ton). Table 5.7
presents a summary of the sensitivity analysis of the five key parameter, including the main
value variations considered ("base", low and high) and the respective switching value.

49
B. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
6.6    The project would: (i) sustainably produce some 860,000 tons of fuelwood (equivalent
to 258,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal) over a six year period and would establish a
permanent system capable of producing more than 300,000 tons of fuelwood (equivalent to
90,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal or 27% of total consumption) per year on a
sustainable basis; (ii) reduce woodfuels-related deforestation in the Tambacounda and Kolda
regions by some 20,000 ha/year, and as a consequence reduce net CO2 emissions by 510,000
tons/yr and reduce the loss of biodiversity by the establishment of sustainable forest systems and
of a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park; (iii) generate employment
and economic development opportunities in 250 rural villages in the Tambacounda and Kolda
regions and including women in the management and marketing of woodfuels and other related
income generating activities; (iv) generate during the implementation period more than US $10
million in direct revenues to 250 villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional
revenues to the communities from related natural resource management and exploitation
activities (agro-forestry, livestock keeping, non-fuelwood forest products, etc.);  (v) on a
sustainable annual basis after the end of the project, generate direct revenues in excess of US $3
million to the participating villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional
revenues from related natural resource management and exploitation activities; (vi) reduce CO2
emissions by 420,000 tons/yr. by the distribution of 225,000 improved charcoal stoves; (vii)
increase the availability and access of low income households to more reliable and efficient
charcoal stoves and to modem fuels; and (viii) strengthen the planning, policy making and
implementation supervision capacity of the traditional energy sector institutions, while
increasing the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic institutions, and NGO's
community) in the management and operation of the sector.
6.7    Environmental Aspects (Category C).  The project is expected to: (i) reduce
deforestation and soil degradation through the implementation of sustainable forest management
practices on a large scale; (ii) contribute to reducing the loss of carbon sequestration capacity
and of biodiversity that results from the prevailing non-sustainable exploitation of woodfuels and
from forest fires and, over time, increase carbon sequestration capacity and stabilize biodiversity
through the extension of sustainable natural resource management practices nationwide; (iii)
reduce CO2 emissions through the promotion of better carbonization techniques and the
promotion of more fuel efficient household stoves; (iv) reduce urban charcoal pollution and
contamination (soil and water) and reduce incidence of respiratory diseases (continuous exposure
to charcoal dust) among charcoal handlers and retailers (which are mostly women) through the
modernization of the charcoal marketing standards (sealed bags); and (v) reduce indoor air
pollution and reduce health risks to women through the promotion of improved woodfuel stoves.
6.8   The project is not expected to have negative environmental impacts. The relocation of
production sites to other areas is not likely to happen because:
(i)  there are no other geographic areas in Senegal with forest resources (volume and
density) which can be economically exploited to supply the large woodfuels urban
markets;
(ii)  areas with sufficient forest resources -- and not necessarily more fragile -- in
(Casamance) and outside Senegal (Guinea) are 350 to 500 km further away from



50
the urban markets than what Kolda and Tambacounda. Their exploitation would
imply dramatically increase transportation costs (up to 50%);
(iii) the existing charcoal production control system, albeit cumbersome and
inequitable, has been historically effective in controlling spatial production of
charcoal and there is no basis to believe that it would be any less effective under
the project, particularly given that there is stated government commitment for
project implementation; and
(iv) the willingness of individuals to engage in illegal charcoal production would be
determined by the profitability of doing so. As illegal charcoal production would
happen over and above the officially approved production quota, illegal production
would result on product surpluses. Illegal charcoal would then be transacted at
below official wholesale prices rendering its profit margin much lower than the
legal trade. The larger the surplus, the lower the parallel wholesale price would
be. The probability of this actually happening is near to zero because potential
illegal producers would be discouraged by the prospects of reduced market prices,
increased transportation costs and high probability of being caught and of
receiving stiff fines in the process. In any event, the project includes monitoring
and evaluation systems (forest exploitation and transport flows) designed to
capture any illegal production and/or movement of woodfuels. The monitoring of
woodfuel transport flows in the Senegalese case are far simpler than in other West
African countries (e.g. Mali) because there is only one access route from the
production sites (south- west and south of the country) to the urban markets
capable of handling the 15 and 30 ton trucks a day that are used in the trade.
Illegal charcoal flows from Ziguinchor to Dakar through the Gambia river ferry
would be subject to far easier control mechanism at the ferry docks and the
respective national border check-points;
C. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
6.9    The sustainability of the project would be achieved by the following key design factors:
(i)  the effective transfer of responsibility for the management of the forest resources
from the Government to the rural communities;
(ii) the effective opening-up of the woodfuels trading system;
(iii) a gradual change in woodfuels fiscal and pricing policies and mechanisms -- which
will be designed on the basis of project's field experience and the findings of
several studies and enacted by December 31, 2000 -- to inter alia: promote
sustainable management of forest resources by rural communities; discourage the
exploitation of woodfuels from non-managed forest areas; promote the use of
improved carbonization technologies; maximize direct woodfuel-related revenues
at the producer level; and, optimize the economic efficiency of the sector taking
into account the real economic value of woodfuels (para. 7.1 .iv); and



51
(iv) the strengthening of the long-term capacity of the rural communities to manage
their forest resources sustainably.
6.10   Specific activities and monitoring systems have been included in the project design to
address all these issues.
D. PROJECT RISKS
6.11   While it is expected that in the process of transferring part of the industry's activity to
the rural communities the project will affect a small portion (27%) of charcoal traders and of
expatriate charcoal laborers ("surghas"), that impact cannot be seen in isolation from the
ongoing Africa-wide process towards democratization and local community enpowerment.
Senegal is no different than other countries in the region, and numerous instances of major
structural change are already underway throughout the economy. Nevertheless, recognizing that
the reaction of the traditional traders and "surghas" pose a moderate risk to the project, special
attention was paid to including them in the preparation of the project. Furthermore, two project
activities were specifically designed to support the existing traders to adjust to the new situation
(see "Project Description" section). Also, other activities were designed to monitor and prevent
possible implementation interference (see "Monitoring and Evaluation" section). Also, the
project would be only one of numerous government-lead developmental activities which would
be supported by official regulatory and legal measures.
6.12   Since the project will limit the exploitation of woodfuels in the project area to the
participating rural communities, the possibility that charcoal production by traditional traders
could switch to other areas of the country has been raised. This, however, is not expected to
occur as charcoal production is regulated by government and is now subjected to the new
provisions of local community approval. Should traditional traders attempt to relocate their
activities, the affected local communities would be legally empowered to stop them and --
contrary to the past -- the Government would be obliged to protect the communities' interests.
Should this happen, however, the project includes a forest resource monitoring system which,
operated independently from the Government and with international donor supervision, would be
responsible for reporting non-regulated forest exploitation.
6.13   The risk of an illegal relocation of charcoal production happening and resulting in
increased environmental degradation of more ecologically fragile areas has been raised but
considered negligible after further examination. A detailed Environmental Impact Discussion
Note that was prepared for internal discussion early on in the project preparation phase is
available in the project files.
6.14   Finally, the risk that the rural populations might not be able to achieve full sustainable
management of the forest resources cannot be entirely ruled out. Nevertheless, even in that case,
the project would result in a considerable transfer of welfare to the rural communities with
unquestionable economic development opportunities and social benefits and significant national
and global environmental benefits.

THE NIOKOLO-KOBA NATIONAL PARK
DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY
(Extract from: Monogphie National sur la Diversite Biologique: Chapitre 3: "Les
Modes de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles Au Senegal et leur Evolution"
IUCN-Senega1, (1995)
(Working level translation from original French text)
The Niokolo-Koba National Park is located on the border of the administrative regions
of Tambacounda and Kolda, on the Gambia River, near the Guinnean border on the South-East
of Senegal. It is located inside a slightly undulating region with chains of hills reaching an
altitude of about 200 meters, separated by vast areas of lower situated floodplains that are
covered by water during the rainy season. The Gambia river and its two main tributaries, the
Niokolo-Koba and the Koulountou, pass through the park. The vegetation is constituted of
mainly dry forests, wooded savannas, Sudanian trees and shrubs with principal species such as
Pterocarpus erinaceous, Bombax costatum, Erythrophleum africanum, Sterculia setigera and a
number of Combretum species. According to FAOIUNEP (1981), 78% of the country's "foret
galeries" are located inside this park. About 1,500 plant species have been registered inside this
park. An example of the region's valuable flora can be found in the laterite zones. Here several
species reside at their most western limit of distribution, for example Eragrostis popeguini,
Adelostigma perrottetii, Andropogon felicis, Cyathula pobeguini and several species of
Lepidagathis. Around 80 mammal species, 330 bird species, 36 reptile species, 2 amphibious
species and 60 fish species are found in the Park, along with numerous invertebrates. Carnivores
include the panther Panthere pardus, the lion P. leo and the African wolf Lycaon picturs. The
Park's three main water streams are the habitat for the buffalo Syncerus caffer, the antelope
Hippotragus equinus, the eland of Derby Taurotrogus derbianus (some 1,000), the Colobus
badius temmincki, the three African crocodiles: the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus, C
cataphractus and Osteolaeomus tetraspis, four turtle species and the hippopotamus
Hippopotamus amphibiuA The park is the last refuge in Senegal for the elephant Loxodonta
africana. About 150 chimpanzees Pan troglodytes live in the forest galeries of the park and
vicinity of Mount Assirik (the North-West limit of their distribution). Among the birds, we
find the bustard of Denham Neotis cafra denhami, the Bucorvus abyssinicus, the Dendrocygna
viduata and the eagles Polemaetus bellicouss and Terathopius ecaviatus.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE GEF ACTIVITIES
1.     The monitoring and evaluation of GEF activities included in the project are: (i) the forest
resources exploitation, (ii) the wildlife distribution, (iii) the socio-economic situation of the target
group and (iv) the community-participation and institutional involvement.
2.     The actors involved in these monitoring and evaluation activities will be the Centre de
Suivi Ecologique, the Forest Service, the villagers, some technical assistance and NGO's (yet to be
identified) which are involved in natural resources management. Although the final evaluation of
the impact of this component of the project will be a joint effort of the different actors, not all
monitoring activities will always be undertaken by all actors. The exact role of each actor within the
different activities will be discussed in the field.
3.     Before the project interventions start, actual trends in land use in the districts of Kolda and
Tambacounda will be investigated through satellite remote sensing, statistics and field trips. The
focus will be on the:
- location of villages, roads, water streams, watershed areas, arable land, forest land,
grazing land, fallow land cultivated land and severely degraded land,
- human population densities,
- composition and densities of wildlife and livestock,
- composition and productivity of crops,
- identification of forest types and their condition (maturing state, clear-out, burnt etc.),
- identification of grazing land types and their condition (perennial, overgrazed, burnt
etc.).
4.     Participatory Rural Appraisal's (PRA) will be undertaken to verify the above obtained data
and to gather more specific information on the present situation of:
- delimitation of village territory borders
- land tenure practices and conflicts (e.g. who decides where and when forest land will be
cleared for agricultural expansion),
- village community structures,
- NGO's active in natural resources management,
- collaboration between village-communities, the Forest Service, Centre de Suivi-
Ecologique, and NGO's,
- variety of income resources,
- composing elements of the agro-ecosystems (e.g. is hunting an important source of
income, and so yes for whom?),
- identity of important non-fuelwood products present in the forests.
- identity of various stakeholders (with gender specification) involved in different
components of the agro-ecosystems with special attention for the forest component
(both fuelwood and non-fuelwood products)
- location and practice of subsistence fuelwood collection
- interest of different villages in collaborating with the project.



Annex-2
Page 2 of 4
5.     From these data a "baseline situation on a regional level" (not to be confuse with the "GEF
Baseline Scenario" mentioned before) will be described. This document will (i) represent an
improved comprehension of the interaction of the different components of the agro-ecosystems, (ii)
facilitate the selection of villages that will take part in the project and (iii) enable evaluation of the
projects impact during project implementation and at its completion.
6.     Once the participating villages are selected, a more detailed description of the baseline
situation of these villages will be prepared. That information will be particularly detailed on the
condition of the forest with regard of both flora and fauna species which are highly valued either by
local and/or global standards. (e.g. the tree Pterocarpus erinaceus is of interest for timber, fuelwood
and fodder production but is threatened in the region).
7.     "Monitoring in the field at the regional level" will continue annually throughout the
project cycle and will be concentrated on forest exploitation and wildlife and livestock (distribution
and density).
8.     Concerning forest exploitation, the monitoring will include the location and size of the
deforested areas, the type of forest concerned and the apparent cause for deforestation (agricultural
expansion, charcoal production, forest fire or other). If the cause was "clear-cut for charcoal
production" the logging technique practised will be recorded (species harvested, height of cutting,
etc.). If the cause was forest fires, the damage will be described. Subsequently, the villages where
forest cutting took place - excluding those which are selected within the project and therefore will
have special treatment - will be visited to verify the apparent cause and to inquire whether the
villages were in control and if so why, how and by whom the decision was made.
9.     The forest exploitation monitoring will primarily be undertaken by the "Centre the Suivi
Ecologique - CSE" in collaboration with the Forest Service. The visits to the villages will
strengthen the collaboration between these services and the local communities while creating
environmental awareness. Also the villages will be instructed to contact these services in case they
are confronted with illegal intrusion and/or tree cutting by outsiders.
10.    Regarding wildlife and livestock distribution and density the monitoring will be undertaken
seasonally as to cover the movements of the animals. This activity will most likely be executed by
NGO's (e.g. IUCN) in collaboration with the Centre the Suivi Ecologique and the villagers. This
again will strengthen the collaboration between services, NGO's and villagers while creating
environmental awareness and discouraging illegal hunting.
11.    "Monitoring in the field at the village level" in the selected villages will continue
annually after the implementation of sustainable forest management practices. The monitoring will
again be focused on forest exploitation and distribution and density of wildlife and livestock.
12.    During forest exploitation monitoring, the parameters to be investigated are:
- location, size and condition of severely degraded parcels which are put aside and
receive regeneration treatment
- location and size of deforested area for agricultural expansion
- location and timing of forest fires
- location and timing of forest grazing



Annex 2
Page 3 of 4
- location and amounts of wood harvested for charcoal production
- harvesting techniques practised (clear-cut, or selective logging)
- height of logging, diameter and identity of species harvested
- forest damage caused by other reasons such as natural disasters
13.   Within the village community, the results will be compared with the original sustainable
forest management plan and if necessary the management plan for the next year will be adjusted.
If, based on the results, the new forest management appears to create a need for adjustment in other
areas of the agro-ecosystem, assistance in these areas will be provided by the project (e.g.
intensification of agriculture). This process of regular adjustment of forest management planning
will be a learning process for both the forest agencies and the villagers, while strengthening their
collaboration and making them independent of technical assistance after project implementation.
14.   Regarding the monitoring of wildlife and livestock density and distribution, the number per
species (with distinction of common, endemic or threatened species if it concems wildlife) and the
location and the vegetation type where they were encountered will be recorded seasonally. As in
the regional monitoring, this activity will strengthen collaboration between services, NGO's and
villagers while creating environmental awareness and discouraging illegal hunting.
15.   At the end of the project, the compilation of data from the annual monitoring and
evaluation activities on both regional and selected villages level, will be used to evaluate the impact
of the project on forest resources exploitation, biodiversity conservation, socio-economic situation,
community-participatory and institutional strengthening within the region.
Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options (Non-GEF funded activities)
16.   Within the Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution component the improved
woodfuel stoves sub-component will be subject to periodic monitoring and evaluation.
17.   The monitoring and evaluation will be a joint action between the producers, the retailers,
the users, technical assistance and NGO's (yet to be identified) with particular interest for issues
related to women and either health or environment. The exact organisation of the monitoring and
evaluation will be designed by the actors in the field during the Preparatory and Support Activities
component.
18.   Before the implementation of the improved stoves sub-component, monitoring of potential
users will focus on:
- number of people per household
- number and type of woodfuel stoves used
- daily cooking tasks of these stoves
- daily amount of woodfuels used per household
- how and from where woodfuels are obtained
- woodfuel prices and mode of payment (how, who)
- average lifetime of traditional woodfuel stoves
- price paid for woodfuel stoves and mode of payment ( how, who)
- where is being cooked, indoors or outdoors
- symptoms of respiratory problems within the household related to the smoke of cooking



Annex 2
Page 4 of 4
- complaints about traditional woodfuel stoves
- interest in improved woodfuel stoves
19.    These data will be used for the description of the baseline situation and for the selection of
potential users interested in participating in the monitoring procedures.
20.    When a traditional woodfuel stove is to be replaced by an improved woodfuel stove the
user will be asked to record: (i) the daily woodfuel use since using the improved woodfuel stove,
(ii) whether the situation in regard to respiratory problems has been improved in case there were
such problems prior to the use of improved stoves, (iii) the appreciation of the improved stove in
general and (iv) suggestions for modification of the improved stove if considered important.
21.    The results will be used to (i) verify the combustion efficiency of the improved stoves (ii)
to verify its supposed mitigation power related to respiratory problems and (iii) to consider users
comments in the production of new stoves.

INCREMENTAL COSTS AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS
A.    Broad Development Goals
1.    Senegal's traditional energy sector policy is directed towards meeting the rapidly
growing urban demands of traditional forest-based fuels by the development of community
based sustainable forest management, by the introduction of efficient carbonization of fuelwood,
by the promotion of improved woodfuel stoves -- essentially charcoal -- and by promoting inter-
fuel substitution. This strategy is expected to minimize further environmental degradation and to
foster rural development.
I. Business-as-Usual Scenario
2.    At this point in time, the Tambacounda and Kolda regions (located in the southeastern
part of the country, Figure 1) are the only regions of the country which have sufficient resources
to be able to supply non-local demand (urban) for woodfuels, estimated in 1992 at some 520,000
tons of fuelwood and 330,000 to is of charcoal (equivalent to some 1.8 million tons of fuelwood).
Within these regions some 30,000 ha of forested land is annually clear-cut for the commercial
production of urban woodfuels while no measures are undertaken to allow regeneration. This
non-sustainable deforestation takes place in addition to continuous destruction of forest by
uncontrolled forest fires and relentless agricultural expansion. Due to inefficient carbonization
of  fuelwood  toward charcoal (18%  vs. 30%), the exploitation pressure on forests is
unnecessary high. Presently, the charcoal business is effectively in the hands of some 20 urban
families with little participation in the production activities or the sharing of the profits by the
rural communities. Although specific governmental regulations exists to orient and monitor the
exploitation of the forest resources and the Forestry Service (Ministry of Environment and
Protection of Nature) is responsible for the conservation of the country's forest patrimony, the
Government does not have the financial resources or manpower capacity to control the situation
on the ground let alone to implement government-run sustainable forest resource management in
the country.
3.    In the absence of any form of integrated land-use planning and/or strategies, the forest
areas that are clear-cut are not allowed to regenerate because after the forest is removed the land
is immediately used either for agriculture, grazing or subsistence fuelwood collection. The
situation of Senegal follows the same destructive land-use pattern consistently observed
throughout other developing countries. The continued non-sustainable (clear-cut) commercial
exploitation of forest for the supply of woodfuels and particularly of charcoal, results in a
continuous loss of carbon sequestration capacity (decrease of forest stocks) and hence an
increase in net CO2 emissions.  In addition to the resulting generalized environmental
degradation, the current geographic location and the expected exploitation expansion path poses
a considerable risk to the Niokolo-Koba National Park, which is located in the intersection of
the Tambacounda and Kolda regions, and which has been classified as a national and
international "Biosphere Reserve".

II. Baseline scenario
4.     The Forestry Service would implement a traditional free standing forestry management
project. Very little collaboration would take place with the population residing in the project
area. Sustainable forest management would be mostly undertaken by the Forestry Service.
Ideally, they would partially clear-cut the forest based on the regeneration cycle of the forest
ecosystem and allowing for fallow periods, prevent forest fires and protect the area against other
uses such as agricultural and grazing activities. However, because of the Government's limited
manpower, they would only be able to achieve these goals partially (50%). Only Forestry
Service agents would receive training in sustainable forest management. The project would
cover a non-contiguous and dispersed target area of 300,000 ha within the Tambacounda and
Kolda regions, most likely close to existing roads to facilitate the access. As the rural population
would have a minimal involvement in the implementation of the project and in the sharing of the
resulting economic benefits, the project - being mostly dependent on continuous and direct
governmental management, would only have a limited effect within the specific target area and
for the duration of the project. No improved charcoal production would be introduced because
this has been tried earlier by the Government through the promotion of the "Cassamance kiln"
and did not work due to poor program design and implementation. On the other hand, an
improved stove dissemination program by the private sector and NGO community would be
supported to reduce woodfuels demand. At the end of the implementation of the free-standing
forestry management project -- and in the absence of a follow-up project -- the sustainable
management practices introduced in the target area would not be self-sustainable, the area's



Annex 3
Page 3 of 16
forest stock would be prey to the traditional non-sustainable exploitation and land-use patterns
and, thus, the accrual of global environmental benefits would end. Furthermore, as carbon
sequestration capacity, CO2 emissions and biodiversity are directly related to the state of
conservation of the forest stocks, in the long-term, the Baseline Scenario would equal the
Business-as-Usual Scenario in terms of global environmental benefits.
Global Environmental Objective
5.    The global environmental objective of the proposed GEF financing would be to bring the
net CO2 emission associated to the production of charcoal in the project area to zero, to maintain
and expand the existing carbon sequestration capacity, and to protect and maintain the
biodiversity in the Niokolo-Koba National Park which would be endangered by both the
Business-as-Usual and the Baseline scenarios.
MII. GEF Alternative Scenario
6.    Under the GEF Alternative Scenario, sustainable forest management, by selective
logging, would be implemented by transferring the responsibility for the management and
exploitation of the forest resources to the rural communities, and the project area would be
specifically established to form a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba National
Park (Figure 2). Sustainable forest management plans would be designed together with the
rural populations taking into account the multifunctionality of the existing agro-ecosystems and
thus the socio-economic parameters and interests of the local community. Integrated forest fire
strategies would be developed instead of total forest fire prevention by exclusion. Rural and
community development activities would be undertaken and support for the establishment of
rural micro-enterprises would be provided in order to motivate the local populations to
adequately manage and develop the rural environment. Improved carbonization, reaching 30%
efficiency, would be introduced. All these actions together would reduce losse in carbon
sequestration capacity and in biodiversity and would result in zero net CO2 emission from the
woodfuels-related activities in the project area. Institutional development of and capacity
building at the governmental agencies and community structures would also be included to
support sustainability and proliferation of the project's achievements after the completion of its
implementation. Monitoring activities would be implemented to evaluate the effects and, if
necessary, to adjust management strategies.
Costs
7.    The difference in cost of the project between the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios
is US $4.66 million for the implementation of activities related to community-participatory
activities, integrated natural resources management, improved carbonization and monitoring and
evaluation of global environmental benefits of the project. Table 1 presents a summary of the
cost of project under the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios.

Costs Effectiveness
8.     It is estimated that over the project duration of 7 years the GEF Alternative Scenario
would achieve a total CO2 emission abatement of 1.1 million tons at a unit abatement cost of
US $4.30/ t CO2. Over 15 years, the GEF Alternative scenario would result in a CO2 emission
abatement of 4.5 million tons at a unit abatement cost of US $1.04/t CO2.
Additional Domestic Benefits
9.     In addition to a direct transfer of welfare to the rural communities resulting from the
management and commercial exploitation of woodfuels, it is expected that the rural population
will be able to obtain additional benefits and revenues from other activities such as Agroforestry,
livestock keeping and exploitation of non-fuelwood forest products. While quantification in
monetary terms is not possible, the protection and maintenance of the Niokolo-Koba National
Park would enhance the country's and the project area eco-tourism prospects.

Management Components)
CO2 emission abatement
10.    Under the Business-as-Usual Scenario (clear-cut followed by grazing, crop growing
and/or continuous subsistence wood collection) no forest re-growth would occur. Therefore, the
net emission of CO2 would equal the total amount emitted by the burning of wood harvested
(100% of CO2 emission level). The Baseline Scenario (sustainable forest management achieving
only 50% of sustainability) would result in a net CO2 emission level of 50% during the life of
the project.1 The GEF Alternative Scenario (achieving 100% forest regeneration during and
after project implementation) would result in a zero net CO2 emission level.
11.    The productivity of the savanna woodlands in the area is estimated at 30 m3 of fresh
wood per ha equaling 15 ton of fuelwood.2 Under effectively sustainable forest management, I
ton of fuelwood/ha/year can be harvested.3 This is the harvest intensity simulated under the GEF
Alternative Scenario. For the Business-as-Usual Scenario and the Baseline Scenario an annual
harvest intensity of 1.7 t/ha is simulated in order to arrive at an equal amount of charcoal
production in each of the different scenarios, given a carbonization efficiency of 30% 4 in the
GEF Alternative Scenario and of 18% s in the other scenarios. Thus, the comparison of the
Although it is expected that at the end of the project (year 7) it would gradually revert to the 100%
non-sustainability, a sustainability level of 50% was maintained throughout the 15 year period to
avoid complicating the analysis with additional assumption on the rate of reversal from 50%
sustainability to 100% non-sustainability. Factoring a gradual reversal to non-sustainability would
result in higher benefits for the GEF Alternative Scenario.

scenarios is based on differences in amounts of fuelwood harvested and the corresponding net
CO2 emissions resulting from varying degrees of forest management sustainability. The
amount of carbon sequestered in 1 ton of harvested fuelwood equals 1.7 t of CO2    The
impact of possible natural hazards such as drought, windstorms or diseases was not taken into
account.
12.   The total area managed during the implementation of the project increases as follows:
year 1: none (detailed studies and preparation of management plans)
year 2: 15 000 ha
year 3: 40 000 ha
year 4: 80 000 ha
year 5: 130 000 ha
year 6: 200 000 ha
year 7: 300 000 ha
13.   A comparison was made between these scenarios during the 7 year project - starting
wood harvest in the second year- and over 15 years. The 15 year time period was chosen
because it equals the period after which any fixed area in the region under an exploitation of I t
of fuelwood/ha harvested by clear-cutting without regrowth, would be totally clear-cut.
14.   For the sake of simplicity, this approach ignores the influence of the different scenarios
on the sequestration capacity of the forest ecosystem as a whole by not taking into account the
varying influences of selective logging and clear-cutting on aspects such as forest age, species
composition, underground biomass, soil condition, herbaceous vegetation, fauna and alternative
land use. However, since under both the Business as Usual Scenario and the Baseline Scenario
all forested land will finally be converted in either pasture or agricultural land, the GEF-
alternative Scenario would appear even more favorable on the long term in regard of CO2
emission abatement because the carbon sequestration capacity of forest land is generally much
higher than that of pasture or agricultural land.
15.   In summary, the approach has been very conservative for several reasons since (i) the
sustainable fuelwood harvest intensity of 1 ton per ha in the GEF-Alternative Scenario
represents the lowest limit within a range of 1 to 3 ton per ha., (ii) the Baseline Scenario is
maintained at 50% sustainability throughout the 15 years, while a gradual drop is expected after
the 7 years, (iii) the positive influence of controlled forest fires is not included, (iv) conversion
of forest land to pasture or agricultural has not been included and (v) no multipliers were applied
to account for expected positive influence on forest management in the whole districts of Kolda
and Tambacounda.
16.   Figure 3 presents the cumulative amounts of fuelwood harvested to produce equal
amounts of charcoal under the carbonization efficiencies of the different scenarios over the 15-
year period. The carbonization efficiency under the GEF Alternative Scenario is 30% and under
the Baseline Scenario and the Business as Usual Scenario is 18%.

in the GEF Alternative Scenario.

18. The difference in cost of the supply management sub-components (included within the
project's Components I and II) between the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios is US
$4,660,000. This difference results from the implementation of: (i) technical activities design
to enlarge the project from a simple free standing forestry project to a natural resource
management project and to include monitoring and evaluation systems and mechanism for the

activities designed to increase the participation of the rural community in the strict enforcement
of sustainable forest management and, thus, expected to result in the achievement of the global
environmental benefits. Tables 2 and 3 respectively present a detailed descriptive cost structure
of the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios for the project's Supply Management sub-

C.    Incremental Cost of Demand Management Activities With Global
Environmental Benefit Not Financed by GEF
CO2 emission abatement
1.    The Government of Senegal has long sought to promote the use of improved stoves.
However, it has been unable to make the use of improved stoves either operational or
sustainable. This is so because most stove programs implemented until now were run as Donor-
Government managed activities, which invariably collapse as soon as donor financing and
technical supervision ran out. As a rule, these projects worked on the basis of large consumer
price subsidies, whereby there was little long-term incentive for the private sector to produce
stoves outside direct donor financed pilot programs. When the cost of the expatriate technical
assistance is considered, it is estimated that the cost per disseminated stove elevates well beyond
the US $100 level. On the other hand, during recent policy analysis work (RPTES Program), the
Government reached the conclusion that a new generation of consumer-accepted improved
charcoal stoves (Sakanal, Diambar, etc.) exists and is already being successfully produced and
marketed at full cost by several NGO's in the principal urban centers of the country. Those new
initiatives are severely constrained in volume of operation (10,000 to 20,000 stoves/year) by a
lack of investment and working capital. Thus, lack of access to credit or other financial
instruments is the principal constraint to the successful market-based dissemination of the
promising new generation of improved charcoal stoves by small scale and micro-enterprises
and NGO's. GEF financing of this activity would contribute to the elimination of market
barriers.
2.     Within that context, the Baseline Scenario would be limited to the promotion by
Government of the improved stove concept within its general consumer education activities and
campaigns. No other investment or technical assistance activities would be carried out.
3.    Within an  "Environmentally enhanced" scenario - parallel to the GEF Alternative
scenario -- the project would promote for a period of five years (shorter than the life of the
project) the production and marketing of improved stoves by the private sector (small and micro-
enterprises) and/or NGO's at full factor cost by establishing a rotatory working capital fund (US
$ 300,000) for small and micro-enterprises and NGO's which have market-proven stoves but
lack the necessary resources to invest in the expansion of their production capacities.
Additionally the project would undertake basic monitoring and evaluation of the improved stove
programs and would set up a professional improved stove promotion campaign.
4.    Within the GEF Alternative scenario, a total of 225,000 improved charcoal stoves would
be produced and sold through the market during the first five years of the project. Stove
production and sales would reach the following cumulative schedule:
year 1:  2,700
year 2:  8,300
year 3: 25,000
year 4: 75,000
year 5: 225,000



Annex 3
Page 13 of 16
5.    The CO2 emission abatement of this activity was calculated for the project period of
seven (7) years and for over a 15-year period (following the same standard used for the GEF
funded activities). The underlying assumption for extending that calculation to the 7 and 15
year periods is that once the project manages to "kick-start" the private sector/NGO based
production of improved stoves and the consumers have had a five year cycle of stove usage,
there would be a continuously increasing market demand for stoves, without the need for
continued governmental support. Based on the results of the evaluation of the 5-year program,
the Government will either continue to use the rotatory fund as such or will apply the funds
towards consumer energy education and awareness programs.
6.    The new generation of improved charcoal stoves reduces the consumption of charcoal by
1.6 kg per day per household. Burning 1 kg of charcoal equals the emission of 3.2 kg CO2. In
line with those assumptions, the implementation of the improved charcoal stove activity within
the GEF alternative Scenario would result in a n=t total CO2 emission abatement of 1.5 million
tons over 7 years and of 4.8 million tons over 15 years. Figure 5 presents the cumulative n=
CO2 emission abatement expected to result over a 15-year period from the implementation of
225, 000 improved stoves. It was assumed that a permanent park of 225,000 improved stoves
would remain in use by households through continuous reposition after the project target is met
at the seventh year of implementation. If the improved charcoal stoves result to be less efficient
than what has been estimated (and documented) thus far, the CO2 abatement benefit of this
activity may be slightly lower thar. anticipated.

Cost
7.    The total cost of the proposed 5-year improved stoves activities is US $500,000. This
cost would be divided between: (i) a research and analysis funds to review and evaluate private
sector and NGO investment proposals; (ii) a rotatory investment fund (US $300,000) to support
selected private sector/NGO initiatives; (iii) support to pilot sales and promotion campaigns (US
$100,000); and (iv) monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the improved stoves (US
$50,000).
8.    The difference in cost of the proposed demand management sub-components between
the Baseline and the enhanced scenario (US $500,000) is exclusively attributed to the
implementation of the improved stoves activities. Tables 4 and 5 respectively present a
descriptive cost structure of the Baseline and the Environmentally Enhanced scenarios for the
non-GEF funded demand management sub-components of the project.
Cost effectiveness
9.    The unit abatement cost of the project's Component HI under the Environmentally
Enhanced Scenario is US $0.34/t CO2 after 7 years and US $0.10Jt after 15 years.

PROJECT PARTICIPATION ACTION PLAN
Introduction
1.    For the past three years, the Government of Senegal, with the support of the World
Bank, has been in the process of formulating a traditional energy policy as well as identifying a
project to address its critical problem of rapidly decreasing traditional household fuel sources.
The process of both Policy Formulation and Project Identification has been participatory,
relying upon multi-disciplinary and inter-ministerial teams working on a consensus basis.
Further, a series of consultations with NGOs and the private sector representatives were held to
obtain comments. These significant activities have led to the development of the Senegal's
"Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project" (SPEMP) where participation will
play a vital role in attaining project objectives. To clarify the role of participation as well as the
participatory process and methodology to be utilized in the project, the following Participation
Action Plan (SPEMP- PAP) has been developed.
KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN
* Based on a Consultative and Participatory Process: The foundation for the design of this
plan results from a consultative process of Policy Formulation and Project Identification
involving several key stakeholders. In addition, a series of National and Regional Participatory
Project Preparation Workshops were conducted by the Government of Senegal between
December 1995 and April 1996 to obtain feedback and suggestions from representatives of civil
society on the overall project strategy.
* NGO Oversight: The Government of Senegal will choose an NGO to be responsible for the
implementation and monitoring of the SPEMP-PAP. This "lead" NGO will be responsible for
promoting, monitoring and reporting on all participatory activities during the project
implementation phase.
* Phase of Preparatory and Support Activities: The entire first year of the project will be
dedicated to participatory preparation activities, as well as other support activities. The
participatory preparation activities will allow communities to design their own community
management plans as well as for the project team to obtain additional social, economic,
ecological, and functional information necessary for project implementation.
* Role of Women, Youth and NGOsi: Due to their critical role in resource management and
development, women, youth and NGOs have been identified as key participants and will play a
fundamental role throughout the lifecycle of the project.
* Participatory Methodology Training for Government Officials: General sensitizing of
government decision makers on participatory approaches and their impact on development is
planned as a key component of capacity building and institutional development activities for the
Government of Senegal.
INon-Governmental Organizations here also refers to Community Based Organizations (CBOs)

Background
2.     The SPEMP "Executive Project Summary" notes that "the government and the private
sector lack the financial and human resources that would be necessary to adequately manage the
country's forest resources".  Consequently, to obtain the project's objective (to meet an
important part of the rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels), it is necessary to have
2
the active involvement of the rural populations . For successful implementation of the project,
community involvement must be systematic and representative of all stakeholders. In an effort
to ensure systematic participation (participation that occurs in all stages of the project cycle,
influences design and implementation, and is appropriately institutionalized), the following
SPEMP - PAP has been developed. This plan, formulated in collaboration with the Government
of Senegal, is based on, in addition to other activities, a series of National and Regional
Participatory Project Preparation Workshops conducted by the Government of Senegal.
These workshops, involving over 60 community representatives and NGOs and conducted
between December 1995 and April 1996, gathered critical social, economic, and environmental
data which has improved the overall project strategy and enhanced the knowledge base of the
project team.3
Participants
3.     The recent Participatory Project Preparation Workshops identified women, youth, and
NGOs as key participants in the project. Special attention will be given to these groups,
however, not at the exclusion or marginalization of others. For example, Senegal's new
decentralization regulations identifies rural community councils as the statutory natural resource
managers at the local level. As a result, rural community leaders will also play a critical role in
the project.  Other essential participants will include charcoal producers, the private sector,
pastoralists, herders, bee-keepers, the government, and anyone else identified during the first
year of preparation activities. Contact with representatives of some of these key groups has
already taken place through the Project Preparation Workshops. Table 2 is an initial listing of
some of these contacts which will be built upon during the cycle of the project.
Process
4.    In general, the participatory process to be followed during the project's lifecycle is
expected to be fluid and iterative, continuously adjusting to meet the needs of the project and its
participants. A "lead NGO" will be selected by the Government of Senegal to promote and
monitor this process.
2 "Rural populations" here refers to community populations, NGOs, and CBOs.
The National Participatory Project Preparation Workshops, held in Dakar December 1995 and March
1996, obtained advice and lessons learned from over 40 representatives of NGOs, the private sector,
and CBOs working in the Traditional Energy Sector throughout Senegal. The Regional Participatory
Project Preparation Workshops, held April 1996 in Tambacounda and Kolda, presented the project
proposal to its principal stakeholders - local populations. Comments and suggestions were solicited
regarding the proposed strategy from more than 80 representatives of NGOs, CBOs, community
leaders, the private sector, and local govermnment officials.

Page 4 of 7
Participatory Planning and Preparation Phase (Year 1), Participatory Implementation Phase
(Year 2-7), and Evaluation Phase. The following provides greater details on the anticipated
participatory activities during these phases.
Participatory Planning and Preparation Phase: Year 1
6.    The first year of the project will serve as a foundation for the six years to follow. During
this critical year, a Project Implementation Plan will be defined in conjunction with the principal
participants, notably women, youth, rural populations, NGOs, CBOs, charcoal producers, the
private sector and the government. The following participatory activities, monitored by the lead
NGO, will result in the development of the Project Implementation Plan:
* Regional NGO Assessments: Studies will be conducted of NGOs working in the two
targeted regions, Tambacounda and Kolda, by an independent consultant or agency.
The results of these studies will illustrate the capacity of NGOs working in the
regions to participate in and promote and support participatory project
implementation.
: Organization of and Initial Implementation of Participatory Rural Appraisals:
Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRAs), conducted by NGOs or individual consultants,
will serve as the backbone for the Project Implementation Plan. The PRAs, in
addition to collecting necessary social and economic data, will allow communities to
prepare their own community management plans based on indigenous knowledge,
culture, and the existing resource base. At the end of the first year, this information
will be synthesized with technical findings obtained by the Government to formulate
technically, socially and economically sound community management plans.
Together, the Government of Senegal and the lead NGO will then consolidate these
community management plans into a detailed implementation plan for annual
participatory forestry management modules as well as for inter-fuel substitution
activities.
7.    Information collected from the PRAs will highlight themes and subjects which could be
useful in future PRAs or in other studies being conducted by the project. This information will
also be incorporated into the design of the following programs:
*  capacity building programsforfield agents and institutions;
* a monitoring and evaluation system; and
* a comprehensive communication strategy.
8.    During the first year, PRA facilitators will be selected. In addition, zones of intervention
for initial exploratory PRAs will be identified based on ecological, socio-demographic, socio-
professional, and administrative criteria. By the end of the first year initial exploratory PRAs
will have been conducted in each "arrondissement", covering approximately 15 communities.
This number will expand over the seven years, as illustrated in a later section of this plan, with
the increasing number of community managed hectares.
9.    Some of the participatory tools to be used in the appraisals may include semi-structured
interviewing, focus group discussions, preference ranking, mapping and modeling, and seasonal
and historical diagramming. These tools will reveal along with other information the following:

- soil and land conditions
- land tenure practices and issues
- ecological, environmental and agricultural history, culture, and practices
- village community structures
- roles of community members (i.e. gender roles)
- livelihood analysis and variety of income resources
- wealth ranking
- important institutions and individuals in the community
- NGOs and CBOs active in the community
- NGOs and CBOs active in the community in the domain of natural resource
management
- important non-fuelwood products present in the forest
- location and practice of subsistence fuelwood collection
- community interest in natural resource management
- community interest in the project
- Community "Restitution" Workshops: Once the results of the PRAs have been
analyzed, "restitution" workshops to present and validate the findings will be held
with communities which participated in PRA.
* Regional Implementation Plan Workshops: At the end of the first year, Regional
Workshops will be held to brief community representatives and local administrative
officials on the Project Implementation Plan.
Participatory Inplementation Phase: Years 2-7
10.   As noted above, the six years of project implementation will see a gradual increase in
community participation as the number of community managed forests increases. Support
structures for participation will be established as well as the implementation of training and
capacity building programs.
11.   Participation: PRAs will continue to be the building block in designing community
management plans as well as evaluating existing activities and systems. The number of PRAs to
be conducted for planning purposes over the six year period is based on the number of
communities to be enrolled on a yearly basis. Table 3 is an estimation of yearly increase in
"planning PRAs" which will total 250 by the seventh year:4
4 ThiS table may change based on the demand by communities or other changes to the project design.

TOTAL       250
Additionally, "evaluative PRAs" will be conducted annually in selected communities.
12.   Issues raised in the first year of PRAs needing a more detailed assessment will serve as
the basis for a Socio -Economic Assessment to be conducted during the second year of the
project. This study will provide a more in-depth analysis of the targeted issues. Findings will be
incorporated where appropriate into the project and PRA design to reinforce activities.
13.   At the mid-point of the project, a Beneficiary Assessment will occur to assess views on
the project's implementation process and services being provided. This assessment will involve
various beneficiaries in urban and rural areas as well as service providers such as charcoal
producers, transporters, and the government to assess the initial impact of the project. This
information will feed into an overall mid-term evaluation report.
14.   Support Structures: To support the participatory process and ensure its representativity,
several structures will be established early on in the implementation phase. Some of these
structures will include:
* establishing or reinforcing communication mechanisms and collaboration systems in
the zones of intervention,
* establishing consultative groups which will foster dialogue between village
participants and the project team,
* establishing alternative mechanisms for conflict resolution and management among
stakeholders, and
* establishing a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating participation by local
populations
15.   Training and Capacity Building: Continuous training and capacity building of local
organizations and individuals will occur to further ensure sustainability. These activities will
take place in technical domains as well as in the areas of financial management, strategic
planning, monitoring and reporting, and participatory planning and management. In addition,
particular attention will be given to the training and sensitizing of government officials in
participatory approaches and their impact on development.

Evaluation Phase: Year 7
16.    At the end of the project, a final independent evaluation will be conducted to assess the
impact of the project, its sustainability, and its participatory approach. Participating and non-
participating communities will be targeted in rural as well as urban zones. Within these zones,
representatives of all stakeholders (e.g. women, youth, NGOs, local elected officials, pastoralists,
herders, bee-keepers, charcoal producers, the private sector, the Government, and donors) will be
surveyed for their views on the process and impact of the project. The evaluation team will be
multi-disciplinary and its members independent, having had no previous involvement with the
project.   The team  will be comprised of an NGO  and Participation  Specialist, an
Environmentalist, an Energy Specialist, a Sociologist or Anthropologist with a focus on gender
issues, an Institutional Development Specialist, and Economist. With this diverse group it is
anticipated to obtain a broad as well as in-depth view of the project's results and impact. Upon
its completion, a french version of the evaluation report will distributed to all the project's
partners and made available at the Resident Mission.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General Context
1.     The economic evaluation of natural resource management activities and investments in
developing countries has been the subject of continued discussion during the last three decades.
The lack of consensus among economists on the subject stems primarily from the difficulties in
arriving at a proper valuation of the natural resources in question, delimiting the frontiers of the
systems and activities under analysis, and defining the objective function of the problem under
analysis.
2.      Unlike most post-industrialized countries, where there a well established market systems
and regulatory, public consultation and arbitrage mechanisms, developing economies are
generally characterized by imperfect markets (information, access, etc.), regulated pricing
schemes, and inter alia lack of public participation and consultation in natural resource
allocation decisions.1 The specific case of the forest resources in Senegal is a good example of
that situation. As a direct legacy of the colonial period all land and forest resources "belong" to
the national government. The government through less than transparent mechanisms has
historically assigned the rights to commercial forest exploitation to a limited number of
individual in detriment of the vast rural populations, which have until recently lost their
surrounding forest resources and related habitats without receiving any compensation for it nor
being able to participate in the decision process. Forest lands have been systematically denuded
for different purposes, such as, for the expansion of the agriculture frontier, the extraction of
precious woods, construction materials, woodfuels and medicines. Operating under the
assumption that those resources had no inherent economic value other than as processed inputs
or products and that belonging to the state there was no need to compensate rural populations for
their loss, forest resources have historically been valued at their direct cost of extraction,
processing and handling. Under that scenario, the ecological value of the standing forest stocks,
their social value and the value of their multiple economic linkages have been systematically
disregarded. Government agencies and individuals have operated under that scenario driven by
narrow political and financial interests, and have been able to do so for a long time because of
the lack of political representativity of the rural populations. Economic analysts, on their part,
constrained by lack of adequate information and quantifiable parameters, being pegged down to
1
A good illustration of the practical differences in economic valuation between post-industrialized and developing
countries is the comparison between the long standing discussion in the United States and Canada concerning the
logging industry and its implications on the habitat of the endangered Spotted Owl and the forest logging
industry in West African countries and their impact on the "endangered" rural communities. In the case of the
Spotted Owl, the direct financial interests of the logging industry (included owners, labors, related business,
etc.) have been successfully challenged over the years by the environmental and bio-diversity conservation
interests of a much wider social constituency across the two countries. In the case of Senegal, large scale clear-
cutting of forests by a handful of urban-based individuals (for the expansion of export agriculture, for
construction materials, extraction of precious woods and woodfuels, etc.) has taken place since the colonial
period with zero or near to zero consultation and or compensation to the affected rural indigenous populations.

classical evaluation techniques, and/or by being forced to define the frontiers and objective
functions of the problems under analysis in a very narrow sectorial basis, have frequently been
unable to contribute to the proper valuation of the resources.
3.     If an "economic" analysis of a forest resource investment has to be undertaken, it stands
to reason that the analysis must attempt to capture the society's value and not that of a small
interest group. In an economy where the market functions in a relatively open manner and where
all segments of society have representative participation in the process of making economic
decisions (through the price mechanism or through other regulatory and/or consultative
mechanisms) there would be little room to question classical welfare economics assumptions.
On the other hand, in an economy plagued with market failures and where the actual distribution
of welfare is extremely skewed, it is extremely difficult to agreed that the economic value of
standing forest stocks would be zero or anywhere near to it, as it has been frequently proposed.
When examples of such zero valuation are examined in more detail, however, one readily
realizes that more often that not that valuation was the result of the way in which the frontier and
objective function of the analysis where defined.
4.     If an economic analysis focuses strictly on the supply of woodfuels to urban markets and
either assumes that the forest resources are "stock resources"2 or that the prevailing woodfuels
price structures already account for resource conservation through "stumpage fees" or other
mechanism, then it would be possible to conclude that the financial costs of generating the
intended supply of woodfuels (extraction, transportation and marketing) are the central
parameters to account and that the real social value of the forest (not just to a few individuals) is
already included as a production cost. Under that approach, an analysis could further focus on
the cost of supplying a given volume of final useful energy (measured in terms of tons of oil
equivalent or other calorific unit) and, on that basis, compare the economics of woodfuels
supplies with other potential altemative energy sources.  Such an analysis would not be
appropriate for evaluating the proposed "Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management
Project" in Senegal because of the following principal reasons:
(i)  the supply of woodfuels to urban markets is the desired energy outcome of the
project, but doing so in an environmentally sustainable and socially equitable
manner is an equally important objective;
(ii)  there is undisputed evidence that the prevailing forest resource exploitation
schemes in Senegal are both ecologically and socially detrimental and non-
sustainable;
(iii) there is equally undisputed evidence that, at the scale at which forest resource are
being exploited in Senegal for obtaining woodfuels (mainly charcoal), the
resulting ecosystems degradation greatly affects other economic sectors like
2   Natural "stock resources" are defned as resources which are finite within a human realizable
timeframe. Fossil fuels are considered "stock resources" because although they have a natural
generation process their natural production function runs in the millions of years and hence any unit
consumed in the present would be irreversibly discounted from the existing stock. The economic
implication of that is that their valuation would only need to account for the societal preference of
consumption in time period ta vis-&-vis time period to+,,.

agriculture, and that as rural ecosystems degrade rural poverty increases, there is a
loss of rural employment, and among many other impacts, an acceleration of rural
exodus (with the consequent exacerbation of urban social and economic conflicts
and costs);
(iv) given the current a foreseeable level of woodfuel consumption, the economy can
not possibly sustain large scale inter-fuel substitution programs based on
expensive imported fuels;
(v)  under the present system of exploitation resource costs and prices do not account
for resource regeneration nor for compensation to the rural populations. Defined in
that way, the proposed project can not possibly be evaluated either in its own
merits or compared to the alternative supply of energy from a narrow direct factor
cost perspective. Furthermore, if the now well accepted postulate that urban
development holds the key to future aggregate economic growth in the African
countries (and elsewhere) is factored into the analysis, establishing sustainable
rural woodfuel supply systems for the urban energy markets would provide a
stable and mutually beneficial rural-urban interaction market mechanism; and
(vi)  forest resources in Senegal are "flow resources with a critical zone'"3 and are
already being used above their natural inflow rate resulting in an implicit loss a
continued stream of quantifiable benefits (good and services) through time.
The Project Rationale
5.     The supply of woodfuels to the urban and peri-urban energy market in Senegal is based
on geographically concentrated and non-sustainable forest resource management practices (clear
cutting). Given the relatively low efficiency of wood-to-charcoal conversion (18%) due to
inefficient carbonization, total charcoal consumption is equivalent to 1.2 times the total
consumption of fuelwood. Charcoal is currently produced in the Kolda and Tambacounda
regions, some 400 km away from the principal urban (Dakar and Thies) and peri-urban markets.
6.     Until recently forestry legislation gave the Forest Service the exclusive prerogative to
assign commercial exploitation rights over forest resources nationwide. These rights were
historically given only to urban-based traders resulting in the creation of a vertically integrated
and oligopolistic industry with widespread corruption problems. Among other issues, original
annual charcoal exploitation quotas were frequently surpassed with the Forestry Service lacking
the manpower or monitoring mechanisms to adequately supervise and enforce them. It is
3   Natural "flow resources with a critical zone" are defined as natural resources which have a natural
regeneration function within a realizable human timeframe, but if their use rate is grater that their
natural regeneration rate (inflow rate) their become finite (stock resources) for practical purposes.
The economic implication of that is that when used within the critical zone (net depletion) their
valuation must include the forgone value of the lost regeneration and the resulting non-availability for
continued use through time. Compared to stock resources -- say woodfuels vis-a-vis LPG -- either the
valuation of the woodfuel (flow resources) has to be higher or the discount rate that it is applied to
them needs to be lower in order to reflect the loss of the continued stream of benefits through time.

estimated that out of the some 1800 legally registered "Exploitant Forestiers" only some 2Q
traders actually work and control the urban charcoal trade. The remainder registered traders buy
charcoal production licenses ("quota charbon") and resell them afterwards to the traders that
actually produce charcoal. As even the temporary expatriate laborers (Guinnean Fulbes,
"sourghas") employed in the cutting of the wood and the production of the charcoal are brought
in to the rural areas by the urban traders, it is estimated that much less than 5% of the annual
turnover of the charcoal trade (US $ 60 million) remains in the rural areas. The transport of the
charcoal, which represents close to 20% of the final cost structure of the charcoal, is provided by
independent trucking companies on a cash payment basis. Over the years, the operation of the
charcoal industry has resulted in: (i) the gradual loss of forest cover (approx. 30,000 ha/year) and
thus of the ecosystem's carbon sequestration capacity and biodiversity; (ii) the degradation
of the rural environment (particularly of the soils); (iii) the impoverishment of the rural areas;
(iv) an acceleration of the rural exodus; and (v) a massive transfer of wealth from the rural areas
to the urban areas. In addition to these negative impacts, it is anticipated that the Niokolo-Koba
National Park ("International Biosphere Reserve Patrimony", 9,130 kmi2), which is located in
the south-eastern corner of the Tambacounda and Kolda regions and which is a declared
national and international biodiversity patrimony and "Biosphere Reserve", will come under
threat of encroachment within the next decade, with irreparable biodiversity and ecological
consequences at the national and global levels.
7.     The organization of the urban and peri-urban fuelwood trade (520,000 tons/year)
resembles that of the charcoal trade but poses considerable smaller environmental and social
conflicts. The consumption of fuelwood in the rural areas (1.5 million tons/year) is largely
satisfied through sustainable subsistence practices (cutting of branches, selective felling of small
trees and collection of dead branches). Women and children play a significant role in the
collection of fuelwood. Rural consumption of charcoal is mostly limited to the areas where it is
produced and is normally traded by the producers for food and lodging at the local communities.
8.    Prect Objectives.   The objective of the project is to meet an important part of the
rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the
ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. This objective would be met
through: (i) the implementation and monitoring of 300,000 hectares of environmentally
sustainable community-managed forest resource systems in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions
of Senegal, creating a protection zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park (Biosphere
Reserve); (ii) the promotion of private sector inter-fuel substitution and private sector and NGO-
based improved stoves initiatives; and (iii) the strengthening of the institutions involved in the
management of the sector, and the promotion of the participation of the civil society (private
sector, academic institutions, and NGOs community) in the operation of the sector.
9.     Project Description.   The project consists of three components: Preparatory and
Support Activities, Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management and Demand Management
and Inter-fuel Substitution Options.  The project design includes a series of activities to
ensure an effective participation of the rural population ("measures incitatives") and thus
guarantee the full achievement of the environmental sustainability objective of the project. The
project also includes specific monitoring and evaluation activities (forest exploitation and
wildlife) designed to evaluate the achievement of its global environmental objectives
(maintenance of carbon sequestration capacity, CO2 emission abatement and biodiversity
conservation

10.   Project Benefits. The project is expected to: (i) sustainably produce some 860,000 tons
of fuelwood (equivalent to 258,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal) over a six year period
and would establish a permanent system capable of producing more than 300,000 tons of
fuelwood (equivalent to 90,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal or 27 percent of total
consumption) per year on a sustainable basis; (ii) reduce woodfuels-related deforestation in the
Tambacounda and Kolda regions by some 16,000 to 20,000 ha/year, and as a consequence
reduce net CO2 emissions by about 510,000 tons/yr and reduce the loss of biodiversity by the
establishment of sustainable forest systems and of a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-
Koba National Park; (iii) generate employment and economic development opportunities in
250 rural villages in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions and including women in the
management and marketing of woodfuels and other related income generating activities; (iv)
generate during the implementation period more than US $10 million in direct revenues to 250
villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional revenues to the communities from
related natural resource management and exploitation activities (agro-forestry, livestock keeping,
non-fuelwood forest products, etc.); (v) on a sustainable annual basis after the end of the project,
generate direct revenues in excess of US $3 million to the participating villages from the trade
of woodfuels, and generate additional revenues from related natural resource management and
exploitation activities; (vi) reduce CO2 emissions by 420,000 tons/yr. by the distribution of
225,000 improved charcoal stoves in urban areas; (vii) increase the availability and access of low
income households to more reliable and efficient charcoal stoves and to modem fuels; and (viii)
strengthen the planning, policy making and implementation supervision capacity of the
traditional energy sector institutions, while increasing the participation of the civil society
(private sector, academic institutions, and NGO's community) in the management and operation
of the sector.
Other Project Options
11.   With assistance of the Bank's Africa Regional Program "Review of Policies in the
Traditional Energy Sector - RPTES", a national inter-ministerial team conducted a 2-year
comprehensive review of the traditional energy sector in Senegal (fuelwood and charcoal),
including the evaluation of the principal inter-fuel substitution issues and options (kerosene and
LPG). Within that review, the regulatory, legal, pricing and fiscal frameworks of the sector and
the evolution of its structure and functioning were studied in detail. The RPTES review
concluded that given the country's present and foreseeable macroeconomic and socio-economic
conditions, Senegal will continue to depend on forest-based traditional fuels to meet the lion's
share of the country's urban and rural energy needs well into the next century. While ongoing
demand management (improved stoves programs and consumer education campaigns) and inter-
fuel substitution (LPG and kerosene) efforts need to be continued and improved to incorporate
the lessons learned to date, large increases of petroleum products imports cannot be sustained
because of budgetary constraints and because current low household income levels severely limit
the potential for widespread inter-fuel substitution at non-subsidized market prices. Within that
context, and until economic growth allows for such substitution to take place, the principal
challenge of the energy sector in Senegal will be to transform the existing non-sustainable
commercial woodfuels supply system into one capable of supplying woodfuels -- particularly
charcoal -- to the rapidly growing urban population in an sustainable manner.



Annex 8
Page 6 of 36
12.   Previous Government run efforts at demand management (improved stoves programs
and consumer education campaigns) and inter-fuel substitution (LPG and kerosene) have had
mixed results. Without a significant shift in policy to promote an active involvement of the
private sector in the expansion of interfuel substitution and demand management efforts at the
massive level required would be neither fiscally sustainable nor sufficient. At close to US $ 750
per ha4 forest plantation schemes have proven to be economically unfeasible though-out West
Africa. The possibility to open additional forest areas for commercial exploitation of woodfuels
has been evaluated and determined unfeasible due to the fragility of the forest stocks and the
economic cost of extraction. The proposed project will therefore concentrate on introducing
sustainable forest/natural resource management systems in the Kolda and Tambacounda
regions for the supply of charcoal and will support a shift towards private sector-based
promotion of improved charcoal stoves and least-cost interfuel substitution options.
13.    Within that context, there is clear agreement between the borrower and the project
participating donors that there are no other economically or technically feasible project
alternatives capable of delivering the intended outputs, benefits and developmental impacts that
the proposed is expected to deliver.
The Evaluation Methodology
14.   Within the general and country-specific framework defined above, a deliberate effort
was made to elaborate a simplified economic evaluation methodology yet capable of including
the inter-temporal social valuation of the forest resources, the distributional effects of their
exploitation, and the value of the benefits saved thought the introduction of sustainable resource
management practices and improved end-use energy technology and the principal measurable
global environmental benefits.
15.   Methodological disclaimer. As the only feasible alternative to the project is to do
nothing, i.e., to continue to exploit forest resources in an environmentally unsustainable and
socially inequitable manner in the exact same areas where the project would be implemented
(Tambacounda and Kolda regions), considerations of transportation or other marketing costs
were purposely excluded from the analysis. Fiscal impacts were also excluded from the analysis
because they are estimated to be negligible, if not further supportive of the proposed project.
Under the current woodfuels taxation system, actual collection of "stumpage fees" is less than
40%. The proposed project includes the strengthening of the control of woodfuel flows and is
thus expected to increase the actual tax collection rates. On the other hand, the project will also
introduce a differential taxation (50 percent reduction) favoring the proposed community-based
sustainable forest management systems. Hence, it estimated that the project will be either neutral
or will have only a modest positive impact on fiscal revenues. The option of maintaining flat
taxation rates to increase fiscal revenues was ruled out from the start as: (i) differential taxation
Data from plantation projects through-out Africa indicate a total cost range of US $ 450 to US $750
per hectare, where the higher end corresponds to projects within Sahelian edafoclimatic conditions
and the lower end to projects in East and Southern Africa.

is required to provide a price protection from non-managed woodfuel exploitation5; and (ii)
government collected "stumpage fees" are justified under the assumption that the tax collected
will be reinvested in the regeneration of the forest stocks. Since this is n=t the case in Senegal,
and through the implementation of the project the rural communities will be responsible for
assuring the sustainability of the resource, there is no rational economic justification to maintain
the same level of taxation for community managed and non-managed areas.
Project Components
16.    All three components of the project (Preparatory and support Activities Component;
Sustainable Supply Management Component; and Demand Management and Inter-fuel
Substitution Options Component) where included in the economic analysis as they are judged to
be necessary and integral elements of the proposed investment. No differential valuation
treatment was given to investments for productive (forest management, improved kilns,
improved stoves, inter-fuel substitution options, etc.) or non-productive sub-components (data
generation and gathering, institutional development, capacity building, social support services,
communication strategy, etc.).6
Evaluation Horizon and Project costs
17.    Because of the long-term  nature of the proposed project objectives and expected
impacts, a project evaluation horizon of 20 years was adopted. All budgeted costs during project
implementation (7 years) where included in the economic analysis of the project. From years 8
to 20 realistic continued implementation costs where assumed at approximately 10 percent of
year 7 costs, gradually decreasing at a relative rate of 10 percent per year until year 20. That
continued but phasing-out cost structure between years 8 and 20 was discussed and agreed upon
with the borrower. Table 1 presents the budgeted project costs by component and main sub-
components per year for the 20-year project evaluation horizon. Figure 1 presents the profile of
project costs by component.
18.    The implication of that cost structure is that the borrower recognizes that the subsequent
cost of maintaining the system that will be put in place will be much smaller than that of its
original introduction. The importance of that is that once the large up-front costs of institutional
development and capacity building (both of governmental and civil society) are met, subsequent
This has been widely agreed upon and implemented in several forestry/natural resource/energy
related Bank projects such as "Niger Energie II" and " Mali Energie Domestique".
6   Although it is normal practice to exclude non-productive components from economic analyses -- as it
is difficult to calculate specific economic returns on things such as institutional development,
capacity building, etc. -- in the case of the proposed project it was judged that those investments
could not be dissociated from the expected project outcomes. If such investments are made and the
project does not achieve its proposed objectives, they would amounted to an unequivocal
misallocation of scarce investment resources. In practical terrns, the impact of including all project
cost represent an added burden of proof for the overall merits of the project.

investment (follow-up projects) to further expand the total area under community management
should be much lower on a unit basis (per hectare cost) than what they are for this first project.
The unit cost of the proposed project is of the order of US $66.6 per hectare (including all project
costs).7 Subsequent investments should not amount to more than US $30 per hectare at current
price equivalence.
Project Benefits and Valuation
19.    While the proposed project is expected to result in a large number of quantifiable and
non-quantifiable impacts the methodology adopted conservatively limited the valuation to the
following expected project benefits:
(i) "sustainable" wood production: the benefit of the "sustainable" wood production
expected to result from the implementation of the sustainable and participatory
forest/natural resource management systems was defined as the net reduction in
deforestation (loss of forest standing stocks) in a comparison between an area under
sustainable management and an equivalent area under non-sustainable exploitation. A
concept of area equivalence was introduced to avoid an overvaluation of benefits as the
amount of wood output that would be extracted from a sustainably managed area (1
ton/ha) is not the same as from an area that is clear-cut (15 ton/ha). The equivalence was
thus calculated on the basis of the total expected wood output of the area that will be
placed under sustainable management at every year of the project and that wood volume
was converted to hectare under clear-cut rates. As the areas under management increase
from year 2 to 7 the equivalent non-sustainable areas were increased. For the areas
under non-sustainable management a realistic 20 percent natural regeneration rate was
assumed. The calculation of the net deforestation impact was computed as being the total
deforestation minus the natural regeneration in a area non-sustainably exploited
equivalent in wood output to the total area under sustainable management within the
project. The effect of that model was that as the total area under management within the
project scenario stabilized at 300,000 ha (sustainably producing an output of 300,000
tons of wood per year) an net deforestation of 16,000 hectares per year was accrued to
the non-project scenario. That 16,000 ha was the result of a total of 20,000 ha deforested
minus a 4,000 ha natural regrowth allowance. Over the 20-year project cycle the non-
project scenario resulted in a net total deforestation of 248,800 ha. By making that
area./output equivalence it meant that during the period of analysis both scenarios
(managed and non-sustainable) resulted in the same amount of wood production but the
whereas 248,800 ha of forest were lost in the non-sustainable scenario, the sustainably
managed scenario have conserved intact the original 300,000 hectares of forests.
Table 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 presents the detailed calculation of the benefit of the
''sustainable" wood production including parametric variations ranging from sustainable
7   If only the costs of the supply side management sub-components are taken into account cost of the
implementation of community-based sustainable forest management systems would be of the order of
US $ 53/hectare. If only the direct field investment costs are taken into account the cost per hectare
would come down to US $ 35/hectare.

Annex 8

forest yields of 1.00 tons/ha to 2.00 tons/ha and producer price ranging from US
$15/ton to US $40/ton.
Since at the end of the 20-year horizon the total area under management still had a full
stock of 15 tons/ha (300,000 ha @ 15 ton/ha = 4.5 million tons of wood) which could be
maintained for continued sustainable exploitation or could be clear cut (or otherwise).
The benefit of the sustainable wood production was then valued at the current producer
price of wood of US $15/ton (base scenario). The producer price as opposed to the
current market price of wood was used because the final market price incorporates the
value added of transportation and marketing.
It is extremely important to note that the main driving parameter of the calculation of the
sustainable wood benefits -- and thereto of most other project benefits -- is expected
sustainable forest yield. Based on the most recent studies 8 it is expected that the
average sustainable forest yield in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions of Senegal will
be between I and 2.5 tons per hectare with a high provability of it being closer to 2.00
tons hectare than to the lower limit. In order to avoid any risk of overestimation of
project benefits all base calculation of the evaluation models were done using the lower
limit (1.00 ton/ha) as the valid parameter. The implication of this is that if the
sustainable yields prove to be higher, all project benefits which are directly related to or
pegged to the sustainable wood output will be automatically increased. If the actual
sustainable yield is confirm on the field at 2.00 tons/hectare, nearly all project benefits
will double ( see Tables 2.1, 2.2. and 2.3).
(ii) incremental charcoal production: the benefit of the incremental charcoal
production expected to result from the promotion of improved kilns was defined as the
additional charcoal that is expected to result from the a given amount of wood if that was
produced with the existing traditional carbonization technology (18%). The improved
charcoal kilns that have already been developed and tested in Senegal -- but which were
unsuccessfully disseminated in the past for accounted reasons -- is estimated to have a
carbonization efficiency of 30 percent. In order to avoid overvaluation of the expected
benefits the base calculations were made utilizing a 25 percent efficiency rate. The
economic value of the incremental production was calculated at the current market price
of charcoal of US $190/ton. It is expected that charcoal prices will rice through time,
thus resulting in higher a higher level of economic benefits for the same level of
incremental charcoal production. In order to avoid any risk of overvaluation of the
expected benefits, the base calculations were done at the current market price of charcoal
and the effect of higher charcoal prices were assessed during the subsequent sensitivity
analysis.
Table 3 presents the detailed calculation of the benefit of incremental charcoal
production for sustainable forest yields of 1.00 tons/ha to 2.00 tons/ha and charcoal
market prices ranging from US $190/ton to US $285/ton.

(iii) global environmental impacts: the benefit of the global environmental impacts
expected to result from the implementation of the sustainable and participatory
forest/natural resource management systems was defined as the expected net abatement
of C02 (in tons) and the conservation of bio-diversity in and around the project areas
(particularly in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and "international biosphere reserve)
and was valued at the US $ 1.01/ton per ton of net CO2 abated. The rational for that
was the value estimated for the CO2 abatement utilizing the GEF global environmental
benefits methodology and it corresponds to the grant funding provided by GEF for the
proposed project. That price is estimated to reflect the global social value of CO2
abatement. No specific valuation was given to the bio-diversity benefits but their value
is assumed to be included in the CO2 calculations. Table 4 presents the detailed
calculation of the global environmental benefits.
(iv) rural income generation and transfer: the benefit of rural income generation and
transfer expected to result from the direct sales of fuelwood by the participating rural
communities was valued at US $15/ton, which is the current estimated "road side"
laborer price of woodfuel in Senegal. While that current price does not include any
valuation for the resource, the economic value of the wood was already accounted for
within model by the "sustainable wood production" benefit (item i above). Also, while it
is expected that when the rural communities take over the "production" of the wood the
new producer prices will be higher, the current price was purposely maintained as the
base figure to avoid any possible over estimation of the expected benefits. Several
higher producer price scenarios were evaluated under the sensitivity analysis. Although
it is frequently done in projects of social interest, no additional income transfer
multiplier was added to the baseline calculations. Bank projects that compute income
transfers benefits to poor income groups estimate that multiplier value at between 30 to
50 percent.
Furthermore, it is important to note that as the community managed systems
mature it is expected that the communities will be able to engage in the direct production
of charcoal as opposed to limiting their activity to the cutting of the wood, whereby the
potential producer price to be applied would be that of the charcoal and not that of the
wood. The current producer price of charcoal is of approximately US $45/ton. At that
point, rural revenues will increase considerably.
Table 5 presents the detailed calculation of the rural income generation and transfer
benefits for sustainable forest yields of 1.00 tons/ha to 2.00 tons/ha, producer prices
ranging from US $15/ton to US $40/ton.
(v) "other" rural revenues: the benefit of "other" rural revenues expected to result
from the development of parallel agro-forestry production activities in the participating
communities was valued as a linear function of the total revenues expected to result from
the total sales of woodfuels by the rural communities. The rational for that was that as
the rural communities perceive an income from the sale of woodfuels they will have
income to invest in other productive activities. The project includes support mechanisms
and resources to assist communities which are prepare to invest their own resources in
other economic activities. As revenues from woodfuels increase through time (or under

the different parametric scenarios tested) the availability of community investment funds
for other activities will also increase resulting in increased revenues from those
activities. The relation between woodfuel revenues and "other" revenues where left
constant at 20 percent for the base scenario of the evaluation exercise but different
scenarios where tested.
The detailed calculation of the benefit from "other" expected rural revenues is included
in Table 5 (see item iv above).
(vi) charcoal saving: the benefit of charcoal saving expected to result from the
promotion of 225,000 improved charcoal stoves in the principal urban areas was defined
as the net saving expected to result from the use of improved charcoal stoves and was
calculated on the basis of the improved stoves produced by the project and expected to
be in actual use at each year during the project. The incremental energy efficiency
differential between the traditional and the improve stoves was estimated at 40 percent.
Based on the use of improved charcoal stove a family that today consumes 5 kilograms
of charcoal per day would need to consume only 3 kilograms. for the same final useful
energy service. That calculation took into account the annual rate of stove production
and a 3-year stove life cycle. The actual economic value of the charcoal saved was
computed at the current market price of charcoal of US $190/ton. As in the case of the
valuation of the improved charcoal kilns it is expected that as charcoal prices rise so will
the level of economic benefits from the use of improved charcoal stoves. The same
altemative price scenarios used for the charcoal kilns was used the charcoal stoves
benefits.
Table 6 presents the detailed calculation of the expected charcoal saving taking into
account expected annual stove production and dissemination patterns and stove life
cycles and valuates the benefits at charcoal market prices ranging from US $190/ton to
US $285/ton.
20.    As the full elaboration and quantification of other project activities (promotion of inter-
fuel substitution options, economic "reconversion" of charcoal traders, modernization of the
charcoal industry, etc.) will be done during the Preparatory and Support Activities component
(Component I) it was judged premature to make estimates on their respective possible benefits
(the full cost of those activities was however included in the project cost).
Discount Rate
21.   A flat discount rate of 12 percent was applied to all project components and sub-
components.

Evaluation Results
22.    The 20-year horizon evaluation of the project resulted in an Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) of 37.35% and a net present value (NPV) at 12 percent discount rate of US $ 34,235
million. Tables 7 and 8 present the summary of project costs and benefits flow and the
economic evaluation of the project. According to these economic evaluation results, the
proposed project would be a fully justifiable and competitive developmental investment for
Senegal.
23.    From Table 7 it can be observed that over the 20-year evaluation horizon the project has
a total flow of US $21.3 million of costs and US $ 186.1 million of expected benefits, for a net
non-discounted positive cost/benefit flow of US $164.6 million. Figures 2 and 3 present the
project's expected cost and benefits flow and the net cost-benefit flow for the entire 20-year
evaluation horizon.
Sensitivity Analysis
24.    The selection of the key parameters for the sensitivity analysis of the project was made
on the basis of their relative weight within the total expected benefits and on the sensitivity
observed during the limited parametric variations included during the baseline evaluation of the
project's benefits (included Tables 2.1 to 6, above).
25.   From the total expected benefits calculated for the project the generation and transfer of
rural income accounted for 39.4 percent, incremental charcoal production for 33.5 percent,
sustainable wood production for 16.7 percent. "other" rural income for 7.9 percent and global
environmental benefits and charcoal consumption savings combined for 2.5 percent. Figure 4
presents a breakdown of the project benefits by type of expected benefit for the 20-year
evaluation horizon.
26.    From the above 5 key parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis of the project:
(i) level of sustainable forest yields (0.5 - 2.0 ton/ha/yr); (ii) fuelwood producer prices (US $
10 - 30/ton); (iii) carbonization efficiency of improved kilns (18% - 30%); (iv) level of
"other" realizable rural income (15% - 40% of expected fuelwood sales); and (v) charcoal
market prices (US $ 190 - 360/ton). Tables 9.1 and 9.2 present the detailed calculation of the
sensitivity analysis for the five key parameter selected. Attachment A presents Figures A.1
through A.5 with the results of the sensitivity analysis for the five key parameter selected.
(i) sustainable forest yields: (0.5 - 2.0 ton/ha/yr): The most important parametric
variable of the project is the average sustainable forest yields. This is so because the
economic output of the sustainable forest management systems will depend on the
realizable sustainable forest yield. Expected rural incomes will depend firstly on forest
yields and then on wood producer prices. As the real forest yields are still based on
estimates a higher degree of uncertainty exists with respect to the forest yields than to
wood prices. Incremental charcoal production, "other" rural income and global
environmental benefits are all positively (and herein assumed linearly) correlated to the

actual sustainable wood output of the project, which in turn will be a direct function of
realizable average sustainable forest yields. Current information indicates that average
forest yields should be between 1 ton /ha/yr and 2.5 tons/ha/yr in the Tambacounda and
Kolda regions. While 1.0 ton/ha/yr was used as the baseline value for the forest yields,
the sensitivity analysis done accepted a yield range from 0.5 ton/ha/yr to the lowest
expected yield. Yields of below 1.0 ton/ha/year, however, are considered to be
unrealistic.
(ii) fuelwood producer prices: (US $10 - 30/ton). Fuelwood producer prices were
allowed to vary from US $10/ton up to US $30/ton. Scenarios for US $15/ton, US
$30/ton and US $40/ton were calculated as part of the baseline evaluation and are
presented in Table 5 (above). Because of that the sensitivity analysis was used to fine
tune the price range between the current US $15/ton and US $30/ton. Although a lower
producer price than the current US $15/ton is not expected to happen, a US $10/ton
scenario was also developed under a theoretical scenario that due to an unanticipated
sudden acceleration of inter-fuel substitution of woodfuels, their demand would drop and
thus potential future market-determined prices would come down..
(iii) carbonization efficiency of improved kilns: (18% - 30%). The carbonization
efficiency of the traditional charcoal kilns is rated at 18 percent. Because of that it is
expected that the lowest conversion efficiency of the improved kilns would be 18%.
Below that level of efficiency their use would be immediately and justifiably
discontinued in favor of the traditional charcoaling methods. Starting a 18 percent the
sensitivity analysis covered gradual efficiency variation until the 30 percent mark.
Efficiencies higher that 30 percent are considered unlikely under the expected field
operation conditions in the project areas. Higher efficiencies would be possible but a
much larger scales of operation than the one envisaged for the project.
(iv) "other" realizable rural income: (15% - 40% of expected fuelwood sales). This
parameter is a function of the income generated from the direct sale of wood by the rural
communities. While there is no empirical data in Senegal to substantiate a specific level
of relation between one and the other, the level used for the baseline calculation (20 %)
was chosen on the basis of estimates from project examples in Burkina Faso
(Programme National de Amenagement Forestier - PNAF and Programme National de
Gestion Terroir). Because of that lack of empirical data to back-up the estimation, the
level of the parameter was allowed to come down as low as 15 percent and go as far a 40
percent. Given the project preparatory work done directly in the field with the
beneficiary communities, it is expected that revenues from "other" economic activities
will play a significant role in the economic development of the project areas. In all
communities visited there are several initiatives for such parallel productive activities
and the communities intent to mobilize the project support mechanism for that purpose.
As the total share of this expected benefit over the overall benefits of the project is less
than 10 percent, even if the ratio between wood income to other income were to be lower
than the 15 percent allowed within the sensitivity analysis, it would not constitute a
decisive factor in the project overall evaluation rating.
(v) Charcoal market prices: Based on the production and marketing track record of the
improved stove that the project intend to support, there is no reason to believe that the



Annex 8
Page 36 of 36
stove dissemination targets of the project would not be met. On the contrary, it is
expected that the demonstration effect of the additional 225,000 that the project will
support will further motivate the development and/or expansion of additional parallel
private sector-based stove supplies at full factor cost. Also, while the long-term testing
done by Appropriate Technology International (ATI) has established that the DIAMBAR
stove has an incremental energy efficiency of 50% in order to avoid overestimation of
benefits the stove's incremental efficiency gain over traditional stoves was fixes at 40
percent. Hence, there being no expected negative variations in either the rate of stove
dissemination or the stove's energy efficiency, the sensitivity analysis of the improved
stove component was limited to variations in the market price of charcoal from US
$190/ton to US $360/ton. As the price of charcoal is only expected to rise over time, no
negative price variation were modeled.
27.   Table 10 presents a summary of the results of the sensitivity analyses conducted,
including the main value variations considered ("base", low and high) and the respective
switching value.

LETTRE DE POLITIQUE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
DU SECTEUR DE L'ENERGIE
30 janvier 1997
A- Obiectifs
1. Le Gouvernement du Senegal a mene de 1987 a 1992, avec le soutien de ses partenaires au
developpement, le premier projet sectoriel sur l'energie. Ce programme a permis de mobiliser les
financements necessaires aux rehabilitations les plus urgentes et pour le renforcement des
infrastructures. II a egalement contribue a ameliorer la capacite de gestion du secteur. Depuis
quelques annees, un nouvel environnement economique se met en place caracterise par la mise en
oeuvre d'un programme d'ajustement global de l'economie et de recentrage du r6le de l'Etat vers
les fonctions de planification / regulation / contr6le.
2. Dans ce contexte, un projet Energie II, reposant sur un programme de reformes importantes
dans le secteur de l'energie, est en preparation. L'objet de la presente" Lettre de Politique de
Developpement du Secteur de l'Energie " ( LPDSE) est de preciser les decisions prises par le
Gouvernement ainsi que le calendrier des actions pour leur mise en oeuvre. Elle s'inscrit dans le
cadre macro-economique defini par le Gouvernement, dont l'objectif est d'atteindre un degre de
croissance economique substantiel, tout en preservant la stabilite financiere et fiscale a moyen
terme.
3. Ce cadre a ete en particulier enonce dans le contexte des accords signes par le Gouvernement
avec les bailleurs de fonds internationaux. II est detaille, d'une part, dans le document-cadre de
politique economique et financiere (PFP) a moyen terme ( 1994-1997) et, d'autre part, dans la
lettre de politique de developpement du secteur prive, conclus en 1994 et soutenus par le Fonds
monetaire international et la Banque mondiale. Le PFP, remis a jour en 1995 et 1996 a defini les
actions generales que le Gouvernement a decide de mettre en oeuvre dans le secteur de l'energie.
Elles sont detaillees dans la presente lettre.
B-Cadre macro-economique
4. En termes d'objectifs macro-economiques, la politique d'ajustement global vise a atteindre une
croissance du PIB de 4,5% a 5% par an a partir de 1995 permettant chaque annee une
augmentation du revenu par tete de 2% au moins et la creation de 20 000 emplois nouveaux. Elle
doit en plus assurer, a partir de 1996, un retour du taux d'inflation, defini en terme de deflateur du
PIB, a son faible niveau de 2 - 3% par an. Elle doit permettre une reduction progressive du deficit
du compte courant exterieur (hors dons), de 9,8 % du PIB en 1994 a 6,8 % en 1997.
5. Le Gouvernement a mis en place un dispositif d'incitations et de securisation de
l'investissement prive qui comporte en particulier le Code des Investissements, l'autorisation de
rapatriements des capitaux et benefices, la legislation fiscale, la couverture des risques de
convertibilite des monnaies et de variation de taux de change.

C-SITUATION ET CONTRAINTES DU SECTEUR
6. Le Gouvernement a procede a l'analyse de l'ensemble des contraintes et obstacles auxquels est
confronte le secteur, a formule des orientations et des strategies adequates et a decide de
conduire des actions specifiques dans chaque sous-secteur energetique en vue d'atteindre les
objectifs globaux qu'il s'est assignes.
Cl-Constats d'ordre gin6ral
7. Le bilan energetique du Senegal fait apparaitre, au niveau de l1'nergie primaire, la
preponderance du bois (61%) provenant de l'exploitation des forets naturelles, suivi du petrole
(37%), celui-ci etant presque totalement importe.
8. Le niveau des prix est repute elev6 au S6n6gal en raison de contraintes objectives notamment
1'absence de rente hydraulique ou petroliere, la taille du systeme (liee a celle du marche) limnitant
les possibilites d'exploitation des economies d'echelle ou de recours a certaines technologies, et les
ressources forestieres limitees.
9. L'acces des populations aux formes d'energies commerciales est faible.
C2- Contraintes par sous-secteur
C2.1-Le sous-secteur petrolier
10. L'approvisionnement en hydrocarbures repose exclusivement sur les importations de la SAR
(Societe Africaine de Raffinage) qui s'elevent environ a 900 000 tonnes par an, representant un
cout d'environ en devises 75 milliards de F CFA en 1995, et 92 milliards en 1996. La SAR est
egalement la seule societe de raffinage de petrole brut. Elle est confrontee a deux problemes
majeurs: d'une part, la taille limitee du marche et, d'autre part, la vetuste des installations qui
tardent a 8tre renouvelees, ce malgre le "supplement" de 2,3 $/bbl qui lui est octroye au titre de la
remuneration de ses activites.
11. La production nationale est assuree par PETROSEN et represente moins de 1000 tonnes de
p6trole brut en 1995, vendu a la SAR et 55 millions de m3 de gaz qui alimentent des turbines a
gaz de la SENELEC. La principale contrainte de PETROSEN reste le financement de ses activites
dans le domaine de l'exploration, en particulier avec les difficultes de mobilisation de fonds
publics.
12. La distribution des produits petroliers est realisee par quatre grandes societes qui se partagent
le marche sans grande concurrence tandis que le transport des produits petroliers est assure depuis
1972 par un cartel de transporteurs affectes de fa,on reglementaire aux differentes societes.

Page 5 of 13
13. La fixation trimestrielle des prix des produits petroliers basee sur la parite importation a
represente la premiCre etape de la reforme recommandee par l'etude du cabinet ADL de 1987.
Certains volets de la reforme tels que la repercussion du prix du marche sur le prix de vente au
consommateur n'ont pas encore ete entierement appliques. Par ailleurs, le poids de la fiscalite sur
le prix des produits petroliers, notamment ceux utilises par les industriels et le gas-oil, obere
lourdement le cout des facteurs de production compromettant ainsi la competitivite de l'economie
et la relance de la croissance.
C2.2-Le sous-secteur electricite
14. L'e1ectricite est uniquement d'origine thermique. La SENELEC a le monopole de la
distribution et dispose d'un parc de production de 280 MW. Elle consomme 300 000 tonnes de
produits petroliers pour une production de 1 000 GWh par an. Elle rachete en plus une part des
excedents d'energie (4 GWh en 1994) des quelques auto-producteurs existants (ICS, la CSS et la
SONACOS qui, avec un parc de 90 MW, produisent 100 GWh par an).
15. Le taux d'electrification au niveau national est de 25 % ; il est de 50% en zone urbaine et
seulement de 5% en zone rurale. La population n'ayant pas accbs a 1'electricite reste tres en
dessous du niveau mondial ( 75 % contre 40%)
16. En outre, le ralentissement a partir de 1990 des investissements de la SENELEC (dfi
essentiellement au gel des financements des bailleurs) a eu pour consequence la degradation des
outils de production et la deterioration des resultats economiques et financiers. Malgre le
redressement note recemment, les principaux problemes (deficit important de puissance, relations
financieres difficiles entre l'Etat et la SENELEC, faiblesse du taux d'electrification) persistent
toujours et leur resolution conditionne le succes durable des efforts d'assainissement engages.
C2.3-L'eIectrification rurale
17. L'electrification rurale est encore tres peu developpee- puisqu'on compte en 1994 environ 250
villages electrifies sur un total de pres de 14.000- a cause principalement de l'absence de
ressources adequates pour assurer le financement des coits tres eleves d'investissement et
d'exploitation dans un contexte de non-rentabilite financiere des operations d'electrification rurale.
Si la tendance actuelle se poursuit, le pourcentage de la population rurale ayant acces a l'lectricit6
ira en diminuant, dans la mesure ou le taux de raccordement (2% an) est inferieur a celui de la
croissance de la population (environ 3% an).
18. Le service de l'electricite en milieu rural est cependant source de progres social important; il
facilite notamment l'acces aux services de sante et a l'education, permet la realisation d'activites
productives generatrices de revenus et, d'une maniere generale, favorise le developpement
economique et social du monde rural. Ainsi, il contribue a freiner l'exode rural en fixant les
populations sur leur terroir, et donc limite le developpement incontr6le des villes. L'electrification
rurale represente, de ce fait, un enjeu considerable pour le Senegal.
II apparait donc fondamental de definir un cadre strategique global qui permette la mise en place
d'une veritable dynamique d'electrification rurale.

C2.4-Le sous-secteur des combustibles domestiques
19. La consommation nationale est estimee a 330.000 tonnes de charbon de bois et a 1.500.000
tonnes de bois, ce qui represente l'equivalent de plus de 4 millions de m3 de bois. La demande en
charbon de bois, satisfaite par un prelevement concentre sur des ressources forestieres fragiles, est
a l'origine d'un d6frichement annuel de 30.000 ha de forets naturelles.
20. Les modes d'exploitation actuelles pour la fourniture du bois energie et du charbon de bois
conduisent a une degradation rapide du couvert forestier. Egalement, le front de 1'exploitation
forestiere recule d'annee en annee, pour atteindre aujourd'hui des zones situees a plus de 400 km
de la capitale. Enfin, la non-responsabilisation des populations locales ne permet pas une gestion
efficace des ressources forestieres de leurs terroirs.
21. La butanisation, menee depuis 1974 grace a un systeme de subvention sur le prix du gaz
butane et a des investissements prives importants en matiere d'equipement et d'infrastructures de
stockage, d'emplissage et de distribution, a aujourd'hui des effets visibles. Mais cette politique
s'est revelee etre d'un cout eleve pour l'Etat, atteignant actuellement 6 milliards de F CFA sous
forme de subvention sur le prix du produit sans compter l'exon6ration des taxes sur les
equipements gaz.
22. Enfin, les campagnes de promotion de foyers ameliores et de substitution de la tourbe au
charbon de bois ont ete sans grands resultats a ce jour.
D- Politique Energetiaue
23. Malgre les contraintes precedentes, le secteur energetique du Senegal presente des atouts
serieux pour son developpement, entre autres:
- une industrie petroliere complete fonctionnant selon des standards de classe
intemationale;
- un sous-secteur electrique organise de maniere rationnelle et recelant des ressources
humaines competentes, et;
- un sous-secteur des combustibles domestiques qui mise clairement sur une gestion durable
des ressources forestieres.
24. Dans ce contexte, la politique energetique mettra l'accent sur trois dimensions fondamentales:
economique: rationaliser les conditions d'approvisionnement, de production, de distribution
et de consommation d'energie, dans le respect des inter&s a long terme du pays;
. environnementale : respecter les equilibres ecologiques fondamentaux et encourager une
gestion rationnelle des espaces ruraux dans les zones d'exploitation forestiere a usage energetique;
.......



5                               Annex 9
Page 7 of 13
. sociale: elargir l'acces des populations aux formes modernes d'energie, condition sine qua
non de reussite de la lutte contre la pauvrete, de l'amelioration de la sante des populations, de
succes dans les efforts de reduction de l'analphabetisme, du developpement de l'agriculture, de la
promotion de la femme, etc.
25. La strategie comporte des actions dans le domaine des sous-secteurs petrolier et electrique
ainsi que dans celui des combustibles domestiques. Celles-ci- incluent en particulier:
- la liberalisation des importations, du transport et de la distribution des produits petroliers
ainsi que l'abolition de la convention speciale de la SAR et son remplacement par une surtaxe
temporaire et degressive sur les importations de produits finis;
- l'ajustement trimestriel automatique des prix des produits petroliers en liaison avec
l'evolution des cours internationaux;
- la modification du cadre legal et reglementaire afin de permettre un niveau eleve de
concurrence et d'encourager l'implication du secteur prive dans l'investissement et la gestion du
secteur de l'e1ectricite;
- la privatisation et la restructuration de SENELEC; et,
- le transfert aux collectivites locales de la gestion et de l'exploitation des ressources
ligneuses.
26. Pour mettre en oeuvre cette strategie et les actions correspondantes, le Gouvernement a
decide de s'appuyer sur deux nouvelles entites, a savoir: (a) un Comite Interministeriel de
Pilotage des Reformes du Secteur de l'Energie, comprenant l'ensemble des departements
ministeriels concernes et ayant la responsabilite de coordonner et de diriger la mise en oeuvre des
reformes; et (b) une Cellule Technique, composee de specialistes requis, qui sera chargee de
mener tous les travaux necessaires pour la conduite de ces reformes ainsi que de la preparation et
1'execution du Projet Energie II.
E-Sous-secteur des produits petroliers
27. Les activites de ce sous-secteur sont deja exercees pour l'essentiel par des operateurs prives,
mais sous un mode monopolistique. Les r6formes ont pour but de diminuer le couit des produits
en liberalisant totalement ces activites et en stimulant la concurrence.



Annex 9
Page 8 of 13
6
28. Tous les segments de l'activite seront liberalises d'ici fin decembre 1997, par abolition de
tous les monopoles existants (importation, raflinage, transport et distribution). L'encouragement a
plus de concurrence se fera sur la base de regles applicables de la meme facon a tous les acteurs
de la filiere, et en ayant le souci de securite d'approvisionnement, de surete et d'environnement.
Les barrieres a 1'entree dans l'activite (capacites physique et financiere aussi bien pour
l'importation, le transport que la distribution) seront fixees et contr6lees par la puissance
publique. Elles devront etre fixees a des niveaux permettant la satisfaction des exigences en
matiere de securite, de surete, de transparence avec le souci de ne pas decourager de nouveaux
acteurs potentiels. Les importateurs auront la possibilite de regrouper leurs achats sur le marche
international, a travers des mecanismes specifiques a mettre au point, en vue de realiser les
economies d'echelle propres a la taille du marche senegalais.
29. Le Gouvernement adoptera, avant fin 1997, apres concertation avec les operateurs
concernes, les modifications legales et reglementaires permettant l'acces des tiers aux installations
existantes de stockage et de transport par conduites des produits petroliers. Cela concerne en
particulier: les statuts de la SAR; la publication des specifications des produits pouvant etre
consideres pour l'acces a ces installations et des conditions techniques a respecter pour cet acces;
la fixation, I'homologation et la publication par les proprietaires des installations de leur prix pour
le service rendu (utilisation par des tiers de leurs installations).
30. Avant la fin du mois de decembre 1997, la convention liant la SAR et l'Etat sera abolie et le
supplement de 2.3 US$/bbl accorde sur les prix ex-SAR sera supprime. Une taxe sur l'importation
des produits petroliers raffines sera instauree a partir du mois de decembre 1997. Le
gouvernement adoptera avant la fin du mois de juin 1997, en accord avec la Banque
Mondiale,un plan indiquant la duree de cette surtaxe qui sera degressive et limitee dans le temps.
31. Fiscalite et prix: Le but general des reformes dans ce domaine est que les prix refletent les
couits economiques. A plus long terme, lorsque l'ouverture du marche sera plus importante
(nombre plus grand et taille relative plus faible des acteurs), les prix seront completement
liberalises. Dans la periode intermediaire, ils continueront neanmoins a etre regules. La definition
et la mise en place d'une nouvelle structure des prix petroliers se feront d'ici la fin de decembre
1997, en tenant compte d'un certain nombre de principes et d'objectifs de calendrier:
(i) I'ajustement des prix ex-SAR et des prix aux consommateurs en liaison avec les variations
des couts, en particulier celui des produits a l'importation; cet ajustement se fera
trimestriellement jusqu'a la fin de 1998, puis mensuellement;
(ii) les prix actuels seront immediatement transformes en prix plafonds;
(iii) les marges seront exprimees en valeur (et non en pourcentage) aux differents niveaux de
la filiere (importation, distribution, detaillant), et tiendront compte des caracteristiques
techniques et des coat propres a chaque produit;
*.** ...* 



Annex 9
Page 9 of 13
7
(iv) le systeme actuel de perequation du transport sera revu, en raison du nouveau contexte
de liberalisation, pour prot6ger les interets des consommateurs excentres et assurer la couverture
du territoire.
(v) la fiscalite sur les produits sera simplifiee et l'objectif de neutralite fiscale (par produit, par
type d'usage) sera recherchee;
(vi) les subventions concernant les combustibles pour la production d'electricite et pour la
consommation d'electricite de la Compagnie des Phosphates de Taiba seront elirninees.
32. En ce qui conceme l'exploration petroliere, la politique du Gouvernement vise a intensifier la
recherche d'hydrocarbures, pour augmenter les chances de decouverte de gisements exploitables.
Dans ce contexte, le Gouvernement et la Societe publique PETROSEN devront concentrer
seulement leurs activites sur la promotion du bassin sedimentaire s6n6galais; a cet effet, les textes
regissant la soci6t6 seront modifies et adoptes avant le 30 juin 1997.
F-Electricite
33. Le sous-secteur de l'electricite fait face a des enjeux considerables qui conditionnent, dans une
large mesure, le succes du programme d'ajustement. C'est la raison pour laquelle, le
gouvernement attache une grande importance au developpement de celui-ci.
34. Les objectifs principaux de la politique du gouvernement pour le sous-secteur de l'electricite
sont: (i) d'assurer la garantie de l'approvisionnement en electricite de la population et des autres
consommateurs dans les meilleures conditions de surete et de prix, compatibles avec la situation
&conomique du pays; et (ii) d'accelerer l'dlectrification urbaine (60% en l'an 2000) et rurale (15%
a l'an 2000).
35. Le Gouvernement a conscience que I'atteinte de ces objectifs ne pourra &re realisee sans,
d'une part, trouver les voies et moyens de perenniser les resultats encourageants obtenus ces trois
dernieres annees au niveau de l'amelioration de la gestion et des resultats d'exploitation, et
d'autre part, ameliorer de maniere substantielle l'efficacite et la productivite du sous secteur par
une large implication des operateurs prives. Cela necessitera une restructuration importante du
sous-secteur dont l'objectif est de: (i) confier au secteur prive la production et la distribution de
l'electricite; et (ii) promouvoir la concurrence a tous les niveaux possibles et compatibles avec les
caracteristiques du systeme electrique senegalais.
Fl- Cadre 2Cneral
36. Il est retenu d'introduire d'importants changements dans la structure de l'industrie electrique
et dans la propriete des moyens de production et de distribution de l'electricite. A cet effet, le
Gouvernement a decide la privatisation ci court ternie de la SENELEC. Par ailleurs, le
Gouvernement ne souhaite pas creer de monopole prive durable ce qui, el moyeni ternie, implique
d'introduire le plus possible de concurrence dans le secteur.



8                              Annex 9
Page 10 of 13
Dans ce cadre, il a ete decide de mettre en place un processus progressif de decouplage vertical de
la structure de l'industrie electrique. Les implications et les adaptations que ce processus
necessitera sur les lois existantes seront examinees et les modifications requises seront effectuees.
Le Gouvernement envisage egalement la creation d'une part, d'une Structure publique legere
chargee de l'lectrification rurale et d'autre part d'une Agence de maitrise de l'Energie.
37. L'introduction de la concurrence dans le secteur sera neanmoins limitee par certaines
contraintes, specifiques au secteur electrique senegalais (cf supra) et liees plus particulierement:
(i) a sa taille actuelle relativement reduite; et (ii) au faible taux de penetration de 1'electricite,
particulierement en zones rurales. Ces contraintes ont et considerees dans le processus des
reformes qui seront mises en place.
F2- Les reformes de la structure et de la propriete du sous-secteur electrigue
38. Pour atteindre l'objectif de moyen-terme qui est de creer les bases pour un cadre competitif
dans le sous-secteur, le Gouvernement a decide d'ouvrir toute nouvelle production au secteur
prive, notamment selon la formule BOO (Build, Own and Operate). Dans les localites deja
electrifiees, et A l'expiration des concessions pour la distribution, leur octroi fera l'objet d'une
procedure d'appel d'offres a des operateurs prives, des collectivites locales ou a des cooperatives.
Dans le cas des localites non electrifiees ce processus sera, autant que possible, egalement retenu.
39. Par rapport A l'objectif de court terme qui est d'ameliorer l'efficience de la societe, le
Gouvemement procedera a la privatisation immediate de la SENELEC, sur la base d'un appel
d'offres structure, en procedant au transfert d'une majorite des actions A un partenaire
strategique, au secteur prive senegalais et au personnel. Le partenaire strategique proposera dans
son offre, le niveau de participation qu'il souhaite detenir. Les responsabilites du partenaire
strategique en matiere de gestion de la societe ainsi que ses engagements en matiere de
developpement de 'electrification seront definis au travers notamment d'un nouveau cahier de
charges, et d'une nouvelle convention de concession.
40. Des son entree en fonction, le Partenaire Strategique devra introduire une comptabilite
distincte pour les trois segments de son activite a savoir:  production-P, transport-T, et
distribution-D. Toute nouvelle capacite de production jugee necessaire se fera par appel d'offres
aupres d'investisseurs prives: la SENELEC n'etant plus autorisee A developper son parc de
production.
F3- Cadre lezal
41. Le Gouvernement preparera avant la fin de I'annee 1997, une Loi sur l'electricite mettant en
place le cadre structurel et juridique dans lequel le sous-secteur devra dorenavant operer. Ce
cadre legal comprendra : (1) la structure et le mode de fonctionnement du secteur permettant
d'assurer le maximun de competition au niveau de la production et de la distribution.



9                              Annex 9
Page 11 of 13
De plus la loi sur l'electricite explicitera les relations entre les differents acteurs; (2) le role de
l'Etat concernant la politique electrique, la planification et la regulation, en particulier en ce qui
conceme les principes de tarification; et (3) les modalites de fonctionnement de l'organisme de
regulation.
Enfin, cette loi devra tenir compte de la politique de decentralisation, mise en vigueur en 1997, et
du cadre futur de la cooperation regionale en matiere de production et de transport d'energie
electrique notamment au sein des pays membres de l'Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du
Fleuve Senegal, de l'Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie et de l'Union
Economique et Monetaire Ouest Africaine.
42. La mise en oeuvre de la Loi sur l'Electricite sera assuree par un organisme de regulation qui
devra etre cree et qui aura pour taches essentielles: (1) d'accorder (et de retirer le cas echeant) les
differentes licences d'exploitation (production independante, concessions); (2) d'interpreter et
d'appliquer les principes de tarification definis dans la Loi; et enfin (3) de definir les standards et
normes de fonctionnement du secteur electrique.
Ce sera dans un premier temps, un organisme gouvernemental situe au sein du Ministere charge
de l'Energie. Sa fonction operationnelle de reglementation sera effectuee par une petite unite
specialisee et comprenant un nombre tres limite de cadres.
Dans un premier temps, elle sera chargee de controler et d'approuver les processus d'appel
d'offres competitifs lances pour obtenir des capacites additionnelles en production d'electricite.
F4- Maitrise de V'Enerfie
43. Le Gouvernement du Senegal entend poursuivre et developper les efforts en matiere de
maitrise de l'energie avec pour objectif de reduire la facture vis a vis des produits importes, de
dimimuer les couits des facteurs de production et de contribuer a la protection de 1'environnement
global.
44. A cet effet, I'Agence pour la maitrise de I'Energie dont la creation est envisagee plus haut
aura pour taches d'identifier les potentiels d'economie d'energie et de realiser les actions
d'information, d'appui et de conseil aupres des differents operateurs. Elle etudiera d'autre part, les
mesures fiscales et reglementaires a mettre en place pour encourager la maitrise de l'energie.
F5- Electrification rurale et Oeriurbaine
45. Le developpement de 1'electricite dans les zones rurales et dans certaines zones peri-urbaines,
que cela soit par developpement des reseaux ou par moyens decentralises, est couteux et le
produit peut s'averer trop cher pour les populations concernees. Le Gouvernement envisage
d'appuyer ces extensions par l'octroi de subventions dans le cadre de sa politique sociale. Leurs
realisation et exploitation pourront etre confiees aux firmes de distribution privees les plus
proches des zones concernmes, selon des procedures d'adjudication reglementees.



10                              Annex 9
Page 12 of 13
46. Cet aspect devra faire l'objet d'analyses compl6mentaires et de propositions plus detaillees, en
particulier pour ce qui concerne la programmation des investissements, les sources et les
modalites de financement. Il est neanmoins attendu que la restructuration du secteur, telle qu'elle
est decrite ci-dessus, facilitera le developpement d'entites capables et interessees a d6velopper ces
activites.
G. Combustibles domesticiues
47. Le but general recherche est de: (i) valoriser de maniere durable les ressources energetiques
issues de formations forestieres nationales; (ii) faire beneficier les collectivites locales de
ressources tirees de l'exploitation forestiere, et (iii) promouvoir des combustibles de substitution
adaptes au modele de cuisson senegalais pour autant que leur faisabilite technique et economique
est assuree.
48. En vue de la realisation de ces objectifs, le code forestier, adopte en 1993 pour sa partie
legislative et en 1995 pour sa partie reglementaire, vise a introduire les reformes importantes
suivantes:
- le charbon de bois sera produit A partir de la vente de bois sur pied en consideration de la
capacite de regeneration des for8ts. C'est dans ce sens qu'un decret presidentiel pris en 1996,
vient de relever la redevance foresti&e et introduit un systeme de taxation differencie suivant que
le bois provienne d'une zone amenagee ou de formations fortieres naturelles.
- les collectivites locales concernees seront les gestionnaires legaux des for8ts de leur
terroir et les beneficiaires des revenus issus de leur exploitation. A cet effet, les decrets
d'application de la regionalisation, dejA signes en janvier 1997, consacrent entre autres, le
transfert de la gestion des ressources forestieres aux collectivites locales.
49. Dans ce contexte, les dispositions legislatives et reglementaires du nouveau Code Forestier
seront revisees, avant le 30 juin 1997, pour tenir compte de la politique de regionalisation et pour
offrir des garanties en matiere de gestion de for8ts et de transfert des ressources issues de
l'exploitation forestiere vers les populations rurales.
50. Dans le cadre de cette revision, les mesures suivantes seront precisees:
1) les gestionnaires legaux des ressources concernees seront les beneficiaires des revenus
issus de la vente du bois des for8ts;
2) les quotas seront des quantites A prelever annuellement, fixees en terme de volume de
bois sur pied ou de stere, en tenant compte de la capacite de regeneration des for8ts
3) les services forestiers mettront en place avant le 30 juin 1998, les mesures necessaires
pour la realisation d'une exploitation forestiere raisonnee et contr6lee (quotas annuels) qui
devront couvrir l'ensemble des superficies forestieres du pays a l'horizon 2005. A l'an 2000, ces
mesures devront couvrir les regions de Tambacounda et de Kolda.
.1. . /* 



Annex 9
Page 13 of 13
51. En outre, le prix de charbon de bois sera liberalise au plus tard le 31 decembre 1999. Un
systbme de regulation de la filiere sera cependant mis en place pour eviter des risques en matiere
d'approvisionnement et pour assurer une situation de reelle competitivite dans le sous secteur.
52. Un plan de suppression de la subvention sur le gaz butane sera adopte par le Gouvernement
au plus tard le 31 decembre 1997, pour tenir compte des contraintes financieres de l'Etat.
L'elimination de cette subvention se fera de facon progressive par tranches semestrielles et devra
8tre complete le 31 decembre 1999.
53. Enfin, le Gouvernement envisage la mise en aeuvre de mesures adequates en vue de diversifier
les combustibles de cuisson proposes aux menages. Il s'agira en particulier de promouvoir le
kerosene -- dont l'introduction comme combustible domestique sera entreprise avant la fin de
juin 1998 -- et valoriser d'autres ressources potentielles nationales.
H - Approche et movens a mettre en oeuvre
54. Le Gouvernement du Senegal a conscience que la mise en oeuvre de l'ambitieux programme
decrit ci-dessus demandera un effort substantiel, du temps et des ressources financieres. Le
soutien de la Banque Mondiale et d'autres bailleurs de fonds sera recherche.
Le Ministre de l'Econornie,                   -       stre de l'Energie,
