F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives
The objectives of the Project are: (a) to increase equitable access to Secondary Education; (b) to
improve quality and efficiency of Secondary Education; and (c) to strengthen the institutional
capacity of the educational sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was revised in November 2004 following Hurricane Ivan, which caused severe
damage to the country. In order to accommodate the recovery effort, the first objective
was modified to “increase equitable access to secondary education, including replacing
and rehabilitating secondary schools damaged by the passage of Hurricane Ivan on
September 7, 2004?. The other two objectives remained the same. The key outcome
indicators, their targets, and output indicators were revised. The Project reverted to the
original PDO at the 2008 restructuring for additional financing. The target values were
also revised, and the output indicators were defined specifically for additional financing.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Grenada and other island states of the Organization of Eastern States (OECS)
have been facing challenges due to their small size and extreme vulnerability to external
shocks based on the following factors: natural disasters including frequent hurricanes;
swings in prices of key commodity imports; and concentration of exports in a few goods
and services. While these countries showed positive economic growth accompanied by an
improvement of social indicators during the 1980s and 1990s, they were still plagued by
strong income volatility and insecurity and persistent poverty at the time of appraisal in
May 2003.

2.      At the time of appraisal, Grenada and OECS countries had been facing
considerable educational challenges. These included: (i) inequitable access to secondary
education, (ii) deficient quality of secondary education including: imbalanced and
irrelevant curricula; ineffective teaching/learning mode; low teachers’ qualifications and
insufficient training; insufficient and low quality instructional materials and educational
equipment to support student-centered learning approaches; inadequate student
assessment and supervision mechanisms; and inadequate school community participation
and support for students; and (iii) weak management of the sector and governance of
schools. Specifically in Grenada, some secondary schools were overcrowded due to
internal migration and imbalanced number of primary and secondary schools in certain
areas. Low academic achievement particularly in the areas of literacy and numeracy was
another major challenge facing the country.2

3.      The OECS Education Reform Strategy, which was adopted by the OECS
Ministers of Education in June 2001, proposed to reform secondary education with a
focus on access, relevance, quality, youth at risk, and institutional capacity. In line with
the regional strategies, each country developed a long-term education sector plan.

4.       The OECS Education Development Program (OEDP) was proposed as an
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to provide phased support to long-term education plans
in the OECS countries. The program was consistent with the OECS Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for FY02-06 (2001). The CAS confirmed the priorities of the regional
Education Reform Strategy and favored a sub-regional approach to encourage cost
effectiveness and sub-regional integration while meeting the particular needs of each
country. The proposed program was designed as a “horizontal? APL, in which the
instrument would apply sequentially across countries in the sub-region to allow countries
to join the program when they were ready (Table 1).

  Grenada showed the lowest proportion of students passing CXC (Caribbean Examination Council: it
provides the exams to the students in the OECS countries at the end of the secondary education cycle)
among the OEDP participating countries. Only 13% of students sitting for the CXC exams in 2000 passed
four subject areas including English and Maths.

5.     Grenada joined the second phase of OEDP. In 2001, the Government of Grenada
adopted its long-term education sector plan “Strategic Plan for Education and
Development (SPEED)? which defines its strategy and actions through 2010. SPEED
addressed the above mentioned educational challenges, and aimed at achieving universal
secondary coverage as one of the top priorities. The OEDP in Grenada (the Project)3
aimed at providing support in implementing and achieving the objectives established in
SPEED.

6.      The Bank had a standing commitment to provide financial and technical
assistance to the Caribbean region and an ongoing relationship with the Ministries of
Education. A collaborative approach had yielded increased cooperation between the Bank
and the countries, and among countries. The Bank had participated in the Caribbean
Education Task Force in its quest to establish a regional strategy. Furthermore, it had
carried out extensive sector work in secondary education and could provide best practice
examples of initiatives at this level.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The objectives of the Project were: (a) to increase equitable access to Secondary
Education; (b) to improve quality and efficiency of Secondary Education; and (c) to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the educational sector.4

8.     It should be noted, however, that there were variations in the original PDO as
presented in the PAD and the Loan Agreement and within the PAD.5

  IBRD-7187-GR/IDA-38090/IDA-45420 (Grenada is an IBRD/IDA blend country); Approval Date: June
3, 2003; Report No: 26042.
4
  This is the PDO as presented in the Loan Agreement. The PDO in the PAD (page 4) focused on the
development objective for the horizontal APL program, noting a special emphasis for Grenada. The PDO in
the PAD (page 4) is as follows: The overall objective of the horizontal APL program is to build human
capital in the OECS which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of their economy and more
sustainable growth. This objective will be achieved by: i) increasing equitable access to secondary
education;, ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct interventions
and provisions of resources at the school level, a focus on student-centered learning and various
mechanisms to provide student support, and iii) strengthening management of the sector and governance of
school. In Grenada, special emphasis will be placed on improving students’ literacy and numeracy skills.

                                                    2
9.     As listed in the PAD, the Project’s objectives were to be measured by the
following key outcome indicators:

       Transition rate to secondary education
        o In proportion to Grade 6 students
        o In proportion to students sitting the Common Entrance Exam (CEE)
        o Based on students sitting the CEE in the 3 underserved parishes of St. Andrew,
           St. David and St. George
       Net enrollment rate at the secondary level
       Gross completion rate in Form 5
       Proportion of students passing at least 5 CXC exams (including Math and
        English)
       Proportion of non-salary recurrent expenditure out of total recurrent expenditure
       Pupil-teacher ratio

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The PDO was revised in November 2004 following Hurricane Ivan, which caused
severe damage to the country. In order to accommodate the recovery effort, the first
objective was modified to “increase equitable access to secondary education, including
replacing and rehabilitating secondary schools damaged by the passage of Hurricane
Ivan on September 7, 2004?. The other two objectives remained the same. The key
outcome indicators, their targets, and output indicators were revised. The Project reverted
to the original PDO at the 2008 restructuring for additional financing. The target values
were also revised, and the output indicators were defined specifically for additional
financing.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The equitable access component of the Project was designed to benefit especially
the secondary school-age children in most populated and underserved areas by expanding
and rehabilitating some secondary schools. Less able learners were targeted with
specially designed support programs. In addition, the quality component of the Project
was designed to benefit all the secondary education students. Teachers, school
administrators, and Ministry staff were to benefit from training provided by the Project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.    Component 1 – Increasing equitable access to secondary education (US$1.17
million) This component was designed to increase equitable access to secondary



5
 Other sections of the PAD, including Section A-3 (p.5), B-3 (p.13), Annex 1 and 3, had different
variations of the PDOs.

                                                    3
education and to relieve overcrowding through the expansion and rehabilitation of three
secondary schools. A total of additional 520 spaces were to be created.

13.    Component 2 – Improving the quality of teaching and learning (US$7.79
million) This component aimed at improving quality to enhance the school teaching and
learning environment, with more direct interventions at the school level and a focus on
student-centered learning by: (i) Developing curriculum for Forms I to III with an
emphasis on literacy and numeracy; (ii) Upgrading teacher skills; (iii) Strengthening
student assessment system; and (iv) Improving student support services.

14.      Component 3 – Improved governance and management of the education
sector (US$1.57 million) This component was designed to improve the level and
efficiency of supervision at the school level through: (i) Strengthening school supervision
and management by establishing District Education Offices and providing training; (ii)
Providing training to school principals on the preparation and use of school development
plans; (iii) Carrying out School Improvement Projects; (iii) Expanding the Education
Management Information System (EMIS); and (iv) Improving communication and
participation through dissemination of information on the education reform process.

15.    Component 4 – Project Management (US$0.73 million) This component aimed
at supporting and strengthening operations of the Project Management Unit (PMU). This
included the provision of technical assistance, training and purchase of the necessary
equipment.

1.6 Revised Components

16.     The Project was restructured three times (2004, 2006, and 2008) in response to
the Government’s formal requests. The 2004 restructuring took place to redirect funds to
emergency civil works needs following Hurricane Ivan. The 2006 restructuring was to
reinstate the expansion of schools in the Project description, adjust the financing
allocation and reduce financing percentages for all the categories. The 2008 restructuring
and additional financing of US$1.9 million was to allow most of the activities that had
been curtailed during the 2004 restructuring to proceed.

17.     The number and names of the components remained the same throughout the
Project. Subsequent to Hurricane Ivan, Component 1 was expanded with a large
allocation of funds, while the scope of activities and funding allocation under Component
2 and 3 were reduced. Subsequent to November 2008, funds were allocated only to the
aspect of quality (Components 2), governance (Component 3), and project management
(Component 4). Some activities, such as summer school programs to enhance literacy and
numeracy and EMIS were completely dropped. Table 2 shows the change in the
Components under the three restructurings.

 1.7 Other significant changes

 18.    The Project was extended three times from the original closing date of September
 30, 2007. It was extended to June 30, 2008 and December 30, 2008 to finalize the civil
 works, and then to June 30, 2011 to carry out activities with the additional financing.

 19.     The implementation arrangements for the Project were also changed in 2005.
 While the PMU was originally set up for OEDP, it was merged with a newly established
 PCU under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) that oversees all donor-funded projects.
 MOE’s PMU staff were moved to the PCU. In addition, in November 2004, more
 flexible procurement arrangements to support reconstruction were introduced.

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

 20.    The Project’s design reflected wide participation of its stakeholders. It
 involved community meetings and focus group discussions with teachers, students,
 principals, and parents to discuss specific topics. Furthermore, a wide range of
 stakeholders were involved in the Project design process through the project preparation
 committee, which consisted of the MOE staff, education officers, teachers, principals,
 teacher union representatives, NGO members, officials from the Ministry of Finance and
 the Ministry of Culture. This helped to enhance ownership and support for reform.
 Close collaboration with DFID during design helped to provide funding for some for
 some of the quality enhancing activities.

 21.      Government’s strong ownership and effective implementation arrangement.
 Based on the successful experience in other projects, a committee consisting of the key
 technical staff in the MOE was set up for each Project component. Each committee was
 responsible for elaborating the component’s activities and costs. This ensured smooth
 preparation process, was highly effective in increasing and maintaining the Government’s
 ownership throughout the Project period, and allowed the continuity from preparation to
 implementation. It also enhanced sustainability of project activities as many project
 activities were institutionalized within the MOE. Moreover, the Focal Point technical
 staff for each sub-component was able to develop skills and competencies for monitoring
 and implementation of program/projects. While the MOE was held accountable for the
 project activities, the PCU was responsible for fiduciary aspects of the Project. This
 arrangement with a clear division of work allowed close coordination and effective
 collaboration between the two. The continuity of the key project members in MOE and
 PCU also ensured the smooth implementation of the Project.


                                             6
22.    The Project was designed based on rigorous studies and evidence. With
DFID funding and a PHRD Grant, preparation studies were conducted for the relevant
areas including teacher training, learning spaces, youth at risk, curriculum, school
mapping and EMIS. The access component was designed based on population study and
school mapping exercise. The quality component was also developed based on students’
performance data.

2.2 Implementation

23.      Hurricane Ivan. The Project was significantly affected by Hurricane Ivan in
2004 that significantly damaged over 85% of the school infrastructure. While hurricanes
are common in Grenada, Ivan was the worst hurricane in the last half-century and caused
damages of a significant magnitude. Education infrastructure was particularly damaged
by the Hurricane, with only 3 schools out of 77 primary and secondary schools remaining
intact; as those schools were constructed in accordance with acceptable standards.6 Given
this emergency, the priority was set on rehabilitation and re-opening of schools including
establishment of temporary classroom spaces to accommodate students in the medium
term. The Hurricane caused significant implementation delays and the Project
restructuring as explained in Section 1.7. The implementation capacity of the PMU was
heavily pressured during this emergency period, as they had to manage other donor
resources, including US$ 10M from the European Commission (EC).

24.     In addition, the Hurricane negatively impacted education outcomes due to
disruption of schooling. Dropouts from secondary school increased as some students took
advantage of increased opportunities to enter the labor market due to reconstruction, and
also due to the need to supplement family income following the aftermath of the
Hurricane.

25.      Cost increase for civil works. In addition to the damages from Hurricane Ivan,
the Project was affected by a significant increase in the cost of building materials and
labor. This was mainly due to a serious scarcity of building materials in the region. Two
fires at GBSS further contributed to increasing the cost of construction. This contributed
to an increased cost for civil work activities and reduction of scope of work originally
programmed under the Project. With the additional emergency reconstruction needs and
these cost increases, a unit cost of civil works for the targeted schools became
significantly higher than the originally planned (the actual cost was US$3,726,230
compared to the original cost of US$1,569,700 in GBSS, and US$968,531 compared to
US$367,300 in Westerhall Secondary, respectively).

  Preliminary assessment of damages in Grenada indicated that 18 out of 19 secondary schools, 55 out of
58 primary schools, national college as well as Government offices in the island suffered significant
damages. Typical losses include partial or total collapse of roof structures, collapse of walls in older
structures and rainwater damage to classrooms, offices and other structures. Aside from the structural
losses, books, lab equipment, teaching aids etc. were damaged beyond usefulness. The average level of
damage was high in the Project’s target parishes (St. Georges, St, Andres, and St. David) (World Bank,
2004).

                                                   7
26.     Procurement Issues of the Government. Planned construction at Grenville
Secondary School was not undertaken due to a procurement conflict with the National
Public Central Tenders Board. The disagreement within the Government over the lowest
bidder’s qualifications prolonged the approval process beyond the bid validity period and
annulled the initial bidding. While this was beyond the control of the MOE and the PCU,
the case was deemed a misprocurement and thus led to cancellation of US$1,078,651.69
of the loan. In addition, Government contracted only one firm to assess the damages from
Hurricane Ivan in all secondary schools in Grenada and to design all school buildings
prior to the bidding for construction. This arrangement caused a significant delay at the
assessment and design stage and prolonged the rehabilitation of target schools.

27.     Cost effectiveness in the implementation of training. The Project adopted the
option of online training instead of sending a few trainees to overseas training as
originally planned. The idea of having a resident tutor proved very helpful in providing
quick answers to questions by the trainees. This arrangement was found cost-effective
resulting in an increase in the number of trainees. Taking into account the lessons from
the previous Basic Education Reform Project, the knowledge and skills of the trained
teachers were shared and well utilized to improve the quality of education.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     Design. Data collection methods were appropriate with clear definition of
responsibility, frequency of collection, and sources of data. However, the original design
of M&E framework entailed two major issues: First, the Project relied on the data
provided by the Government although Government’s capacity for data collection and
analysis was found to be limited before the Project started. While the Project originally
incorporated the strengthening of the M&E capacity of the MOE with the development of
EMIS, this aspect was dropped during the 2004 restructuring. Second, selection of some
of the key PDO indicators and the links to the output indicators could have been clearer.
The indicators to measure quality and management objectives were neither sufficient, nor
clearly linked to the activities as explained below.

29.      For the quality objective, the use of the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC)
exam results and Gross Completion Rate in Form 5 were appropriate, but could have
been supplemented with intermediate outcome indicators more focused on the outcomes
related to Project activities. As rightly identified in the PAD as a risk from outputs to
objective, quality improvements based on curriculum changes and teaching methods is a
long-term proposition. It takes time to make an impact on the results of the CXC exam
that is taken at the end of the secondary education.

30.     For the management objective, none of the two indicators (proportion of non-
salary recurrent expenditure out of total recurrent expenditure; and pupil-teacher ratio)
were clearly linked to the intended outcome (strengthened school supervision and
management) and output or activities (establishment of district offices; training of school
administrators and educational officers in school management). In the absence of an
impact evaluation, assessment of the impact of these activities was a challenge.


                                            8
31.     Despite these issues, no revision was made to the PDO indicators during the
Project restructurings although the targets and output indicators were revised.

32.     Implementation. The MOE has been monitoring progress of the education sector
and the Project activities. It published the Education Statistical Digest in 2006 and 2010,
which contained data for all levels of the school system. Although the EMIS sub-
component was dropped at Project restructuring, there were improvements in the data
collection processes and practices with the assistance of UNESCO.

33.     Nevertheless, there were data inaccuracies in outcome data such as net enrolment
rates and gross completion rates. This is mainly due to the inaccurate population
projections at the macro level made in 2001 without any update. Lack of reliable
longitudinal data hindered the proper monitoring of Project progress, and made it
extremely difficult to measure Project achievement.

34.      Utilization. The data was utilized for updating SPEED and in the annual
budgeting process. MOE is currently working on strengthening EMIS for further
utilization of data, to monitor the impact of activities initiated under the Project and to
update SPEED in the future. Since 2011, Grenada and other OECS countries have been
participating in the training on data analysis and evidence-based policy making,
supported by the Bank’s Institutional Development Fund and implemented by the OECS
Secretariat. These efforts are expected to lead to more systematic data collection and
utilization of the results.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.     Safeguard. No environmental or social safeguard policy was triggered under the
Project. Nevertheless, the Bank’s Latin America and the Caribbean Environmental
Guidelines for Education Projects were utilized for civil works bidding and activities to
ensure that there were no negative impacts on the environment, as a result of
rehabilitation of schools or creation and use of science laboratories and LRCs.

36.     Fiduciary compliance. Overall performance in fiduciary areas was moderately
satisfactory. Despite initial problems of timeliness and quality in the preparation of
Financial Monitoring Reports and occasional delays in the submission of withdrawal
applications to the Bank, overall practice of financial management was adequate.
Procurement practices were generally conducted in accordance with Bank guidelines,
although staffing capacity posed challenges and there were some delays and a case of
misprocurement as explained in Section 2.2.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.    All the activities supported under the Project have been institutionalized and the
Ministry continues to build on these efforts to improve sector performance. The MOE is
also working on strengthening the EMIS and developing performance indicators to
monitor and measure the impact of activities initiated under the Project. Grenada
continues to participate in reviewing the OECS Education Reform Strategy that would
                                            9
guide future development of education in the sub-region. The MOE has also initiated a
review of the implementation of SPEED to guide future development of the sector for the
period 2012 – 2016.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

38.     Objectives and Design. The Project objectives and design were relevant and
consistent with the regional and country strategy and CAS at the time of appraisal, and
remain highly relevant to the development priorities of the country today. Access, quality
and management of primary and secondary education continue to be key areas of focus in
Grenada as defined in the Government’s medium-term strategy “the Revised Strategic
Plan for Educational Enhancement and Development 2006-2015 (SPEED II).? The
Project objectives and design also fit well with the Bank’s strategies: Bank’s Education
Strategy 2020 promotes the equity and quality goals with an emphasis on learning of
disadvantaged population and focuses on the areas including assessment of student
learning, governance, and school management. The Bank’s OECS Partnership Strategy
for FY10-14, which affirms the continued support to protect and improve human capital
in OECS countries, sets one of the core outcomes to increase the proportion of qualified
teachers. It also supports the Project’s sub-regional approach with country-level
customization.

39.      Implementation. The Bank’s implementation assistance was also highly relevant,
as it responded to changing needs in a timely and flexible manner. The Project
maintained its relevance to country priorities by adjusting the design and activities
through several restructurings, additional financing, and extension of the Project Closing
Date, and through more flexible procurement arrangements to facilitate reconstruction
activities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory

40.      The evaluation of the Project was a challenge due to differences in the PDO as
reflected in various parts of the PAD and the Loan Agreement (Section 1.2), quality of
data, and poor link between indicators and Project objectives and activities. The ICR
primarily uses the definition in the Loan Agreement to assess the Project in order to
reflect the changes made through the restructuring. At the same time, given the very
broad definition of PDO in the Loan Agreement in relation to the scope of the project
activities, we draw on the nuances that are highlighted in the PAD to help us identify the
details of intended outcomes. The ICR also recognizes that the indicators are more output
based rather than outcomes due to data limitations and the issue of indicators.

41.     The ICR conducted assessment for two implementation periods: post-2004
restructuring (November 2004 – October 2008) and additional financing (November 2008
– Closing). The assessment for the pre-2004 restructuring period (January 2004 –

                                           10
October 2004) was not conducted since Project activities had barely started with only
US$290,000 or 3.26% of project funds disbursed when the restructuring took place.

Assessment 1 - Post-2004 Restructuring (November 2004 – October 2008):
Moderately Satisfactory

42.     The assessment for this period was conducted against the revised PDO (objective
1) and the revised outcome and output indicators. See Annex 3 for a complete list of
indicators and a summary of outputs and impacts.

Objective 1 (Revised): Increase Equitable Access to Secondary Education, including
replacing and rehabilitating secondary schools damaged by the passage of Hurricane
Ivan on September 7, 2004 – Achieved

43.      This objective was to be measured by (i) transition rate to secondary education
(measured by the following: (a) in proportion to Grade 6 students; (b) in proportion to students
sitting the Common Entrance Exam; (c) based on students sitting the CEE in the 3 underserved
parishes of St. Andrew, St. David and St. George) and (ii) net enrolment rate at the secondary
level. The transition rates to secondary education in the proportion to Grade 6 students,
students sitting the CEE, and students sitting CEE in three underserved areas all increased
from 78%, 52.1%, 53.5% in 2004 to 85%, 67%, 63% in 2008 respectively, although the
targets were not met. However, the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) dropped from 68.4% to
62.7% during the same period.7

44.     Given other interventions, it is difficult to determine the Project’s contribution to
the increase of transition rates. Nevertheless, the objective to increase equitable access
was fully achieved during the post Hurricane Ivan reconstruction period as evidenced by
(i) decongesting of the two schools that were expanded under the Project and (ii) the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of secondary schools damaged by Hurricane Ivan.

45.    The Project created an additional 420 places in two secondary schools by the
beginning of school year 2008/09. The expansion of classrooms helped to reduce
overcrowding since both schools had excessive enrollment before the expansion. In
2003/04, for instance, enrolment in GBSS was 804 compared to the original capacity of
700, and 496 in Westerhall compared to 320 original capacity. The ICR mission
confirmed that the constructed spaces are fully utilized to implement the curriculum and
student support activities. In addition, a Learning Resource Center and two science
laboratories were built and equipped in GBSS and well utilized by teachers and students.

46.    In addition, the Project successfully supported rehabilitation of GBSS and
Westerhall Secondary, as well as the designing and supervision of civil works for eight
secondary schools that had been damaged by Hurricane Ivan. The rehabilitation of these
schools facilitated recovery from the Hurricane and reopening of schools earlier than it


7
  The decline in NER is in line with the general trend in the OECS. At the same time, this result could have
also been affected by inaccurate population projections.

                                                    11
would have been without Project support, benefiting approximately 4,300 students,
exceeding the target of 2,000.

Objective 2: Improve the quality and efficiency of secondary education – Partially
achieved

47.     This objective was to be measured by (i) Gross completion rate in Form 5 and (ii)
the proportion of students passing 5 CXC exams including Math and English. The CXC
pass rates slightly increased from 12.6% in 2004 to 13.8% in 2008. On the other hand,
Gross Completion Rate declined from 97% in 2004 to 70.0% in 2008.

48.      Given the critical impact of Hurricane Ivan on educational outcomes (Section 2.2)
and the issues associated with the PDO indicators (Section 2.3), project achievement
cannot be measured by the above PDO indicators. In addition, other reform initiatives
supported by Government and other donors (curriculum review, teacher training, literacy
and numeracy programs) were also taking place in the sector which could have affected
the CXC results. Therefore, the ICR examines the outputs and the observed impact of
activities that were carried out during this period to assess the achievement of this
objective.8 The objective to improve the quality and efficiency of secondary education
was partially achieved during the post Hurricane Ivan reconstruction period as evidenced
by achievements related to (i) curriculum reform, (ii) the upgrading of teacher skills, (iii)
student assessment and (iv) student support.

49.     Curriculum reform. The Project made a significant contribution to curriculum
reform despite delays due to the focus on rehabilitation and expansion of schools due to
Hurricane Ivan. Literacy and numeracy policies were developed in collaboration with
other OECS countries, and incorporated into the national curriculum policy. Other
subject policies were also developed for newly introduced subjects such as Modern
Languages, Creative and Performing Arts and Dance, and ICT. The new curriculum
policy was officially introduced in school in September 2008. In addition, the Project
provided: (i) training workshops for key stakeholders in the implementation of the new
curriculum; (ii) training workshops for literacy and numeracy coordinators in all primary
and secondary schools; (iii) training for two teachers in Performing Arts at degree level,
though not three as planned, who were deployed to teach dance classes in selected
secondary schools. The new curriculum is better aligned with sub-regional CXC
curriculum, better reflects the changing demands of the labor market, and meets
diversified learning needs of students. Focus group discussions with teachers indicate that
the new subjects serve to enhance creativity of students, and provide opportunities for
disadvantaged students.

50.   Upgrading Teacher skills. The Project made a significant contribution to
improving quality of teaching process by supporting teacher training in planned areas.


8
  The ICR mission was conducted in 2011 to assess the outcomes of activities for the whole project period.
The assessment 1 utilizes the observed impact and information collected during the ICR mission for the
activities implemented during the first assessment period.

                                                   12
During this period, the Project supported training for 20 technical education teachers to
upgrade their skills including pedagogy and the delivery of subject matter. Focus group
discussions with the trained teachers indicate their greatly enhanced capacity to deal with
students with a wider range of learning needs and abilities. In addition, the Project helped
to enhance quality of teaching through improved teacher education. By providing training
for teacher educators, the Project strengthened the capacity of T.A. Marryshow
Community College (TAMCC), the local teacher training college, to train a large number
of teachers in a wider range of subject areas. External assessors have provided positive
feedback to TAMCC on the quality of its current graduates in the areas where trained
tutors were deployed. The Project also helped to create a model classroom at TAMCC by
providing necessary materials and equipment required for teacher training.

51.     The knowledge and skills of returned fellows supported by the Project were also
well utilized and making a positive impact on teaching and learning in different
capacities. For instance, a fellow in Mathematics was deployed at MOE and conducted
training workshops with teachers and launched a number of innovative activities to raise
the profile of Mathematics in Grenada. Focus group discussions and interviews with
students indicate that these initiatives strengthened students’ interest in the subject and
their motivations for learning.

52.    Student Assessment. Good progress was made in introduction of assessment. A
Minimum Competency Test (MCT) was strengthened in 2008 and now conducted
annually for Grades 2, 4, 5, and the results are analyzed and used to tailor support to
ensure that students enter secondary education with stronger skills. A handbook for
continuous assessment was developed and printed, and teachers were trained in the use of
continuous assessment.

53.      Student Support. The Project helped to enhance student support services by
supporting a Textbook rental program, training of assistance guidance counselors, and
peer counseling program. Approximately 3,000 needy students were supported by the
Textbook rental scheme, which was expanded to a National Textbook Program in 2008.
Training of 37 assistance guidance counselors enabled the MOE to place them at all of 19
secondary schools. In addition, Peer counseling program was developed and 350 students
were trained as peer helpers. The deployment of guidance counselors and peer helpers
helps identify and resolve the issues among students on an ongoing basis. Co-curricular
activities were also designed and implemented by students in 25 schools, exceeding the
target of 19.

Objective 3: Strengthen management of the sector and governance of schools –
Partially Achieved

54.     This objective was to be measured by (i) Proportion of non-salary recurrent
expenditure out of total recurrent expenditure, and (ii) Pupil-Teacher ratio. However,
these indicators are not directly linked to the Project’s interventions and thus shed little
light on Project achievements, as indicated in Section 2.3. Therefore, the ICR rating takes
into account the outputs and progress made in the key associated outcomes. The objective

                                            13
to strengthen sector management and governance of schools was partially achieved
during the post Hurricane Ivan reconstruction period as evidenced by progress made in
school supervision and management and capacity building.

55.    The Project made a significant contribution to strengthening school supervision
and management through establishing District Education Offices. Seven district offices
were established by 2008 and staffed with trained district education officers, curriculum
development officers, guidance counselors, and Early Childhood education officers.
Focus group discussions with stakeholders indicate that the district offices have proved to
be a useful link between the MOE and schools, providing a support network for schools
in each district, facilitating knowledge sharing, and providing on-the-job training for
school principals and teachers. It was also noted that these offices serve as a key focal
point to involve technical staff and various local stakeholders such as community
members, parents, and social workers to discuss and address any relevant educational
matters.

56.    The Project also helped to enhance school-based management capacity by (i)
providing training to stakeholders in school management skills, including the preparation
of school development plans, (ii) establishing multi-stakeholder school improvement
teams, and (iii) supporting school improvement projects (SIPs). Each school now
prepares a three-year development plan based on a self-assessment. SIPs were designed
and implemented in schools. Focus group discussions with school principals indicate that
the planning and self evaluation process has helped them to undertake more systematic
planning to focus on weak areas.

Assessment 2 – Additional Financing (November 2008 – Closing): Satisfactory

57.     The assessment for this period was conducted based on the revised project
indicators for additional financing. As the additional financing was provided only for the
quality and management enhancement activities, the assessment for the first objective is
not applicable for this period.

Objective 2: Improve the quality and efficiency of secondary education – Achieved

58.     During this assessment period, the proportion of students passing at least 5 CXC
including Math and English increased from 13.8% in 2008 to 19% in 2010, falling short
of the target by 1%. On the other hand, Gross Completion Rate declined from 70.0% in
2008 to 62.2% in 2011. However, the ICR team cannot determine the Project contribution
to the improvement of CXC results as other reform initiatives supported by Government
and other donors were also taking place in the sector which could have improved the
CXC results. In addition, it is too early to observe the impact of activities implemented
during this period on learning outcomes. As in the case of the first assessment, the ICR
uses the project outputs and observed impact to assess the achievement of this objective.

59.     Literacy and Numeracy Initiatives. The Project further contributed to
strengthening literacy and numeracy by training teachers and instructional support. A

                                            14
total of 84 teachers were trained in literacy or numeracy at degree level, exceeding the
target of 60. 158 teachers were also trained in literacy and numeracy through in-country
training workshop as planned. Focus group discussions with the trained teachers indicate
their greatly enhanced capacity to deal with students with a wider range of learning needs
and abilities. They noted improvements in pedagogy, assessment, attitude toward poorly
performing students, and confidence in teaching and supporting other teachers. The
positive effect of the trained teachers was also strongly echoed during focus group
discussion with students, school principals and education officers; these teachers are
identifying and supporting weaker students more effectively and contributing to
increasing students’ interest. The educational resources were also developed or acquired
to enhance the teaching of Math and Language Arts. Furthermore, a framework for
supporting literacy and numeracy has been strengthened to make more coordinated effort
to improve learning, through the establishment of Literacy teams or associations of Math
teachers at district level. .

60.    Instructional Support Materials. The Project helped to enhance capacity of the
MOE in producing instructional materials by providing the equipment to MOE’s Material
Production Unit and training to the unit staff. This has greatly improved the efficiency in
providing a large amount of materials to schools.

61.    Upgrading teacher skills. The Project continued to support training for technical
teachers in secondary schools. A total of 31 teachers were trained at Diploma level,
meeting the target of 30.

62.     Student support. The Project further strengthened student support through training
and strategically deploying guidance counselors. 20 teachers were trained in guidance
and counseling at BA level as planned, and 14 at MA level exceeding the target of 5.
Focus group discussions with education officers, school principals and counselors
indicate that the quality of delivery of counseling services has greatly improved with
better identification of problems and understanding of issues faced by students. They
reported that more students are utilizing the services, and a positive impact has been
observed in student behavior, including increased attendance, reduction in school
violence and the number of students on suspension. Focus Group discussions with
student leaders confirm usefulness of counselors, including reduction in incidences of
student fights in school due to the preventive role played by counselors.

Objective 3: Strengthen management of the sector and governance of schools –
Achieved

63.    As previously mentioned, the proportion of non-salary recurrent expenditure and
the Pupil to teacher ratio were not used to assess the project achievement, but drawn upon
the outputs and observed impact.

64.     During this assessment period, further training was conducted to facilitate the
implementation of continuous assessment. A total of 361 educational professionals were
trained in the area of Continuous Assessment, including 75 Heads of Departments, 100

                                            15
Principals and District Teams members and 186 teachers. By the time of project
completion, continuous assessment had been firmly introduced in all schools. A student
activity coordinator was appointed in the MOE to facilitate the student-led activities. A
Train the Trainers Resource Manual for Secondary Schools Student Councils was
developed, and the Constitution for Student Council of Secondary Schools was revised.
Student councils have been set up in some school at the time of Project completion, and
approximately 100 students were trained as council members. Focus group discussions
with a group of trained students indicated that the training they received equipped them
with organizational skills, including time management and decision making. Students
also expressed confidence in using the communication skills, developed during training,
to effectively pass on information as well as guide and support other students.

65.     Based on the first and second assessments, the overall achievement of project
objective is rated moderately satisfactory as summarized in Table 3.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

66.     Economic rate of return. The economic analysis that was developed at Project
preparation was well done and based on assumptions that were realistic in 2003. The
hurricane and subsequent economic volatility led to major changes in the Project and the
Project’s economic costs and benefits. An ex-post economic analysis shows that the
Project’s economic rate of return (ERR) was 15 percent and the Net Present Value (NVP)
was US$3.68 million, compared to 30 percent and US$17.2 million respectively in the
PAD. This sensitivity analysis shows that the results are dependent on assumptions on the
value of education quality on income and economic growth. This proves high efficiency
since only 35.6% of original cost was spent on the quality component. The bulk of the
Project was transferred to school reconstruction, which likely had a high short term
benefit.

67.     Cost effectiveness of Project activities. Measuring the cost-effectiveness of the
Project by comparing the original estimates and the actual expenses for each component
is not adequate due to the significant changes in the Project design during implementation.
However, some cost-effective measures were taken for implementing training activities
under Component 2. The online option of training of literacy and numeracy teachers and


9
    A remaining 3 percent was disbursed between the project effectiveness and the 2004 restructuring.

                                                     16
guidance counselors reduced the unit cost of training, at one third of the cost of training
abroad (US$6,900 compared to US$23,600). The savings were used to train more
teachers, allowing the MOE to place trained teachers and counselors in every secondary
school and some primary schools. The Project strengthened the Ministry’s in-house
capacity to produce instructional materials for use in schools through upgrading
equipment and staff training for the Materials Production Unit. This enhanced capacity
has helped to make significant savings in cost and time in providing a large amount of
materials to schools. For example, printing 200 teachers’ manuals that would cost
EC$50,000 if outsourced now costs EC$ 30,000, all costs inclusive. The civil works were
carried out at a higher cost than planned, due to cost increase. The unit cost for target
schools increased from US$1,569,700 to US$3,726,230 in GBSS and from US$367,300
to US$968,531 in Westerhall Secondary. The delays in the evaluation and approval of
bids also slowed the pace of implementation and resulted in an extension to the Project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.      The overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory based on: the Project’s
continued high relevance to the country priorities and Bank strategies; significant
contribution towards improvement of access, quality and management of education;
modest level of efficiency; and moderate shortcomings in the accomplishment of project
activities and achieving targets.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69.    The Project did not include a specific measurement of impact on poverty.
However, it targeted students from low-income families through the textbook rental
program, which initially supported 3,000 needy students and later scaled up to cover all
students. The Project was also designed to expand the schools that serve a large number
of students from low income families. The new curriculum was also designed to meet
more diversified learning needs of disadvantaged students.

70.    The Project was also designed to promote the participation and empowerment of
students. Traditionally, schools were very hierarchical and students were not active in
school. The Project initiated steps to change this culture through the establishment of
student councils, implementation of peer counseling, and development and
implementation of student-led co-curricular activities. The stakeholder interviews with
students showed their highly positive responses and enthusiasm toward these initiatives.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.     The improvement of institutional capacity of the education sector is one of the
key outcomes of the Project. As explained in detail in Section 3.2, the school
management system has been improved with the increased capacity at district and school
level. Student councils were also established. Enhanced capacity of TAMCC allows the

                                              17
training for a larger numbers of teachers. Finally, capacity development of the Material
Production Unit in MOE greatly increased efficiency in the production of instructional
materials.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

72.    Through the implementation of Grenada OEDP, an on-line program for literacy
and numeracy was developed. This program is now offered by University of West Indies
and benefits other countries throughout the Caribbean.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

73.    The assessment of risk to development outcome is rated as moderate, based on the
assessment of overall risk and risk to each development outcome as described below.

74.      Overall, Government has consistently shown a high level of commitment to
education reform. The SPEED II reiterates Government commitment to reforms and
initiatives addressed under the Project, and many of activities have been institutionalized
under the strong leadership of the MOE. There is also a sufficient consensus for the need
for education reform among the stakeholders. This strong commitment and support would
help mitigate the financial risk, which is still persistent due to a negative impact of the
global financial crisis since 2008. The MOE is also pursuing some measures to improve
the efficiency aspect such as multi-grade teaching.

75.     Access. A framework for maintenance of school infrastructure has been put in
place. The MOE developed a school infrastructure assessment form and provides a
monthly maintenance allowance of EC$300 to each school. In addition, all the newly
rehabilitated school buildings after the Hurricane were built hurricane-proof. This would
mitigate the risk of natural disasters from high to moderate.

76.     Quality. Many of the quality enhancement activities initiated under the Project
including literacy and numeracy programs, guidance and counseling programs,
curriculum development, student assessment have been institutionalized. The textbook
rental program to support disadvantaged students was expanded into a National Textbook
Program. It covers all students with a minimal user fee to help ensure sustainability of the
program, with the disadvantaged students exempted. At the same time, relatively high
teacher turnover particularly at the secondary level could reduce the impact of the Project
in the medium- and long-term. In order to mitigate the risk, the Government continues to
train teachers and school administrators. It also plans to review teacher incentives and
innovative ways to ensure that teachers are supported and rewarded appropriately.

77.      Management and School Governance. The district education offices have been
institutionalized within the MOE. At the same time, the accountability framework of the

                                            18
school management system would require further training and clarification of roles and
responsibilities for various actors. Government plans to undertake further training for
school administrators, education officers and teachers to ensure that there remains a cadre
of staff to assume leadership roles in school development. Shortage of resources poses a
risk to implementation of school improvement plans, as these plans depend on fund
raising by schools.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78.     The Bank team collaborated well with the Government and other donor partners
in designing the Project. The team jointly identified the key sector issues, and provided
adequate inputs based on evidence. The team took into consideration lessons from
previous projects and elsewhere. It also utilized a PHRD fund to support background
studies to inform the Project design. This resulted in a Project that was responsive to
Government’s priorities.

79.    However, the design of the monitoring and evaluation framework had significant
shortcomings and could have been improved to include intermediate outcome indicators
and a better link between Project activities and objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     Overall, the Bank’s assistance was highly responsive to the needs of the
Government, as most evident in the three-time restructuring of the Project. Following
Hurricane Ivan, the Bank quickly responded by shifting resources to support high priority
areas and adjusted the financing and procurement arrangements to better accommodate
the client’s needs. Once reconstruction efforts were completed, the Bank provided
additional financing to implement activities curtailed when the Project was restructured
following Hurricane Ivan. The Bank also showed concerted effort in supporting the
reconstruction process by ensuring close collaboration with other Bank-supported
projects, and by administering the European Commission (EC) fund of US$10 million for
school reconstruction.

81.    The Bank team maintained close working relationships with the Government and
other donor counterparts, was readily available for assistance throughout the Project, and
provided timely support to the client including on financial or disbursement matters.
Bank supervision missions were conducted twice a year, and closely monitored
implementation progress. Its inputs and processes were adequate with sufficient support
and direction to the client. The supervision documents were overall well organized,
provided detailed information on implementation progress, and helped the clients to plan
adequately for future activities. The team was also proactive in facilitating cross-country

                                            19
learning by conducting sub-regional workshops and organizing a study tour. In addition,
the Bank team’s consistent effort to strengthen monitoring and evaluation of the Project
interventions helped to focus on this aspect among the clients. The Bank was proactive
in supporting capacity to improve data collection and analysis with the support of IDF
Grant.

82.      At the same time, Bank team could have provided leadership to revise the
project’s results framework during the Project to better align PDO indicators with Project
activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on: close
collaboration with the client during Project preparation, inputs from the background
studies and lessons learned; responsive implementation assistance to meet the client’s
needs; strong technical support through training and supervision; facilitation of
knowledge sharing among OECS countries; and significant shortcomings in the design of
the results framework.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     Government constantly showed a strong commitment to education reform and the
Project. Although its financial obligation was reduced during the emergency situation
following Hurricane Ivan, the Government made counterpart funds available despite
financial constraints. When the expansion of Grenville Secondary school could no longer
be carried out under the Project, the Government identified alternative facilities to
accommodate students and secured funding for construction of permanent structures.

85.     At the same time, there were some procurement issues that affected the Project
outcome as mentioned in Section 2.2. There were also some delays in the evaluation and
approval of bids, which affected the pace of implementation and resulted in an extension
to the Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

86.      The MOE’s strong ownership and staff continuity throughout the Project
preparation and implementation as well as the effective implementation arrangement of
the MOE and PCU were critical factors for the successful completion and
institutionalization of Project activities. Despite a shifting of funds towards civil works
following Hurricane Ivan, the MOE maintained a strong focus on development objectives
including the improvement of quality of teaching and learning as evident by their pursuit
of these activities in the reconstruction period following Hurricane Ivan and their request
for additional financing to implement the quality-enhancement activities. Project

                                            20
outcomes were also enhanced by the MOE’s decision to adopt a cost effective training
scheme and strategic deployment of trained personnel to ensure their better utilization in
the education sector.

87.    The MOE also managed the additional responsibilities created by an influx of
resources to address the post-Hurricane Ivan emergency situation. This, however, posed a
challenge in project implementation and affected timely decision-making. There were
some occasional delays in fiduciary documents.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.    The overall Borrower’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory based on the
following: strong ownership and commitment of MOE throughout the preparation and
implementation; institutionalization of many initiatives; effective implementation
arrangements; cost-effective measures for the training of personnel; availability of
counterpart funds despite the financial constraints; fiduciary shortcomings .

6. Lessons Learned

89.     Results framework with a clear link between Outputs and Outcomes. The
link between Project’s activities and some outcome indicators was not clearly addressed.
As a result, these indicators could not adequately measure the achievements or progress
made. To maintain the focus on Project Development Objectives during the
implementation and to clearly address how different activities and components fit
together, a well-defined results framework is critical. This framework should articulate
the link between outputs and outcomes, by setting intermediate indicators which
adequately measure the interim changes toward achieving the objectives.

90.    Impact evaluation as part of designing activity. The planned evaluation of the
counseling program as well as other training activities could not take place due to
shortage of resources. Without systematic impact evaluation in place, it was very difficult
to measure the effectiveness of training and actual outcome of the programs. It confirms
the importance of including an impact evaluation in the design of projects. The cost
associated with evaluation of the activities should also be budgeted for. .

91.    An online learning course as an effective tool for teacher training. The Project
used online learning courses to train teachers and guidance counselors. This training
afforded teachers an opportunity to immediately put into practice the concepts they
learned and therefore could easily relate to school realities. Online training saved the
Government additional costs of travel abroad and a substitute teacher incurred if a
substantive teacher goes away for training. . While this could be strengthened by
presence of a resident tutor, online training has proved to be an effective and efficient
way of improving teacher quality.

92.     Continuity from preparation to implementation. A technical staff member in
MOE was appointed as a focal point for each component, under which they were
responsible for designing, costing, and implementing the activities. Involvement of
Ministry staff in the project design process translated into higher commitment and
leadership of the individual units. It created greater ownership and enhanced
sustainability of project activities. Creating such a mechanism within the Government
that ensures their continuous engagement would greatly enhance project effectiveness.

93.     Flexibility in Bank assistance. The Project underwent three restructurings during
the life of the project. The team adjusted the Project to Government’s changing needs
under emergency circumstances, and provided critical assistance in a timely manner. This
flexible approach to project implementation received high commendation from
Government and increased effectiveness of the Bank assistance. While keeping the focus
on project development objectives, it is critical to allow flexibility in readjusting to the
changing priority of the country during implementation particularly under uncertain
circumstances.

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project’s economic analysis consists of cost-benefit analysis (contained in Annex 4
of the Project Appraisal Document) and financial analysis (contained in Annex 5).
Together they showed that, based on the conditions at the time of appraisal, the project
was a good investment from an economic point of view and is sustainable after World
Bank financing. This section reviews these results by examining both the initial
assumptions in the economic analysis and the impact of changing economic variables on
the Project.

   A. Cost Benefit Analysis

The cost-benefit analysis that was developed during project preparation relied on
standard techniques, under the assumption that the Project increases both the education
achievement (by reducing the dropout rate) and education quality (as measured by
increased pass rates on the Caribbean Standard Examination). The increase in both the
quantity and quality of graduates were expected to increase wages and lifetime income,
which is treated as the benefit here. The base case estimate is for a relatively high rate of
return of 30 percent (69 percent due to the increase in quality and 31 percent due to the
increase in graduation). Following best practices, the cost-benefit analysis carries out a
sensitivity analysis that shows relatively high rates of return (around 25 percent) under a
variety of economic conditions. The original estimates show that the Project is quite
robust to economic shocks; for example, it would take an unemployment rate of nearly 60
percent to drive the Project’s rate of return down to 0.

Conditions changed substantially since project approval. First, Grenada was hit by
Hurricane Ivan in 2004. This was the first hurricane to hit Grenada since 1955 and it
damaged more than 90 percent of infrastructure. Most schools were rendered unsafe and
inoperable. Second, the Grenadian economy was severely hit by the global recession in
2007 and 2008. In response to the hurricane, the project was changed dramatically to
repair and rebuild damaged schools. Thus, the Project Development Objective and the
indicators were modified to reflect this change. In economic terms, the Project saw a
significant reallocation of resources towards the reconstruction of schools and away from
the original activities planned in the PAD.

The economic analysis here reflects the changes in the Project design due to the hurricane.
The economic analysis relies on the best data available; however there is little updated
information on labor markets. The economic analysis looks at three primary activities:
hurricane reconstruction (part of component 1, after the project was restructured),
improving access (the original component 1), and improving quality (component 2,
additional financing). The main assumptions used in the analysis are:

      The reconstruction of the schools allowed the beneficiary students to return to
       class one year earlier than they would have otherwise without the project. In other
       words, the Project brought students back to schools earlier. This implies earlier

                                             26
       graduation than would have occurred otherwise and earlier entry in the labor force.
       This is calculated by assuming that the amount of schooling that students receive
       (on average) increases by 0.5 years. The total benefit is calculated by multiplying
       the number of students by the average gain by the incremental gain in lifetime
       income.

      Although most of Component 1 was directed to supporting the efforts to rebuild
       the damaged school, the Project did continue to make efforts to expand the
       coverage in several schools. Although resources were less than originally planned,
       this effort was partially successful with an increase in secondary enrollment. It is
       likely that the bigger facility will continue to have a positive impact on enrollment
       in the future, albeit a level that is less than originally projected. The benefits from
       this investment is calculated in a similar fashion as in the original calculation,
       albeit with a lower baseline.

      The project continued to focus on quality, although this component was execute
       with fewer funds and later than originally planned. The economic analysis takes
       this delay and reduction in funds into account by reducing the benefit associated
       with quality and having the impact of quality accruing later in the project cycle
       due to additional financing.

Table 1 outlines the main results of the economic analysis. The net present value was
calculated at 5 percent discount rate. The estimates show that the three main activities all
had positive rates of return. Restoring the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane
brought significant short term benefit to the Grenada education system as it allowed
students to quickly return to school. Without the project, schools would have been rebuilt
at a slower pace. This investment in rebuilding schools accounted for 28 percent of the
project’s total benefit and 10 percent of the project’s net present value (NPV). In other
words, while this new activity was relatively expensive, its net benefit was relatively low.

The original investment under component 1 (focusing on expanding coverage) was
reduced and thus had less impact than expected. Its impact will largely be felt after the
project closes. It accounts for 12 percent of the project’s total benefit and 13 of the
project’s NPV.

Finally, as envisioned in the project design, the investment in quality continues to have
the largest economic impact. Even the expenditure for quality was reduced, it is still
accounts for 77 percent of total benefit and 60 of total NPV. The overall rate of return is
estimated to be 15 percent, which reflects the reduction of expenditures in high return,
long term investments in favor of activities with a more short term focus

Note: NPV means net present value, calculated with a 5 percent discount rate. IRR means internal rate of return.

 It is important to note that these estimates only focus on the project’s impact on future
 income. The Project likely had a significant social impact that is not captured by this
 estimate. In particular, the quick restoration of schools is likely to have contributed to
 economic growth and social cohesion. Likewise increasing quality and secondary
 enrollment is likely to have contributed to social cohesion and possibly to private sector
 development. All of these factors are likely to increase the project’s economic impact.
 The lack of data makes it difficult to quantify these impacts.

 Since most of the Project’s net present value is largely driven by increasing quality, the
 economic impact is most sensitive to changes in the assumption about the value of quality.
 If the secondary premium due to the project dropped from US$500 per graduate to
 US$205, the rate of return for Component 2 would drop to 0 percent and the overall rate
 of return for the project would be reduced to 4 percent. Reducing the discount rate tends
 to increase the relative importance of activities under Component 1 although this impact
 is relatively small.

      B. Financial Sustainability

 Annex 5 includes an analysis of the financial sustainability of the project, focusing on the
 country’s capacity to continue the program and service the loan. Overall, economic
 performance in Grenada has been “bumpy? with the average growth rate between 2003 to
 2010 of 2.0 percent, compared to 3.0 percent as originally projected in the PAD. The
 government has ensured that education spending has remained strong despite the
 slowdown in growth and the education budget has been largely protected.

 An analysis of financial sustainability requires a comparison of the fiscal situation with
 an without the project. The restructuring of the loan has led to a bigger project and thus to
 bigger debt to repay. However, without the debt, the Government would have spent
 substantially to restore schools albeit at a slower pace than without the Project. As the
 project evolved, the Government effectively reallocated IBRD debt for IDA, Although
 the total size of the debt increased, the total repayment only increased by an estimated
 $50,000 per year over the amount without the restructuring. The cost of servicing the debt
 will account for around 3.5 percent of the total capital budget for education and around
 0.5 percent of the total Government capital budget. This is not a burden for the country,
 given the need to rebuild schools and the relatively good returns from the original
 components. At the same time, the restructuring also reduced significantly the future
 recurrent costs associated with the project. These costs more than offset the small
 increase in the annual financing cost of the debt.

1.1 INTRODUCTION

This final Evaluation Report on the Grenada OECS Education Development Project
[OEDP] was prepared in fulfillment of the Government of Grenada’s [the Borrower]
responsibility towards the preparation of the project Implementation Completion Report
[ICR]. In accordance with the requirements of the ICR, the report includes an assessment
of the project’s objectives, design, implementation, operational experience and an
evaluation of the Borrowers’ and financiers’ performance in the development and
implementation of the project.

1.1 PROJECT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The OEDP was part of a horizontal multi-country Adaptive Programme Lending [APL]
established in 2002 as a new strategy to work with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States [OECS]. On June 27th 2003 the World Bank Board approved the Loan and Credit
Agreements in the amount of US$4.0 million and SDR2.9 million [US$4.0 million
equivalent] for a total of US$8.0million and the project became effective on January 28 th,
2004. The United Kingdom’s Department for International Development [DFID]
provided US$0.8 million in parallel financing towards the project. The original closing
date of the project was September 30th 2007. The closing date for the project was revised
on two [2] occasions: initially to June 30th, 2008 and then to December 2008 to allow for
the completion of civil works. On 25th February 2009 the World Bank Board approved
the Credit Agreements in the amount of US$1.3 million as additional financing for the
project to assist in the financing of some activities that was scaled down when the project
was restructured during November 2004. The additional financing extended the project
by a further thirty months [30] to a new closing date of June 30th 2011.

The overall development objective of the horizontal APL program was to build human
capital in the OECS which was projected to contribute to the diversification and
sustainability of the economies of the project countries. Specifically, it was also agreed
that this broad objective be achieved by: (1) increasing equitable access to secondary
education;(2) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more
direct interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on student
centered learning and various mechanisms to provide student support, and (3)
strengthening management of the sector and governance of the schools with special
emphasis being placed on literacy and numeracy.

In September 2004, eight [8] months within project implementation, Hurricane Ivan hit
Grenada which resulted in widespread destruction to the education sector but more
specifically to the school’s infrastructure, school materials and equipment. On November
16th, 2004, the original project developed was restructured to address emergency civil
works which emerged as a result of the devastation caused by Hurricane Ivan. However,
there was the absence of a project restructuring paper. The first project objective was
revised to include replacement and rehabilitation of secondary schools damaged by the

                                            33
passage of the hurricane, and significant portion of the Loan and Credit was reallocated
to finance this task.    The other two objectives of the project however, remained
unchanged, but the expected outcomes were significantly scaled down and the activities
were financed mainly by the DFID Grant before the additional financing was provided.

The OEDP Project was designed with strategies that are reminiscent of lessons learnt
from the implementation of the Basic Education Reform Project [BERP] and the
Strategic Plan for Educational Enhancement and Development [SPEED] which was
developed following wide spread stakeholders participation. The project aimed to assist
the Government of Grenada in implementing the sector plan and achieving the goals in
the SPEED by providing technical and financial support for a set of initiatives. These
included: (1) providing more equitable access to secondary education; [2] improving
completion rates by providing better quality teachers, school resources, emphasizing
literacy and numeracy skills among others.

 At the attainment of project effectiveness the implementation of the OEDP was managed
by the Ministry’s Project Management Unit (PMU) with provisions for monitoring that
involve the World Bank. In the case of the DFID funded activities the PMU liaised with
the London based Crown Agents, Cambridge Education Consultants (CEC) who did the
procurement of consultants and managed the technical assistance inputs. In November
2005, the implementation arrangements for the OEDP were changed. A new PCU was
established under the Ministry of Finance to oversee all donor- funded projects, and the
staff from the MOE’s Project Management Unit was transferred to that new Unit.

1.2 PROJECT COMPONENTS
The project had four components [4],viz;
[1] Increasing Equitable Access.
[2] Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning.
[3] Strengthening Governance and Management
[4] Project Management.

INCREASING EQUITABLE ACCESS.

Under the original designed of the project, this component was expected to expand access
to secondary education through the provision of additional spaces at the secondary school
level in the parishes of St. David, St. Andrew and St. George. It was expected that a total
of 520 additional spaces would have been created by 2008 in the following schools: [1] in
Grenada Boys Secondary School, adding 200 additional spaces; [2] in Westerhall
secondary, adding 200 new places; and [3] Grenville Secondary, adding 120 new places.
It was also expected that civil works would have been conducted to expand and improve
the existing schools facilities and the acquisition of furniture and equipment.

The objectives of this component was revised following Hurricane Ivan were to: [a]
increase equitable access to secondary education, including replacing and rehabilitating
secondary schools damaged by the passage of Hurricane Ivan on September 7, 2004.



                                            34
No further change was made to this component when the additional resources were made
available.


IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

As agreed during the original project design, this component was intended to improve
quality of teaching and learning through: [1] development of all curriculum policies,
[2] training workshops for all principals, teachers and supervisors in the implementation
of the new curriculum,[3] overseas or distance training for four [4] teachers in two-year
programs in creative and performing arts, Learning Enhancement and Achievements
Programmes [LEAP], [5] Programme to enhance numeracy, [6] EXCEL Summer School,
[7] Creation of Learning Resource Centers [LRCs] in four secondary schools, [8],
Upgrading of science laboratories in 11 secondary schools, based on international
standards, [9] printing of new curricula and manual for science labs for dissemination to
all relevant users, [10] local training for 250 classroom teachers and 28 technical teachers
to the certificate level, 11] distance training for 40 technical teachers at the technical level,
[12] Overseas training for four special education teachers to the degree level, [13]
overseas training for four technical teachers, provision of a model classroom with
computers and equipment, [14] the provision of software to strengthen the processing of
test scores and student assessment, [15] training in early detection of learning difficulties
and Continuous Assessment Skills, workshops in math and language skills and the
development and printing of handbooks for teachers on Continuous Assessment, [16]
textbook rental scheme programme, [17] training for guidance Counselors, Peer
counseling and mentorship program and a student-led co-curricular activities.
During the project restricting held in November 2004 this component was significantly
scaled down. However, through the additional resources provided for the project the
following activities were included: teaching training in literacy and numeracy for 60
teachers, the provision of instructional support materials, technical and vocation training
for secondary school teachers and training in school counseling to counselors and
assistant counselors.

STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

This component was expected to [1] establish seven district education offices in schools,
[2] equip and furnish the DEOs, [3] provide training for members of the supervision
teams, [4] training in the preparation of school development plans,[5] and financing of
school improvement plan as well as provision of an education management information
system. When the project was restricted the provision of the education management
information system was omitted. Through the additional financing the project provided
financing for school principals, vice principals and district management teams to ensure
support for implementation of literacy and numeracy programs in the classroom.




                                              35
PROJECT MANAGEMENT

This component continued to sphere the coordination and implementation arrangements
of the project.

1.2 FINANCING

The original OEDP project was financed by a Credit of US$2.9 million from the
International Development Association [CR3809-GRD] a loan of US$4.0 million from
the international Bank for reconstruction and development [World Bank] [LN 7187-
GRD]. A Grant from the United kingdom Department for International Development
[DFID] in the amount of US$0.8 million and a contribution from the Government of
Grenada of US$2.5 million. When the project was restructured in November 2004 the
government of Grenada contribution towards the project was revised to US$0.05 million.
Additional financing was made available to the project in the amount of US$1.9 million
through a Credit from the International Development Association. The original project
agreement was signed on 27th June 2003 and became effective on 24th January 2004.

2. QUALITY AT ENTRY

The overall Quality at entry can be described as satisfactory.

The development objective set for the project was relevant and appropriate to Grenada’s
needs and specific objectives were consistent with the identified needs of the Grenada’s
education sector and with the sectoral development strategy pursued by the GOG as
outlined in the Strategic Plan for Educational Enhancement and development. The project
components were also consistent with the identified priorities and needs of the education
sector. Some of the lessons learnt during the implementation of the Basic Education
Reform Project were incorporated in an effort to ensure that areas of priority were
adequately addressed.

The project was developed with excellent stakeholders participation and as a result of
such there exited greater ownership for the project throughout implementation. The PMU
was staffed with well trained and experienced personnel. The phasing of the project
activities was adequate initially, however as a result of the events of Hurricane Ivan in
September 2004 this has place tremendous pressure on the PMU and the Ministry of
Education. The Unit and the Ministry of Education was also requested to coordinate and
implement several other donor funded project simultaneously. The relative allocation of
the financing among the project component was deemed appropriate in light of the
outputs defined for each component at entry. However the costing of the civil works and
quality components was later restructured as a result of factors outside the project.
Overall quality at entry was therefore rated as satisfactorily.




                                            36
3. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

3.1 Increasing Equitable Access

This sub-component aimed at financing minor expansions in three existing secondary
schools in the parishes of St. George, St. Andrew and St. David, to relieve overcrowding
and better meet the demand for secondary education in the underserved identified areas.
Under this component the project was expected to build and equip new class rooms to
add a total of 520 new places at three secondary schools: (i) Grenada Boys Secondary
School (GBSS), in St George, adding 200 additional spaces and increasing total capacity
to 900 students; (ii) Grenville Secondary School in St. Andrew, adding 120 new spaces
and increasing total capacity to 650 students, and (iii) in Westerhall Secondary School in
St. David, adding 200 new places and increasing total capacity to 520 students.

Planned school reconstruction activities were completed at Grenada Boys and Westerhall
Secondary schools although completed later than scheduled created an additional 420
places rather than 520 as planned under the project. The construction at GBSS was
accomplished at a higher cost than originally planned [EC$10,065,118.92 compared to
the planned EC$6, 902,844]. This was as a result of the need to address damages caused
by Hurricane Ivan and two fires at GBSS. These events have also created reduction in the
original scope of the project. Two [2] science laboratory facilities and a Learning
Resource Center were constructed at GBSS and furnished. The users of the facilities
praised the adequacy of the design and their evolvement in the process before and during
construction.

Additionally, washroom facilities were constructed for Bishops College in light of a very
peculiar need identified however this was not originally under the project. Planned
construction at Grenville Secondary School was not undertaken due a procurement
conflict outside the control of the Ministry of Education and the Project Coordination
Unit that led to a miss-procurement and thus cancellation of US$1,078,651 of the Loan.
The GOG constructed temporary infrastructure to accommodate students at Grenville and
secured funding for construction of permanent structures at the Grenville Secondary
School.

The Ministry of Education has taken steps to improve maintenance of school
infrastructure. These measures include: development of a school infrastructure
assessment form following consultations and endorsement by the Ministry of Works,
and provision of a monthly maintenance allowance of EC$ 300 to each school to
address maintenance issues. The beneficiary schools have all adopted appropriate
maintenance practices to safe guard the investments made. Notwithstanding the
challenges associated with this component the rating for this component is
satisfactorily.

3.2. Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning:

Curriculum Development. Significant accomplishments have been progress has been
made in the area of curriculum reform. For the first time a national curriculum policy and
plan were developed. The policy incorporated literacy and numeracy policies, and is
based on the regional curriculum. The policy was adopted, printed, disseminated to all
schools and introduced in schools in 2008 a bit later than anticipated. Subject area
policies were developed in Modern Languages, Creative and Performing Arts and Dance.
There is good evidence that the curriculum developed are being used at the school level.
The Ministry has also taken steps to refocus the curriculum in light of the changing
demands of the labor market. A series of workshops for school principals and teachers
were executed to assist with the implementation of the new curriculum. The workshops
were well appreciated by all who participated.

Literacy: A comprehensive literacy audit was undertaken. The findings of the audit were
used by the Ministry to affect future interventions within the sector. School principals [58
at primary] and [20 at secondary level] were locally trained on differentiated instruction
and support to teachers in literacy instruction. These training was led and conducted by
one of the returned fellows financed under the project. There is good evidence that the
expertise of returned fellows are well used by the Ministry. All primary school principals
were taken for study tour to another country to observe best practice in literacy. Four (4)
teachers were trained overseas in literacy studies (at cost of US$20,400 each) and
deployed to serve a cluster of schools as reading specialists. These teachers helped to
develop literacy improvement plans and provide coaching to other teachers on aspects of
literacy and to diagnose student learning difficulties. An additional 60 teachers
participated in an on-line degree program in literacy studies (37 of these trained under the
Project at cost of US$5,502 each). These trained teachers have been strategically
deployed to schools, district or Ministry level either as reading or literacy specialists.
Literacy teams were established at district level. The deployment of the Literacy
Specialist has resulted in make improvement in the performance in the area of literacy at
the school level.

Numeracy: The area of numeracy has also has similar success as the area of literacy.
Principals (58 at primary) and (20 at secondary level) were locally trained on numeracy
instruction. There are good evidences that retuned fellows are well utilized in this area
financed by the project also. One [1] teacher who was trained to Bachelor Degree
graduated with First Class and was sponsored to Masters Degree level in Mathematics,
and has been deployed to the Ministry to support the numeracy and assessment efforts.
The Ministry has adopted several cost saving measures to assist with the training of
teachers which was identified as one of the many best practices associated with the
implementation of the project. An additional 40 teachers were trained on-line in Science
and Mathematics education. The training for these teachers was done at one third of
the cost. In order to support Mathematics instruction, a numeracy manual was developed,
teachers trained on its use, and each school was given a Mathematical kit, including
Mathematical software. There is good evidence that the materials developed are used at
the school level. The Ministry has adopted innovative activities to raise the profile of

                                            38
mathematics. Such activities include: a Mathematics Month, Mathematics
exhibitions, Mathematics projects, Mathematics quiz, mental Mathematics every
Friday, and music focusing on Mathematics etc. This without a doubt will assist
with the sustainability of the initiatives financed under the project in this area.

Instructional Support Materials: Equipment upgrades for the Materials Production
Unit were undertaken to strengthen its capacity. Equipment provided includes:
computers, photocopiers, printers and scanners. In addition, one staff was trained. These
greatly enhanced in-house capacity of the Ministry of Education to produce instructional
and other materials to support education program implementation. This capacity has
helped to make significant savings especially during this period when a lot of
materials have to be provided to schools in form of manual and handbooks in
support of the reforms. For example, printing 200 teachers’ manuals that would
cost EC$50,000 if outsourced now costs EC$ 30,000, all costs inclusive.

Standardized Performance Measurement System. Good progress has been made in
introduction of assessment. A Minimum Competency Test (MCT) was developed and is
conducted annually for grades 2, 4 and 5, results analyzed and increasingly used to
improve on the weaker areas. The process of continuous assessment was introduced in
schools. This followed development, printing and distribution of a Handbook on
Continuous Assessment (CA) and training of key stakeholders. All school principals and
heads of departments and district teams from all the districts were trained in CA and
these in turn trained other teachers.

Teachers’ Skills Upgrade: This sub activity aimed at providing Technical and
Vocational Education and Training [TVET] pedagogy for technical teachers in secondary
schools, including: [i] 20 unqualified technical teachers at the Diploma level; and [ii] four
teachers at the Degree level. Three teachers to Masters Degree level in Technical
Education, for teachers to Bachelors in Technical Education, and 51 teachers to Diploma
in Technical Education. All of the teachers have already been deployed and are putting
their training into full use already. The evidence has already been positive through
improving in examination passes at the technical level.

Support to TAMCC. In order to strengthen capacity for teacher training, some TAMCC
tutors were trained to Masters Degree level, additional qualified teachers were deployed
to TAMCC, and equipment was also provided. There is good evidences that both the
training and the equipment provided are place to good use and additional support is
provided to the Ministry of Education via the TACMM Teachers Education Department.

Improving Student Support Services: Several successful training activities were
completed as it relate to this activity, including: [i] 5 counseling assistants were trained
to Bachelor’s degree; and [ii] Sixteen(16) teachers had been trained to Masters Level in
Guidance and Counseling rather than five originally planned under the project and 20
teachers trained in a Bachelor in Guidance and Counseling. The on line option of
training has helped to reduce the cost of training and savings were used to train
more teachers. This training has made it possible for the MOE to place a trained

                                             39
counselor in every secondary school although some do not yet have a suitable room
to provide the services in the most effective and efficient manner. Through the
Project the Ministry was able to collaborate with the St. George’s University to specially
design a programme for the training of teachers at the first degree in counseling. Other
nationals both within and out of the education sector also benefited from the initiative
started under the Project. It is therefore that the impact of the project has spread
beyond the sector.

Student Councils and Peer Support. A Train the Trainers Resource Manual for
Secondary Schools Student Councils was developed, and the Constitution for Student
Council of Secondary Schools was revised. To assist with the implementation of
initiatives started under the project the Ministry has appointed a full time Student
Activity Coordinator who will coordinate all student led activities at the school level. In
fact the creation of a Student Support Services Unit to coordinate all students related
activities have all so emerged as a result of the project. This was another by product that
emerged from the product. Teachers who were trained provided training for 250 peer
helpers, support other teachers and parents through workshops and handouts. While peer
helpers trained in 2005 have since graduated from secondary schools, the Ministry has
now put in place a system to train replacement of peer helpers.
School Improvement Plans. Each of the secondary school at the island was able to
implement at least one school improvement plan. Many of the schools have come up
with very innovate ways to sustain the initiatives started through fun raising
activities at the school. Some school wanted to undertake even greater projects
however the financing for same was limited.

A textbook rental program in support of 3,000 needy students was implemented for two
years under the project. In 2008 the GOG had extended the programme to cover all
students based on the Ministry of Education National Textbook Program. In order to
guarantee sustainability of this program, each student is charged an annual user fee of
EC$ 25 per student. Students who have been assesses as not eligible to pay are exempted.
The rating for this component is highly satisfactorily.

3.3. Strengthening Governance and Management

The creation of District Education Offices was a new addition to education management
created under the project. Seven (7) district offices were established and equipped.
National standards for performance of district education officers, curriculum
development officers and Early Childhood Education Officers and their job descriptions
were also developed and are will utilized. The district officers have proved to be very
useful link between the Ministry of Education and schools, provide a support network for
schools and serve as training venues for school principals and teachers. Stakeholders
confirmed the usefulness of the district offices. The feedbacks received from
stakeholders indicate that the creation of the District Education Officers were well
thought through.




                                            40
A School Assessment Handbook, a School Development Manual and Guidelines for
School Development Planning were developed to provide guidance to school principals
on planning. A Handbook for school principals and a framework for school performance
review were developed. These resources guided the establishment of school
improvement teams comprising: principal, deputy principal and Heads of Departments,
parents, students, teachers and board members. The number of School Development
Plans produced as a result of the development of the manual is evidence that the training
was very useful. All education officers, school principals and district supervision team
(includes curriculum officers, ECD specialists, teachers in charge of pre-primary schools)
were trained in school management skills, including how to prepare school improvement
plans. Each school now prepares a three year development plan which is informed by a
self assessment the major challenge to implementation of school improvement plans
is shortage of resources, as these plans depend on fund raising by school.
The rating for this component is satisfactorily

4. BORROWER’S PERFORMANACE

At the start of the project everything seemed ready for takeoff, a few months into
implementation Hurricane Ivan made his grand appearance thereby having the Ministry
of Education to revisit the project and make adjustments to the project categories
especially the civil works category, since the island’s school stock was heavily damaged.
Throughout the life of the project the cost tables had to be adjusted on a number of
occasions to meet the challenges which we were faced. The project was therefore
executed under abnormal conditions.

Notwithstanding the fact that the Government of Grenada’s contribution towards the
project has reduced when the project was restructured on 16th November 2004 to address
other areas of priority that emerged after events of Hurricane Ivan. The GOG fulfilled its
responsibility as required by the project in a satisfactory manner. However there were
some procurement issues that were not adequately addressed by the GOG which resulted
in the cancellation of a portion of the loan in the amount of US$1,078,651. There were
fulltime Clerk of Works assigned to the civil works project which contributed to the
improved onsite supervision of the civil works financed under the project.

The Ministry of Education fulfilled its responsibility through ensuring that there were
project staffs throughout implementation of the project although there were some level of
delays when the Ministry of Education Project Management Unit was merged into the
Project Coordination Unit [PCU] under the Ministry of Finance.

The PCU’s capacity was placed under tremendous pressure post Hurricane Ivan in
managing several projects by other donors. Notwithstanding this the PCU provided
timely supervision reports as required under the project.

The Borrower demonstrated its commitment and ownership of the project through its
responsiveness, its regular project team meetings on the progress of the project led by the
various component focal points and its open collaboration with the World Bank. In light

                                            41
of the approach adopted by the Ministry through the implementation of the project, this
offers well for the sustainability of those initiatives. The Project Advisory Committee
[PAC] did not function effectively.

Overall the Borrowers performance has been satisfactorily.

5. FINANCIER’S PERFORMANCE

Despite the challenges the Financier’s performance was executed with little or no hitches.
During implementation there were ongoing discussions with the Financial Specialist as
well as the Disbursement Officers and the Task team Leaders on matters that needed to
be clarified. These resource persons were always available and willing to lend their
support and give advice.

The Bank Team assigned to the Project must be commended for their high
professionalism exhibited throughout implementation of this project which was
executed under extraordinary circumstances. The successes achieved under the
project can also be attributed to the quality of supervision received by the Bank.

The Financier fulfilled its responsibility in a timely manner and was very flexible in its
approach to project implementation as evident in during the 16th November 2004
restructuring that took place. The decision to finance the much needed toilet block at the
Bishop’s College which was not under the original project was another case in point.
Additionally, the decision to provide additional towards the project activities which was
scaled down during the original project activities which was scaled down when the
project was restructured.

The Financier was diligent in the monitoring of the project implementation with a half
year visit conducted on schedule. This without a doubt has proved to be an extremely
important of project implementation and is probably one of the major factors that
influenced the ability of the project to achieve as much as it has.

The Aide Memoires prepared at the end of each supervision mission was extremely
helpful in identifying activities completed in an effort to facilitate a smooth project
implementation. The Aide Memoires were also very instrumental in assisting the
Borrower to plan adequately for future activities.

The quality of the monitoring executed by the Financier during project implementation
was extremely supportive in assisting the Borrower during project implementation in
light of the fact that the project was implemented during very unusual circumstances as a
result of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Emily in 2005. Overall the Financier’s
performance has been satisfactorily.




                                           42
6. FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOME

There were a number of factors affecting implementation and outcome. Those within the
Borrowers Control included:

   Slight delay in deployment of returned fellows to their various areas in a timely
    manner and delays in ensuring that their managers and supervisors were clear on their
    new roles and responsibilities.

   Institutionalization of the new roles of retuned fellows. There have been some delays
    in the appointment of some fellows following the completion of studies.

   Increases in market cost of civil works, and the availability of construction materials.
    This coupled with the effects of two hurricanes and two fires at one of the project
    school. These factors without a doubt had extreme negative implications for the
    achievement of the full outcomes that were targeted for the access component of the
    project.

   Procurement delays when the Ministry of Education PMU was merged with the PCU
    under the Ministry of Finance. Additionally procurement delays at the Public
    Tenders Board level.

   Site selection and availability for location of District Education Offices [DEOs]- this
    was severally affected by the effects of the Hurricanes and moderately by the
    Ministry’s of Education availability to conclude on the sites selections in a timely
    manner.

   The provision of full time project staff. Following the events of Hurricane I van in
    September 2004, there was extreme pressure for the staff at the PMU in light of the
    fact that they were also requested to work on several other donor funded projects
    within the education sector. Failure to ensure that they are fulltime dedicated staff at
    the PMU to work solely n the project in light of the multiple roles the staff were
    required to play has resulted in some delays in project implementation in the early
    years of the project.

   The standard processing times with Tender Board , which reviews all contracts some
    time took longer than expected for final contract approval. This caused delays,
    particularly at the beginning of the project.

   Availability of materials. The early construction phase of the Project coincided with
    a serious scarcity of building materials.

7. KEY LESSONS LEARNT

During project preparation were:

   The appointment of focal point for each component of the project has created greater
    ownership during project preparation and implementation. This has also allowed for
    the sustainability of the respective initiation following project closer. This best
    practices must be shared and is commendable and should be adopted for any future
    interventions,
    Key lessons learnt during project implementation were:

   The fact that project beneficiaries were heavily involved during the project
    preparation phase this has result potential bottlenecks that could have emerged during
    project implementation.

   The fellowship programme could have been better researched in some cases
    especially as it relates to the masters progamme in counseling psychology. Despite
    there were some orientation done for fellows before proceeding off to their various
    studies, even grater orientation could have been conducted. Lessons on teacher
    training.

   The on-line courses for teachers have proved to be an effective and efficient way of
    improving teacher quality, but could be strengthened by presence of resident tutors.
    This training affords teachers an opportunity to immediately put into practice the
    concepts they have learned and therefore easily relate to school realities. Government
    does not have to incur additional costs of a substitute teacher when the substantive
    teacher goes away for training or costs for travel abroad.

   The performance of some fellows especially in the online programme has shown that
    there was a need for more rigorous selection procedures in the selection process of the
    fellows.

   The need for improved communication among the Unit within the Ministry of
    Education.

   The need for more aggressive marketing for the reform initiatives undertaken under
    the project.

   A need for a more effective and appropriate model for the transfer of skills learnt
    example in the area of School supervision and management when persons department
    from their position at the Ministry of Education.

   The need for the installation of more effective systems along with strategies to be put
    in place to ensure that new skills learnt are well incorporated in the day to day
    operations at the Ministry of Education and within the education sector on a day to
    day basis.


                                            44
   Project formulation should include a contingency amount to take account for cost
    over-run that occurs due to factors outside of the project.
