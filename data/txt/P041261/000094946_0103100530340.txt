3.    Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1   Original Objective
In January 1995, the Government of Azerbaijan embarked on a macroeconomic
stabilization program supported by the IMF. The program was successful and resulted in
significant reductions in budget deficit and inflation. After seven years of drastic output
collapse, Azerbaijan experienced positive GDP growth in 1996 which accelerated in the
subsequent years. The Government of Azerbaijan also liberalized most prices and unified the
exchange rate. Overall, however, the country's performance on structural reform has not been
as satisfactory as has been progress in stabilization.
The goal of the SAC was to support the Government's efforts to accelerate structural
reforms. The principal objectives of the SAC were (i) to open domestic markets to
competition through trade liberalization; (ii) to implement a privatization program which
would further reduce the role of the state in economic and commercial activities; and (iii) to
promote the development of an efficient banking system.
3.2   Revised Objective [not applicable]
3.3   Original Components
The reform program proposed in the SAC focused on three areas:
(a) Trade liberalization: a new Ministry of Trade was to be established, consistent with
the principles of a market economy, retaining only regulatory functions and working
toward membership in the World Trade Organization. The state trading organizations
were to be privatized.
(b) Privatization: a clear strategy for a privatization program was to be created with the
necessary legal and institutional environment across the entire Government. Legal and
institutional frameworks for the auctions, share registration, a depository, market
intermediaries, trading and settlement were to be established. The Government was
urged to obtain technical advice in these areas.
(c) Financial sector reform: restructuring and privatization of the four state-owned
banks were to be undertaken. Strengthening of the Supervision Department of the
National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) that would oversee the reforms in the sector was
to take place.
3.4   Revised Components [not applicable]
3.5   Quality at Entry
The assessment of Quality at Entry for this SAC has been satisfactory. However, the
QAG reviewers rated it only as "marginal" in regard to poverty and social aspects. This
reflected the fact that, given the objectives of this adjustment credit, the design and



3
implementation arrangements did not incorporate key social issues and the views of major
stakeholders through a participatory process. The QAG reviewers also rated the project as
"marginal" in regard to risk and sustainability, raising questions on the extent of borrower
ownership and the adequacy of the institutional base for this kind of operation. While we
acknowledge that there existed some concerns about the capacity of the Government to
implement the project, we feel that overall the project's timing and content were satisfactory.
The project's objectives and components were appropriate and consistent with enabling the
Government to undertake an ambitious reform process. The project was closely coordinated
with the financial and economic measures supported by the IMF.
4.    Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1   Outcome/achievement of objective
The goal of the SAC was to support the Government's efforts to accelerate structural
refofrms. The narrowly defined objectives of the SAC included trade liberalization,
privatization and banking sector reform. Stated more broadly, the SAC objective was to
create a competitive market, to reduce the role of the state in economic and commercial
activities and to develop an efficient banking system. The project has been successful in
achieving the narrowly defined goals in terms of the specific policy actions supported by the
SAC. However, the project has been less successful in achieving the broadly defined
objectives, as outcomes from expected policy actions. One needs to keep in mind, though,
that transition to a market economy is a long term process and there is a limit to what a single
lending activity can achieve. This SAC was one of the initial efforts of the Bank to accelerate
reforms in Azerbaijan and it was expected that the reform process would be supported with
subsequent lending.
The objective of creating a competitive market through trade liberalization has not
been fully achieved, though the trade in goods and services relative to GDP has been
increasing over the period 1997-1999 (see Annex 1). The Government does not seem as
committed to free trade as it was in the past. Import duties (relative to the value of imports)
increased from 2.75 percent in 1997 to 4.2 percent in 1998. Currently, the Customs
Committee is planning to introduce a new tariff code with a large number of varying rates,
including very low tariffs for goods not produced in Azerbaijan and high tariffs for imports
competing with locally produced goods.
The Government has been less than successful at reducing the role of state in
economic and commercial activities. Government spending relative to GDP has increased
during 1997-2000. The size of government employment has increased by 7.5 percent during
the 1995-99 period. The public sector remains relatively large and there are continuing
difficulties in distinguishing private and public activities. Government intervention in the
private sector is extensive, and in many cases regulations are either unclear or their
enforcement is not transparent. According to the 1999 Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey commissioned jointly by the World Bank and the EBRD, Azerbaijan has
the highest level of administrative corruption among 20 transition economies surveyed. In
communal services, enterprises continue to cross-subsidize residential households. The large



4
scale privatization has been lagging behind, and 80 percent of medium- and large-scale
enterprises, including the most profitable ones, are yet to be privatized. Concerns have been
expressed about the transparency of the privatization process by IFIs and the international
business community. On the positive side, the contribution of the private sector to GDP
increased from 55 percent in 1998 to 62 percent in 1999.
The program has had a limited impact on efficiency in the banking sector. The overall
level of development of retail banking is still limited. In 1998, state-owned banks accounted
for about 85 percent of assets in the sector. Almost 90 percent of the total loans of the
banking system are provided by the state banks. The share of bad loans in the three state
banks, excluding the International Bank (IBA), would exceed 80 percent of their total
portfolio. Although foreign banks are legally allowed to participate fully in the banking
sector, they are effectively discouraged from expanding their operations and cannot therefore
exert competitive pressures.
Currently, there is very limited effective rural credit. This was also the case before
Agroprom Bank (AIB) has ceased lending, since most of the Agroprom's existing portfolio
was to medium- and large-sized enterprises. Currently, there are a number of initiatives to
address the issue of rural credit including a Bank agriculture sector project, which would
initiate a mechanism to increase the availability of market based credit and deposit services
for rural households, enterprises, and farms. This project will support the establishment of
credit cooperatives and groups of jointly liable borrowers (village banks), and provide a
credit line (around US$11.5 million) to be allocated through these establishments to finance
eligible sub-projects. Also, a few new informal schemes are in the early stages of
development. The Prominvest Bank (PIB), Savings Bank (SvB) and Agroprom Bank (AIB)
have ceased their banking operations. The licenses of Prominvest Bank and Savings Bank
have been removed and the United Universal Joint Stock Bank (UUJSB) has been created.
The license of Agroprom Bank has not been revoked as of today. However, the authorities
have agreed to an action plan which includes the withdrawal of the banking license of the
Agroprom Bank by December 2000. The International Bank (IBA) has not been privatized
yet and the proposed EBRD investment in JIBA is still being negotiated.

4.5  Institutional development impact
The institutional development impact of this one operation has been rated "modest"
relative to the overall task of creating the institutional base that Azerbaijan needs if it is to
become a successful market-oriented economy with an efficient public sector. However, the
impact of the SAC can be considered "substantial" in the several specific areas that were the
focus of the reforms supported by this credit. For instance, the project has led to the
establishment of a Ministry of Trade and to the enactment of a Law on Securities and a Law
on Secured Transactions.
5.    Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1   Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency
The external environment proved more problematic than initially envisioned.
Calendar year 1998 was a difficult year for the Azerbaijan's economy. Petroleum prices
(U.K. Brent), which had average $19.12 per barrel in 1997, fell to an average of $12.72 in
1998. The effects of the crisis in Russia, which followed the sharp devaluation of the ruble in
August 1998, adversely affected both exporters and import-competing producers in
Azerbaijan.
Moreover, the collapse of output in the initial years of the transition, and the slow and
limited recovery that has since taken place, have not helped in mobilizing popular support for
the reform process. Finally, groups of vested interests have subsequently resisted further
reforms.
5.2   Factors generally subject to government control
There was a delay of nearly a year in the release of the second tranche because of
problems in the implementation of the agreed reform measures. In November 1997, at the
time of the first supervision mission, it was still expected that it would be possible to release
the second tranche in May/June 1998. Subsequently, however, progress in implementing the
agreed reforms was very slow. The second supervision mission in April/May 1998 reported
that "that there has been very little progress in implementing the agreements reached" during
loan negotiations and that "even when required actions are taken as agreed, their
developmental impact has been minimal, because there has not been any follow-up to make
them operational and/or effective." Consequently, in mid-1998, this SAC was classified as a
"problem project."
The Government exhibited some inertia in deciding on and implementing economic
policies, which can be attributed to the Presidential elections that took place in November
1998. However, the third SAC supervision mission, which took place in December 1998,
found that once the elections were over the authorities renewed their attention to economic



7
reforms. That mission noted the Government's resolve in implementing the remaining SAC
conditions and concluded that progress under the SAC could now be rated as "satisfactory."
Consequently the closing date for the credit was extended from January 31 to April 30, 1999.
On April 2, 1999, the Executive Directors were notified that the originally agreed conditions
for the second tranche release had been fulfilled and, consequently, that release would be
made. Additionally, recognizing the effects of the crisis in Russia, on March 31, 1999, the
Board approved a Supplemental Credit of SDR5 million which was added to the second
tranche and increased the total to SDR3 1 million.
More recently, as petroleum prices rose from $12-13 per barrel in 1998 and early
1999 to $26-27 in the first half of 2000, the availability of foreign exchange has not been a
serious constraint upon the economy. This could have led the Government to believe that the
IFIs have been pressuring the country to move too fast on reforms and that in the present
situation the country could afford to move in its own way and at its own pace. Thus, although
the specific requirements of the SAC have been fulfilled, the degree of government
ownership of the broader structural adjustment and reform program may have been somewhat
weak.
5.3   Factors generally subject to implementing agency control [not applicable]
5.4   Costs andfinancing [not applicable]
6.    Sustainability
6.1   Rationale for sustainability rating
The sustainability of the specific reforms supported by the SAC is considered "likely."
Although there are questions about the pace of the desirable further reforms, particularly with
respect to public sector management, we do not expect any "going back" on the specific
reform measures that were supported by this SAC. Although the dialogue with the
Government has been less than easy and the progress has been slower than desired, we expect
that given the Government's intentions to proceed with the reformn process, the Bank will
continue to provide support for the reform efforts in the future.
6.2   Transition arrangement to regular operations [not applicable]
7.    Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1   Lending
The Bank's performance on lending is considered satisfactory. In keeping with the
strategy outlined in the CAS, this SAC was part of a series of adjustment operations in
support of the transition process in Azerbaijan. It focused on key steps in the reforn process
for which external financial assistance was necessary as a catalyst for Government action,



8
and it provided support for the budget and the balance of payments. The operation was
closely coordinated with the financial and economic measures being supported by the IMF.
During the appraisal mission, technical advice was provided to the Government to
support their efforts to establish a Ministry of Trade and negotiate accession to the World
Trade Organization. Moreover, assistance was provided to the State Property Committee in
the area of corporatization and preparation of voucher auctions. The appraisal mission noted
that unless the State Property Committee obtains additional resources both technical and
financial, it would be less able to proceed with the ambitious privatization program.
Unfortunately, very little technical assistance, particularly in terms of grants, was available to
Azerbaijan at that time. Later on, however, the IBTA project provided funds for technical
assistance.
7.2   Supervision
Supervision was performed in a satisfactory manner. The first supervision mission,
which took place in November 1997, worked closely with the Government to identify the
areas where progress had to be made in order for the second tranche to be released. These
areas included the privatization process, banking sector reform and state procurement.
As potential problems were identified early on, the World Bank staff worked closely
with the Government during subsequent supervision missions. The program was put back on
track and the remaining issues were resolved. The closing date of the project was extended so
that the necessary reforms could be implemented before the release of the second tranche.
Disbursement of the second tranche took place in April 1999. It was combined with a
Supplemental Credit of SDR5 million which was approved by the Board on March 31, 1999
in order to mitigate the effects of the Russian crisis. The total of SDR31 million was
disbursed.
7.3   Overall Bank performance
For the reasons indicated above, the Bank's overall performance is considered
satisfactory. Also, it may be noted that, when a combination of factors led to delays in
implementation in 1998, the Bank made realistic adjustments in its expectations which
permitted the credit to complete disbursements in April 1999.
Borrower
7.4   Preparation
The borrower's contribution to, and participation in, the preparation of the credit is
considered satisfactory. The Government officials most directly concemed worked closely
with Bank staff in the design of the operation.



9
7.5   Government implementation performance
Although there was a period in 1998 during which implementation was delayed due to
external shocks and performance was considered unsatisfactory, the agreed policy measures
were eventually taken. For this reason, the borrower's overall implementation performance is
considered satisfactory.
7.6  Implementing Agency
The performance of the implementing agency, the National Bank of Azerbaijan, is
considered satisfactory.
7.7   Overall Borrower performance
The borrower's overall performance with respect to fulfilling the specific conditions
of this SAC is considered satisfactory.
8.    Lessons Learned
Transition to a market economy is a gradual and lengthy process that is marked by
successive incremental changes to the status quo. From this perspective, the SAC's agenda
may have been overly ambitious setting out to accomplish extensive changes in a very short
period of time. Yet without such an ambitious program the project most likely would not
have achieved as much as it did.
The second lesson is that the Bank must be able to show some flexibility when, as in
1998, unanticipated circumstances necessitate adjustments in the timetable. Adaptability on
the part of the Bank has contributed to a greater Government commitment and the
satisfactory completion of the project.
Although policy actions were implemented according to the loan agreement, the
sustainability of the reform program may be fragile. Govermnent ownership of development
objectives may have been weak and more efforts to ensure shared objectives would be needed
for future project to be successful.
