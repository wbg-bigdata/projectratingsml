INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO NIGERIA FOR THE GUSAU
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nigeria for the equivalent of US$19 million to help finance agricultural
development in the Gusau area in the North Western State of Nigeria. The
loan would have a term of 20 years including a five-year grace period with an
interest of 8 percent per annum. The US$19 million Bank loan would be onlent
to the North Western State Government (NWS). The loan would be onlent on
the same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Nigeria"
(416a-UNI) dated August 5, 1974 was distributed to the Executive Directors.
The country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        The most striking feature of Nigeria's economic performance since
1970 is the remarkably rapid recovery from the dislocations and disruptions
caused by the civil war. GDP rose by nearly 50 percent in the two years
immediately following the war. This exceptionally high growth obviously
included a large element of "catching-up" as the economy responded to the pent-
up demands of the civil war period and as investment and production which had
been postponed during the hostilities were rapidly realized. As this phase
came to a close, a decline in the rate of growth to more normal levels was
to be expected. Moreover, during 1972 and 1973, agricultural production was
adversely affected by drought in the Northern States, and the output of some
manufacturing industries (e.g., textiles and footwear) fell as a result of
intensified competition from imports, following the policy of liberalization
introduced in early 1972. As a result, GDP at factor cost is estimated to have
risen by about 8 percent in 1972/73. Growth in 1973/74 may be in the range of
6-7 percent. The country's GDP during 1970/71 through 1972/73 was about 45
percent higher than in the three years immediately preceding the war. The
implied growth rate during the period 1964-66 to 1970-72 (6.3 percent a year)
compares favorably with the 6 percent attained during the fifties and early
sixties.
4.        This rapid economic recovery resulted mainly from expansion of
petroleum mining. Crude oil production rose from around 630,000 barrels per
day (bbls/day) in early 1970 to 1.8 million bbls/day in early 1972 and 2.0
million bbls/day by mid-1973. Government services too increased quickly on
the basis of considerable growth of revenues from the oil sector. On the



average, manufactures also grew faster than total output. However, petro-
leum production is an enclave activity, and manufacturing and modern services
afford employment for a small share of the labor force. Nigeria essentially
remains an agricultural economy in spite of a substantial shift in the com-
position of output since the period immediately before the civil war. Agri-
culture accounted for 46 percent of domestic product in 1971/72 (i.e., prior
to the increase in oil prices) and employed some 70 percent of the labor force.
Consequently, Nigeria's per capita income (about $130 in 1972) largely reflects
the low productivity of its traditional agriculture.
5.        The considerable growth of domestic product and income in recent
years was accompanied by similar increases in all major components of aggre-
gate expenditure. In real terms, exports in the period 1971/72 through 1973/74
averaged about twice the pre-war levels, imports increased by almost 90 per-
cent, investment by over 65 percent, and consumption expenditures by about
50 percent. Per capita real consumption and the rate of investment are well
above pre-war levels. Private sector investments have been high in both oil
and non-oil activities, especially manufacturing among the latter. Public
investment (valued at 1970/71 prices) rose from N148 million in 1970/71 to
N340 million in 1972/73 and was budgetted at N600 million in 1973/74. Never-
theless, implementation of the public investment program contained in the
Second Development Plan is behind schedule, due partly to a delay of ten
months in the issuance of the Plan and, more significantly, to inadequate
executive capacity for project preparation and implementation. Recognizing
these problems, the Government decided to postpone the start of the next Plan
by a year. The Third Development Plan is now scheduled to start early in 1975,
and will cover the five-year period 1975-80. Provisional guidelines for the
Third Plan, issued in July 1973, are currently being reviewed in the light of
the new situation brought about by the recent sharp rise in oil revenues.
General Gowan's Independence Day message of October 1, 1974, indicates that
the Government is now contemplating a much bigger program of investment than
outlined in the July 1973 Guidelines.
6.        Nigeria's balance of payments and fiscal position have also shown
dramatic improvement essentially because of the rapid growth of petroleum
exports.  Total exports have risen from N885 million in 1970 to N2,227 million
in 1973, with oil accounting for practically all the increase. Imports have
also grown (from N756 million in 1970 to N1,234 million in 1973), but more
slowly than exports. This has enabled the Government to reduce short-term
external debt and to progressively relax the restrictions on import payments
and repatriation of dividends. The few remaining licensing and payment
controls in respect of goods and factor services have been removed in the
last budget. Foreign exchange reserves have increased dramatically following
the recent increases in oil price, and preliminary figures as of early October
1974 indicate that external reserves exceed $4 billion, equivalent to about
15 months' imports.
7.        The increase in oil revenues from N70 million in 1969/70 to N730
million in 1972/73 was also the major factor in transforming the Government's



-3-
fiscal position. In 1969/70, the Federal and State budgets taken together
showed an overall deficit of N349 million; in 1971/72, they showed an overall
surplus of N268 million. Because of a sharp increase in expenditures, 1972/73
recorded a small overall deficit. But the recent rise in oil prices is likely
to result in an unprecedented overall surplus during 1973/74 and the current
year despite big increases in budgetted expenditures. This growing fiscal
strength, however, has been largely confined, so far, to the Federal Govern-
ment. In general, the states have been barely able to balance their revenue
leaving little resources to finance capital expenditures. The Federal Govern-
ment has made large grants and low interest loans to alleviate the situation.
The picture is likely to change dramatically as a result of the new revenue-
sharing arrangement announced by General Gowan in his Independence Day address.
Under the new arrangement, the states as a group are expected to have suffi-
cient resources to meet all their current expenditures and about two-thirds
of the projected capital expenditures.
8.        The improved budgetary situation, liberalization of imports and
recovery of production in the eastern states have, together, helped abate
inflationary pressures. The Lagos Consumer Price Index rose by less than 3
percent in 1972 and a little over 4 percent in 1973, compared to an average
of 13 percent or more per annum between 1968 and 1971.
9.        Other major developments in the last two years include a far-
reaching reform of the Marketing Board System, a substantial increase in
producer prices for agricultural products, the acquisition of a 55 percent
equity participation in virtually all foreign operations in the oil sector,
and the establishment of the Bank for Commerce and Industry to assist in-
digenous entrepreneurs. A population census, conducted in November-December
1973, indicates Nigera's population to be around 80 million. These results
are provisional and subject to review by a Committee of Experts. The final
population figures are not expected before the end of the current year. At
the political level, the most noteworthy event is the announcement of the
Federal Military Government's decision to postpone the return to civilian
rule, originally set for 1976.
Medium and Long-Term Prospects
10.       Even before the recent rise in oil prices, as pointed out in the
Basic Economic Report (Report No. AW-35a), it was apparent that the resources
generated by oil would permit Nigeria to undertake a bold program of public
development expenditures and plan for a sustained, rapid growth during the
next decade. The Guidelines for the Third Plan issued in July 1973 visualized
total public investment at some 80 percent higher than in the Second Plan
with emplasis on agriculture and rural development and on widening and deepen-
ing the industrial structure. With the prospect of vastly larger oil revenues,
the Government has decided to further increase the scale of projected invest-
ments. The hlead of State recently announced that the public sector investment
program in the Tlhird Plan would be about N20 billion, out of an estimated
total investment of N30 billion. This is expected to generatc a 9 percent
annual increase in incomes. Apart from larger outlays in agriculture, roads,



- 4 -
educati6n, health and infrastructure, massive investments in oil-related
industries like Lt'G, fertilizers and refineries are visualized.   The need and
scope for the projected investments is beyond doubt. The finance and foreign
e:;change necessary to sustaim them are also available. The Government is aware
that shortage of executive capacity poses a serious problem, and efforts are
being made to overcome this constraint.   Clearly the fulfillment of the Third
Plan targets depends critically on the success in building up the necessary
capacity to prepare, imiplement and manage projects.
11.       The bank's Economic Mission, reviewing Nigeria's medium and long-
term growth prospects in the light of the new oil prices, estimated that,
with oil prices remaining constant in real terms, oil output rising moderately
and public expenditures growing at the rate of 13 percent a year (in real
terms), the economy has the potential to sustaiTI an average annual growth of
over 9 percent through the mid-eighties, provided the investment program is
implemented efficiently. The potential growth would be somewhat lower (8.3
percent a year) if oil prices in real terms were to decline moderately, oil
output were kept constant and public expenditures grew by only 10-11 percent
a year. Even with such high rates of growth, Nigeria in the mid-eighties
would still be a relatively poor country with per capita real income of
around $500.
12.       Under the above assumptions, Nigeria is expected to remain in over-
all balance of payments surplus during the remainder of the 1970s. Accumu-
lated reserves at the end of the Third Plan (1980/81) may lie in the vicinity
of 18 months' import value, the value of imports having risen by that time
to around $13 billion in terms of current prices.   However, the overall balance
of payments is likely to be in deficit by the early eighties, and the deficit
could rise rapidly. The range of possible outcomes during the eighties is
very wide and will be very sensitive to the behavior of oil pricel, output
and public expenditures.   With relatively low growth of public expenditure,
constant real oil prices and rising oil output, total reserves in 1985/86
could be equivalent to less than 10 months' imports.    B3ut, with higher growth
of government expenditures, lower oil prices and constant oil production,
NTigeria could well have exhausted all its reserves by that timne.
External Assistance
13.       Nigeria's need for external assistance to help accelerate invest-
ment in the more intractable areas such as agriculture ancl rural development
and to increase executive and managerial capacity in the infrastructure
sectors is the more urgent as the countryvs resources increase. The Federal
Covernment's attitude towards foreign private capital is that it should com-
plement, not compete with domestic capital.   This applies to official exter-
nal assistance as well. Priority is, therefore, being given to multilateral
and bilateral projects and programs which act as catalysts to investment
efforts in the high-i priority areas and increase indigenous capability to
control, manage and promote the growth of the economy efficiently in the
future. Against this background the Federal government and the Bank agree
that, at least over the next Plan period (1975-1980), the primary objective



- 5 -
of Banlc activities in Nigeria should continue to be to assist Government
efforts to increase investment in the high priority areas of agricultural
and rural infrastructure development and to improve public sector capability
to manage and promote the future growth of the modern sectors, rather than
to increase available resources. During recent discussions with the Govern-
ment, it was also agreed that the most efficient and effective means of
providing this assistance would be in association with capital projects
typically financed by the Bank, such as the projects proposed today.
14.       Nigeria's creditworthiness for additional borrowing on conventional
terms is not in question. As of December 31, 1972, total external public and
publicly guaranteed debt, including undisbursed loans, amounted to an estimated
$1,035 million, of which approximately $57 million represented suppliers'
credits. Outstanding but undisbursed commitments of official capital were
about $426 million. Debt service in 1972 was 2.5 percent of gross exports, or
less than 4 percent of exports less factor payments. In view of the substan-
tially improved resource position of the country, and the consequent uncer-
tainty as to the level of its future borrowings, it would not be possible to
state, at this stage, what the Bank's share of Nigeria's total outstanding
debt or debt service will be in the next five years. The Bank Group's share
of total external public debt (including undisbursed) at the end of 1972 was
about 45 percent. This relatively high share essentially reflects Nigeria's
low level of external debt ($14 per capita in 1972) rather than substantial
lending by the Bank ($6 per capita, including undisbursed, at the end of 1972).
15.       The Government of Nigeria is favorably inclined to re-cycle a
portion of its accumulating resources for the benefit of the developing
world.  During the past six months, Nigeria has increased its subscription
to the African Development Bank and announced that it will no longer seek
to borrow from that institution; donated $800,000 to the Consultative Group
for International Agricultural Research, thus becoming the first developing
country to contribute to the Group; and contributed SDR100 million to the IMF
Oil Facility. In addition, Nigeria has recently agreed to make a substantial
purchase of Bank bonds, the terms of which are currently under negotiation.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA
16.       Bank/IDA lending to Nigeria to date amounts to $621.9 million (net
of cancellations) of which $370.8 million was committed during the period of
the Second National Development Plan. Transport and power together account
for $428.2 million or about 69 percent of the total, and agriculture, educa-
tion, industry and the post-war rehabilitation loan account for the remaining
31 percent; excluding the program loan, the respective shares are about 75
percent for transport and power and 25 percent for the other three sectors.
Although disbursements have been lagging, the execution of projects has gen-
erally been satisfactory. Annex II contains a sunmary statement of Bank loans
and IFC investments and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 6 -
17.       Bank activities since 1970 have generally been aimed at assisting
Nigeria in the following three broad areas: (a) reconstruction and rehabili-
tation of the economy after the civil war; (b) institution-building in the
public sector; and (c) extensive economic, sector and project preparation
work. In pursuance of these aims, Bank commitments in FYs 1971, 1972, 1973
and 1974 amounted to $97.2 million, $119.6 million, $54 million and $75
million, respectively; during the same period, an economic mission and agri-
culture, education and transportation sector missions visited Nigeria, and
extensive assistance was provided to the State Governments in identifying and
perparing projects designed to raise the production and incomes of small
farmers.
18.       The proposed project, and the four other projects under considera-
tion today, reflect the increasing emphasis being given to agriculture and
rural development in the Federal Government's plans for investing oil revenues
for the benefit of the bulk of the population who live in rural areas. Nego-
tiations with the Bank have been completed for three further agricultural
projects directed towards raising the production of palm oil from nucleus
estates and snallholdings in the Western, Mid-Western and East Central States.
Other projects in an advanced state of processing will be concerned with small-
holder rubber production in the itid-Western State and an irrigation scheme
near Kano, and work is underwzay on the preparation of two further rural develop-
ment projects, similar to those being presented today, in the Benue Plateau and
Klwara States in the center of the country. These last four projects should be
ready for presentation to Executive Directors within the next eighteen months.
Outside agriculture the activities of the Bank Group are being restricted over
the next few years to a small number of projects for which the Federal Govern-
mient has requested assistance in building up netw institutions required to
streng,then essential infrastructure and to provide employment for the rapidly
growing urban population. Work is currently proceeding on the preparation of
projects for small-scale industry and water supply and sewerage in small towns
and rural areas. The possibility of Bank assistance in the reorganization of
the telecommunications sector has been discussed, but no decision has been
taken. No further lending is presently envisaged for highways, power or
education which have been important areas of Bank Group involvement in the
past. However, two education projects are still at an early stage of imple-
mentation, and their supervision will make considerable demands on the time
of Bank staff. The work of the Bank's Resident Mission in Lagos is largely
concentrated on project preparation in agriculture and public utilities and
on the supervision of on-going projects in these and other sectors.
19.       Since foreign exchange as such is no longer a scarce resource in
Nigeria, the extent of the Bank's participation in the financing of individual
projects is being determined more by reference to what is considered to be an
appropriate share of total costs. For projects which have high priority in
meeting basic economic and social problems such as those in agriculture and
rural development, where the direct foreign exchange component may also be
relatively low, the Bank has been financing 50% of total costs, and this is
the formula proposed for the sharing of costs of the five projects under
consideration today and the three other projects for which loans have already



-7
been negotiated. In the case of four of the five projects under consideration
today the foreign exchange component ranges between 47 and 51%; for the Rice
project it is 30%. This cost-sharing formula will be re-examined before
further negotiations take place.
20.       During the five years since the end of the civil war in January
1970, Bank Group commitments to Nigeria have averaged about $80 million a
year. Disbursements on Bank loans to Nigeria have lagged well behind commit-
ments. During the current fiscal year, they are not expected to exceed $54
million on a gross basis, or $18 million net of interest and principal repay-
ments to the Bank. A large increase in the level of lending was discussed
with the Nigerian Government two years ago when it was assumed that Nigeria
would continue to require a substantial inflow of external capital for financ-
ing investments in the power and transport sectors which had absorbed the
bulk of previous Bank loans. Now that these requirements can be met from
Nigeria's own resources, the level and direction of Bank lending in future
years will have to be reviewed in the context of the country's new Five-Year
Plan, and such a review is planned for April or May next year when the Govern-
ment expects discussions on the Plan to have been completed.
PART ITT - AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA
21.       Agriculture, including livestock, fisheries and forestry is by
far the most important source of output and employment: in 1971/72 it
contributed about $4 billion or 46 percent of the country's gross domestic
product and about 70 percent of the labor force is estimated to be employed
in this sector.
22.       Nigerian agriculture is primarily domestic market oriented. Nearly
90 percent of her production - comprising all staple food crops and animal
products, most palm oil and cotton, and a substantial part of groundnuts - is
consumed within the country. Nigeria is nearly self-sufficient in foods.
In 1971-72, total imports of food and beverages - of which meat, milk and
sugar are the main items - were of the order of $145 million or less than
5 percent of estimated total food consumption. Exports of agricultural
products in 1971-72 were valued at $265 million. Until the mid-sixties, they
were the dominant element in Nigeria's export trade, but have since been over-
taken by crude oil. Even so, they are still a significant source of foreign
exchange and account for the bulk of the non-oil exports.
23.       Nigeria can be divided into three major agricultural and ecolog-
ical zones; a southern wet forest zone comprising the Western, Mid-Western,
East-Central, South-Eastern and Rivers States, characterized by high rainfall
and a tropical climate and growing mainly perennial tree crops, namely cocoa,
rubber and oil palm; a central dry forest zone known as the middle belt
embracing the whole of Kwara State, Benue Plateau, the southern parts of
North-Western, North-Central and North-Eastern States which is underpopulated



- 8 -
and tsetse infested, but has a high potential for annual food crops and live-
stock; and a northern zone which, being free from tsetse has a high population
density and a fairly intensive and developed system of agriculture. This area
covers about 50 percent of the country, and in addition to supporting most of
Nigeria's cattle population, also produces most of her cereals, beans, ground-
nuts and cotton.
24.       Land holdings are typically small.   The average farmed area per
holding for the country as a whole is estimated to be less than three
acres. In some of the more densely populated areas of the south, the
average is less than one acre. There are few farm families with more than
25 acres of cultivated area. Farmers follow for the most part traditional
techniques of which bush fallowing and mixed cropping are characteristic
features. The practice of bush fallowing is essentially a device to main-
tain soil fertility. Mixed cropping permits farmers to get more output
per acre with smaller risks of crop failure. However, since improved seed,
fertilizers and other elements of modern technology are used on a very
limited scale, average yields are still low. Small holdings and poor produc-
tivity explain the relatively low level of income in the agricultural sector.
There are also considerable disparities in the distribution of land and
incomes both between and within regions.
25.       While reliable data are lacking, it is believed that agricultural
production since the early sixties has been growing only slightly faster
than population. Agriculture has certainly been growing much slower than
other sectors, and as a result, its share in GDP has been declining. The
relative sluggishness of agriculture is largely attributable to the exist-
ing low level of agricultural technology. The disruption of production in
the eastern states during the civil war was an aggravating factor. Since
then, the recovery has been hampered by short-term factors such as drought
in parts of the north in 1972-73 and 1973-74, but, more particularly, by
a number of underlying long-term influences. Some of the most important
factors among these are the rising age-profile of tree crops, technical and
other constraints to accelerated food crop production, e.g., the lack of
improved crop varieties and adequate credit facilities to finance the pur-
chase of modern farm inputs. Imports of food, though still small, have
risen from around $70 million in 1965-66 to $145 million in 1972. The slow
growth of production has also affected exports. Cocoa and rubber exports
have remained stagnant in recent years. Palm oil exports have dwindled to
negligible amounts and palm kernel exports are stagnating at well below
pre-war levels. Groundnut exports in 1972 were some 80 percent below the
1965 level and were even lower in 1973 because of the drought in the north.
In addition the availability of groundnuts for export has been affected by
substitution of groundnut for palm oil in domestic consumption and the rela-
tively better price offered to farmers by private traders. A near record
groundnut crop is in prospect for 1974. Cotton, once a major export, is now
fully utilized by the local textile industry and local supply cannot meet
demand.
26.       A vigorous effort to step-up the growth of agricultural and live-
stock production is essential for viable development of the economy. The



-9-
demand for agricultural products is growing rapidly. On a rough estimate,
the resources generated by the oil sector would be adequate to sustain a
growth rate of over 9 percent per annum in real terms over the next decade.
This will generate a 6 percent average annual increase in domestic demand
for farm products.  Unless the rate of agricultural growth is accelerated,
the economy faces the prospect of' large and increasing food imports. More
importantly, continued slow growth of agricultural production implies a
slow improvement in the living conditions of the mass of the population with
the attendant risks of further aggravation of rural-urban disparities.
27.       Nigeria has vast unexploited potential for increasing agricultural
production. The productivity of practically all segments of agriculture -
food, export crops, and livestock - are far below levels attainable with
modern farming methods. In addition there are extensive areas of good agri-
cultural and grazing land which, if developed along scientific lines, could
greatly increase production. While improved varieties and techniques adapted
to local conditions are not available for all crops and regions, much can be
done on the basis of existing knowledge. Significant improvements in pro-
ductivity of many of the major export and cereal crops have been demonstrated
to be technically and economically feasible. The main constraints are organi-
zational and institutional: until recently Government efforts to help the
farmers to learn and apply the known techniques for raising production have
not been on a scale commensurate with needs and possibilities. Extension
services in many states are poorly staffed, credit and marketing institutions
are few, planning is weak and the expertise needed to implement successfully
major agricultural and other rural development projects is in short supply.
There are also complex social and institutional problems to be overcome before
the land potential, including the resources of the middle belt, can be effec-
tively exploited, and the livestock industry organized along modern lines.
28.       The Federal and State Governments are conscious of the need for
greater attention to agriculture and of the impediments to be overcome before
significant progress can be achieved. Several major new programs initiated
within the last year or two bear witness to a heightened Government concern
for and interest in agricultural development. These include the creation of
the Nigerian Agricultural Bank, the launching of an accelerated food produc-
tion program, larger and better organized projects for replanting/planting of
tree crops and integrated agricultural development projects in different
parts of the country. At the request of the Qovernment, the Bank has actively
assisted in the preparation of many of these projects. The Bank economic
mission in 1973 made an overall survey of the potential and prospects for
food production. Agriculture and rural development generally are of crucial
importance to Nigeria's long-term growth, and the Bank plans to continue
assisting Nigeria in preparing and implementing projects in this area.
PART IV r TIIE PROJECT
29.       A Report entitled "Appraisal of Gusau Agricultural Development
Project -- Nigeria" dated September 6, 1974 (No. 354a-UNI) is being distri-



- 10 -
buted separately. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III; as is
map showing the location of the project area.
30.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in November,
1972 and was subsequently prepared by the Bank in collaboration with the North
lWestern State authorities. The project was appraised by a Bank mission that
visited Nigeria in September and October, 1973. Negotiations were conducted
in Washington in July, 1974. The Nigerian delegation was headed by Alhaji
Abubakar Alhaji, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Finance.
Project Description
2
31.       The project area covers 3,800 km   or about 2 percent of the total
area of the North Western State.   It comprises part of the Sokoto Administra-
tive Division and is estimated to involve some 68,000 farm families mainly
engaged in the growing of cotton, groundnuts, sorghum and maize and supporting
a total project area population of 620,000.
32.       The proposed loan would assist Nigeria's North Western State Govern-
ment (NWS) to finance an agricultural development project which would involve
the construction of vital crop extraction roads and water supplies, and would
provide farmers with the technical, marketing and credit services, and inputs
required to increase production and farm incomes. Currently, the latter are
low, about US$220 per family and US$34 per capita.
33.       The project would be carried out over a five year investment period
1975/76 - 1979/80, and would involve:
(a) constructing about 1,000 km of low cost agricultural
roads, 85 small and medium size earth dams, 160 tapkis
(ponds), and associated soil conservation structures;
(b) constructing an administrative centre in Gusau, 4
development unit centres, and 40 farm service centres;
(c) expanding Gusau seed multiplication farm and the
new development of an additional farm at Kaura-Namoda;
(d) expanding training facilities at Gusau and construc-
ting a new project training centre at Kaura-Namoda;
(e) provision of adequate farmer extension, marketing
services, including staff, vehicles and equipment;
(f) provision of seasonal and medium-term loans to farmers
for the purchase of crop inputs and farm equipment;
(g) establishing a project evaluation unit; and



(h) preparation of plans for the continued provision of
project services after the investment phase of the
project is completed.
34.       The project is designed on a scale that would have an impact,
given the size and population of the country. There is the added advantage
that the project would provide practical training for Nigerian staff in the
technical and administrative management of projects of this type, and if
successful, the project concept could be applied to many areas of northern
Nigeria.
Project Execution
35.       The project would be managed by the Gusau Project Management Unit
(GPMU) which would carry out the day-to-day management operations. GPMU would
be responsible to the Cusau Project Executive Committee (GPEC) for budgetary
and policy control; the Chairman of GPEC would be the Permanent Secretary of
the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) of NWS. GPMU and GPEC would be established
as a condition of loan effectiveness in a form and with membership, functions
and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank. GPMU would have its head-
quarters at Gusau, the main centre of the project area and would enjoy autonomy
greater than that afforded to the technical divisions of MA. GPMU would co-
ordinate its activities at a Federal level through a Federal Coordinating
Committee.
36.       The GPMU would be responsible for the procurement, distribution and
sale, for cash or credit, of fertilizers, seeds, insecticides, sprayers, ox-
drawn equipment, tractors and other necessary farm supplies and would decide
on the suitability and composition of any package of inputs offered to farmers.
37.       The creditworthiness of each loan applicant would be certified by a
project approved farmers' association; this would be part of the mutual gua-
rantee policy that GPI'U would pursue.  Provision would also be made to extend
credit to groups or to village farmers' associations if farmers wish to pool
input requirements and assume joint liability for credit. Before the begin-
ning of each planting season, a schedule of proposed lending terms falling
within the range of 5 to 9-1/2 percent would be furnished by GPMU to GPEC
which would, in consultation with appropriate Nigerian Authorities and the
Bank apply the lending terms for the planting season.
38.       Recognizing the need for considerable improvement in primary market-
ing, the project would take various measures to improve marketing in general.
These would include improved weighing and measuring devices and village storage
facilities by a number of marketing reforms for statutory crops such as timely
announcement in accordance with existing practice at the presentation of the
annual Federal Budget; establishment and enforcement of greater discipline of
Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) and produce inspection staff.

39.       Both the Federal and State Government recognize the need for qualified
and experienced staff to administer the project and assure high technical stand-
ards in its field implementation. The northern states are generally short of
qualified personnel to fill key project management and senior technical posts
and the demand for personnel with such expertise remains high. NWS is fully
aware of the problem of staffing the project adequately and is prepared to
recruit staff internationally, where qualified Nigerian personnel are not
available. International recruitment is expected to be necessary for the
managerial posts of Project Manager, Chief Accountant, Chief Engineer, and
Chief Technical Officer, and a condition of loan effectiveness would be that
such posts in addition to that of Chief Administrative Officer to be recruited
locally, had been filled. Existing staff in the project area would come
under the project and additional staff would be transferred to the project
from other areas of the State. Priority during the first two years would be
given to the project for those Agricultural Assistants completing ongoing
training courses. On-this basis, sufficient professional and technical staff
would be available. Retroactive financing of US$150,000 is proposed to cover
the appointment of key personnel referred to above with effect from July 25,
1974.
40.       A degree in Agriculture is offered by the Ahmadu Bello University
at Zaria in the North Central State (which also serves all six northern States)
and it is expected that some of the graduates would be recruited for the
project. In addition, the Division of Agriculture and Livestock Service
Training (DAIST) of ABU also offers both a 3-year diploma and a 2-year certi-
ficate course in various aspects of agriculture which could be utilized for
middle management training for the project. The NWS also operates (a) farm
training centers for the training of Field Supervisors (FS), the lowest grade
of extension worker and (b) farm institutes for farmer training. Provision
has been made under the project for the up-grading of the existing Gusau Farm
Institute to a Farm Training Center and for the construction of a new Farm
Training Center at Kaura Namoda, both of which would be used, in the initial
years of the project, to train project staff particularly FS and Credit Assis-
tants (CA). Such training would initially consist of simple short courses
on specific crops and associated problems. FS would receive further training
after a period of field experience, and thereafter regular refresher courses.
Credit and Marketing staff would be trained in a similar manner through a
series of in-service courses. Later on, the emphasis would be more on farmer
training. It is not anticipated that the recruitment of individuals for
training as FS, CA and other junior technical posts under the project
would present any serious problems as the basic level of primary education
throughout northern Nigeria is relatively good and, as there is an increasing
surplus of West African School Certificate holders on the labor market.
41.       In addition to the training of lower level staff discussed above
and the training of higher level staff on an in-service basis, GPMU would
also pay particular attention to the training of selected staff to fill
managerial functions. In this respect, internationally recruited staff
would, as one of their responsibilities, ensure the adequate training of



w 13 -
their subordinates, and would be required to submit to GPEC through the
project manager, quarterly reports on the training aspects of their sections.
The project manager would have the overall responsibility for ensuring that
an adequate management training program is maintained and would report regu-
larly on its progress in order to satisfy both the NWS and the Bank of the
adequacy of the program. Additional funds have been provided under the
project for the recruitment of a training specialist in the event the project
manager considers this necessary.
Project Costs
42.       Project costs are estimated at US$37.4 million of which the foreign
exchange component would be US$17.7 million or 47 percent of total costs.
Details of project costs are given in Annex III. Project costs include a 5
percent physical contingency, and a variable price contingency (7-12 percent
compounded) over the proposed five-year loan disbursement period. Contin-
gencies amount to US$9.3 million or 25 percent of total project costs. The
Bank loan would finance 50 percent of the total project costs which would
cover the entire foreign exchange costs and a small percentage (7%) of local
costs amounting to approximately $1.3 million. A summary of the proposed
financing plan for the project is given as follows:

Procurement
43.       Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers, insecticides,
farm tractors and implements, where orders or contracts have a value of more than
US$25,000 would be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accor-
dance with IBRD guidelines. Such procurement is estimated to have a value of
about US$11.4 million. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15
percent preference when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign manufac-
turers. Contracts for the construction of buildings, staff houses, and the
purchase of construction materials and furnishings valued at US$5.4 million
would not be attractive to foreign contractors, due to the dispersed locations
of the works and the small size of individual contracts and orders, and
would be awarded under locally advertized competitive bidding. Bona fide
domestic contractors would reccive a 7-1/2 percent preference in bid evalua-
tion. Construction of roads, water supplies and soil conservation works
estimated at US$6.7 million would be carried out on force account due to
the shortage of suitable medium scale contractors who normally would undertake
this work. However small contractors would be employed to the maximum extent
feasible. A large part of project costs (estimated at US$11.6 million) would
be for labor, staff salaries and allowances, vehicle maintenance and operations,
general services, and project evaluation, and, as such, would generally be



- 15 -
unsuitable for competitive bidding. Those items not included specifically
under procedures for ICB or advertized locally would be purchased through
commercial channels.
Disbursement
44.       The proceeds of the Bank loan (US$19 million) would be disbursed over
five years (1975/76 - 1979/80) to cover 50 percent of total project costs and
would be expended against the following categories:
-    100 percent of the cif cost of directly imported vehicles,
heavy plant, and equipment or 76 percent of the cost of
these items if locally procured, totalling US$2.0 million;
-    100 percent of the cif cost of directly imported farm
tractors and equipment, ox-drawn equipment, spraying machines,
fertilizers, insecticides, battery sets and seeds or 71 percent
of the cost of these items if procured locally, totalling US$3.5
million;
-    100 percent of the cost of internationally recruited staff
amounting to US$1.6 million;
-    60 percent of the cost of buildings, staff housing
and construction material and labor for roads, dams and
soil conservation works, totalling US$3.2 million;
-    60 percent of local staff costs amounting to US$2.8 million;
-    60 percent of the cost of the field evaluation unit
amounting to US$0.5 million;
-    an unallocated amount of US$5.4 million to cover
physical and price contingencies.
45.       Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against import documentation,
contracts and certified records of expenditures. For disbursements made
against certified records of expenditures, documentation would not be submitted
for review as a matter of course, but would be retained by the project manage-
ment unit for scrutiny by Bank supervision missions. Any of loan funds remaining
after the completion of the project would be used to further develop the
project area.
Economic Benefits and Justification
46.       The economic rate of return from investment in the project is esti-
mated at 16 percent. The project's principal direct benefit would be the
incremental increase in farm production that it would generate, and which would
result directly in higher incomes for some 41,000 farm families of about
US$220 per family or US$41 per capita and better living standards for a further



- 16 -
27,000 who would benefit through the improved infrastructure and marketing
arrangment within the project area. If the non-farming population, traders,
laborers, etc. are included, then about 620,000 people would in one way or
the other, receive primary or secondary benefits through project activities.
Some of the more immediate benefits which would accrue from the project
include, (a) a general improvement in communications, and an increase in
local trade and employment opportunities for the non-farming population
in the project area; (b) a degree of stabilization of the North Western
State population in more productive activities; (c) the use of the project
by NWS to test new development, credit and marketing techniques that could
be quickly applied to other state farmers, and the extended use of the
seed multiplication centers for the provision of improved seeds to farmers
in other parts of the State; (d) annual net incremental foreign exchange
earnings amounting to some US$5.7 million that will accrue to the FMG coffers
once the project attains full production; and, (e) the use of information
accumulated by the project evaluation unit in the formulation of future
agricultural policy and resource and financial allocation throughout the
country by FMG. In general terms, the project should result in improved
farm management practices and some reduction in income disparity while ensuring
a more even food supply for Nigeria's urban population and the expanding
commercial livestock industry.
Risks
47.       In any agricultural project dealing mainly with smallholders the
success of which would largely depend on adequate rainfall as well as the
timely staffing of a number of new organizations, involves risks. However,
it is believed that the project would minimize such risks, given the
provision of competent management and proven technical innovations; the
farmers are hardworking, and the production to be induced by the project
is in high demand on both the domestic and export markets. No serious ecolo-
gical risks are envisaged though the possibility would be closely monitored
and the necessary corrective action taken.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank and the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the North-
Western State of Nigeria, the report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.  Projects in Execution
Credit 72-UNI, Education Project: US$20.0 million
Credit of March 1, 1965; Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Loan 814-UNI, Second Education Project: US$17.3 million
Loan Of April 18  1972; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
Loan 929-UNI, Third Education Project: US$54.0 million
Loan of_August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The first education project (72-UNI) had a late start in implementa-
tion, particularly in the three eastern states which were affected by the
civil strife between 1967 and 1970. Execution of project schools in these
states is at working drawings stage while the majority of project schools
in other states are under construction. Completion of work in eastern
states might take about two more years. Fxecution of the second education
project (814-UTNI) is generally satisfactory, although it is twelve months
behind schedule and special implementation assistance would be needed in
one state to avoid further delay. The third education project (929-UNI)
has not yet been declared effective pending appointment of consultant-
architects and execution of subsidiary loan agreements and legal opinion.
The effectiveness date has been postponed to December 31, 1974. Action
to appoint consultant-architects and to fulfill the other conditions of
effectiveness is progressing.
Loan 427-UNI, Western Road Project: US$145. million
Loan of September 26, 1965; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Loan 694-UNIL Transport Rehabilitation: US$25.0 million
Loan of June 26, 1970; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Loan 838-UNI, Fifth Highway Project:  US$26.3 million
Loan of June 16, 1972; Closing Date:  June 30, 1977
There has been a saving of $2.5 million in Loan 427-UNI, out of which
procurement of road machinery and conduct of a photogrammatic survey would
be financed and the balance, estimated at approximately $2 million, would
likely be cancelled. Construction work and procurement under the Transport
Rehabilitation Loan (694-UNI) have proceeded satisfactorily except for
procurement of some railway equipment which has been affected by administra-
tive delays as well as delays in delivery schedule due to the energy crisis.
However, deliveries are now proceeding satisfactorily and the loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by March 31, 1975.
Loan 705-UNI, Ni erian Industrial Development Bank: US$10e0 million
Loan of August 28, 1970; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
This loan is fully committed. Withdrawals out of this loan in 1973
were slower than expected owing to cancellation of sub-project loan commit-
ments.

Loan 76h-UNI, Western Cocoa Project: US$7.2 million
Loan of June 23, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Loan 1045-UNI, Second Cocoa Project: US$20 million
Loan of October 11, l974; Closing Date: September 30, 1981
Though there was delay under Loan 764-UNI in the establishment of
the Cocoa Development Unit and only 65 percent of first year planting
was achieved, excellent progress was made and the 1973 planting target
and 1972 backlog have been fulfilled. The Second Cocoa Project (Loan
1045-UNI) is expected to become effective by January 1975.
Loan 847-UNI, Fourth Power Project: US$76.0 million
Loan of June 30, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This loan became effective only on June 13, 1973, owing to delay
in connection with the Loan Assumption Agreement for the previous Bank
loans in this sector. Progress on the Bank project is considered satis-
factory.
Loan 922-UNI, Second Lagos Ports Project: uS$55 million
Loan of August 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This loan became effective on October 29, 1973 and implementation
of the project is proceeding satisfactorily.

Procurement
Procurement of all items where orders or contracts had a value of
more than US$25,000 valued at US$11.4 million through international competitive
bidding (ICB) with domestically manufactured goods being allowed a 15 percent
preference in bid comparison. Contracts for civil works not large enough to
attract foreign contractors valued at US$5.4 million to be awarded under
locally advertised competitive bidding though foreign firms would not be
precluded from bidding. Domestic contractors as defined by the borrower and
accepted by the Bank would receive a 7-1/2 percent preference in bid evalua-
tion. Construction of roads, water supplies and soil conservation works
valued at US$6.7 million would be carried out on force account though petty
contractors would be employed to the maximum extent feasible. An estimated
US*11.6 million would be for labor, staff salaries and allowances, vehicle
maintenance and operation, general services and project evaluation and as
such generally be unsuitable for competitive bidding. Items not qualifying
for ICB or local advertisement to be purchased through local commercial
channels. Remainder of project costs of about US$9.3.million would be con-
tingencies.
Economic Rate of Return
The economic rate of return from investment in the project is
estimated at 16 percent.
Appraisal Report
Report No. 354a-UNI dated September 6, 1974.
1/   Project costs include a 5 percent physical contingency and a variable price
contingency based on the Bank's Central Projects staff guidelines for treat-
ment of project costs over the proposed five-year disbursement period.
Total price contingency equivalent to 32 percent of baseline costs.
Fertilizer costs, which have increased out of proportion to other costs
were amended at negotiations to reflect current prices, and because the
average current 1980 prices have been projected to be about the same as
the current 1974 prices, price contingencies for fertilizer have not been
included.
