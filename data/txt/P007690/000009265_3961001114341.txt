MEMORADUM Alll) RECOFlDlTIOI 0T   PRESIDENT
0  THE IBID TO TDE ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIEA, S.N.C.
WITH TUE GUARANM  0 TlHE UNITED MEICAN 8TTZES
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.      The following morandum and recommndation on a proposed loan to Nacional
Pinanciera, S.N.C. (lAPIN) for US$250.0 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by the Unitcd Mexican
States, would be repayable over 17 years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's variable interest rate. NAMN ould be the Borrower and the Secretariat of
Education (Secretaria de Educact6n Publica, SEP) and SEP's State Level Education
Entities (SCRPs) would be the executing agencies.
2.      Batkgrggd. After nearly a decade of deep recession, Mexico's successful
economic reform end restructuritg program has placed the country back on a growth
track. Nowever Mexico's potential for sustained growth is still constrained by
relatively low levels of human capital formation. Although considerable progress
ws" achieved between 1950 and 1980 in expanding the education system, the 1984
Income-Expenditure survey shows that 201 of the population has no education and
another 551 has at most six years of schooling. There also exist striking and
persistent differences in terms of the level of education among regions and income
groups, strongly correlated with differences in the incidence of poverty; average
schooling rAnges from 3-4 years in the south to 7-9 In Mexico City and the north.
3.      The two issues of low educational levels and unequal distribution of
educational opportunities can be directly related to critlcal deficiencies in the
provision of basic education services, in particular at the primary level. While
enrollment ratios are high (982 at the national level), the quality and internal
efficiency of the primary school system are low, characterized by high repetition
and dropout rates and low cognitive achievement. This problem--fsr more acute in
the poorest states--can be linked to: (i) deficiencies In teacher training; (ii)
lack of educational materials; (iii) teacher absenteeism and misallocation; (iv)
weak evaluation and supervision; and (v) inadequate physical facilities and
difficulty of access in remote areas. This situatLan has worsened considerably
since 1982, when the drastic decline in public educational expenditures began.
Spending cuts have been more severe than in other Latin American countries
enacting fiscal austerity measures (total public education spending fell from 5.01
of GDP In 1982 to 3.21 in 1988) and have affected primary education most of all.
The current level of spending per primary student Is far below the level in other
Latin American countries with similar per capita lncomes.
4.      In 1989, Government education policy changes were announced in the
lEducation Modernization Program 1989-94," which sets as its major objectives:
C1) increases in the level of education among the population; and (ii)
improvements in overall educational quality, with basic education identified as
the foremost priority. More specifically, first, the Government Introduced this
year a new curriculum vhich has been revised with the objective of providing
itcreased continuity between the three levels of education and second, it proposed
to complement this action with: (i) programs targeted at reducing repetition and
dropout rates; (1i) classroom rehabilitation and construction; (i11) a reorganized
teacher training system; (iv) improved supervision and evaluationg (v) continued,
but gradual, decentralization; and (vi) lncreased community participation. Viewed
in Its entirety, the program is well-targeted, ambitious and designed to improve
the efficiency and equity of the education sector.

S.       ationsa for- Bnk Group g  nvoovement. The proposed project is an integral
part of the Bank's assistance strategy for Mexico, supporting growth recovery and
poverty alleviation. By assisting the Mexican Government in Improving both the
efficincy of educational expenditures and the quality of services, the project
will help remove human resources constraints on growth. By focusing on primary
education and on four of the most disadvantaged otates (see para. 6), it will
also, together with the Bank's Low Income Housing, Basic Health Care and
Decentralization snd Regional Development projects, address the needs of the poor
and thus contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational opportunities.
This effort would also be supplementee' by the proposed Initial Education Project
(under preparation) which would emphasize early childhood development as an
effective means to improve children's readiness for learning.  Currently, the Bank
ti the only International financial aid agency working for primary education in
the poorest states.
6.      Proiegt Objectives. The proposed project vould iWprove the quality and
efficiency of primary education, focusing on four (Oaxaca, Guerrero, Chiapas and
Nidalgo) Mexican states with the highest incidence of poverty and low educatlon
indicators. These objectives would be achieved through: (i) reducing the high
repetition and dropout ratest (Ui) raising the level of cognitive achievement of
childrens and (iiI) strengthening management of the primary education system,
Including program design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
7.      Proiect Descrl2timn.  The project consists of two major components:  (a)
the Educatlonal Services Improvement Component (72 percent of the total project
cost including contingencies) would: (i) provide educational materials, books for
school libraries and some bilingual reading books in primary schools, mostly
rural; (ii) upgrad skills of underqualified teachers and provide in-service
training for prlmry school teachers and teacher trainers, using traditional
methods as well as distance education technologies; and (III) rehabilitate,
replace and construct efucational facilities; and (b) the Institutional
StreuLthnlnas Coggonent (28 percent of total project cost) would: (i) provide
work incentives for teachers; (li) improve the supervision system;
(I11) strengthen the organization of the support service delivery system and the
management capacity of the SEP at the federal and state levels; (iv) support
improvements in the information, monitoring and evaluation systems; and (v)
conduct celected studies to assess the impact of project activities and help
refine future program design. The project implementation would be carried out b7
the SP at the central level and by the SEP delegation. at the state level
(SCEPs), which are key institutions reaponsible for the actual delivery, operation
and management of educational services.
8.      The total project cost is estimated at US$352.0 million equivalent,
including taxes and duties (estimated at US$39 million), with a foreign exchange
component of US$44.4 million equivalent (12.5 percent). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of US$6.0 million equivalent would be granted for
oependitures incurred after March 22, 1991. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report go. 9770-ME, dated August 28,
1991, is being distributed separately.
9. Zm.ggem2gatlon ArrkgnRments. The borrower would be WAIN, which would act
as the administrator of the loan. The proceods of the loan vould be disbursed



-3-
during a six year period. The project would be Implemented through the existing
orgsni.ational structure of the SP, sand implementation responsibilities would be
Phar.d between the central level and SEP's state delegations. Overa'? authority
jor project magnement would be vested In SEP's Underescretariat for Educational
Coordination. The Undersecretary would be assisted in the general management of
the project by a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) directly associated with the
General Directorate for Planning, Programming and Budgeting (DGPPYP) at the
central levol and by State PCUs (SPCUs) placed under the Director of that state's
SCEP.
10.     Issues "ad Actions.  During nuogtlgaE      agreements were reached on the
following main issues: (a) mchan_ism to uonitor teacher attendance at training
sessions and distribute corresponding incentives; (b) a detailed description of
the teacher training courses and training materials, would be submitted to the
sank by June 30, 1992 for review; (c) the detailed description of all distance
education (audiovisual) programs would be presented to the Bank by April 30, 1992
for approval; (d) SEP would monitor and present during annual reviews the entire
civil works program carried out by SEP and by the Solidaridad Program;
(a) evidence regarding donation or purchase of land for new construction and
adequate staffing would be provided during the annual work plan reviews; (f) the
technical plans for the remaining two thirds of school rehabilitation works
planned for the first year of the project would be submitted during the rest of
1991, and plans for subsequent years during annual reviews; (g) the list of target
schools selected for the first year under the teacher incentive program, with
subsequent year school selection to be agreed with the Bank during annual reviews;
(h) terms of reference, implementation schedules, short list of consultants,
collaboration of foreign consultants, and model consultant contracts for the
studies on project impact evaluation and cost-effectiveness, bilingual books,
teacher incentives, the TV pilot program, and the project's impact on chil6iren's
behavior, end availability of data collected to the Baok; (i) staffing plan for
the PCU and the SPCUs, appointment of the PCU operating director, and several key
staff of PCU and SPCUs; the Government would finalize appointment, by the date of
Loan effectiveness, of all operating directors of the SPCUs, all other staff, and
appoint staff for the technical committee associated with the PCU; (j) performance
indicators and project progress review criteria regarding project monitoring and
evaluation to be used for annual and mid-term reviews; (k) undertaking of annual
reviews by the G¢vernment with the Bank to discuss previous year implementation
and next year work plans; (1) In-depth mid-term review to assess project
performance and initial impaot, focusing on the effectiveness of teacher and
supervisor incentives, the library and bilingual books program, the distribution
system, teacher training and the pilot TV program, with results to be submitted to
the Bank by September 30, 1994 for its review and comment, and action plans,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be prepared and init:.ated by November 30, 1994;
and (m) the Govarnment would prepare and submit to the Bank an addendum by
February 29, 1992 to the existing agreement between federal ond state educational
authorities to unsure that state authorities would collaborate with SCEPs to
monitor project Implementation in state schools.
11.     The conditions of effectiveness ares (a) presentation for at least two of
the project states of detailed proposals on how to implement the procedures in
SEP's preventive maintenance manual for infrastructure, furniture and equipment;
with the remaining two states to present implementstion plans by June 30, 1992;
and (b) presentation of evidence that the central and state PCUs are adequately
staffed In accordance with the staffing plan agreed upon during negotiations.
Conditions for disbursement aret (a) for the pilot programs, presentation of a



-4-
detailed proposal for too work to be done by Radio-Television de Osmca,
specifying the implemntation schedule; and t .' warehouso  construction,
Submission of en nventory cotrol system satisfactovy to the Bank.
12.    Proieet Benefits. The proposed project wold support Government progrms
for improvin both the quality and effiLcency of primary education, focusing on
four states with high incidence of poverty and lou education indicators. The
level of cognitive achievement of children as well as the probability of their
completing the primry education cycle &re expected to increase. Benefits would
thus consist I n higher rate of human capital accumulation contributlig to
econmic developmnt. They would also consist In a more equal distribution of
economic opportunities among Mexican children. The project would improve the
efficiency of public resource use by reducing repetition and dropout rates and by
increasing tbo amount of tivestments with high social rates of return.
Institutional strengt46enig would contribute to a better allocation and increased
productivity of human resources within the sectors and to an enhanced capacity to
evaluate and monitor educational policies and programs. Approximately half of the
chlldren who would benefit from the project would be girls. Therefore, additional
benefits are expected, as research has demonstrated that increasing the level of
education of women has a sinificant positive effect on the health status and
educational attainment of their children, and that it also contributes to lower
fertility. The impact may be particularly significant for girls from the
indigenous population.
13.    Rsks agd Uncertainties. The main project risks are aSsociated with
possible delays in project execution due tot (4) possible teachers' union
opposition to Government policy changes; and (11) limited implementation capacity
at the stato level. The risk of teacbers' union opposition is difficult to
address. However, the improvement of work conditions for teachers and supervisors
that the project would bring about and the recent success of the Government (and
In particular, of the SCEP directors of the states involved) in handling union and
employment issues provides some confidence that this risk can be minimised. The
project attempts to reduce the second risk throught (a) the provision of training
and technical assistance to the states; and (b) close monitoring from the central
level. To lncres"e SEP staff familiarity with Bank procedures, a project launch
seminar to cover implementation aspects would also take place soon after loan
effectiveness. The risk of slow implementation would also be alleviated, on the
one hand, by the high priority given by the Government to improving economic aud
social conditions in the poor southern project states, and on the other hand, by
the strong commitment expressed on repeated occasions by SEP towards the project
objectives as well as the dedication and work already invested in the project
preparation.
14.    Re¢mm ndat o* I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
