HAND TUBEVELL PROJECT (CREDIT 1140-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the implementation of the
Hand Tubevall Project in Bangladesh for which Credit 1140-BD in the amount of
SDR 14.8 million was approved on May 17, 1981. The Credit was closed on March
31, 1988 and the undisbursed balance of about SDR 955,061 was cancelled. An
amount of SDR 2.5 million was previously cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the
Asia Regional Office and is based, inter alia, on the Stuff Appraisal
Report; the Credit, Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda;
and discussion with government officials.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on May 3, 1990, for comments by Jur.e 14,
1990, but none were received.

1/   Credit effectiveness was delayed because GOB took time to meet the
conditionalities. Project implementation was consequently delayed.
2/   Credit closing date was extended thrice; first to expand the scope of the

HAND TUBEWELL PPROJECT (CREDIT 1140-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
1.       The main objectives were:  (i) to increase the income of very small farmers
by providing them with an access to affordable irrigation technology; and (ii) to
provide safer water supply to the rural population.
Implementation Experience
2.       During the initial period, there were production difficulties due to
inadequate funding for import of essential materials. Also, the controlled prices
of project HTW were below market costs, thus undercutting private sector production.
This was corrected following IDA intervention. However, during the last project
years the situation reversed and project HTW had to compete with lower priced HTW
offered b; the private market.
3.       The pace of sale of HTW was slower than anticipated at appraisal.  The main
reasons were: (i) sales were confined to cooperative members only; (ii) the
cooperatives were often short of resources to provide the necessary credit to
farmers; (iii) inefficient HTW allocation procedures by BRDB; and (iv) inability
of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) to supply complete HTW sets
during the peak selling season.
Project Results
4.       Socio-economic surveys indicate that although significant numbers of HTW
were purchased by larger farmers, small farmers have also gained significant access.
Also, project HTW were used mostly (952) for drinking water supply. However, HTWs,
when used for irrigation, were mostly for irrigation of high-value crops.
Sustainability and Lessons Learned
5.       With more than 400,000 HTW installed throughout the country, this
technology is now well established in Bangladesh. However, the procedures
introduced under the project for distribution of HTW are clearly unsustainable.
These were intended for a transition period, in which the technology was considered
to still be in its "infant" stages. However, as the review of project
implementation indicates, public sector interventions resulted in inefficiencies in
both production and distribution.
6.       With the technology now well known throughout the country, there is no more
place for public sector involvement in production/distribution of HTW. Special
assistance with HTW to the poor would be better provided by the NGOs and
institutions like the Grameen Bank.

MAND TUBEWELL PROJECT (CREDIT 1140-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       Agriculture is the dominant sector in the Bangladesh eiconomy
accounting for nearly 502 of the Gross Domestic Product. Agricultural
production is severely constrained by the scarcity of cultivable land and
natural hazsrds. The heavy pressure of population on land poses a major
development constraint. It is estimated that more than 502 of farm households
cultivate less than 2.5 acres, the minimum holding necessary to provide
subsistence income at the existing production levels. Farm holdings are
segmented into as many as 10 parcels. This constitutes an obstacle to
efficient farm management. Rural institutions are weak and a firmly entrenched
rural power structure tends to monopolize limited services such as
agricultural credit. Rural infrastructure is poorly developed and safe water
supplies are the exception rather than the rule.
2.       The main thrust of the Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) agricultural
development strategy has been, and continues to be, to increase food
production, to give all farmers equal access to crop production inputs and to
provide employment opportunities to landless families. - was recognized that,
to achieve these objectives, a major effort would be req-ired to overcome the
shortage of minor irrigation equipment, spares, fertilizer &nd other inputs.
.he irrigation technology prevalent at the time of project formulation - Deep
Tubewell (DTW), 'hallow Tubewell (STW), and Low Lift Pump (LLP) - is more
suited for use by individuals or groups of larger laneholde-s because of the
(relatively) large irrigation coverage (DTW 80ac; STW l2ac; T 3 50ac). On the
other hand, hand operated tubewells (HTW), discharging 8-10 gpm and capable of
irrigating about 1/3 ac of paddy using family labor, are ideally suited for
catering to the needs of the farmers with small holdings. Moreover, HTWs are
inexpensive, easy to install and maintain and can be manufactured within the
country.
3.       GOB, with IDA's assistance, formulated and implemented a Medium-Term
Food Production Plan (MTFPP) for the period 1980-85. The Plan focussed on
increasing minor irrigation facilities such as DTN, STW, LLP and HTW and on
increasing the sup-ly of production inputs including availability and access
to agricultural credit. The Bank assisted the government in these efforts
through the following projects: North Vest Deep Tubewell (Cr. 321-BD), Shallow
Tubewell (Cr. 724-BD), Low Lift Pump (Cr. 990-BD) and Rural Development II
Project (Cr. 1384-BD) and the subject project. (Annex I)
4.       GOB had constituted a committee with representatives from the
project's implementing agencies and the executing Ministry to prepare a
Project Completion Report (PCR). The Committee prepared the report and
submitted it to IDA in April 1988. Since GOB had prepared the report on the
basis of the previous guidelines, this report has been prepared by the Task
Manager, as an 'old style' PCR. This report iL also based on a review of the
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 3280 BD, dated April 17, 1981), the Development



Credit Ag.eement (dated July 8, .981), IDA supervision mission reports,
project files and discussion with government officials.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL
Proiect Origin
5.       The basis of IDA's consideration in 1978, of a HTW project originated
from the rapid sale of 7000 HTWs financed under the IDA assisted Rural
Development I Project. However, at that time Bangladesh Agricultural
Development Corporation (BADC) and the Integrated Rural Development Board
(subsequently renamed Bangladesh Rural Development Board), each had one large
ongoing Manually Operated Hand Tubewells for Irrigation (MOSTI) programs to
sell 90,000 and 150,000 HTWs respectively. Since UNICEF w&s committed to
follow-up with their successful MOSTI project, an IDA project was not pursued.
Subsequenitl.y when UNICEF was not able to proceed with a follow-on project, IDA
was requested by GOB to finance a HTW project.
Project Preparation and Appraisal
6.       the project concept and scope were simple, based upon ts- experience
of the two HTW projects already implemented by GOB. However, the appraisal
mission did raise some policy issues. These were:
(a) making pig iron and coke eligible for import by individual and
groups of industrial finms rather than solely by GOB;
(b) increasing the sale price of HTWs sold to farmers under the GOB
projects to a level that would allow full cost recovery and leave
a margin for profitability to any private firms and marketing
agents interested in producing and supplying this equipment to
farmers in competition with GOB projects; and
(c) prcviding medium-term credit through the banking system and
through the UCCAs for the purchase of the HTWs.
7.       In response, GOB argued that the existing foundries did not have the
experience to import the raw materials required for fabricating pumpheads.
The bank therefore agreed that the pig iron and hard coke (required to produce
complete pumpsets) and galvanized iron (- I.) pipes and brass wire mesh (for
strainers) were to be procured by DPHE following ICB procedures. The local
suppliers would be given a preference limited to 15X of the c.i.f. value of
imported material or the import duty whichever is less. Contracts far



-3-
fabricatl;ai wear  to be let following local competitive bidding procedures
satisfactory to IDA. Under this arrangement DPHE was to provide foundries with
the required amount of pip iron and coke for a specified number of pumpheads,
on the basis of fixed coefficients (80 pounds of pig iron and 20 pounds of
nard coke per pumWhead). The foundriea would then supply the pumpsets to DPHE
at the price specified in the contract. It was agreed that strict quality
control woald be ensured so that the foundries would supply the hand tubewells
according to the standard specification agreed under the project.
8.       GOB reluctantly agrfed to slightly increase the price of the
equipment to be so80 under the project and to maintain parity with HTWs sold
under other GOB projects. The price that was agreed on, was not a "full cost"
price since indirect taxes were excluded. An adequate dealer margin was
included in the sales price. A national Hand Tubewell Coordination Committee
was set up to review the prices of both the private sector and the project
hand tubewell prices with a view to ensuring parity in hand tubewell prices.
The provision of medium-term credit (for the members of the farmers
cooperatives) was also agreed to by GOB.
Project Description
9.       The major objective of the project was to increase the  production
and incomes of very small farmers by giving them access to appropriate
irrigation technology. Secondary objectives were to provide safer domestic
water supplies and to encourage the domestic manufacture of irrigation
equipment.
10.      The project was to be implemented nationwide in areas having suitable
ground water conditions, i.e., (a) sweet-water bearing sand within sixty feet
of ground surface; and (b) a static water table within 20 feet of the surface
during the period of peak irrigation requirements (AprillMay). It was to
produce and distribute 180,000 (later increased to 270,000) hand tubewells
over a three year- FY1981 to FY1984 (later extended to FY1988) period,
Pumpheads and strainers were to be fabricated by qualified foundries and
machine shops in Bangladesh under contracts with Department of Public Health
Engineering (DPHE), and the complete pumpsets were to be distributed by DPiE
to the Upazila Central Cooperative Association (UCCAs) from which they were to
be sold to the farmers. The project was to provide major and minor tool kits
for private mechanics to install and service hand tubewells. There was
provision for simple training for village mechanics. Medium-term credit. was to
be provided to purchase the hand tubewells and the tool kits. The project
provided for an internationally recruited quality control consultant to work
with a Quality Control unit in DPHE to be set up under the project. The
project also included a program of research and testing of appropriate hand
tubewell equipment with the objective of finding and developing design



-4-
improvements to increase the efficiency of minor irrigation and then promoting
the improved design(s) towards privatization in a follow-up HTW project.
11.      The IDA Credit of US$18.0 M was to finance about 80Z of the project
cost excluding duties and taxes. It was to cover the full foreign exchange
cost (US$16.2M) and about US$I.8M equivalent of the local costs. Farmers
purchosing hand tubewells and tool kits on medium-term credit were to
c'ontribute a downpayment equal to 102 of the hand tubewell price, net of taxes
and duties. The balance would be the medium-term loan repayable in equal
annual installments over a three-year period. About 15? of the farmers were
expected to purchase hand tubewells on a cash basis. GOB was to finance the
balance of the project costs including taxes and duties. Funds were to be made
available to the implementing agencies in the form of budgetary allocations in
the Annual Development Plan (ADP).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Experience
12.      Table 1 gives a summary of physical achievements under the project.
Several events determined the need to make some changes from the SAR estimates
during project implementation. During 1982, in the face of
exceptionally severe economic constraints and the necessity to reduce the
overall size of the ADP, the government appointed a Martial Law Committee to
review all projects and programs. This review resulted in a scaling down of a
number of projects. In the course of this pruning, several components of the
HTW project, e.g., vehicles, laboratory testing, and consultants for the
mid-term review and for the management information system, were cut or
deleted. The research and testing component was reduced from $200,000 to only
$10,000.
Production of HTWs
13.      According to the appraisal estimate, the 180,000 HTW sets  (50? of
which were 2-pipe sets and 502 3-pipe sets) were to be produced and
distributed as follows: 1981-82 - 40,000; 1982-83 - 60,000; 1983-84 - 80,000.
Production and distribution were delayed for several reasons. During the first
year none were produced because the major raw materials (pig iron aud hard
coke) could not be imported due to lack ox adequate funds in the ADP (a
problem common to many projects at that time)- Once this budgetary allocation
problem was resolved, GOB banned the international procurement of 1 1/2 inch
diameter G.I. pipe. Procurement of G.I. pipe was held in abeyance while IDA
insisted that in order for the procurement to be eligible for IDA financing,



-5-
10B procedures would have to be followed. The ban was walved temporarily in
the early part of 1983 and then for the duration of the project in June 1985.
The waiver of the ban was made a condition by IDA for the expansion of the
project scope and extension of the Credit closing date proposed by GOB in 1985
(para 16).
14.      The fabricatio-n & *   pumpheads was also initially slow to start
because of the delay in  ,.iunting the quality control consultant. The delay
was due to DPHE's initial _.eluctance to adh.re to IDA's guidelines for
appointment of consulting *ervices. To expedite the fabrication work, the
Resident Mission of the Bank appointed a local consultant for a month (June
1983). From July 1983 DPHE hired the same local consultant for the entire
project period.
15.      As part of its austerity program, Government banned for a short time
international travel of officials. This prevented travel for pre-shipment
inspection and led, in some cases, to shipment of inferior quality material
and to short shipment. Due to tL. relatively small quantity of materials (less
than one shipload) procured by DPHE. only one or two offers were received in
response to calls for ICB tender and this led to retendering and delays in
procurement.
16.      In mid-1984, the Government requested IDA to finance additional
90,000 HTWs and 180,000 sets of spare parts out of the credit savings, as well
as extend the Credit closing date from March 31, 1985 to March 31, 1985. The
mid-term review had estimated the demand for HTWs at full-cost pricing to be
around 400,000 additional units during the Third Five-Year Plan period
(1985-1990). The review also identified a need to provide for di3tribution of
spares under this project since spare parts were apparently being stolen from
UNICEF/DPHE stores and sold in the market to meet the demands for spare parts.
17.      IDA agreed to the request based on the assessment that a  proposed
follow-on HTW project would not be approved by the time of the closing of this
project (March 31, 1985); hence the need to fill the gap by increasing the
number of HTWs and to extend the closing date. However, with the inordinate
delays (about 6 months) by both IDA, in processing the request for extension,
and by GOB in counter-signing the draft amendment letter on the expansion of
the project scope and consequent delay in the procurement of raw materials and
GI pipes, sufficient HTW sets could not be supplied by DPHE to meet demand.
The Government requested a further 15-month extension to June 30, 1987; RMB
also agreed that a 15-month extension was warranted in light of the GOB fiscal
year ending on June 30, the expiration of the PP and inadvisability of
terminating the project in the middle of the sale season. However, in keeping
with the current guidelines, IDA approved only a one-year extension (to March
31, 1987) with the proviso that a limited additional extension could be



-6-
considered upon review of the progress of project implementation. In order to
complete the field testing and the sale of the total 270,000 HTWs, the Credit
was again extended to March 31, 1988.
Pricing of HTWs
18.      In early 1984, a mid-term project review by a World Bank consultant
found that, though the Taka price of most local products using imported raw
materials had increased as a result of the substantial devaluation of the Taka
since appraisal, the price of project HTWs had not been increased accordingly.
In effect, there had been a real reduction in the net-of-taxes prices that had
been agreed to by GOB. The project HTWs were undercutting the market for
private sector production. Subsequently the Bank recommended that the
Government increase the price of project HTWs (Table 2). After initial stiff
resistance GOB eventually agreed to an increase. It should be noted though,
that the project HTWs are of a much a higher quality than those traditionally
offered by the private sector, and could have been expected to command a
premium.
Sale of HTWs
19.      The pace of sale of HTWs was much slower than anticipated at
appraisal (Table 3). This was due to a number of factorst (a) HTW sales were
confined by a directive of Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB), to only
members of KSS (Farmers Cooperative Society) when the SAR clearly stipulated
that HTWs would be sold to all farmers for cash, while only members of the KSS
would be eligible to receive credit; (b) most UCCAs did not have the required
liquid funds to pay for the HTWs from the DPHE stores (the procedure was that
the farmers paid 15Z of the price as downpayment and the balance had to be
pre-financed by the UCCAs from its own resources); (c) the procedure of
central allocations of the HTWs by BRDB head office, based on Project
Directors' reports on demand, did not allow any reallocation between UCCAs in
the event that any UCCA failed to lift its allocation within the specified
time, or if the demand in some UCCAs exceeded the allocation; and (d) the
inability of DPHE to supply complete HTS  sets during the peak selling season
(November to May) due to delay in procurement of raw material.
20.      Based on the recommendations of the July 1985 supervision mission,
BRDB liberalized the sale of HTWs to include non-members of the KSS and also
decentralized the system of allocation of HTWs so that it was more responsive
to the demand situation. To solve the problems of inadequate funds, several
UCCA's an arranged overdrafts against the shares and savings of the
cooperative society's members with a commercial bank and took delivery of HTW
sets from DPHE stores. This arrangement is not permissible under cooperative
rules. As a result of the above changes, as well as the publicity campaign
carried out by BRDB at the suggestion of the supervision missions, the sales
performance improved somewhat.



-7-
21.      Demand for 3-pipe HTWs exceeded appraisal estimates. In part,  this
may have been due to a price differential with the private market. The ban on
the importation of GI pipe had allowed the price of locally produced GI pipes
to be increased. Since the project obtained a waiver from the import ban, GI
pipes were procured through ICB at least 25 to 302 cheaper than the prevailing
market price. The demand for the extra set of pipes may have been influenced
by this price differential, and possibly, the extra pipes were resold by the
farmers at the higher market price. Alternatively, it may have been due to the
falling water table due to groundwater irrigation development in several parts
of the country. This was not anticipated at appraisal. Since the actual reason
for the increased demand for 3-pipe HTW sets could not be ascertained, the
April 1986 supervision mission recommended that BRDB should allow UCCAs to
satisfy the customers demanding a HTW set with 3 pipes first, rather than
constraining sales momentum by limiting sales to 50S for 2-pipe sets and 502
for 3-pipe sets. This flexibility also boosted sales. As a result of the sale
of more 3-pipe set than estimated, several thousand pumpheads without pipes
were left. The supervision mission recommended that these pumpheads be offered
to the foundries on the basis of the buy-back option (para 26).
22.      Contrary to appraisal estimates, HTWs were largely sold for cash
(about 95Z). This was because of a combination of factors: (a) inability of
farmers to use credit because they could not give collateral or could not get
hold of a guarantor to recommend them for a loan; (b) reticence of UCCAs to
process credit purchases because of the paperwork needed for a small size loan
and the substantial effort necessary to recover the loans; and (c) high demand
among those willing and able to pay cash.
23.      Sale of HTWs in the second extension year was impeded by an increase
in price, 18X for 2-pipe set and 212 for 3-pipe sets, necessitated by
increased prices of raw materials and GI pipe. Furthermore, project HTWs had
to compete with lower-priced pumpsets (with PVC pipes and wells) sold by the
private sector, and also with the low-price indigenous Rower and the Treadle
pumps sold under various NGO programs.
24.      The project provided for a buy-back option where interested foundries
and machine shops could buy back 202 of the pumpheads fabricated and pipes
holed by them (Section 3.11 of the DCA). Initially, the foundries and
workshops were not interested in this option: the workshops, because the holed
pipes were of little use alone; the foundries, because the pumpheads produced
under the project were significantly more expensive than the ones produced
outside the project (although the latter were of inferior quality). In the
interest of expeditious disposal and preventing the physical deterioration of
stocks, the November 1987 supervision mission recommended that the foundries
and the workshops should be offered the unlimited buyback of whole pumpsets.
IDA modified the relevant section of the DCA to accommodate this. A number of



-3-
the foundries then became interested - the below-market cost of the project GI
pipes possibly provided the inducement. A total of 65,093 complete hand
tubewell sets (242 of the total) were sold back to the foundries and
workshops.
Trainins of Mechanics
25.      About 2030 persons had been trained on the installation  repair and
maintenance of HTWs. The project target was 2000. According to the findings
of a survey carried out by BRDB, mechanics training program has created a
cadre of professional mechanics.
Procurement and Distribution of Toolkits
26.      Of the targeted 25000 sets of toolkits, 250 major and 1100 minor
toolkits had been procured. These kits were to be sold on credit to trained
mechanics and farmers. Due to delay in the procurement of toolkits and
inability of BRDB to establish link with the participating commercial bank
provided in the project provide credit, the distribution of tool-kits was
delayed. However, with the increase in the price of toolkits in the market,
sales picked up and almost all the toolkits were sold by FY88.
Sale of Spare Parts
27.      None of the HTW project (UNICEF MOSTI, USAID SSIP) including this,
included spare parts for the pumpsets. Each assumed that local foundries and
machine shops would supply parts as demanded. The mid-term review of the
project found that there were a scarcity of spare parts and recommended its
inclusion in the extended project. Subsequently, 180,000 sets of spare parts
were provided in the project. Of which the UCCAs sold only 38,000; and
another 38,000 were sold through the buy-back option. Sale was difficult
because the spare parts procured under the project cost more than the inferior
quality available in the market. At the time of proj*jct completion, the spare
parts sets were being sold in open auction.
Research and Testin8
28.      As mentioned earlier, the research and testing component was
initially dropped from the project. It was later re-incorporated in the
revised PP in 1985, but implementation was delayed because the Local
Government Division did not agree to the consulting firm recommended by the
Research and Testing Committee set up by the RD Division.  The research and
testing confirmed that a follow-up project should cover a range of pump types,
including TARA for areas where the depth of water table is more than 6.5
meter.



-9.
Civil Work
29.      The project provided for one regional store, in addition to DPUE's
three, to overcome the storage problem of HTWs. Due to the slow pace of sales,
UTW sets remained at DPHE stores for a long time without proper maintenance,
such as regular greasing. Due to shortage of space, some HTW material, such as
brass strainers, were kept in the open and consequently corroded. After
repeated requests by supervision missions, DPHE began a maintenance program,
but only in the last year of the project.
B. Project Costs
30.      Total project cost over a period of four years was estimated at Tk.
482M (US$ 3514). Project completion however was extended to six years and
Tables 4 and 5 present the actual project expenditures and a comparison
between the appraisal and the actual project costs. Though the credit became
effective in the FY82, there was no allocation in the ADP for the project.
Actual expenditures under the project exceeded appraisal and PP estimates.
This has occurred due to increases in: (a) operating costs, (b) HTW production
in the revised project (para 15, and (c) cost of civil works and inclusion of
spare parts in the revised project. (para 15) Expenses for incremental staff
increased due to upward revision of salaries. With the increased number of
HiWs produced, the local cost of HTW production was higher than original
estimate. The construction cost of a storage godown at Natore was also more
than appraisal estimates. Finally, the inclusion of 180,000 sets of spare
parts also increased the cost of the project.
31.      There was also savings of about $400,000 in the credit because
several components were cut or deleted. As a result of these reductions, as
well as favorable bids on purchase of raw materials, exchange rate changes and
the appointment of a local instead of an expatriate consultant for quality
control, there were overall savings of about SDR 7.2M.
C. Financing and Disbursements
32.       Total financing from IDA was USS 14.74M or 82? of the tvtal Credit
amount. Contribution from GOB was US$ 5.57M or 65? of the appraisal estimate
(Table 6). Since the bulk of the HTWs was sold on cash, farmers contribution
was significantly more than the appraisal estimate of 152 of the farmers
buying with cash.
33.      Disbursement of IDA Credit was slow throughout the project period. At
the end of FY85 (the original project completion year) only 30? of the Credit
amount was disbursed against 100? of the appraisal target. Major reasons for
slow disbursement were the delay in the procurement of raw materials for MTW



-10-
fabrication and G.I. pipes. The bulk (about 652) of the Credit was to finance
these items.
D. Consulting Services
34.      The quality control consultant did an excellent job of checking the
quality of all raw materials and finished goods and advising the foundries on
production matters as well as advising the Research and Testing Committee.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Implementing Agencies and Coordination
35.      The project was to be implemented by BRDB which is an agency under
the Rural Development and Cooperative (RD) Division under the Ministry of
Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (LGRDC). The Director
(Field Services) of BRDB served as the project manager, and a full-time Deputy
Director was assigned to assist in carrying out the day-to-day project
administration. A sub-project management unit was established in DPHE, an
agency under the Local Government (LG) Division under the Ministry of LGRDC in
the office of the Superintending Engineer for Planning, who became the
manager. A full time Executive Engineer was assigned to assist him.
36.      Project implementation was affected because the participating
agencies of the government did not act expeditiously. In the initial years of
the project, implementation was delayed due to inadequate funding provided by
the Planning Commission. The initial rigid attitude of the Ministry of
Commerce about the waiver of the ban on the import of GI pipes procured under
the project also considerably delayed project implementation. The inordinate
delay by ERD to countersign the amendment letter to the DCA also affected
implementation because awards for procurement of raw materials had to be kept
in abeyance till signature.
37.       Project management was negatively affected by inadequate cooperation
between the two Divisions - RE and LG. This resulted, inter alia, in the delay
in the appointment of the consulting firm to carry out the field testing of
the different pump types.
38.      Project management within BRDB was initially slow to monitor the
performance of the sales program. Centralized allocation procedure for HTWs
adversely affected sales. BRDB could not advise UCCAs to resolve their
liquidity problem to purchase HTWs from DPHE stores. However in the later
years of project life, management in both DPHE and BRDB has been quick in
taking decisions such as in the case of the unlimited buy back option and
auctioning to expedite sales. BRDB, being a non-technical agency, has to be



-11-
complemented for the efficient handling of the field testing of the handpumps
through the Research and Testing Committee.
39.      DPHE management always considered the project as BRDB's and that
their responsibility was the supply of complete pumpsets. DPHE failed to
coordinate the distribution of the pumpsets with the peak selling season
(November-May) of the HTWa9. This was one of the causes of the delay in sales.
Project Monitoring
40.      The project had made provisions for technical assistance for
development of reporting procedures and information feedback. BRDB did not
use the technical assistance but, on their own, prepared reporting forms for
monitoring performance. The format was reviewed by the Resident Mission of
the Bank and was found adequate. The main problem was delay in the submission
of the reports which supervision of HTW sales very difficult.
Compliance with Covenants
41.      The status of compliance with covenants was satisfactory. All the
covenants have been complied with albeit some with slight delay. Annex II
gives the status.
V. PROJECT IMPACT
Findings of the Socio-Economic Surveys
42.      Two socio-economic surveys of the project were carried out. The first
survey was done in 1984 and the final one in 1987. The 1987 study Was
conducted in 12 upazilas in four divisions with a sample size of 2344
households. The major findings are:
(a) Landholding Pattern (Table 7)
- HTWs distributed during the early years of project period mostly
benefitted the larger farmers owning 2.5-5 ac of
cultivable land, while about 45Z of the subsequent batches of
HTWe went to the small farmers owning 1.5 ac or less;
- in the Rajshahi division, 44Z of the beneficiaries were small
farmers;
(b) Occupation of HTW Purchasers (Table 8)
- self-employed farmers were the dominant group (66Z) to purchase
BTWe; 18Z went to traders and businessmen;
- among the HTW users, the share of landless and sharecroppers was
6Z, most of whom were in Rajshahi division;



-12-
(c) Organisational Affiliations (Table 9)
- The KSS farmers bought most of the early consignments of HTWs;
in subsequent years however the women's cooperatives and the
rural poor groups were allowed to purchase project HTWs;
td) Land Under Cultivation (Table 10)
- HTW users cultivating 0.5 - 1.5 ac and 2.5 - 5.0 ac both V-re
modal   households with 482 and 34Z share of HTW respec.         y;
- the modal group of HTW users cultivating 0.5 - 1.5 ac was
followed by group cultivating 1.5 -2.5 for about 19? of the
cases;
te) Irrigation (Tables 11,12 and 13)
- though HTW buyers had access to other irrigation equipment,
small farmers used less of other irrigation technology;
- for 49Z of the cases, HTW purchasers did not irrigate any land
which implies that these HTW were used for drinking water.
- only 4.5? of the project HTWs were used for irrigation; 21? for
both    irrigation and drinking water, and 10? for drinking
water and kitchen garden;
(f) Crops Cultivated (Table 14)
- in irrigation, HTWs were primarily used for vegetable
cultivation (51?) followed by water melon, chilies, pulses and
paddy;
(g) Sources of Finance (Table 15)
- About 86? of the households purchased HTWs from their own
savings;
- among the sample households, no farmer bought HTW with credit
from comercial banks.
(h) Impact on Women (Table 16)
- women from 32Z of the household owning HTW increased production
of kitchen gardens.
- most of the women with access to HTW saved enormous time in
fetching water;
4S.      The above findings indicate that while the smaller farmers have
gained access to HTWs in large numbers, a significant number of HTWs have gone
to the larger farmers, businessmen and traders. One plausible explanation is
that access to credit was inadequate and only those with ready cash had access
to project RTWa. Irrigation by HTWs was a relatively new concept and this
project was to demonstrate that HTWs are well suited for winter vegetable
cultivation.
44.      The project has been successful in facilitating private sector
development in the manufacture and sale of No.6 handpumps. Local foundries
have been established or expanded to manufacture all pumpheads for the
project. After attaining capability to manufacture handpumps, the big



-13-
foundries are now capable of selling as many as 1500 pumpheads on average per
month through their own dealer networks. Furthermore, about 227 UCCAs earned
more than Tk 24 M in comissions from the sale of project HTUs.
Project Sustainability
45.      The benefits of the NTWs sold under the project are likely to be
sustained throughout the lifetime of the equipment. The project HTWs are of
superior quality and therefore more durable than other HTWs available in the
market. There are more than 400,000 HTWs installed throughout the country and
users generally are able carry out minor repairs. The mechanics trained under
the project, as well as the toolkits supplied, will be useful to carry out
major repairs and maintenance of the project pumps. There are a large number
of mechanics operating at the village level. The forty foundries which
participated in the fabrication work have benefitted from the guidance of She
quality control consultant and this will have a lasting effect.
46.      Although no major risk was identified during appraisal, the risk had
been mentioned that, in some areas, the installation of DTW and STW may dry up
HTWs. In some areas this has happened and more cases can be expected. However,
this is not a major problem since farmers can lift HMes and sink them
wherever groundwater is available, or the equipment can be sold to farmers in
other areas.
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
47.      At appraisal, economic rates of return (EU) was estimated to be 442.
When costs and benefits of drinking wacer HTWs were excluded, ERR was
estimated at 47Z. Sensitivity tests indicated that the project was more
sensitive with respect to changes in yield and price changes but for all
expected extreme changes in the variables, the project would maintain a rate
of return well above the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 122.
48.      Since project HTWs were mostly (951) used for drinking water and less
for irrigation, there could be lower economic returns. On the other hand, when
used for irrigating high-value crops, such as vegetables, fruits and chilies,
project HTWs achieved high returns. Although a re-estimation of the project
economic impact was not done due to lack of data, a conservative assessment
may be made based on the above observation and the fact that there is a heavy
cash demand for HTWs.  While overall returns may be somewhat lower than those
estimated at the time of appraisal, the investment in BTWs remains
economically viable. Furthermore, the availability of pure drinking water had
a positive impact on the health of the rural population.



-14-
VII. IDA PERFORMANCE
Prolect Desin and Appraisal
49.      The Bank's preparation and appraisal missions were combined because
the government's project preparation was believed to be satisfactory. The Bank
processed the project documentation expeditiously.
50.      Though the procurement arrangements were cumbersome, they were
necessary to ensure the availability of raw materials to the foundries at the
world market prices in the face of GOB's restrictive policies on imports.
There was no evidence that the project in any way disrupted the flow oi
imports by the private sector. The import of coke and pig iron has since
become considerably freer than when the project began.
Supervision
51.       In addition to the formal b4-annual supervision carried out by both
headquarters and resident mission staff, the project has been subjected to
continuous supervision by RMB. The supervision missions identified key
problems which impeded project performance and provided solutions. On numerous
occasions, the RMB bad to perform the task of a mediator between the two
divisions within the Ministry responsible for project implementation. RMB also
had to intercede on behalf of the implementing agencies, first with the
Planning Commission to provide adequate budgetary allocation, and then with
the Ministry of Commerce, on behalf of ERD, to allow ICB procedures to oe
followed for the import of the GI pipes under the project which was a
condition for the extension of the Credit closing date. Furthermore, the Bank
(particularly RMB) played an advisory role. A case in point is the suggestion
to GOB to modify the buy-back procedures so that the unsold stocks of project
UTWe can be sold.
VIII. LESSONS LEARNED
52.      The main lessons from project implementation are as follows;
(a) The appraisal mission assumed that credit was essential to influence
demand for HTW and to make them accessible to smaller farmers. The
experience of the project has been that credit was not necessary to
create demand and was not sufficient to direct HTWs to sma'a3r
farmers. The fact that more than 801 of the HTWs have been sold for
cash demonstrates that larger aumbers of buyers exist who are willing
to pay cash for the relatively small numbers of HTW available. Until
this demand is filled, there will not be much effective demand for
HTW credit.
(b) Provision of credit will not direct limited supplies of HTWs to
target population. Increased supply of RTWs combined with provision



-15-
of credit are practical ways to reach larger numbers of small
farmers.
(c) Government's objective to provide cheap HTWs to poor farmers cannot
be achieved until it addresses immediately the perverse policies of
high levels of nominal protection on both inputs and outputs of the
GI pipe sub-sector. In addition, the duties on raw materials for the
foundry sub-sector exceed the weighted average duty rate of all
imports for the country as a whole. When these issues are addressed,
HTWs can be made available at much lower prices.
(d) Due to groundwater changes since 1980, deep set manual alternatives
should be promoted in areas with falling water table.
(e) Any future HTW project should emphasize private supply and
distribution of HTW equipment.

heads to      participating foundries and holed pipes to participating
found-ies and holed          pipes to participating machine shops.  Since the
foitLjries were initially not        interested in the pumpset only, to
expedite sales, it was agreed by IDA and GOB         to allow unlimited sale of
whole pumpset to interested foundries and workshops.
[4] GOB sold the balance through auction.
[5] GOB has auctioned off the unsold stock.
