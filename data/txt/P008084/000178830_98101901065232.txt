CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
SUI-lARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has requested Bank assistance
to reequip Caroni Ltd., a company which controls 90% of ithe sugar industry in
Trinidad.  Caroni Ltd. was formerly a subsidiary of Tate and Lyle Ltd., a
well-known British company registered in London, but a majority nolding of
51% of the equity was purchased by Government in August 1970.  Tate and Lyle
Ltd. still retain 32% of the equity, the balance being held by numerous small
shareholders.  Caroni Ltd. is the largest single commercial enterprise other
than the oil companies, and is the biggest employer of labor apart from the
Government itself.
ii.       Oil is the mainstay of the national economy.  In 1971 it contributed
19% of GDP, whereas agriculture contributed only 7%.  Ncvertheless, agricul-
ture provides direct employment for 24% of the working population and is of
direct or indirect benefit to many more. It contributes 15% of total exports,
of which 60% are sugar products. Sugarcane has been grown in Trinidad and
Tobago for 350 years and has played an important part in the development of
the islands. Despite its turbulent history, and periods of extreme depres-
sion, sugar is still the most important local crop. It occupies a taird of
the cultivated land, employs 45% of the agricultural labor force, and is sec-
ond only to oil as a source of foreign exchange. The industry has not been
profitable for most of the last decade, largely due to rising costs and static
or declining output. As a result, much of the plant and equipment is in need
of replacement, while administrative and technical operaitions are also in
need of review.
iii.      The project appraised in this report would corntribute to the re-
establishment of Caroni Ltd. on a viable basis, by meanss of a loan to reequip
its factories, transport fleet, harvesting and field equipment. The Project
would also prov*1ie_funL4s to complete land preparation prior to the intri-auc-
ti-6n-uf~f(anical cane harvesting on'those cane lands' that lend theemselves
to -duIt~mechan±zatioi, "and-to ¢underta1oe three technical studies designed t6'
improve opefBtioridrand administrative efficiency.  The Project would be the
second agricultural lending operation the Bank has helped finance in Trinidad
and Tobago.
iv.       Project costs over a five-year rehabilitation period are estimated
at US$21.9 million, 85% of which represents foreign excliange. The Bank would
finance US$12 million, the balance being provided by Caroni Ltd. from self-
generated funds. The loan would be disbursed over a four-year period, and
would be repayable over 15 years, including a grace period of five years for
the repayment of loan principal. The loan would be made direct to Caroni
Ltd. at an interest rate of 7-1/4%, with Government providing the necessary
guarantee, for which it would receive an annual 1% guarantee fee from Caroni
Ltd.



- ii -
v.        Procurement of all factory, transport and field equipment, totaling
US$15.1 million would be by international competitive bidding, apart from minor
orders unlikely to attract international Bids. Technical assistance, training,
and research services, totaling US$1.94 million, would be obtained from suit-
ably qualified organizations. It is proposed that the Bank retroactively
finance equipment amounting to US$1.5 million which is already in the process
of being procured, since procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank have
already been followed.
vi.       If net profits are compared withn investment costs, including the
value of assets at their book value as a cost incurred in the first year,
the annual financial return on capital employed is 5.3% in 1972/73 rising to
7.8% in 1979/80. The financial rate of return on incremental investment is
17%, while the economic rate of return is 26%. The latter figure is based on
the assumption that without the investment proposed in the Project the Trinidad
sugar industry would decline to a point of collapse over a 10-year period.
vii.      The Project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$12 million,
provided steps are taken as agreed during negotiations.



TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.01      The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has req'iested assistance
from the Bank to reequip the factories, transport fleet, and field machinery
operated by Caroni Ltd., which controls 90% of the sugar industry in Trinidad.
The Company was formerly a subsidiary of Tate and Lyle Ltd., a well-known
British company registered in London, but a majority holding of 51% of the
equity was purchased by Government in August 1970. Tate and Lyle Ltd. still
retain 32% of the equity, the balance being held by numerous small private
shareholders. Caroni Ltd. is the largest commercial enterprise other than
the oil companies, and is the biggest employer of labor apart from the Govern-
ment itself.
1.02      The Company's equipment was known to be in a rundown condition, and
following the takeover one of the new Board's first actions was to commission
a detailed appraisal of the plant by Tate and Lyle Technical Services Ltd.
This was completed in October 1971. Caroni Ltd. concluded that US$20 million
was required to bring the factories and transport and field equipment to
acceptable levels of efficiency and reliability, of which half could be pro-
vided from self-generated funds and half should be obtained from outside
sources.
1.03      In December 1971, the Bank sent a mission fromn the Industrial Proj-
ects Department to Trinidad to preappraise the project. Following the mis-
sion's recommendations the project was entrusted to the Agricultural Projects
Department. This report is based on the findings of two Bank missions which
visited Trinidad in April/May 1972 and August 1972. Tte first mission was
composed of D. Gold and P. Greening (Bank) and R. Innes, A. Arben and M. van
der Berg (consultants). The second mission was composed of P. Greening, S.
Thillairajah, P. Hazell and M. ElGhali (Bank) and A. Arben (consultant).
Other Bank Projects
1.04      The proposed Bank Group financing would be the second loan to
Trinidad and Tobago for agricultural purposes. The first was a loan for
US$5 million in 1967 to assist the development of small farmers on Crown
Lands. After initial difficulties implementation of the Project has been
satisfactory and disbursement of the loan has almost been completed.

II. BACKGROUND
A. National Features
Geography and Climate
2.01      Trinidad and Tobago are geographically part of South America, at
the nearest point only 16 miles from the coast of Venezuela, and are the
most southerly islands of the West Indies. The two islands combined cover
an area of 5,128 sq km (1,980 sq miles). In 1971 they had a population of
1.03 million people, of whom approximately one half lived in the rural areas.
Over the last decade the population has on average increased at 2.1% annually.
2.02      The climate is tropical and although there is a well defined dry
season, temperature variations are slight throughout the year. Total annual
rainfall is erratic but the average is usually between 60 and 70 inches, the
North aad West being a Little dryer than the South and East. As a rule the
rains start at the end of May and continue to December, with a brief spell
of dry weather in September. The dry season is from January to May, but
this pattern cannot always be relied upon.
Land Use
2.03      Only 35% of the land is available tor agriculture.  The remaining
65% is either forest (45%), urban areas (8%), swamp (2%), or abandoned tree
crops and secondary woodland (10%). Tne 35% of agricultural land represents
445,000 acres, but of this some 100,000 acres are either ir shifting cultiva-
tion or semi-derelict tree crops. The net affect is that only 25% of the
land area, or 345,000 acres, are under effective cultivation.
2.04      The principal crops are sugar, cocoa, citrus, coffee, and coconuts.
Of these sugar is by far the most important, with cocoa a poor second. In
addition various root crops, vegetables, pulses and sweet potatoes are g&:rWn,
largely for subsistence. There are approximately 36,000 agricultural hold-
ings in Trinidad and Tobago, of which 47% are less than four acres and 72%e
less than nine acres in size. Most of the country's livestock are raised on
small holdings. Annex 1, Table 1 lists production statistics for the various
agricultural commodities.
Agriculture and the Economy
2.05      011 is the main stay of the economy, contributing 19% of the GDP
in 1971. This figure has declined from 28% in 1963, but is expected to rise
again with the discovery of further oil and gas reserves. Agriculture on
the other hand contributed only 7%. Similarly, in 1971 petroleum exports
(aet of crude oil imports) were worth US$144 million or 55% of total exports,
while food products worth US$40 million contributed some 15% of total exports.
Sugar products represented 60% of these food exports. Food imports in 1971



totaled US$57 million, the principal commodities being cereals, milk and
meat products, and fruits and vegetables (see Annex 1, T'able 2).
2.06      Despite a high population density, a rising bill for food imports,
underutilized land resources, and 13% national unemploymlent, agriculture has
failed to make much headway in the last two decades. There are a variety of
reasons for this, including a poor social image, a badly structured industry,
inadequate marketing, credit and extension facilities, JEragmentation of hold-
ings, much part-time farming, and, for the most part, heavy soils of indif-
ferent natural fertility. In addition labor wages, inf:Luenced by the
petroleum industry, have risen to levels that the indusltry can hardly afford.
In spite of these problems, which are elaborated upon in Annex 2, agriculture
is important to Trinidad. It provides direct employme.ut for 24% of the
working population, and, since there is no clear cut distinction between the
urban and rural populations, it contributes to the subsistence needs of many
others.
B. The Sugar Industry
History of Sugar
2.07      Sugarcane was first introduced to Tobago and subsequently to
Trinidad nearly 350 years ago. The crop has dominated the economic develop-
ment of the country until the discovery of oil in more recent years, and has
had a profound effect on the racial origins and political development of the
,,people of Trinidad.  It is also responsible to a large extent for the   7,
vailing unpopularity of a        trp was grown on a large
niesEbf dl-rlNnHi]dC5nEES estates, each with its own small sugar mill, but by
a process of amalgamation over the years the numbers of' both estates and
factories have dwindled drastically. Where there were 300 small mills in 1800,
only two large and four smaller factories exist today. Sugar has had a
turbulent history. Periods of extreme prosperity have been interspersed with
even longer periods of extreme depression, and twice within the last 100 years
the total collapse of the industry has been forecast. More details are provided
in Annex 3.
Alternatives to Sugar
2.08      Despite its problems and unpopularity, sugar is the linchpin of
the agricultural sector. It occupies about one-third of the cultivated
acreage, employs 45% of the agricultural labor force, iLs more tolerant than
other crops to the poor soils and broken terrain, and Ls a crop in which
much capital has been invested, and in which there is a wealth of local
technical expertise and knowledge. Moreover, it has a well developed place
in world markets and is a product that is likely to be in rising demand.
2.09      There has been much talk of diversification out of sugar, but this
is not possible on a large scale in the short term. Tlhere is no alternative
crop with comparable export outlets nor one which could replace it as a source
of foreign exchange. Land presently under cane could in theory grow other



- 4 -
crops, but it would be unrealistic to expect a switch from cane without con-
siderable expenditure and the necessity for many new skills. Trinidad im-
ports considerable quantities of cereals and it is tempting to.suggest that
maize could be grown in lieu of sugar and at the same time save on grain
imports. However, local maize yields are low, and trials have failed to
show that large scale maize production is economically viable. Other attempts
at diversification have been made with bananas and coconuts but these have
not proved successful either. Long range, but only partial, alternatives
to sugar may exist, notably beef production, but at present such alternatives
have not proved to be profitable and there are a variety of technical con-
straints.
Present Structure of the Sugar Industry
2.10      In Trinidad in 1972 only three sugar companies are in operation
these being Caroni Ltd., Orange Grove National Co., Ltd., a.ad Forres Park
Ltd. The first is dominated by Government, the second is wholly owned by
Government, but the third is still in private hands. All three companies
both grow cane and process it in their own factories. In addition, there
are some 10,000 independent cane farmers who supply cane to the various
factories. The quantity of cane supplied by each farmer varies greatly, but
collectively farmers provide about 40% of all the cane grown each year.
2.11      Of the three companies, Caroni Ltd. is by far the largest.  It
grows most of the estate cane acreage, processes the bulk of the farmers'
cane in addition to its own, and manufactures 90% of all the sugar produced.
Hence Government, through its majority holding in Caroni and its complete
ownership of Orange Grove now controls 96% of the sugar industry. No investi-
gation has been made of Orange Grove or Forres Park, but neither is very
profitable. The Forres Park factory is old and costly to operate, and the
estate has recently been offered for sale to Government. If it were acquired,
Government would directly control the entire industry.
Sugar Production
2.12      In the past ten years the production of estate cane has been static,
averaging 1.5 million tons annually, mainly because of lack of funds and lack
of confidence in the future. During the same period there has been a steady
increase of farmers' cane from 0.7 to 0.9 million tons (see Annex 4).
2.13      National estate cane yields have averaged 28.5 tons/acre during the
last 20 years, and have in fact remained static for a considerable time.
Over the same period it has taken an average of 10.24 tons of cane to produce
a ton of sugar. This figure has deteriorated from an average of 9.89 tons in
1952-61 to 10.58 tons in 1962-71, illustrating that there has been a decline
in efficiency.
2.14      Peak production of sugar was achieved in 1965 with a total of
250,600 tons. In 1971, which can be taken as an average year, the three
companies produced 213,200 tons of sugar. Of this total Caroni produced



- 5 -
193,000 tons, Orange Grove 11,500 tons, and Forres Park 8,500 tons. This
involved the grinding of 1,375,000 tons of company cane and 937,000 tons of
farmers' cane.
2.15      The acreage under estate cane is approximately 56,000 acres, but
not all of it is necessarily reaped every year. Of this Caroni has 51,000
acres, Orange Grove 4,000 acres, and Forres Park 1,000 acres. In an average
year it is likely that 50,000 to 54,000 acres are actua'Lly reaped. No de-
tailed figures are availsble for the acreage of farmers' cane, 'ut, assuming
a yield of 17 tons/acre, it would be in the order of 54,000 acres. This
indicates a total cane area of 110,000 acres, or 30% of the total cultivated
land in the island. The crop dominates the entire west,ern areas of Trinidad
(see Map).
Sugar Institutions
2.16      Four institutions presently represent different interests in the
industry. The first of these is the West Indian Sugar Association (WISA)
which is a regional body set up in 1942 to administer the sugar quotas granted
to Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago urler the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement, the International Sugar Agreement, and United States Sugar
Act. These quotas are awarded to WISA and not to individual countries direct.
The second institution is the Sugar Manufacturers Association (SMA) which
represents the manufacturers rather than the growers of sugar, and serves as
a link between WISA and the local industry. The SMA has existed as an
informal body since 1920, but was given official status when WISA was estab-
lished.
2.17      The third organization is the Trinidad Island Wide Cane Farmers
Association (TICFA) which was established in 1957 to serve the interests of
the individual cane farmers. Lastly, there is the SugaLr Industry Control
Board (SICB) which was established by Government in 1966, primarily to serve
as an umpire between the sugar manufacturers and the cane farmers. For
further details see Annex 5.
2.18      Since Government has acquired control of the Orange Grove National
Company and Caroni Ltd., circumstances have changed, and both the SMA and
SICB have largely become outmoded. Institutional changes are recommended in
paras 4.23 and 4.24.
Sugar Marketing
2.19      There are five outlets for Trinidad's sugar, namely the local
market, other Caribbean islands, the United Kingdom, the USA, and Canada.
The bulk of exports are raw sugar. Details are given Ln Annex 4, Table 3.
2.20      Local Market.  This comprises domestic consumption including sugar
used for industrial purposes.  The local quota is, by Law, a first charge on
sugar production. The local price has, for largely political reasons, been
kept static for many years. Between 1953 and 1966 the price was TT$ 187/ton



-6-
for partially refined (washed grey) sugar, and TT$ 269/ton for refined sugar,
regardless of rising production costs and higher export prices (see para 5.06).
Since then price increases have been permitted, the 1972/73 prices being
TT$ 318/ton and TT$ 396/ton for washed grey and refined sugar respectively.
Local consumption has risen steadily, from 20,000 tons after the war to an
anticipated 42,000 tons in 1972. Of this 37,000 tons (88%) is Caroni's
share of the market.
2.21      Caribbean Market.  Since the formation of the Caribbean Free Trade
Association (CARIFTA) in 1968, it has been agreed that Trinidad should supply
a portion of the sugar needs of other West Indian islands. Trinidad's share
is 10,000 tons, of which 9,000 tons (90%) is allotted to Caroni. The current
1972 price is TT$ 299/ton for washed grey sugar, and TT$ 359/ton for refined
sugar.
2.22      United Kingdom.  Traditionally the UK has taken the bulk of the
island's exports in the form of washed grey sugar under the terms of the
Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.  Trinidad's share of the quot; is 132,100 tons,
of which Caroni is allotted 118,000 tons (89%), but Trinidad has not been
able to meet the quota every year. Exports in 1971 amounted to 123,000 tons
at an average price of TT$ 223/ton. The price has risen from TT$ 212 in
1962 to TT$ 293 in 1972.
2.23      United States.  The American market has been opened to Trinidad
following the Cuban crisis.  The US quota is, like the UK quota, allocated
by WISA.  Trinidad's share of the quota varies annually.  In 1971 it was
20,000 tons, Caroni's share being 18,500 tons (92%). Any US quota in excess
of the annual allocation is divided so as to bring the individual countries
of the US quota as near as possible pro rata to export availability. The US
does not provide a major outlet in terms of total tonnage, Jut the price of
TT$ 331/ton (1972) for raw sugar makes it more lucrative than any other
m arker.
2.24      Canada.  Trinidad's share of this market is 28,000 tons, Caroni's
allocation being 23,000 tons (89%). It has traditionally been a low price
market, though the price has recently risen to TT$ 293/ton. Canada has
served as a residual buyer for whatever sugar cannot be disposed of else-
where, and the Canadian Government has also made available a customs rebate
which has supplemented the low price to some extent.
2.25      Marketing arrangements have been relatively stable since the intro-
duction of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA) after the second World War,
and more recently under the International Sugar Agreement. The CSA has been
an important lifeline to the industry. It brought an era of prosperity in
the 1950's, though this was eroded in the 1960's due to a rapid rise in labor
costs. The big question marks for the future concern the impact on the CSA
of Britain's entry into the EEC, and whether sugar prices will harden appre-
ciably and permanently as world consumption begins to overtake supply in the
1980's (see para 5.05).

III. CARONI LTD.
Scale of Operations
3.01      The Company owns 72,000 acres of land, in effect most of the land
between Port of Spain and San Fernando. Of this some 51,000 acres is in
estate cane, 9,000 acres is rented to cane farmers, and the balance is either
unsuited for cultivation or is taken up by roads, buildings, and other facil-
ities. The Company's cane lands comprise approximately 31,000 acres in the
North and 20,000 acres in the South. The majority of the land in the North,
some 24,000 acres, is flat, and lends itself to full scale mechanization,
whereas in the So'uth 'most or _leff       Wrlyr9fidS only 2,o000 acres is flat
enough for mechiad4zed harvesting.  The 18,000 acres'of hill land in the 'Sou'th
an&--Ah -ut 7-,00 -acres of 'similar land in the North require much land labor,
and with Trinidad's pattern of rapidly escalating labor rates, this poses
obvious long-term problems.
3.02      About 22,000 people depend directly on the Company for a living,
i.e., 13,500 employees and 8,500 cane farmers. A large percentage of these
people are of East Indian origin who tend to have large families, so that it
is likely that a total of some 100,000 people are involved. To this total
should be added those that cater for and service company employees and farmers
in one way or another, possibly half as many again. This implies that a
total of 150,000 people, a seventh of the islands' population, are financially
dependent to a greater or lesser extent on the Company.
Field Operations
3.03      Cultivation methods differ considerably within the estate lands,
partly for geographical, and partly for historical reasons. In the North,
where much of the land is flat, there is increasing use of mechanization
for all operations; but in the South, due to its topography, cultivations,
other than initial land preparation, are still largely performed by hand.
Three very different systems of harvesting are used. The traditional hand
cutting and hand loading on small carts drawn by water buffalos, hand cutting
together with self-loading trailers, and full machine harvesting. The dev-
elopment of machine harvesters is impressive but cultivation methods require
review. There is also too much reliance on old cane varieties that have been
outclassed elsewhere in the Caribbean. Details of cultivation practices are
incorporated in Annex 6.
3.04      Much of the machinery used for cultivation, and for the transport of
cane from field to factory, is worn and in need of replacement. The Company
has not been able to do this due to its financial circumstances (see para
3.15).

Facto j y    eraLionS
3.05       Caroni Ltd. operates four factories capable of producing approxi-
mately a quarter of a million tolns of sugar annually.  The four factories
are sited at Woodford Lodge (with a capacity co produce 25,000 tons sugar
per year), Brechin Castle (115,000 tons), Ste. Madeleine (100,000 tons) and
Reform. (15,000 tons). Collectively the factories together can grind 19,000

has operated a distillery, at Couva, its products being rum, whisky, and
raw alcohol, whlie at Point Lisas there are elaborate facilities for the
shipping and storage o f raw sugar.
3.09       The study conducted by Tate and Lyle Technical Services Ltd., sub-
sequently Confirmed by a Bank study (see paras 1.02 and 1.03), concluLes that
substanLial investment is required to reequip three of the four factcrias and
the distillery.  Under the proposed project Ste. Madeleine, Brechtlii  aEs:le
and Woodford Lodge factories wouild be the three to be rehabilitated, and,
once this has been done, the Reform factory could be closed. For fuither
details see Annex 7.



-9-
Company Production
3.10      Estate cane production has remained static for the last 10 years,
ranging from 1.2 million tons to nearly 1.5 million tons annually, largely
due to weather conditions, with average cane yields fluctuating from 25 to
29 tons/acre. The 10-year average has been approximately 28 tons/acre.
Sugar production from estate and farmers' cane combined has varied from
180,000 tons to 213,000 tons, this being a reflection of cane yields and
the ratio of tons of cane to a ton of sugar (TC/TS ratio). The latter has
tended to increase over the years (see para 2.13). Several factors have
contributed to this, including an increase in malicious cane fires and the
necessity of having to mill increasing quantities of s:ale and dirty cane.
3.11      Sugar by-products include molasses, bagasse, and various forms of
alcohol.  Molasses production has varied in accordance with cane and sugar
production from 11 to 15 million gallons a year. It is used as an animal
feed or is distilled into alcohol. Production of alcohol has fluctuated
widely, depending on availability of markets, from a lolw of 225,000 to a
high of 580,000 proof gallons. Bagasse, the cane residue left after juice
has been extracted, is produced in large quantities, and is used mainly to
fuel the factories. There is usually a surplus of about 120,000 tons and
plans are now in hand to convert 50,000 tons of this into a form of fiber
board. A board factory, owned by a company in which Caroni Ltd. has a fifth
of the equity, is under construction near Brechin Castle. Details of sugar
and by-products production are given in Annex 4, Table 4.
Organization and Management
3.12      Caroni Ltd. has a Board of nine members, five appointed by Govern-
ment and four appointed by Tate and Lyle Ltd. The Government nominees reflect
its determination to ensure that political issues are not ignored, and that
any differences between the Company, its employees, and the cane farmers, are
resolved internally rather than in public. However, in achieving this it
appears that commercial considerations are often subordinated to social pres-
sures. In several instances commercial experience is lacking, and occasions
arise when Board members find themselves with divided loyalties. Existing
arrangements do not work well and there is considerable unnecessary contro-
versy. Improvements are suggested in para 4.25.
3.13      Company operations are run by the Managing Director who in turn is
assisted by a Management Committee consisting of five departmental managers.
These are: the Financial Controller, Commercial Manager, Operations Manager,
Personnel Manager, and Company Secretary. The Operations Manager in effect
controls the bulk of company employees since he is responsible for all field
and factory operations. For details of Company structure see Annex 8.
3.14      The present organization has been inherited from Tate and Lyle Ltd.,
and is to a large extent traditional in the sugar industry. Organizational
problems have arisen, partly aggravated by the departure of many senior ex-
patriate staff in recent years, and the entire organizational structure is
under review by the Company. Areas in which improvements are required are
mentioned in para 4.26.



- 10 -
Company Finances
3.15      Company profits have fluctuated during the last decade.  Modest
profits were made in 1964, 1965, 1968 and 1969, but these have been more
than offset by losses in other years. The summarized profit and loss accounts
and balance sheets for the five-year period to June 30, 1972 are provided in
Annex 8, Tables 1 and 2. The losses made during the last three years have
been 3o substantial that the financial position of the Compalny has become
unsou.nu, its licuidity threatened, and maintenance of the Company's assets
seriously neglected (see para 3.04). The Company has little working capital
for its 1972-73 operations and has been obliged to arrange for a bank over-
draft with a limit of TT$ 24 million (US$12 million). Ordinary dividends
were last paid in 1969, but preference dividends on 6% fixed interest stock
nave, h1owever, been paid annually.
3.16      There are various reasons for the poor performance during the last
10 years or so. Output has stagnated and has not kept pace with rapidly
rising costs, particularly labor costs, and management has been slow to
introduce reforms. Matters have been aggravated by militant labor unions,
high wages in the neighboring petroleum industry, and the injection of poli-
tical issues into unions affairs. Poor profitability has led to inadequate
investment in factories and field equipment, which in turn has led to poorer
overall performance and higher operating costs. Technical innovations such
as mechanization have not been introduced fast enough, partly for political
and partly for financial reasons, and the internal organization has been
excessively centralized. Operational and financial controls and planning
have been weak, and overheads have been allowed to rise too high. In short,
the Company has a record of poor industrial relations, outmoded attitudes and
inadequate technical performance.
Cane Farmers
3.17      At present, the cane farmers produce 40% of all cane handled by
Caroni. This is an increase on previous years, and reflects their increasing
importance to the Company.  Farmers' circumstances vary greotly and m.any are
only part-time farmers; some grow only two or three acres of cane, others
200 to 300 acres. The most important group are those with 12-20 acres of
cane, producing up to 500 tons each. Their importance has increased to the
point where this group of small farmers, although comprising only 21% of all
farmers, produces just over half of the total farmers' cane.
3.18      The majority of farmers are tenants.  Some rent land from the Com-
pany, but the majority rent from smaller private landlords. Often a farmer
will own some of his holding and rent other parts of it. Fragmentation is a
problem, and little attention has been paid in the past to providing adequate
extension or credit facilities. Apart from buying their cane and providing
a little seasonal credit, the Company has furnished no services to farmers.
Traditionally the Company has looked upon the farmers as a necessary nuisance
and liaison has been poor. Conditions have, however, improved markedly in
the last two years, following the Government's assuming control of Caroni
Ltd.



- 11 -
3.19      The larger cane farmers that rely on hired labor are faced with
the same pressures of rising costs as the Company, though not the same degree
of union activity. They claim they make relatively little profit out of
growing cane at current prices.                farmers u.n           lab9r r
much better in net cash terms.  Detailsof cane  arm ng operations are given
Labor
3.20      The sugar industry has always employed large numbers of labor, and
until relatively recently nearly all the field work of cane cultivation was
done by hand. The work is arduous, unpopular and considered degrading, par-
ticularly the harvesting of cane. Most jobs are done on a "task" or piece
work system, the standard task being about three to four hours work by an
able-bodied person.
3.21      Caroni currently employs some 13,500 people (field and factory
combined), about 25% of whom are women. Detailed employment statistics for
the period 1962 to 1971 are in Annex 10, Table 1. In recent years Caroni
has had difficulty in              sfci         el
harvesting operations, whic  ma           ly explained by the fact that in the
LuLa reas rhVlOl MPloyment figure is about 4%, in contrast to the overall
national figure TiirTh  reluctant to take on additional
permanent workers, because of the long-term commitment this would involve,
and is increasing its reliance on temporary workers, as shown below:
1969       1970        1971        1972
Temporary Workers Employed       425        497       1,403       1,287
Total Employees              13,377      13,606      13,583       n.a.
3.22      Trinidad has a history of well-organized labor unions and those
representing the sugar workers have been as active and aggressive as any.
Relations between Caroni management and the unions have not been good, and
the Company's efforts to introduce mechanization in order to cut costs and
reduce labor_ uumbprs have been continuously resisted.
3.23      The introduction of mechanical harvesters, first introduced in
1962, has been a particularly hard-fought battle. To the Company it has
become a vital issue. Wage rates have increased by more than 70% since
1964, and the Company has had to provide a wide range of fringebenef its
over and above cash wages.  During the same period labor productivity has
not improved to any marked extent, and the average price of sugar has only I
increased by 30% (see Graph No. 6850 in Annex 10). With labor now account-
ing for some 40% of total costs, Caroni could gain substantially from an
accelerated mechanization program. Considerable costs savings would arise
from reduced overheads, supervision and management costs apart from the,
eventual reduction in the number of workers.

- 12 -
3.24      From the Unions' viewpoint, each machine harvester is said to
replace 88 people, and is therefore a move to be resisted. It is probably
also true that while the Unions have succeeded in obtaining actual wage
increases of 70% since 1964, the workers in the sugar industry are paid
less than those in other industries.
3.25      Wages are likely to continue to increase at a fairly high rate in
the future, but the Unions have agreed in principle to a mechanized harvest-
ing program with Caroni which allows machines to replace field workers who
leave the Company through natural attrition (see Annex 11). This policy is
also acceptable to the Government, and is consistent with the judgments of
special Industrial Court hearings held in 1966 and 1969. A more rapid pro-
gram of mechanization would be commercially desirable but could not be im-
plemented for social reasons.
Housing and Social Services
3.26      Traditionally, labor on the estates has been badl- housed in
"barracks".  These have all but disappeared, thanks largely to the efforts
of the Sugar Industry Labor Welfare Fund. This fund, financed by a levy on
sugar of TT$ 2.40/ton exported, has since 1947 lent TT$ 17.5 million to
estate laborers to erect housing of their own. To date nearly 9,000 homes
have been built, and this has gone a long way to improving the standard of
housing. Cane farmers provide their own housing on their own holdings.
3.27      The Company has always provided medical services for its labor
but not for cane farmers. Facilities are good, though the expense to the
Company is considerable. Schooling is provided by Government. The Company
also maintains a large police force in addition to its watchmen, again at
considerable expense. Government has indicated that it is prepared to
assume responsibility for some of these social services (see para 5.09).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The Project would endeavor to enable Caroni Ltd. to become a pro-
fitable and more efficient producer of sugar, and thereby assist the Govern-
ment of Trinidad and Tobago to revitalize its sugar industry, and ensure that
it remains fully competitive on world markets. It would also safeguard and
improve the livelihoods of all those that work in the .ndustry at all levels
of employment, both employees and independent cane farmers (see para 3.02).
4.02      The Project would finance, over a five-year period, a program of
investment designed to improve the efficiency of field and factory opera-
tions, reduce costs, and enable the Company to undertake studies to improve
its management procedures.. The main components of the Project would be:
(a)  the overhaul and improvement of the Ste. Madeleine, Brechin
Castle and Woodford Lodge sugar factories, and an extension
of the distillery;
(b)  the renewal of most items of field machinery and transport
equipment;
(c)  the conversion of a further 12,500 acres of flat land from
cambered beds to ridges, thus permitting the further intro-
duction of machine harvesters;
(d)  three technical studies by outside consultants and the
appointment of a management advisory service,
(e) an expanded research and training program; and t
(f)  certain items of equipment to aid management and adminis-
tration.
4.03      The type of investment, and the phasing of expenditure would be:

B. Detailed Features
Sugar Factories and Rum Distillery
4.04      Detailed studies already made by Tate and Lyle Technical Services
and by the Bank (see para 3.09) would form the basis of the rehabilitation
program envisaged for the factories. Three of the factories, namely Ste.
Madeleine, Woodford Lodge, and Brechin Castle would be exte-isively overhauled,
while Ste. Madeleine would also be expanded.
4.05      The bulk of expenditure on the factories would be on Ste. Madeleine.
This would include two evaporation vessels, a new mill for No. 2 tandem, a
new vacuum pan, and expenditure on improvements to the feeder tables, the
centrifuges, and miscellaneous pumps and drives. At Brechin Castle the main
items would be a new roller for No. 1 tandem, tramp iron separators for each
tandem, improved,milling controls and a new crystalizer. At Woodfcrd Lodge
the main item would be a new crystalizer, while for the distillery the two
biggest items would be additional storage tanks and modifications to the
still. Further details are in Annex 12, Tables 3 to 6.
4.06      No increase in capacity is planned for Woodford Lodge and Brechin
Castle factories, the new equipment being required to keep the factories
running and to improve their performance and reliability. Both factories
would be able to handle a slightly larger annual tonnage of cane in the
future, made possible by fewer mechanical breakdowns. However, at Ste.
Madeleine where cane production presently exceeds factory capacity, an
increase in grinding capacity is envisaged. This would be done in three
stages, from 340 to 370 tch 1/ in Stage 1 (1974), to 400 tch in Stage 2
(1975), and finally to 430 tch in Staae 3 (1977). The Project would also
provide equipment for improvements to the rum distillery, the prime purpose
being to increase storage capacity and to improve the quality of the spirits
produced.
Field and Transport Equipment
4.07      Much of the existing field and transport equipment is either old
or worn out. Breakdowns, particularly of the transport fleet, are frequent.
Under the Project, much of this equipment would be renewed, either immediate-
ly or gradually over a five-year period. The main items to be procured would
be 144 tractors, IQ combine harvesters, 182 vehicles, 245 trucks and trailers
of various types, and a wide range of cultivation equipment. Details are
provided in Annex 12, Tables 7 and 8.
4.08      At present only 4,000 acres are being replanted aninually, which is
less than desirable. With better equipment this figure would be increased
to 7,000 acres annually, the purpose being to hasten the introduction of
better cane varieties and improve the ratio of plant cane to ratoon cane.
1/   Tons of cane per hour.



- 15 -
4.09      The further increase of mechanical harvesters would lead to consid-
erable cost savings, more timely harvesting, and improved output. It would
therefore receive high priority. The Company currently operates six har-
vesters which in 1972 harvested 130,400 tons from 4,600 acres of ridges. In
effect, the land conversion program is currently ahead of the introduction
of harvesters. The program envisaged calls for a balance to be reached by
1976, by which time there would be 18 harvesters in operation. Harvester
numbers would thereafter be increased more slowly to keep in step with the
land conversion program. Full mechanization of harvesting, which would be
limited to the flat lands of North Caroni, would be achieved in 1980, by
which time 20 machines would handle 24,000 acres.
4.10      The proposed mechanization program would lead to the loss of about
2,000 field jobs over the period 1973 to 1981. However, if the natural at-
trition rate of the permanent labor force continues at the present annual
rate of 4-1/2%, and if field workers who leave are not replaced, then the
labor force would decrease naturally by about 2,300 men over the same period.
The actual phasing of these labor movements are developed in Annex 11, where
it is shown that the mechanization program could be implemented without neces-
sitating any forced redundancies in the permanent labor force. The mechaniza-
tion program would therefore be acceptable to both labor unions and the Gov-
ernment (see para 3.25).
Land Formation
4.11      The reason for converting flat land from camb,ered beds to ridges is
to permit the introduction of machine harvesters and more extensive mechani-
zation of all cutltivations.  The Company has already converted 11,500 acres,
and the Project proposes that the conversion of the remaining 12,500 acres of
flat land in the North be completed by 1980/81. Approximately 1,500 acres
would be converted annually. The phasing of this program is detailed in
Annex 12, Table 9.
Administrative Equipment
4.12      Under this heading is included office and accounting equipment,
office furniture, dispensary and laboratory facilities, and equipment re-
quired for the Company's apprentice training school. All these items are
designed to remedy deficiencies in the facilities concerned.
Research, Training and Technical Studies
A.13       The present research facilities are limited.  The site of the    i
Research station is satisfactory, housing is adequate, but due to a lack
of professional staff, the research program has not kept pace with the Com-
pany's needs., The Project includes provision to engage additional profes-
.sional staff, establish a small quarantine station, and expand the research
program. Such a program is vital, particularly entomological research and
the introduction of new cane varieties.



- 16 -
4.14      There is also provision for better training facilities for all
staff, and funds to finance three teclnical studies and a management advisory
service that are essential to further development. The three studies are:
(a) A hydrological/irrigation survey of North Caroni. The purpose
of this survey is to investigate the drainage and supplementary
irrigation requirements of the flat lands being converted from
beds to ridges, and to produce a master drainage plan. The
Company has relatively little fundamental knowledge about the
hydrology of the area and it is important that this position be
corrected.
(b) A study of all aspects of Company operations, including field
and factory operations, cost control and management procedures.
No such comprehensive study has ever been undertaken. A small
team of outside consultants would be used over a period of
three months, with one of the team members remaining for up to
two years to assist in the implementation of mutually agreed
improvements.
(c) A study of the possibilities and implications of subdividing
the hilly Company-owned lands in the South for occupation
by small-scale cane farmers. These lands are diflicult to
mechanize, impossible to harvest with the present machines
available, and difficult to produce cane profitably under
estate style management. Such a study would have wide
implications for the future, size, and structure of Caroni
Ltd. since, if the hilly lands were disposed of, it would
halve the land cultivated by the Company and increase farmers'
cane lands by a corresponding acreage.
4.15      All three studies would receive a high degree of priority.  An
outline of draft terms of reference for all three studies is included in
Annex 13.
4.16      Advisers would be appointed to visit the Company at regular inter-
vals to provide management with technical, financial and administrative
advice. Their purpose would be to keep management up to date and serve as
a sounding board for the introduction of new techniques. They would report
to the Board at half-yearly intervals through the Managing Director.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost Estimates
4.17      Total Project costs for the five-year period are estimated to be
US$21.9 million (TT$ 42.3 million), of which the foreign exchange component
is US$18.7 million (TT$ 36.5 million) or 85%. A summary of Project cost
estimates including the foreign exchange element is as follows:

4.18      Cost estimates were prepared on the basis of current costs.  In-
flationary cost increases are provided for in a contingency calculated at
6% per annum cumulative for the entire five-year Project period. In addi-
tion, a physical contingency of 5% flat on all Project costs has been pro-
vided. The total provision for contingencies amounts to approximately 23%
of Project costs.
4.19      Project costs exclude import duties and other levies on imported
items. The sugar industry is exempt from such levies and assurances were
obtained from Government during negotiations that the 'Company would continue
to receive such concessions for all items directly imported under the Project.
Proposed Financing
4.20      The proposed Bank loan of US$12 million (TT$ 23.4 million) would
finance about 64% of the foreign exchange component during the initial



- 18 -
development period. Caroni Ltd. would finance the balance out of self-
generated funds. The loan would be made to Caroni Ltd. who would accept the
foreign exchange risk, but with Government providing a guarantee. The loan
would be for 15 years at 7-1/4% with a five-year grace period for repayment
of loan principal. Caroni Ltd. would pay an additional 1% annually to Gov-
ernment for their guarantee. Cash flow projections (Annex 14, Table 4) in-
dicate that Caroni Ltd. would generate sufficient funds to repay the Bank
loan within 15 years and finance further development.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
4.21      Procurement of factory machinery and field equipment totaling about
USS15.2 million would be by international competitive bidding. The exception
to this would be small orders of less than US$15,000 each in value, subject to
a maximum aggregate total of US$250,000, where the size of the order would be
unlikely to attract international bids. In sucn cases items would be procured
after receiving quotations from at least three suppliers. Of the US$15.2
million, factory equipment totals US$7.06 million, cultivation, harvesting
arnt cane haulage equipment totais US$5.92 million, while general transport
and agricultural equipment totals US$2.14 million. Vehicles are currently
assembled in Trinidad, there being four assembly plants that represent nine
international vehicle manufacturers. It is expected that such local assembly
plants would wxin orders for vehicles. Rehabilitation has already started,
equipment totaling US$1.5 million is in the process of being procured, and
it is proposed that these items be financed retroactively from the loan since
procurement procedures have conformed to Bank practices.  Items ircluded under
land formation, totaling US$0.6 million, would be undertaken by the Company
itself, since it is the only organization in Trini'ad with che necessary
expertise, and already has 10 years of experience of land formation.  Items
included under administrative equipment totaling US$0.15 would be procured
locally in small quantities after receiving quotations from at least three
suppliers. The necessary assurances were obtained from Caroni Ltd. during
neigotiations.
Disbursements
4.22      The Bank loan would be disbursed over four years, against appro-
priate documents, as follows:
(a) CIF costs of factory, field, and transport equipment--US$9.412
million, or ex-factory cost for vehicles if procured locally;
(b)  100% of total costs of technical fees--US$0.840 million;



- 19 -
(c) 40% of land formation costs--US$0.138 million, and
(d)  60% of administrative equipment costs--US$0.050 million.
It is also proposed that the CIF costs of equipment would be financed from
4/30/72, involving an amount of US$1.5 million. An unallocated amount of
US$1.560 million would meet contingencies on the above items. Any undis-
bursed Bank funds due to cost savings would be cancelled, unless needed for
related work associated with the Project and/or feasibility studies for
further investment as approved by the Bank. A schedule of estimated Bank
disbursements is given in Annex 12, Table 11.
E.  Organization and Management
Structure of the Industry and of Caroni Ltd.
4.23      Changes are required in the structure of the sugar industry, large-
ly because the institutions serving it were either established before Caroni
Ltd. dominated the scene or before Government acquired a controlling interest.
Both the SMA and SICB are examples of institutions that have become outmoded.
Similarly, there is need to rationalize the position of the Orange Grove
National Company, which is wholly owned by Government, in relation to Caroni
Ltd. There is also a need to create a central agency ito act as a forum for
discussion of matters of policy affecting the industry as a whole and its
relations with both Government and outside bodies.
4.24      Government appreciates the position and favors the establishment
of a Sugar Holding Company or a Sugar Authority. Such a body would advise
Government on matters of National Sugar Policy, and on its Board would be
represented all the various interests in the industry. The Board of either
organization would be a more suitable meeting ground for Government nominees
than the Board of Caroni Ltd. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Government that either a Sugar Holding Company or a Sugar Authority
would be established, with duties and terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, within a year of the loan becoming effective.
Management Structure of Caroni Ltd.
4.25      The present Board of Caroni Ltd. does not function smoothly, which
is not in the long-term interests of the Company. Some Board members find
themselves representing conflicting interests, and, lacking wide commercial
experience, do not always consider issues from a purely commercial viewpoint.
Government proposes to reactivate a small but powerful executive committee
of the Board, consisting of the Chairman, the Managing Director and one Gov-
ernment nominee with wide commercial experience. The committee would meet
at least monthly and have delegated to it all the powers necessary to take



- 20 -
decisions without constant reference to the main Board. Suzh an Executive
Committee was established after Government assumed control. It worked well
but was subsequently allowed to lapse. Assurances were obtained from
Government, and from Caroni Ltd., during negotiations, that the executive
committee would be reactivated as a matter of urgency, but in any event be-
fore the loan becomes effective. Caroni Ltd. would further covenant itself
to maintain the executive committee in active and effective existence.
-,&.26    The internal structure of the Company is currently under review.
A General Manager is being appointed to serve under the Managing Director.
It is desirable that other changes also be made, particularly to decen-
tralize anG allocate responsibility to section managers for many of the serv-
ices they currently receive from other operational departments. There is
also a need to improve communications within the Company, particularly the
metihods adopted for budgeting, financial control, and the preparation of
work programs. A review of the Company's management structure and person-
nel requirements would be included in the terms of reference of the consul-
tants appointed to advise on Company affairs. Draft terms of reference are
attached in Annex 13. Assurances were obtained (from Caroni Ltd.) during
-e..otiations that such a study would be initiated within six  onths of sign-
ing of the Loan Agreemnent, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
Assurances were also obtained from Caroni Ltd. that a Management Advisory
Service would be retairned for an initial period of three years, with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, following receipt of the consultant study.
-'..27    As in any co=mercial organization, good managerment and competent
staff are essentiai. The revitalization of Caroni Ltd. will depend a great
deal on the caliber of top management. For this reason assurances were ob-
tained from Caroni Ltd. that in the event of staff changes, the posts of
Managing Director, General Manager, and Financial Controller (or their
equivalent if job descriptions are chan ged) would only be filled after
consultation with the Bank.
Training and Recruitment
4.28      There is considerable need to improve training faci.l-ties at ali
levels of the Company.  The problem is particularly acute in the factories
in(i to a lesser extent on the field side. The Project allows for an expanded
training program and assurances were obtained from Caroni Ltd. that such a
training and personnel development program would be initiated following
uetailed recommendations in the management study (see paras 4.14 and 4.26).
There is also a need to concinue the recruitment of foreign technicians and
st.ff, particularly for the factories, until local personnel of sufficient
experience are fully trained and available. Assurances were obtained
from Government during negotiations that entry and/or work permits for such
staff would be readily available to Caroni Ltd.



- 21 -
Research, Quarantine Facilities, and Technical Studies
4.29      A vigorous and imaginative research program iLs essential.  The
Company has been responsible for excellent research work on insect control
and it is vital that this be continued. It has, however, lagged behind in
the introduction of new cane varieties, largely for want of a quarantine
station. The Bank was informed by Government during negotiations that a
quarantine station has now been established in Chaguaramas. Assurances were
also obtained from Caroni Ltd. that the research program, to be carried out
under the Project, would be drawn up in consultation w:ith the Bank within
six months of signing the Loan Agreement.
4.30      There is need for a comprehensive hydrological study of the flat
lands of North Caroni, and a study of Company land in ithe South to examine
the possibilities of settlement by additional cane farners. Assurances were
obtained from Caroni Ltd. during negotiations that sucli surveys would be
initiated within six months of signing the Loan Agreement with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank (see Annex 13).
Accounts and Audit
4.31      Caroni Ltd.'s accounting records are computerized.  Detailed phy-
sical, financial and statistical records are kept, but these are not fully
used for management purposes, nor are cost control procedures fully compre-
hensive. These matters would also be included for studly by consultants
(see para 4.26). Management is competent to administer a fully integrated
system as advised by consultants which would serve as an effective manage-
ment tool. Caroni Ltd. is audited by E. 0. White and Sons and their services
are acceptable. Assurances were obtained from Caroni Ltd. that their ac-
counts would continue to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank, and that audited accounts would be submitted to the Bank not later
than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Cane Farmers
4.32      In the past, the cane farmers' interests have not always received
the attention they deserve. Caroni's Cane Farmers Department needs to be
strengthened and arrangements made for cane farmers to receive more of their
needs through the Company. These could include technical advice, the supply
of agricultural r'quisites such as fertilizers and sprays, and the organiza-
tion of seasonal credit with funds provided by the Agricultural Credit Bank.
This too is a matter for investigation, and would be in the terms of refer-
ence for the consultants employed to examine company operations. The serv-
icing of cane farmers requirements through the Company would become partic-
ularly important if the study of South Caroni (para 4.30) recommends that
certain company lands be settled by additional cane farmers. Such a recom-
mendation is very possible.



- 22 -
V. PRODUCTION, PRICES, MARKETING
AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Production
5.01      For Project purposes, it has been assumed that total cane produc-
tion would remain constant at 2.3 million tons over the year 1973-1981, of
which 1.4 million tons would be produced by the Company and 0.9 million tons
by the cane farmers. In its projections the Company is anticipating that
farmers' cane production will be increased to 1.2 million tons by 1981,
principally due to expansion in the Southern and Eastern areas, but since
such expansion is problematical no allowance has been made for this. It is
also assumed that the total acreage of estate cane will decrease from 51,000
acres in 1973 to 46,700 in 1981, thus allowing the Company t.o remove marginal
areas from cultivation. This, however, will be compensated for by a small
increase in average cane yields, which are projected to rise from 27 tons/acre
in 1973 to 30 tons/acre in 1981, made possible by improved cultivation prac-
tices and the introduction of newer varieties by means of the accelerated
replanting program. Since company cane yields have normally ranged between
28 and 29 tons/acre during the last 10 years, these yields and production
assumptions are conservative. Details are in Annex 14, Table 1.
5.02      Only a marginal increase in raw sugar production is projected,
from 211,700 tons in 1973 to 225,500 tons in 1981, largely as a result of
a small improvement in the TC/TS ratio. The latter is projected to improve
from 10.51 to 10.20, which again is a conservative estimate bearing in mind
the very considerable improvements that would be made to the factories and
to the harvesting equipment. It follows that since there is little projected
increase in raw sugar production, there would be no significant increase in
by-products. Hence, 1973 levels of output, with minor modifications, have
been used. Molasses production is estimated at 74,000 tons in 1973, rising
to 76,000 tons in 1974 and thereafter. Spirit production is estimated at
580,000 proof gallons throughout.
5.03      The Project would have no direct impact on international sugar
trading arrangements, the small increase in production being entirely
absorbed by the local market.
B. Prices and Markets
5.04      The Company has well developed marketing arrangements, and well
established markets for a range of sugars and sugar by-products. Prices are
known and established until 1974, under the terms of the Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement, the International Sugar Agreement, and the US Sugar Act. For
Project purposes, current prices have been used for 1972/73 and 1973/74, and



-23 -
1974 figures have been used for 1975 through 1981.  The average price used
for all sugar, both exports and local sales, is TT$ 311/ton (US$159/ton) or
approximately 7.1 cents/lb. This is on the assumption that post-1974 prices
will show no decline and the pattern of marketing will not alter significant-
ly. Details are provided in Annex 14, Table 1.
5.05      There has been uncertainty as to what will happen to international
sugar prices when existing marketing arrangements are reviewed and renewed
in two years' time. Present indications are that prices will remain firm,
and possibly move higher, as anticipated world consumption rises faster than
likely world production. It is significant that the price of "free" sugar
has risen from an average of 3.75 cents/lb in 1970, to 4.52 cents/lb in 1971,
and is likely to average 7.3 cents/lb in 1972. Informed opinion feels that
prices will remain firm for some time to come. This view is shared by Bank
commodity staff who predict an average of 8.1 cents/lb in 1974, 8.8 cents/lb
in 1975, and 8.9 cents/lb in 1976. The issue is covered in more detail in
Annex 15.
5.06      It is undesirable that the price obtained by Caroni Ltd. for local-
ly consumed sugar, which by law is a first demand on Company production, be
pegged at unrealistically low levels as has happened ir the past (para 2.20).
Assurances were obtained from Government during negotiations that the price
to be paid to Caroni Ltd. for sugar for the domestic market would be reviewed
and set every two years, based on a formula that enabled the Company to earn
an 8% return after tax on the pro rata capital employed to produce sugar for
the local market, or, alternatively, based on the average export price, which-
ever is the less.
C. Financial Results
5.07      Statements of Caroni Ltd.'s projected income and expenditure, the
sources and application of funds, together with calculations of financial
rates of return, are given in Annex 14.
Company Profits
5.08      Caroni Ltd. should earn a profit (before taxation) of TT$ 1.9 mil-
lion in 1972/73. With the proposed investment, management reorganization,
and introduction of effective operational controls, this profit should steadily
increase to TT$ 4.5 million in 1976/77 and to TT$ 7.7 million in 1981/82. By
the end of the Project period the Company's annual post-tax profits should
average some TT$ 3.8 million per annum. The Company would not be subject
to income tax until 1976/77 because of the TT$ 8.4 million cumulative loss
carried forward from 1971/72, and the proposed heavy rehabilitation program.



- 24 -
5.09      The financial results for 1973/32 tabulated in Annex 14 show a big
improvement on past results for 1968/72 tabulated in Annex 8. This is prim-
arily due to various cost savings (Annex 14, Table 1, pages 5 and 6), some
increase in production, and substantial increases in sugar prices that have
recently been obtained (see para 5.04). Expenditure figures assume
savings would be made in harvesting costs through the introduction of addi-
tional machine harvesters in a phased program, in general overheads, and
on the assumption that Government would, in agreement with Caroni Ltd., take
over the costs of certain social services (medical and police) currently paid
for by Caroni Ltd. This has already been agreed and the necessary assurances
were obtained from Government at negotiations. Based on these assumptions
projected profit levels are realistic, but these results will not be obtained
unless Government ensures that Company policy is determined primarily by com-
mercial criteria, and management is able to botih improve terhnical performance
and maintain costs within projected limits. For this reason the Project at-
taches great importance to changes in the structure of the industry (para
4.23) and the management of the Company (para 4.25), to the three consultant
studies (para 4.14), and to the question of a management advisory service
(para 4.16).
Capital Employed and Rates of Return
3.10     As a result of the proposed investment the finances of the Company
would be strengthened. Capital assets employed would increase in value from
TT$ 37 aillion in 1972 to TT$ 70 million in 1982. Working capital would be
increasingly financed out of retained earnings, thus reducirg the bank over-
draft. The Company would be able to repay the Bank loan completely by 1987,
allowing for a grace period of five years for the repayment of loan principal,
and at the same time generate sufficient funds for future capital requirements.
The annual financial return (after tax) on total capital employed would range
from 5.3% in 1973 to 8.3% in 1980.  The financial rate of return or. the pro-
posed investment, not taking into account price contingencies? would be 17%.
If price contingencies are, however, included as part of incremental costs
the rate of return would drop to 10% (Annex 14, Tables 3 and 4).
Financial Covenants
5.11      In the interests of sound financial management it would be necessary
to set certain targets and constraints in the form of covenants. A statement
of policy was agreed with Caroni Ltd. during negotiations, that the Company's
objective would be to improve earnings so that the rate of return on capital
eiiployed would compare favorably with returns earned from alternative uses of
capital in Trinidad of comparable risk, and that such earnings would from
1974/75 be not less than 3% annually. In addition, assurances were obtained
that (a) no additional medium and long-term debt would be incurred without
the Bank's agreement if the effect would be for the total of such debt to be
more than 1.5 times the net worth of the Company; (b) that no more than 25%
of net earnings from the previous fiscal year would be distributed as dividends
on ordinary stock up to June 30, 1977 without agreement with the Bank, and
thereafter only to the extent that such payments would not _eopardize the
financing of necessary capital improvements and working capital.

VI.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      A traditionally structured estate like Caroni relies on a large
work force engaged in manual operations. Such labor intensive methods of
sugar cultivation and especially sugar harvesting are becoming increasingly
difficult to sustain in the face of rapidly increasing labor costs and, due
to its social image, ever increasing unpopularity among the younger genera-
tion of workers. Wages have been greatly influenced by wages in the nearby
petroleum industry, and, in addition, Government has been able, due to rev-
enues from the petroleum industry, to provide a comprehensive program of
public services to the community. These benefits, together with the perva-
sive prejudice against agricultural employment and support for the unemployed
through extended family ties, collectively explain the apparent paradox that,
despite relatively high national unemployment, people do not want to cut
cane.  Thus Caroni has the twin problems of labor becoming both scarce and
more expensive.                                                       ,:         '
6.02      Under existing fiscal and social policies,  iee  a  ernatives are
open -- to abandon the industry, to subsidize labor,  r<  oth change the
structure of the industry and speed up mechanization!-' e first of these,
abandoning the industry, is neither socially nor economically desirable in
view of the lack of alternative employment for the resources now used in
sugar. This is true of both labor and land. The land appears to have little,
alternative use, particularly in the short-run, and, in any case, the capital
required to shift this land to other cultivation is more than that required
to save the sugar industry. In addition, since the counatry already has sub-
stantial unemployment, it is unlikely that those unemployed by abandoning
the industry would be able to find alternative employment. The second alter-
native, that of subsidizing the average wage in the sugar industry, is excess-
ively costly and pinlikely to improve the efficiency of ithe industry.  It might J
be justified if the shadow price of labor were lower than the present market /7
rate. This is not the case particularly for cane cutting since the younger 4
generation is reluctant to accept this type of work and anr quantification f
to determine a shadow price for this kind of work would be highly speculative.
The Government, the Company, and the labor unions involved have rejected this
approach in favor of the third alternative, to make parts of the production
process, particularly harvesting, more capital intensive and, if further study
indicates it is desirable, to increase the importa3nce-oL        mall.iXn±a-
sector.  This can only be done gradually, and explains the importance that is j
attached in the Project to a detailed study of the Company's land that cannot
be mechanized together with a program of mechanization of those lands that
lend themselves to it.
6.03      In view of the brighter market prospects for sugar a case could be
argued for expanding operations. This may well be feasi,ble in the long-term,
but it is felt that the first priority is to improve the efficiency of exist-
ing operations. Only when this has been accomplished should a more expan-
sionist policy be pursued. The Project mix that has been prepared is consider-
ed to be the most appropriate to the circumstances of Caroni, and is generally



- 26 -
acceptable to the various interests most concerned. Investment in the factories
and transport equipment is urgently required and is not interchangeable with
investment in labor, while investment in cultivation equipment is necessary
to maintain current production and can be justified on the grounds already
mentioned.
6.04      The Project would aim at reducing costs and improving efficiency
rather than at increasing output. This increase in efficiency would result
in an annual financial rate of return on capital employed of 5.3% in 1972/73
rising to 8.3% in 1979/80. Foreign exchange earnings from sugar products of
at least US$25 million annually would be maintained, and Government revenue
from corporate taxes would be enhanced by US$1 to US$2 million annually from
1977. The Project would also continue to provide employment for about 11,500
sugar workers and safeguard the livelihoods of 8,500 independent cane farmers.
Virtually all the benefits would accrue to Trinidad, apart from the payment
of dividends to minority foreign stockholders.  These are not easy to estimate
but are unlikely to exceed US$0.25 million annually.
6.05      The economic rate of return must be measured in terms of the alter-
natives available--in this case the gradual phasing out of the industry.  tThen
or how this would occur is difficult to estimate given the existing social and
political climate. If investment is not made in the very near future the en-
tire sugar industry will gradually deteriorate over a 10 year period to a
point of final collapse. The difference between benefits with and without
the project is deemed to be incremental benefits. The economic rate of return
calculated on this basis, excluding price contingencies, is estimated to be
26%. This is a conservative estimate; it is unlikely that the industry would
survive as long as 10 years without any investment being made. If, however,
price contingencies are included in incremental costs, the rate of return
drops to 20%. Sugar prices used for rate of return calculations average
USW7.1/lb which by present forecasts is considered to be conservative. The
rate of return inclusive of contingencies was therefore tested for sensitivity
to sugar price increases of 10% and 20%. Suci itcreases would improve the
return to 27% and 34%, respectively. These figures indicate there is substan-
tial economic justification for the Project (Annex 14, Table 6).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
With Government:
(a)  that a Sugar Holding Company or Sugar Authority'ith duties
and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, would be
established within one year of the loan becoming effective
(para 4.24);



- 27 -
(b)  that the price to be paid to Caroni Ltd. for sugar for the
domestic market would be reviewed every two years and be based
on a formula that enabled the Company to earn an 8% return on
the pro rata capital employed to produce sugar for the local
market, or, alternatively, based on the average export price,
whichever is the less (para 5.06); and
With Caroni Ltd.:
(a) that in the event of staff changes the posts of Managing
Director, General Manager, and Financial Controller (or
their equivalent if job descriptions are changed) would
only be filled after consultation withi the Bank (para 4.27);
(b)  that studies would be undertaken to investigate the hydrology
and irrigation potential of North Caroni and ito investigate
the implications of subdividing certain Company-owned lands
in the South for occcupation by small cane farmers, both on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, within six
months of the signing of the loan agreement (para 4.30);
(c) that no more than 25% of net earnings from the previous fiscal
year would be distributed as dividends on ordinary stock up to
June 30, 1977 without agreement with the Bank, and thereafter
only to the extent that such payments would not jeopardize the
financing of necessary capital improvements and working capi-
tal (para 5.11).
7.02      As a matter of urgency, and in any case before the loan would be
made effective, Caroni Ltd. would provide an assurance to the Bank that the
executive committee of its Board of Directors had been effectively reactivated
(para 4.25).
7.03      With the indicated assurances, the proposed P;roject constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$12 million for a term of 15 years,
including a five-year grace period.

Agricultural Development Problems
1.        Agriculture in Trinidad is not prosperous, though certain sub-sectors
of the industry (notably poultry, vegetables and tobacco) are expanding. The
reasons for the poor performance over the last two decades include the follow-
ing:
(a) For historical reasons agriculture is associated with menial
labor and exploitation. It has a poor social image, apart
from the cane farmers there is no large and well organized
body of public opinion to press its case.
(b) Large oil revenues have made it easier to import food than
produce it locally, and there has not been the stimulus for
agricultural development from a long term poinit of view. In
addition, the oil industry has been able to pay much higher
wages than the agricultural industry could afford, particularly
in a depressed condition, thus increasing the disparity of
opportunity between oil and agriculture.
(c) In the past the emphasis has been on estate crops such as
sugar and cocoa, owned to a large extent by outside interests
and geared to producing profits for export raither than raising
the overall level of prosperity of the rural areas.
(d) Marketing is difficult. The domestic market is limited and
the necessary organization and experience for external market-
ing is weak. Cocoa has been in decline for 40 years, citrus
has been hard pressed to compete against more aggressive com-
petitors elsewhere, and coffee has had the problem of over
production on the world market. Horticultural produce has
similar limitations, and with all crops the combination of
high costs and low yields have penalized competitiveness.
(e) Support services have not been well developed. Credit facil-
ities, particularly for long tern credit, hav,e been very limited,
extension and research service have not been adequate, and access
roads into the remoter areas have been poor.
(f)  Mlore recently there have been pressures from other CARIFTA
countries that they be given the opportunity to supply Trinidad's
requirements for rice, root crops, etc., in turn enabling them
to pay for imports of light industrial products from Trinidad.
These pressures are likely to restrict Government policies towards
agricultural diversification in such crops.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(g) Apart from a poor image the industry has various social
problems, including absentee ownership of land, much part
time farming, a preponderance of small holdings, fragmenta-
tion, and widespread praedial larceny. Such attributes are
associated with rural poverty and lack of confidence in
agriculture. In addition, considerable areas of land are
set aside for oil concessions.
(h) l4any of the soils are of low inherent fertility and drainage
is often a problem. The distribution of rainfall can be
erratic and there is a marked dry season, which, without
expensive irrigation facilities, is a limitation to some
crops. Unlike some Caribbean Islands there are no soils of
volcanic origin and high fertility.
(i) For historical reasons, estate agriculture has dominated the
production of most crops other than those used for subsistence.
The estates have had to get bigger to survive, as in the case
of Caroni Ltd., and there is now a large gap between such
estates on the one hand and subsistence/part time cultivators
on the other hand. Wihat is now missing is the category in
between, the small and medium sized full time farmer, and
the type of person most likely to respond to development
stimulus.

History of the Sugar Industry in Trinidad and of Caroni Ltd.
Background
1.        The history of Trinidad, as is the case with miost of the Caribbean
islands, is steeped in sugar. The crop has for the most part dominated the
country until the discovery of oil in recent years, and has had a profound
effect on the racial origins and political development cf the people of
Trinidad over the past three-and-a-half centuries. Sugar cane is said to
have been first introduced by the Spaniards to Tobago rather than Trinidad
in 1627. The industry flourished, and by 1799 total exports amounted to
nearly 9,000 tons sugar. In subsequent years production declined and was
finally virtually extinguished by the hurricane of 1846.
2.        In Trinidad cane was probably first grown around Port of Spain
and the first mill is said to have been established in 1787. By the turn of
the century there were some 300 mills in operation, all operating on small
individually owned estates. By 1855 total sugar exports amounted to 20,000
tons and to 64,000 tons by 1885. Thereafter the industry stagnated until
the outbreak of the First World War. However, by 1933 production reached
120,880 tons. It declined during the Second World War, largely due to an
acute shortage of labor, but has expanded steadily if not spectacularly ever
since. Peak production was achieved in 1966, with a record sugar output of
250,586 tons. The last two or three years have been less favorable with
total production slipping to 213,161 tons in 1971.
3.        In the early years cane was grown on a large number of individual
estates, for the most part family owned by planters of Spanish, French or
British extraction. Labor was provided by slaves and the remnants of the
original Carib inhabitants. In 1807 slavery was abolished but the slaves
were not finally emancipated until 1834. When this occurred there was a
mass move off the estates, labor was at a premium, and the authorities of
the day made substantial efforts to attract to Trinidad either "freed slaves"
from the USA, or labor from Europe, China and the islands of Madeira. None
of this labor proved very suitable, and in 1845 the first indentured labor
was introduced from India. The process continued unchecked until 1916, by
which time no less than 150,000 Indians had been brought to Trinidad.
4.        Concurrently with these changes in the labor force, there were
constant changes in the structure of the industry. Sugar everywhere in the
Caribbean has had a turbulent history, not least in Trinidad, and periods
of extreme prosperity have been interrupted by equally frequent and often
prolonged periods of depression. Over the years there has been a steady
concentration of the cane estates into fewer and fewer hands' The 300 small
mills of 1807 shrank steadily in numbers to only 11 large factories in 1937,

despite an overall pattern of expanding acreage and steadily increasing pro-
duction. At the outbreak of war in 1939 only nine companies were left. Bet-
ween them they cultivated 32,000 acres producing some 3/4 million tons of
cane, and also handled the 1/2 million tons of cane produced by some 13,000
small cane farmers. Thus the small private estate has given ground steadily
to the large public company, and the labor force has changed from the Negro
slave to the East Indian laborer and East Indian cane farmer.
5.        These changes have not been without incident, and the history of
Trinidad has been liberally punctuated by Comndssions of Enquiry to investi-
gate the never ending complexities of the cane industry. Twice within living
memory total collapse has been predicted, in the 1890's and again in the
1920's. This is a point worth mentioning, if only to emphasize that the
problems of Caroni Ltd. in 1972 have many precedents.
Formation of Caroni Ltd.
6.        The story of Caroni Ltd. well exemplifies the structural changes
tnat have occurred in the sugar industry in Trinidad. It is a story of the
big estate getting bigger and the smaller estates being squeezed out, partly
due to the competitive nature of the industry and partly due to the financial
advantages to be gained by increasing size.
7.        The Company was first incorporated in November 1937 when Tate and
Lyle Ltd., a well known public company incorporated in England, bought out
the business and undertakings of Caroni Sugar Estates Ltd. (Trinidad), and
Waterloo Sugar Estates Ltd. (Trinidad). At that time Caroni owned two sugar
factories, one at Brechin Castle and the other at Caroni itself, while the
liaterloo Co. owned a third factory of its own. The merger resulted in what
was then one of the two largest estates in ,rinidad, the second being the
Ste. Madeleine Sugar Company. In 1959 Caroni acquired Gordon Sugar Company,
and in doing so acquired a useful block of land contiguous with its own lands
in the South. This acquisition was followed in 1961 by the purchase of Wood-
ford Lodge Estates, and very shortly afterwards in 1962 by a merger by Caroni
with the Ste. Madeleine Sugar Company.
3.        The merger was approved by both sets of stockholders on May 31, 1962,
confirmed on June 29, 1962, and the authorized capital was increased to its
present level by resolutions passed on December 19, 1963. The following year
the Ste. Madeleine Sugar Company was wound up and its assets transferred to
Caronii.
9.        At June 30, 1970 Tate and Lyle Ltd. was the ultimate holding company
of Caroni Ltd., and beneficially interested in 70.59% of the issued Ordinary
Stock and 20.72% of the issued Preference Stock. In August 1970, following
negotiations, Government purchased 51% of the Ordinary Stock of Caroni Ltd.
With this controlling interest, and complete ownership of the Orange Grove
National Company, Government effectively obtained control of 96% of the entire
sugar industry in Trinidad.

CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
Institutions Serving the Sugar Industry in Trinidad
1.        Four main institutions represent the various interests in the
sugar industry.
2.        West IndiAn Sugar Association (WISA).  This institution, esta-
blished in 1942, is a regional association representing all the sugar pro-
ducing islands in the erstwhile British West Indies. Its main function is
to administer the sugar quotas granted to the various islands under the
terms of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, the International Sugar Agreement
and the United States Foreign countries quota. These quotas are awarded
to WISA and not to individual countries directly. In addition, it is
responsible for research carried out in Barbados on behalf of all member
territories.
3.        The Association is governed by a Board of Directors each of whom,
including the Chairman, is the nominated representative of the local Sugar
Association of the member countries. For the last ten years the Trinidad
Director has been the Chief Executive Officer of Caroni Ltd. A member of
Caroni staff has also been the nominee to represent Trinidad on any of the
WISA committees. These committees report to the Board on technical and
specialist subjects.
4.        Sugar Manufacturers Association (SMA).  The Association was formed
in the early 1920's as an unregistered body, its purpose being to provide
a united front for a then more fragmented industry. In 1942 it became a
corporate body, largely as a result of the need to have a National Associa-
tion as an adjunct of WISA in each sugar producing island of the British
West Indies. Membership was restricted to those that processed sugar rather
than those that grew cane. All sugar companies have been members, but with
the consolidation of the industry in recent years only three companies
remain.
5.        The SMA has had three functions, to formulate policy, to present
a united front in negotiations with outside agencies, and to serve as the
statistical and recording arm of the industry.  It has been financed by
the three members, subscriptions being based on pro rate sugar production.
More recently, and due to the overwhelming size of Caroni, the SMA has been
turned into a limited company.  It is in effect a subsidiary of Caroni
and handles its public affairs and negotiations with other organizations.
Caroni has two places on the Board, and Forres Park and Orange Grove one
each. The Chief Executive of Caroni is the Chairman.
6.        Sugar Industry Control Board (SICB).  The Board was established in
1966 (Act No. 14), its purpose being to serve as an umpire between the sugar



ANNEX 5
Page 2
manufacturers and the cane farmers. It has various functions: for example,
agreeing on the price formula for cane, licensing cane weighers, determining
farmers' quotas, and prescribing acceptance standards for the sale of cane.
The Board has 10 members, three nominated by the SMA, three by the Cane
Farmers Association, and four by the Minister of Agriculture. The Chairman
and Deputy Chairman are appointed by the Minister.
7.        Trinidad Island-Wide Cane farmers Association (TICFA).  The
Association started in January 1957, originally on a voluntary basis.
Since 1961, membership has been obligatory to all cane farmers. There are
58 branches throughout the cane belt, each with honorary office bearers.
These branches are linked to the Headquarters office in San Fernando via
two regional committees, one for the North and the other for the South.
Apart from headquarters staff TICFA employs three field officers, their prime
function being to provide liaison between the farmers and the companies.
TICFA is well led and well organized, and appears to do a very useful job in
representing farmers interests. Relations with Company Management have
improved greatly in the last two years.

CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
Soil Conditions and Cane Cultivation Methods (Estate)
1.        Soils.  There are big variations in soil type within the sugar
belt, particularly between the North and South. In the North and central
areas (Woodford Lodge and Brechin Castle) the land is mostly flat with
soils of alluvial origin from the Caroni, Caparo and Couva river systems.
Twenty-nine soil types exist, ranging from fine sands, through silty
clays, to heavy clays. Drainage is frequently impeded in the heavier
soils.
2.        In the South (Ste. Madeleine and Reform) the land consists
mainly of an undulating peneplain with rolling hills of a more or less uniform
elevation of 200 feet. Six soil types are recognized, most of them heavy
clays where impeded drainage is a problem. Erosion has occurred over the
years,.landslips are frequent, and there is evidence that some soils are badly
truncated. About 43% of the company-grown cane is growni in these hilly areas
of the South, and a substantially greater percentage than this of farmers'
cane.
3.        Field Layout.  Field areas are from four to 30 acres, the average
being 10 acres. On the flat lands the existing layout is one of cambered
beds carrying four rows of cane five feet apart. The existing system of
cambered beds has evolved; it has not been designed from fundamental hydrolic
principles. It has two big disadvantages: (a) it does not permit easy
mechanization; and (b) it predetermines in an arbitrary fashion the drainage
layout.
4.        In order to permit mechanization, all camberecd beds are being
converted to ridges spaced five feet six inches apart. The changeover to
ridges from cambered beds is sensible but the details of the operation are
questionable in several instances, namely the direction of infield drains,
the use of bulldozers rather than scrapers, and a measure of expensive
perfection when the operation is first carried out.
5.        Land Preparation and Cultivations.  Some 4,000 acres are prepared
each year for replanting. The work is performed in the dry crop period
by D6, D7, D8 and TD18 Crawler Tractors.
6.        Flat Lands.  Having burnt off the residues form the previous crop,
the beds are levelled by bulldozers or by flat ploughing with mouldboard
ploughts. Levels are taken to establish a grade of one to two feet in
1,000 feet and the final levelling is then carried out with bulldozers,
graders and land levellers. Further operations consist of deep tillage with
chisels and refining with offset disc harrows. This is followed by the



ANNEX 6
Page 2
building up of the ridges with tool bar mounted double mouldboard bodies
drawn by D6 tractors.
7.        Hilly Lands.  The first operation is carried out either by chisel-
ling to a depth of 16-20 inches or by Rome 16-36 offset disc harrows. This
is followed later by further chiselling or discing. D7 and D8 tractors are
used. The planting furrows are made by D6 tractors carrying two or three
double mouldboard bodies.
3.        The timing of operations is not always ideal.  This is a vital issue
with major implications.  For a variety of reasons management is not always
on top of the work schedule, and work programs and objectives are not spelled
out in a precise enough fashion. Supervision in the quality of work needs
improvement.
9.        There is scope for additional mechanization, possibly the use of
lower powered and thus cheaper machines, and possibly also a regime of
shallower cultivations.  These issues require more detailed study.
10.       Planting.  Planting begins shortly after the onset of the rains
in June and it is the aim to complete it within five to six weeks. Whole
canes are laid in the furrows by hand and then chopped into smaller pieces
to inhibit any tendency towards polarity of germination. Covering of the
plants is carried out with hoes or forks. On the ridge cultivation, if
weather and soil conditions permit, the covering of the plants may be carried
out by discs drawn by wheel tractors. On the hilly lands the furrows are
covered by first breaking each alternate bank; the other bank is broken
when the cane is established. This practice reduces the risk of severe
erosion from heavy rains.
11.       Planting should start earlier in anticipation of rain rather than
after its arrival. Some of the present delays are due to obstruction by the
labor unions. This must be rectified. A late start to planting limits the
total acreage planted in any one year, increases weed competiticn, and neces-
sitates much expensive hand work. The damage done by delay is cumulative and
the effects are felt in subsequent ratoon crops. The correct timing of plant-
ing in effect has a major bearing on the annual work cycle. Delays can
greatly increase costs and limit yields, both long- and short-term.
12.       The use of small scale supplementary irrigation may be justified on
a limited scale to improve the course of plant cane and to get the crop well
established before the onset of the rainy season. The question of closer
spacing should be investigated, but this is a matter that should be treated
with caution. Conclusions should not be reached on the basis of inadequate
evidence.
13.       Fertilizers.  On those areas which have been converted to ridges,
fertilizer is applied by tractor. Elsewhere application is by hand.
14.       Nitrogen.  Four cwts of sulphate of ammonia per acre are applied
to all plant and ratoon crops.  In the case of plant canes, two applications



ANNEX 6
Page 3
each of two cwts per acre are made, the first soon after germination and
the second some six weeks later.
15.       Phosphate and Potash.  The application of phosphate and potash is
based to some extent on the soil type and the results of past field trials
and soil analysis. In general, phosphate is applied only to the Princes
Town, Talpara and Freeport Clays and to the McBean sands. It is also
applied to those areas which have been levelled and the sub-soil exposed.
The application is made in furrow at planting, at the rate of two cwts
superphosphate per acre. Field experiements are said to have shown no
responses to further applications to the ratoon crops. Generally, potash
is not applied to the heavier clays. All other soils receive muriate of
potash at the rate of two cwts per acre to plants and 1-1/2 cwts per acre
to ratoons. Lime is not used.
16.       Fertilizing practices need improving.  There is; a tendency to
provide blanket applications irrespective of widely different soil types.
For instance, some soil series are known to have substantial deficiencies
in phosphate, others have high theoretical lime requirements. It would
seem that not enough phosphate is being applied and that soil acidity is
being ignored. Nor are potash applications sufficiency in every case.
The levels of nitrogen dressings are probably adequate but there is a need
to split the dressings and apply late nitrogen under certain local circum-
stances. The mechanization of the fertilizer application should be increased,
and filter pressed mud produced by the factories should be used with more
discrimination.
17.       There should be more selective use of fertilizers within fields,
particularly following land formation and the change from cambered beds to
ridges. The earth moving involved is bound to lead to variations in
fertility within relatively small areas. Fertilizer applications in general
should also be related to detailed foliar analysis, and more frequent soil
sampling.
18.       Varieties.  All the varieties being grown have been bred by the
W. I. Central Sugar Cane Breeding Station is Barbados. The distribution
for the 1971 crop was:

19.       Because of its susceptibility to Leaf Scald Disease (a disease
now recorded in Trinidad) B49119 will not be replanted. HJ5741 has shown
promise and is being extended under close scrutiny before more rapid
extension.
20.       The variety position is a major cause for concern.  There is too
much dependence on B-41227, a 31-year old variety which have been outclassed
elsewhere. in the Caribbean and was never one with outstanding cane qualities.
The othfer main variety, B-49119, is also being outclassed, and its vigor
is now suspect. There is an urgent need for the introduction of fresh
varieties.  A quarantine station at Tobago is a first priority.  In selecting
new varieties, special emphasis should be placed on early ripening. The
present policy of extending the use of HF-5741 is justified though evidence
of its superiority is not complete.
21.       Weed Control. Since the introduction of the use of 2,4-D as an
estate practice in 1950, an increasingly greater reliance is being placed
on chemical weed control.
22.       The main pre-emergence herbicides in use are Pesco 1815, Atrazine,
Asolux, Daconate, and Karmex (also used with 2,4-D as a contact). These are
mainly applied by hand with knapsack sprayers in the south and by tractor
drawn sprayers in the north. Where weeds are established, Gramoxone or a
herbicidal oil is applied. Dalapon is also used for controlling grasses
in drains, road verges, etc.; it is not used in growing cane. The use of
tractors for the application of herbicides is being extended.
23.       Grasses are now the most serious weeds.  The control of broad
leafed weeds has been good and the information on their control is well
documented. The main problem is the timing of application of weedicides.
It has to be done rapidly and large areas have to be covered in a short
space of time following the onset of the rainy season. At present the
timeliness of application is not as good as it should be and more attention
should be paid to the use of boom sprayers in both North and South. Aerial
spraying should also be investigated in greater detail.
Pests and Diseases
24.       Froghopper (Aneolaemia varia saccharine).  Has always been the
most serious pest of sugar cane in Trinidad and has been frequently
responsible for heavy losses. Formerly, control measures were based
on the destruction of the nymphs by the application of an insecticide dust
(Trithion or Toxaphene) to the base of the cane stools, using hand dusters.
Where control of the nymphs failed and there was a large emergence of
adults, these were dealt with by drift dusting with 25% malathion applied
by tractor driver Messinger dusters.
25.       Since 1967 control measures have been aimed at controlling the
adults and are carried out by aircraft. The insecticides used are Sevin,
3 lbs 85% sprayable, Unden 1/5 lbs 50% sprayable, Azodrin E. C. 1 pt in
2 or 3 gallons water, and Malathion 96% L.V.C. at 1 pt per acre. All



ANNEX 6
Page 5
sprayable dust powers are applied with 12 mls U.C. No. 1 Stricker per
gallon. The sprays are applied on contract by four Piper Pawnee Aircraft
(capacity 140 gallons) and two Thrush Commanders (capacity 400 gallons).
26.       Every ratoon field (45,000 acres) is observed twice per week,
and a record made of the level of nymph andadult infestation. All
observation reports reach the control centers the day after the observations
have been made. On the bsis of these reports the fields requiring to be
sprayed are selected and the flight plans prepared.
27.       Aerial control has so far proved to be more effective than hand
dusting and it is considerably cheaper. In 1971, 87,800 acres of estate
cane were sprayed, equivalent to an average of approximately four applica-
tions to the area under control. In addition 9,170 acres of cane farmers'
lands were sprayed.
28.       Cane Aphis (Sipha flava).  Was formerly regarded as a minor pest
but in recent years there have been widespread attacks which have required
treatment. "Anthio" at 10-15 fluid ozs in three gallons of water per
acre applied by aircraft is used for control.
29.       Jumping Borer.  (Elasmopalpus Lignosellus).  Can at times cause
serious damage to young ratoon shoots. Damage is most severe during
periods of drought. There is no known means of control.
30.       By far the most important pest is the froghopper.  It can cause
catastrophic loss of yield and sugar losses of up to 60% have been demonstra-
ted experimentally with severe outbreaks of the pest. Company research and
control has been good and every effort must be made to maintain this satis-
factory state of affairs. The future of the industry would be jeopardized
if applied entomological research and control were to suffer.
31.       There does not appear to be any major cause of concern regarding
diseases. The variety HJ-5741 should be avoided on poorly drained soils as
it is susceptible to chlorotic streak and imperfect drainage can help spread
the disease. It would be advisable to check on the status of chlorotic
steak and ratoon stunting in greater detail.
32.       Harvesting.  Annual cropping is practised and the entire acreage,
except that which is reserved for planting material, is reaped each year.
Plant canes are 9-10 months old at reaping. All cane is burnt prior to
reaping. There are three systems of harvesting in practice:
33.       Traditional.  The cane is cut and topped by hand and loaded into
water buffalo or mule carts in which it is drawn from the field to a nearby
motor-driven crane where it is weighed and off-loaded. The cane cutting and
carting gangs work separately. Cane cutting is paid for on a task basis
related to yield. Carting is paid for by the ton delivered to the crane.
After the crane has been cut and carted it is usual to employ a gang of
gleaners to gather the cane which has been left behind. The average output
per worker employed is variable, but it in the order of 2 to 2-1/2 tons
per man/woman day worked.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
34.       Traditional methods of harvesting are expensive and productivity
is low. They should be phased out as fast as possible. Labor productivity
in harvesting does not compare favorably with other sugar producing countries.
35.       Self-Loading Trailers (SLT).  The cane is cut by hand and left
in a bundle secured by a chain to be loaded by winch and cable on to a tractor
drawn self-loading trailer for transport to the crane. A bundle in a normal
yielding field is about a day's work for a man or about 2-1/2 tons. One
self-loading trailer serves about 20 cutter/bundlers and ia 1969 loaded
an average of 4,800 tons of cane per trailer for the crop. The advantage
of this system, apart from a saving in cost, are:
(a) it eliminates the difficulty of setting the cane cutting
task since the cutter/bundlers are paid by the ton; and
(b) it eliminates the need for gleaners since the cane is
picked up cleanly.
More effort is required to be put into the output of SLT's. In view of the
fact that the trailers work a 12-hour day, the output per tractor is dis-
appointing. The output of the trailers requires investigation. In the South
in particular tire pressures are too high and harvesting by means of SLT's
is doing damage to established cane in wet weather. SLT's should be in-
creased on the flat land to replace animal-drawn carts, and consideration
should be given to the use of side-loading trailers and improving the
cleanliness of cane.
36.       Combine Harvesters.  The combine cuts, tops, chops and discharges
the cane into accompanying tractor-trailer units as it travels down the row.
The four-wheel drive infield tractors are exchanged by faster units for
transport to the factory.
37.       The theoretical output of a combine is 25 tons per hour or 200
tons for an eight-hour shift. The crew consists of two combine operators
and two or more infield tractor drivers.
38.       It is also necessary to employ a gang of scrappers working with
the combines and the fields have to be gleaned after harvesting.

39.       The company deserves credit for the eight years of development
work which have gone into the development of mechanical harvesting techniques.
Progress has been encouraging though maintenance costs appear to be higher
than they should be. Considerable improvements are still possible both in
reducing costs and improving output per machine.
40.       The standard of mechanical cutting is excellent but there is room
for improvement in the cleanliness of cane. The flotation of the infield
trailers is not adequate and requires investigation. Similarly it is neces-
sary to analyze the daily rainfall records to evaluate rainfall reliability
as a factor governing harvesting.
41.       All harvesting should cease by the end of May and not mid June as
at present.  The present inability to cease harvesting by May 30 is a major
cause of increased factory costs, poor sugar returns, and lower yields
in succeeding crops.
42.       Drainage.  Since most of the Northern cane lands are flat and
the soils are for the most part heavy, drainage is critical and probably
the single most important factor governing cane yields. Present drainage
systems have evolved on an ad hoc basis, rather than as a result of com-
prehensive hydrological planning, and there is marked absence of basic hydro
data.
43.       There is an urgent need for a full hydrological survey and a
review of land-forming and drainage practices. The drains presently being
put in may be in the wrong direction, and may have to be turned through 90°.
There should also be further investigation into supplementary in-field drains
in fields under ridge cultivation, together with the use of mole drains.
44.       It is significant that cane yields have remained relatively
static for many years, despite better nutrition, new varieties and the
introduction of mechanization. Based on fundamental questions of rainfall
and evapotranspiration, which hold good in most cane-producing areas,
the Company is only obtaining approximately 54% of computed potential yield.
Assuming 65-76% of the potential yield is obtained, attainable yields
could be in the order of 40 ton/acre. It could be that inadequate drainage
is a significant factor in this loss of potential yield.
45.       Irrigation.  None of the cane lands are irrigated though potential
for it exists in the North. One of the main justifications for a hydro-
logical survey would be to investigate irrigation potential, particularly
in the North. An elaborate and costly system is not envisaged. Benefits
would include:
(a)  Earlier planting (i.e., in anticipation of rain rather
than after it);
(b)  Better plant material, through the irrigation of the
source of plant material;
(c)  Higher cane yields;



ANNEX 6
Page 
(d) Lower costs and better weed control by more precise
management of weedicides and better timing in their
use; and
(e) A better overall harvesting regime which should improve
sugar yields and reduce costs.
46.       Cane Transport.  Both rail and road transport is used to carry
harvested cane to the factories. The railway is used solely for transporting
cane and in an average year handles from 700,000 tons to 750,000 tons.  It
is particularly important in transporting farmers' cane in the South to
Ste. Madeleine factory. The bulk of the remainder of the cane is transported
by road, mostly in 15 ton trucks with a trailer attached. Company vehicles
haul about 1 million tons and about a third as much again is handled by
contractors. A small quantity of cane, 40,000 to 60,000 tons, is brought
in direct to the factories by farmers using their own transport.
47.       The railway is expensive to maintain and delays are frequent,
particularly in the South. It should be phased out as soon as possible.
Apart from the age and unreliability of some of the vehicles, road transport
is more satisfactory. Replacement vehicles provided under the project
should improve perfromance and reduce time lost through breakdowns. A
longer term problem is the volume of public traffic on the Southern main
road, along which much of the cane is to travel, but matters should improve
when the new dual carriageway is completed.

Factory Processing Procedures
1.        The Tate and Lyle Technical Services Report on the factories was
completed in October 1971. It is a lengthy document which describes the
present state of the factories, and the equipment needed to improve effi-
ciency and guarantee reliable performance for the period 1973/1978. The
mission examined the report in detail, and its consultant; (m. van den Berg),
has submitted his own report. The mission's conclusions are as follows:
2.        The Tate and Lyle technical study is basically sound and only
minor modifications are suggested. However, any further expansion beyond
the limits envisaged by the Tate and Lyle study require further analysis.
3.        All four factories are old.  Most of their equipment is obsolete
and expensive to run, but much of it is, nonetheless, still in fair
operating condition. The policy in the past has been to maintain old equip-
ment rather than to replace it with more up-to-date machinery. This is
particularly so at Woodford Lodge. Such a policy has not: been a wise
one from a long-term point of view.
4.        The present grinding season, extending from the beginning of
January to the end of June, is too long. Grinding in most years should
start in January and finish by the end of May. In some years it may be
possible to start grinding in late December. Grinding should not extend
into June and a policy which plans to do so is most unwise. The aim should
be a 151-day gridning season (22 weeks) with a margin of three days, i.e.,
to 154 days. A shorter grindinig season on these lines will: (a) increase
sugar output by improving the tons of cane to tons of sugar (TC/TS)ratio;
(b) reduce factory costs; (c) reduce damage to stubbles in the field;
(d) enable earlier planting and higher plant cane yields; and (e) enable
better timing of many field operations, which should in turn result in
lower costs and higher ratoon cane yields. The length of the grinding
season is a key issue reflecting company profitability and all round
efficiency.
5.        The question of working longer at weekends deserves detailed
study. At present factories shut down for cleaning and maintenance, and
because it is traditional not to work on Sundays. If evaporators were
made interchangeable by adding a first vessel to each evaporator, it should
be possible to shorten down-time. Increased grinding time should in theory
result in the ability to produce an additional 8,000 tons; of sugar. The
capital cost would be TT$ 1.8 million. The economics of this should be
investigated. bearing in mind its impact on changes in working shifts,
overtime costs, availability of transport, etc.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
6.        The improvement plans for the factories should increase the
available grinding time from 75% to 80% from 1978 onwards. Caroni manage-
ment's estimate of 75% is therefore on the conservative side. Similarly,
management's estimate that the TC/TS ratio will be improved from 10.6 to
10.2 over the 10 year period 1972/1981 is conservative and is capable of
being achieved.
7.        No final decision should be taken on the closing of the Reform
factory.  There is much to be said for retaining it, if only for insurance
purposes, until the reliability of Ste. Madeleine is assured.
8.        Existing senior management in the factories is older than is
customary elsewhere.  Many are due to retire soon, yet there are very few
qualified replacements in the pipeline. There is urgent need for an
accelerated training program, and a management succession plan.
9.        Training should be a specialist function and separate from day-
to-day management. Existing management is fully engaged on routine operations
and has not enough time to attend to trainees.
10.       Existing manning shceudles in the factories should be rationalized.
Some savings should be possible.
11.       Routine sampling methods leave room for improvement.  Much of
this could be automated.
12.       There is a need for more preventive maintenance.  Similarly staff
operating factories in the grinding season should be trained to be able
to maintain and repair them in the off season.
13.       It was not possible in the time available to analyze all these
issues, but they would be examined in detail by the consultants engaged to
look into company procedures.

3.        The composition of the Board is thus weighted heavily towards
social and political interests, particularly when, as appears to be the
case, the Tate and Lyle representatives other than the Managing Director
of Caroni Ltd. do not exert a great deal of influence. 'This is partly due
to the Tate & Lyle representatives not being resident in Trinidad, and
partly due to their apparent wish not to interfere.
4.        Clearly political considerations are important, particularly
bearing in mind the background of the sugar industry, but as things stand
at the moment there is a tendency for commercial considerations to take
second place. This can impair the efficiency of management in the widest
sense, and weaken the competitive position of the Company over the long
term.
5.        Management.  The management structure of the company is best
illustrated by Chart 1 overleaf. Field control is exercised by five section
heads reporting to the Managing Director. These section heads comprise the
Financial Controller, Commercial Manager, Operators Manager, Personnel
Manager and Company Secretary. Collectively they form the Management
Committee. The Operations Manager is responsible for all agricultural and
factory operations, as illustrated by Chart 2. There is a clear division
between North and South, both agriculturally and from a factory point of
view. The present structure is currently under review by the Company and
a General Manager is being recruited. His appointment will affect the
outcome of the review.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
Cane Farmers' Operations
Background
1.        The majority of cane farmers are descendants of the 150,000 inden-
tured laborers brought into Trinidad between 1845 and 1916 from India.
Many of them accepted 5 acre holdings in lieu of a return passage to India.
From 1882 onwards they were permitted and eventually encouraged to grow
cane for sale to the factories. This enabled the estates to expand cane
output at relatively little capital cost, and allowed the largely East
Indian labor force to supplement their earnings as estate labor.
2.        Cane farmers vary considerably.  At one end of the scale there are
small part-time farmers with only an acre or so of cane, at the other end
there are a few with several hundred acres. In between there are a substan-
tial majority with farms of 10 to 15 acres, where cane farming represents
their main occupation and source of income. Most farmers are tenants,
renting their land either from the estate or private landlords. Only 15%
own their entire holding. Fragmentation is widespread and a holding can be
composed of half a dozen small parcels of land. Hence a man may own part of
his holding and rent other parts. Fragmentation is a problem since it
mitigates against good husbandry practices and encourages larceny, in itself
very widespread. Nor does a predominantly tenant/landlord relationship
encourage stability.
3.        Cane farming is still essentially a part-time occupation, encour-
aged by the nature of the crop which requires little attention between har-
vests. A survey in 1933 showed that only 12% of farmers relied entirely on
cane sales for their living. The position is probably much the same today,
with even the largest of farmers having other interests. Many such interests
are, however, connected with cane growing, i.e., transporting cane for
others or working as estate labor.
4.        Cane farming is also a middle-aged occupation, the majority of
farmers (71%) being over the age of 40. This is partly due to the younger
element being reluctant to go into farming, due to its poor image, and
partly due to the fact that a man does not as a rule inherit land when
young.
Number of Farmers
5.        The first cane farmers originated around Ste. Madeleine, and the
majority of farmers are still situated in the southern areas of the sugar
belt. Numbers expanded rapidly in the early years, reaching some 20,000
in the 1920's. At that time, a period of depression for the sugar industry,



ANNEX 9

the farmers produced half the total annual cane tonnage. This ratio was
maintained until the mid-1950's, but has since declined nationally to
nearer 40%. In 1971, 9,975 farmers produced 9.92 million tons of cane.
6.        As far as Caroni is concerned farmers have, during the last ten
years, accounted for 20-40% of total cane output. Numbers have fluctuated
from a low of 4.276 in 1963 to a high of 8,784 in 1970, but cane output has
increased consistently to the present level of about 845,000 tons out of a
total company production of 2.4 million tons. Detailed statistics for the
years 1962-1971 are listed in Table 1, overleaf.
Cane Acreages and Yields
7.        No accurate information is available about the total acreage of
farmers' cane. Traditionally the Company has only been interested in the
cane tonnage and has never really inquired about its origins. For record
purposes farmers have been categorized by the Company according to the cane
tonnage sold. The only acreage data available is from a survey conducted in
1967 1/. The results are tabulated (see overleaf) and, though five years
old, are still applicable.
8.        These figures indicate a total of 42,000 acres of cane at an
average yield of 17 tons/ac. Yields increase markedly as the size of holding
increases. The "average" farm is 6.5 acres, though the spread on either
side of the mean is so large that the average figure means little.
9.        Over the years there has been a marked tendency for numbers of
farmers to decrease, but the size of holding and overall production to
increase. The small farmer producing less than 20 tons still exists, but
only represents 19% of farmers and 2.2% of total cane production, whereas
30 years ago the figures were 67.6% and 18.5% respectively. Similarly the
farmer producing 100-500 tons of cane represents 50.9% of total cane
production whereas 30 years ago he represented only 21.3%. Details are
shown in Table 3, overleaf.
Cane Production
10.       With a trend towards bigger units, cane production per farmer
has increased. The average production per farmer was only 30 tons in 1940,
in 1950 it was 50 tons, in 1960 65 tons, and in 1970 100 tons.
11.       All four factories receive farmers cane.  Deliveries to Woodford
Lodge have remained fairly static over the past decade, ranging between
40,000 to 60,000 tons. The same is true for Reform at about 50,000 tons,
and Brechin Castle at 180,000 to 200,000 tons. The big expansion, however,
has taken place at Ste. Madeleine, from 271,000 tons in 1964 to 610,000 in
t,/ "The Cane Farmers of Trinidad" unpublished PhD Thesis by D. Maharaj.

1970, this being a reflection on the number of farmers in the southern cane
areas. Total farmers' cane production to all four factories currently runs
at about 850,000 tons per annum. Detailed figures are given at Table 1.
Field Operations
12.       Cultivation practices vary depending on locality, soil type,
farmers' abilities, etc. For similar reasons the replanting cycle varies
greatly, the range being four ratoons on poor land to perhaps 15 ratoons on
really good land. The average is in the order of five to six ratoons.
13.       Plant Cane.  Ploughing is the first operation, usually in January/
February in the North and somewhat later in the South. Most farmers rely
on tractors for ploughing, either their own or a contractor's machine.
Following ploughing the land is tractor ridged, ridges being four feet
apart. A cambered bed system may or may not be used depending on drainage
conditions. Planting is done after the rainy season starts in June/July.
Standards are quite good and the planting material may even be cut into two
node sets and spaced 18 inches apart. This improves germination and reduces
the need for supplying. Fertilizers are applied by hand after planting,
usually only sulphate of ammonia at one to three cwts/ac. Planting is done
in the furrow and the ridge is broken down over the planted cane in two
operations, again aiding germination. These operations also serve as a
weeding.
14.       Additional weeding is done if necessary, but often no further
cultivations are carried out until harvest. Some farmers are beginning to
use weedicides. Plant cane may not be harvested in the first year if it
has been planted late.
15.       Ratoons.  Ratoon Cane receives relatively little attention.  After
reaping the residual trash is burnt and fertilizer is applied by hand a
month or so later. Timing depends on the availability of fertilizer and
pressure of other work. The great majority of farmers now use fertilizer,
but again it is largely sulphate of ammonia.
16.       One weeding, seldom two, is done in ratoon cane prior to harvest.
Harvesting is by hand, the cane being burnt beforehand in many instances,
and either loaded direct on to a cart or bundled and loaded later.
Cane Transport
17.       Farmers transport their cane in carts or tra:Llers, buffalo or
tractor drawn, to one of 54 company operated loading stations. The cane
is weighed and transloaded to either company or contractor owned lorries
for shipment to the factory. Alternatively, it may be transported on the
company owned railway. It is the farmers' responsibility to get cane to
the loading/weighing station, the company's responsibiLity to move it from
there to the factory. Some farmers do however deliver direct to the
factory gate, particularly at Reform factory.



ANNEX 9

Farmer/Company Liaison
18.       All farmers are required to sign a contract before they are
registered as cane growers. It is renegotiable every five years. The
contract stipulates how much cane the farmer will produce. In theory any
surplus may be refused but in practice this has seldom happened. The
Company maintains a specialized Cane Farmers Department to handle all
dealings with cane farmers and their representatives, the Department's
prime function being to organize the delivery of cane to the factories and
for its payment.
19.       Traditionally the Company has looked upon the farmers as a
necessary nuisance, relations between Company and farmers have not been good,
and the Cane Farmers Department has had low priority in Company affairs.
This pattern has changed substantially since 1970 and liaison was greatly
improved.
Services to Farmers
20.       Farmers have for the most part received little help or encouragement
from official sources.
21.       Extension Services.  No Government staff have been supplied in
recent years, nor has the Company made much effort to provide a service.
Farmers are expected to make their own arrangements, yet a survey in 1967
indicated that only one farmer in 10 had received advice on any agricultural
topic.
22.       Credit.  There are no facilities for long-term credit, while
facilities for medium- or short-term credit are modest. In the South there
are 22 credit societies which farmers may join, but there is no such
counterpart in the North. These societies have been aided by Company staff
in a semi-private capacity. Farmers use the societies for short-term crop
finance and often for domestic needs until the cane harvest comes round.
Irt, however, a farmer requires a loan to purchase a tractor, or similar
major items, he is required to make arrangements direct with a local bank.
23.       The 1967 survey indicated that 38% of farmers receive no credit
during the year, 56% obtain seasonal finance for periods of less than a
year, and only 3% have access to medium-term (one to three years) credit,
these being the larger farmers.
24.       Subsidies.  Government paid a planting subsidy in 1944-46, and
a plowing subsidy between 1958 and 1965. Neither are in operation today.
A fertilizer subsidy has been payable between 1968 and 1971, which has
taken the form of a credit of 40 cents per ton of cane produced, the money
to be spent only on fertilizer. This has been most useful, since a 20 ton/
cane crop represents a TT$ 8 subsidy per acre. It has been widely used, but
due to a shortage of funds is not likely to be extended to the 1973 crop.



ANNEX 9
Page 5
25.       There has also been a subsidy towards the cost of froghopper con-
trol, limited to farmers with less than 25 acres of cane. Half the cost of
treatment is subsidized, to a limit of TT$19/ac. Where aerial spraying has
been practised in the North on a trial basis it has been paid for entirely
by Government.
Farm Mechanization
26.       The use of machinery is increasing.  Most farmers rely on tractor
tillage for planting cane, and a substantial number of bigger farmers now
own tractors. Some 50% of farmers delivering 300-500 tons of cane own
tractors, and the figure is higher as the scale of operation increases.
Many such farmers also contract to transport other farmers' cane.
Comparative Budgets
27.       Cane farmers vary greatly in their circumstances, ranging from a
part-time smallholder with two to four acres of cane to a large full-time
farmer with perhaps 300 acres of cane. The former will rely almost entirely
on family labor, the latter almost exclusively on hired labor. Some will
be owners of their land, others tenants. The quality of the land also
varies, as also do husbandry standards, which in turn will influence cane
yields, costs, and total output.
28.       Hence for budgetary purposes there is no such being as an "average"
farmer, the "average" being merely a statistic with a wide range of varia-
tion. Arbitrary, but nonetheless realistic, examples are chosen, namely:
(a) a small part-time farmer with four acres of cane; (b) a rather bigger
farmer of 15 acres of cane which represents a more or less full-time family
unit; and (c) a larger farmer with 100 acres of cane who relies entirely
on hired labor.
29.       Very little factual information is available on cane farmers'
costs. Caroni Ltd. have no figures. TICFA has only limited data, and the
mission has had to rely on judgment rather than accurate and comprehensive
figures.
Example A - Part-time smallholding:
30.       The farmer spends little time on his cane and relies substantially
on nonfarm income for his livelihood. To him the farm represents a house,
a source of subsistence food, and a small cash income. Inputs to the cane
are low, standards of husbandry are poor and yields are low at 12 tons/acre.
The farmer relies entirely on family labor, apart from the preparation of
land for plant cane. Replanting is done spasmodically, perhaps 1/2 acre
per year at best and often none at all. The farmer is a tenant, but owns
a buffalo and cart. His group represents 28% of all cane farmers but
produces only 10% of total farmers' cane.



ANNEX 9
Page 6
Example B - Family Unit:
31.       This farmer spends most but not all his time on the farm.  Though
he may have some nonfarm income, and almost certainly some noncane income,
cane is nevertheless his main source of cash. Standards of husbandry are
reasonable, plant cane averaging 18 tons/ac and the ratoons 20 tons/ac.
The farmer relies on his family to provide all labor, except the preparation
of land for plant cane and the transport of cane to the buying point. He
replants 2 acres or less per year. He is a tenant, owns a buffalo and cart
but no tractor. He represents 20% of all farmers, but his group produces
51% of all farmers' cane.
Example C - Large-Scale Cane Farmer
32.       This man represents one of the few farmers producing more than
1,000 tons cane. He has 100 acres of cane and does in fact produce some
2,240 tons annually. Standards of husbandry are quite good. Plant cane
averaging 18 tons/ac, ratoons 23 tons/ac. He relies entirely on paid
labor, whose wages are relatively high but not quite as high as Caroni Ltd.
has to pay.
33.       The farmer owns a tractor but is also a tenant.  Current labor
costs, assuming his inputs are as outlined, ensure that he makes relatively
little out of cane growing itself, but may well make an additional profit
out of contracting, etc. Essentially this man has the same problem of
rising costs as does an estate. He represents only 0.4% of all farmers
but produces 8% of all farmers' cane.
Conclusions
34.       From the comparative budgets overleaf it is apparent that:
(a) the part-time smallholding makes a modest return, low
yields being balanced by low inputs;
(b) the small full-time farmer does quite well, but only if
he relies almost exclusively on family labor; and
(c) the large farmer does not do very well bearing in mind
his acreage. He is in the same position as the estates,
unless he has better than average yields or lower than
average costs. He supplements his income by being a
transport contractor for other farmers and, if he owns
his holding, hopes for considerable capital appreciation.

NOTE: The figures for 1939-1945 and 1961-1967 are for the island as a whole,
those for 1968-1970 and 1971 for Caroni only. However, as Caroni has
included most of the cane farmers since 1968 the figures are comparable.

ANNEX 11

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
Labor Aspects of the Mechanization Program
1.        Government policy and the labor unions largely prohibit Caroni
from shedding employees through redundancy measures. Consequently, the
labor savings of any mechanization program can only be fulLy realized as
reduced costs if the mechanization program is phased so that labor savings
are at most exactly offset by the natural attrition of the labor force.
The purpose of this annex is to show that the mechanization program proposed
in the project would be acceptable from a labor point of view.
2.        A program of composite cultural and harvesting operations has
been projected (Table 1) which corresponds to the mechanized harvesting
program of the project. This program also includes projected acreage
conversions to ridges in Caroni South which will enable mechanization of
cultural but not harvesting operations. Man day labor requirements have
been established for each cultural and harvesting operation on an acreage
basis (Table 2). Matrix multiplication of Tables 1 and 2 leads to estimated
total man day requirements for all cultural and harvesting operations for
the years 1971 to 1981 (Table 3).
3.        The total estimated man days required for all cultural and
harvesting operations in 1971 (1,180,190) can be compared to the actual
number of man days used (1,557,426). The error of estimate is about -24%
and, ignoring possible errors, arises because the estimated labor require-
ments do not take into account such unproductive time as is spent in travel
to and between fields, and in unofficial rests. To correct for this
omission, without assuming better managerial performance, it was thought
expedient to multiply the projected total man day requirements for each year
by 1.3. The corrected total man day requirements are also at Table 3.
4.        Total man day requirements for cultural and harvesting operations
decline by 30% over the period 1972 to 1981. This is comprised of a 43%
reduction in requirements for Caroni North and a 14% reduction for Caroni
South. Assuming that one man works 218 man days per year (the actual
average for the years 1969 to 1971) then the 30% reductiorL in man day
requirements is equivalent to 2,170 men. This reduction is phased over
the period 1973 to 1981 as follows:

1974                   - 351                        472
1975                   - 266                        738
1976                   - 441                      1,179
1977                   - 211                      1,340
1978                   - 268                      1,658
1979                   - 202                      1,860
1980                   - 300                      2,160
1981                   -  10                      2,170
5.        These figures depict the maximum number of jobs that would be
eliminated, because immobility of men between types of jobs and between
North and South Caroni would probably lead to the maintenance of more jobs
but with less man days of productive employment per man per year. Unfor-
tunately, without detailed knowledge of deployment possibilities for
individual workers, it is not possible to quantify these considerations, and
it is necessary to work with the maximum job loss estimates in testing the
labor acceptability of the mechanization program.
6.        Available data on attrition in the regular labor force pertain
to total permanent wage earners at Caroni. These include transport,
factory and ancillary workers in addition to field workers. The project is
not expected to significantly affect total labor requirements for transport,
factory and ancillary operations, so that after allowing for replacement
rates for workers in these operations, the remaining attrition can be
fully offset against reduction in field operation jobs.
7.        Details of the number of permanent wage earners leaving Caroni
in the past three years are presented in Table 4, together with data on
recent recruits and the age composition of the 1971 labor force.

8.        The erratic increase in the number of permanent: wage earners
leaving Caroni in 1972 makes future forecasts difficult, because there are
obviously important variables at work which cannot be incorporated into a
simple probabilistic model of attrition. Further, suitable data are not
available for more sophisticated analysis. It has therefore been assumed
that the attrition rate for the period 1973 to 1981 will be 4.5% of the
total permanent wage earning labor force. This 4.5% is ithe approximate
average attrition rate for 1970 and 1971. There were more than enough
people in the older age groups in 1971 to permit this ralte to continue, even
after allowing for a net loss of 808 workers in 1972.
9.        Under this assumption, and taking actual net attrition for 1972,
the number of permanent wage earners leaving Caroni over the period 1972
to 1981 is as follows:
TABLE 5
Projected Attrition of Wage Earners
1972                             808
1973                             477
1974                             456
1975                             435
1976                             416
1977                             397
1978                             379
1979                             362
1980                             346
1981                             330
10.       To obtain the number of workers leaving which can be offset
against the loss in jobs through mechanization it is necessary to deduct
the estimated number of workers who will be replaced in transport, factory
and ancillary operations. 1/ This has been done in Table 6, and the
resultant attrition for field operations compared with the number of jobs
to be lost.
1/   The annual replacement rate is also assumed to be 4.5%.  Using 1971
data this corresponds to 145 men per year.

11.       The cumulative attrition exceeds the cumulative number of jobs
to be lost for every year except for 1980. This means that, until 1980,
no redundancy problem need arise and, in fact, without any new recruitment
of field workers there would probably be a shortage of labor in some years.
Such shortages could easily be met through use of temporary seasonal helpers
as has been done in the past, or through increased hours per man. In '950 a
possible redundancy of 52 men arises, but this is easily avoided by carrying
the extra men for one year by which time more than sufficient attrition
will have accrued to offset this surplus.
12.       The mechanization program is therefore acceptable from a labor
viewpoint.  Further, the mission was assured that even without recruitment
of new field staff for the project period, there would be sufficient workers
with driving and mechanical skills to perform mechanized tield operations.
While Caroni is currently short of good mechanics for repair and maintenance
services, there is still scope for suitable people to be recruited into
the ancillary services through the 4.5% replacement rate allowed. Some
training schemes are also envisaged.

CARONI SUGAR PROJECT
Consultant Studies Draft Terms of Reference
No. 1:  Study of All Aspects of CompanOperations
Objectives of Study:
1.        To investigate all aspects of Caroni's operations, including
field, factory, and transport arrangements, administrative procedures and
financial affairs.
2.        To investigate the position of Caroni Ltd. within the Trinidad
sugar industry, and whether or not there is a place for the Orange Grove
National Company and Forres Park Ltd. within Caroni Ltd. or operated in
close association with it.
3.        To make recommendations to the Government and the Board of Caroni
Ltd. for the effective and efficient operation of the entire sugar industry
as a self-financing entity within the framework of Government policy for the
industry. Due consideration will be given to social and issues.
4.        To prepare comprehensive and detailed proposals for the implementa-
tion of the recommendations. These proposals will be prepared in close
consultation with the management of Caroni Ltd., and also the management of
the other sugar companies if there is reason to believe that the companies
concerned should be run in association with Caroni Ltd. rather than within it.
5.        To make recommendations for the services and ter-;s of reference
of a management advisory service for Caroni Ltd.
Composition of Study Team and Timing of Operations
The Study team will consist of:
6.        Team Leader.  A man with wide management experience in the sugar
industry, preferably with personal knowledge of the Caribbean.
7.        Cane Agronomist.  A man with a good technical background in cane
agronomy, preferably with detailed knowledge of drainage problems and fully
mechanized cane cultivation techniques.
8.        Agricultural Engineer.  A man with diverse experience of cane
cultivation and transport requirements, preferably with detailed knowledge
of mechanized cane harvesting techniques.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
9.        Management Accountant.  A man with a good accounting background,
a detailed knowledge of sugar accounting, and proven experience with the
introduction of management accounting procedures.
10.       Factory Specialist.  A man with a good background of cane processing
and one capable of advising on the engineering and production aspects of
sugar factories.
Timing
11.       The team requires three months in Trinidad, and a further two
months to write up and prepare a report. The team would also be required to
be available to submit the report to the Board of Caroni Ltd. in Trinidad.
It is therefore likely that six months' work would be required of each man.
The team will aim to start field work by the end of April 1973. This would
enable it to witness the 1973 cane harvest and the problems associated with
the onset of the rainy season at the end of May. After the study had been
completed and agreement reached on its recommendations, one member, probably
the management accountant, would remain for one to two years to assist with
the implementation of the recommendations.
Cost                                                                         US$
12.       Study.  Four consultants for six months at US$5,000/month =  120,000

of the flat lands of North Caroni that are situated within the Caroni, Couva,
and Caparo catchments.
3.        To prepare a basic drainage plan for North Caroni, taking into
account the possibilities of reclaiming the Caroni swamp if such work is
deemed to be feasible.
4.        To make recommendations to Caroni Ltd. on ways and means of imple-
menting a drainage and land forming program, including the costs and benefits
of such a program.



ANNEX 13

months for field investigations and report preparation. A week would be
required for presentation of the report. After the report had been
presented and recommendations agreed the irrigation engineer would be
retained in a consulting capacity to advise on the implementation of the
recommendations. Follow-up studies of individual aspects may be necessary.
Cost                                                                    US$
11.       Study:  10 consultant months at US$5,000/month    =          50,000
Implementation: Retaining fee of engineer for
four years at US$10,000/year      =       40,000

ExEenditure
6.        All operating costs are based on 1971/1972 expeniiture but suitably
adjusted to take into account changes arising from the proposed investment
program and consequent cost savings.
7.        Cost inflation is covered by a price contingency of 6% in 1972/73,
and 12% thereafter on all company operating costs.
8.        Purchase price for farmers' cane is based on a new formula agreed
between the company and farmers, and is related to the selling price of
sugar. As the selling price of sugar has been assumed to 'be constant, the
price per ton for farmers' cane is also constant.
9.        Plant cane and ratoon cultivation costs are based on 1971/72
figures of TT$ 280 and TT$ 95 per acre respectively, with savings to be
achieved as follows:
Year                 Plant Cane                   Ratoons
1972/73                 2.5%                        2.5%
1973/74                 5.0%                        2.5%
1974/75                 7.0%                        5.0%
1975/76                10.0%                        5.0%
1976/77                10.0%                        7.5%
10.       The following costs have been used for harvestirng cane:
Animal drawn carts              : Estate, TT$ 9.50/ton cane
: Contractors, TT$ 6.00/ton cane
Self loading trailers           : TT$ 5.00/ton cane
Mechanical harvesting           : TT$ 1.80/ton cane
11.       The following transport costs have been assumed:
(a)  Rail Transport                  : 1972/73  TT$ 3.09/ton cane
: 1973/74  TT$ 3.00/ton cane
: 1974/75  TT$ 2.90/ton cane
:  1975/76  TT$ 2.76/ton cane
(b)  Road Transport by               : Company  TT$ 1.70/ton cane
: Contractor:  TT$ 2.08/ton came
12.       Costs of maintenance of field and transport equipment are taken
at the 1971/72 levels, with an increase of TT$ 60,000 per combine harvester
unit (including in-field equipment). The following cost savings are antici-
pated through better operational efficiency:



ANNEX 14
Table 1

1972/73                           2.5%
1973/74                           5.0%
1974/75                           7.5%
1975/76                          10.0%
13.       Agricultural Department overheads are taken at the 1971/72 levels,
with savings of TT$ 200,000 in 1973/74, TT$ 400,000 in 1974/75, and
TT$ 420,000 thereafter.
14.       Sugar handling costs are calculated at TT$7.00/ton for 1972/73
through 1976/77 and at TT$7.40 for 1977/78 onwards.
15.       General overheads are taken at the level of 1971/72, with antici-
pated savings gradually increasing to TT$ 1,750,000 in 1975/76. The
TT$ 600,000 increase from 1977/78 represents management training, research
and inspection services costs, treated as revenue expenditure.
16.       Export cesses of TT$ 7.20/ton of sugar exported have been deducted.
These cover TT$ 4.80/ton for the Sugar Rehabilitation Fund, and TT$ 2.40!ton
for the Labor Welfare Fund.
17.       The following rates have been used for depreciation of fixed assets:
(i)  Factory Machinery                    5%
(ii)  Agricultural Equipment              15%
(iii)  Administration                      15%
(iv)  General Transport                   20%
18.       Management training, research and technical assistance expendi-
tures included in projects costs have been written off in the year of
expenditure.

Future Prospects for Sugar
1.        Through most of the 1950's and 1960's world production of sugar
greatly exceeded consumption. There were brief periods of temporary shortage
in 1963 and 1964, following poor crops in 'Cuba, but these were quickly
erased by further expansion of output elsewhere. Due to overproduction
sugar prices on the world market were very poor. Sugar producers in many
countries incurred heavy losses, though producers in the Caribbean were
sheltered from the worst effects of poor world prices by favored marketing
arrangements under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and American Sugar Act.
As a result of poor profitability many sugar industries declined and process-
ing facilities were neglected.
2.        In the 1970's the position is already changing.  Total world produc-
tion is now only marginally greater than consumption, stocks have been
depleted and the price of sugar on the free market has hardened appreciably.
Projections by Bank staff indicate that annual consumption is likely to rise
steadily in the next decade, from the current 72 million tons to 101 million
tons. This increase in consumption is likely to be most lpronounced in the
lesser developed countries, where per capita consumption is low, rather than
the developed countries where per capita consumption is already high and
unlikely to go much higher. The anticipated situation can be summarized
thus:

3.        About half the increased production is wanted in the lesser
developed countries, and the capital required for the capacity to produce
this 15 to 16 million tons annually is thought to be in the order of US$4.5
billion, of which US$2.9 billion would be a foreign exchange component.
These are formidable requirements. In the past the necessary capital has for
the most part been raised from private sources, but with the experiences of
the 1950's and 1960's this source of capital is likely to be more limited in
future. Relatively few private investors are likely to wish to reinvest
in the sugar industry on the scale that is required, thus increasing demand
for capital from Government and international sources.
4.        These pressures, rising consumption and the prospect of more
limited development capital, have resulted in a signficant increase in the
price of free market sugar.  This has risen from an average of 3.75 cents/lb
in 1970 to 4.52 cents/lb in 1971, and is likely to average about 7.3 cents/lb
in 1972. Informed opinion feels that prices are likely to remain firm for
some time. Current Bank forecasts are 8.12 cents/lb for 1974, 8.86 cents/lb
for 1975, and 8.96 cents/lb for 1976.
5.        Between 1973 and 1975 existing international sugar agreements are
due to be renegotiated. Such negotiations are likely to be influenced by the
prices actually ruling at time of negotiation. Hence, if prices remain firm
or rise further in the next 18 months, they may well set the level of prices over
over a much longer period. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to assume
that post 1974 prices will be as good as those ruling in 1974, and that there
will not be a decline to anywhere near the price levels of the 1960's.
6.        A detailed appraisal of sugar prospects for the next decade is
provided by a policy paper dated 11/7/1972 prepared by the Economic Analysis
and Projections Department of the Bank.
