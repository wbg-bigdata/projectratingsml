KOREA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF A
SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1. TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
1.01      The fundamental changes in Korea's economy over the past decade have
been accompanied by major development and changes in the transport sector.
Freight and passenger traffic tripled between 1966 and 1976; and results for
1977 and 1978, the first two years of the Fourth Five Year Plan 1977-81
(FFYP), show a continuation of the trend. As industrialization spread
throughout the country and GNP per capita more than doubled, Korea developed
its road transport system and its coastal shipping, and the railway lost its
preponderant position.
1.02      Traffic statistics (Tables 1.1 /1 and 1.2) illustrate these changes
over the 1966-76 decade. The rail transport share of freight traffic fell
from 78% of total ton-km to 45%, while road and coastal shipping shares
increased respectively from 12% to 30% and from 10% to 25%. For passenger
traffic, the rail share of total passenger-km fell from 43% to 25% over the
decade, while the road share increased correspondingly from 56% to 74%. These
trends have continued since 1977, although at a much slower pace as modal
allocation is gradually reaching equilibrium. These relative changes in modal
split reflect the economic advantages of the various modes, as rail and
coastal shipping increasingly concentrate on long distances and bulk
commodities, while road transport handles short distance and more diffuse
traffic.       ,,
1.03      The basic sector strategy has been and continues to be increasing
the capacity of the system fast enough to avoid bottlenecks that would cripple
the rapid growth of the economy. Thus the Government has been allocating
regularly, since the beginning of the Second Plan in 1967, about one quarter
of its total capital expenditure to expand and modernize transport
infrastructure. Investments have been concentrated on the Seoul-Busan axis
where most industrial development is taking place and on corridors to the
northeastern part of Korea to serve the country's coal mines and cement
plants. The FFYP public and private investment allocation for the transport
sector is Won 2,784 billion (US$5.7 billion). It is expected that 45% (Won
1,258 billion) will be invested by the public sector in infrastructure and
equipment. The remaining 55% (Won 1,526 billion) will be invested by the
private sector, primarily for road vehicles and ships (Table 1.3). Actual
investments for 1977 and budgeted ones for 1978 and 1979, deflated to 1975
constant prices, indicate that implementation is about 10% behind the plan
target (Table 1.4). However, actual investments in 1977 were only 80% of that
/1 Tables are given in Annex 3.

year's budget which would indicate greater lag behind the plan then shown by
the budgeted amounts for 1978 and 1979. A further shortfall is expected in
1980 as a result of a very tight budget, and some delays are anticipated in
the implementation of highways and ports projects.
1.04      Other major sectoral objectives have been to constantly improve the
efficiency with which the transport system is used, and to establish institu-
tions to plan, construt, maintain, and operate the system efficiently. The
Bank has played a very active role in advising and assisting the Korean
authorities in pursuing these objectives and establishing such institutions
as the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) in the Ministry of Construction and the
Korea Maritime and Port authority (KMPA); and in strengthening the Korean
National Railroad (KNR).
1.05      For many years, the transport system has been strained by the
demands of rapid economic growth. As a result, and to ensure that development
priorities were reflected in the allocation of scarce transportation means
among competing claims, the Government established fairly tight regulations in
the sector. Licensing regulations in the road subsector are still restrictive
despite some relaxation in recent years and tariffs for all modes are set by
Government. Now that the system is more developed and also more complex,
these rgulations should be relaxed to allow the market to determine the most
appropriate levels of service and tariffs. The Bank has maintained a dialogue
with Korea on sector legislation, mainly through highway projects, and on
tariff adjustments, mainly through railway and port projects; it has also con-
tributed to a better analysis of investments in the entire sector and to
transport coordination in general. Partial relaxation of commercial road
vehicle licensing was implemented in 1977, and road, rail and port tariffs
were increased several times during recent years. The new trend in the
Economic Planning Board (EPB) is for further liberalization of the economy in
general, but there is still a strong preference among many agencies for
retaining as much control as possible. Through its lending operations in the
sector, the Bank will continue to press for greater flexibility in the use of
the transport system and in tariff setting, as well as assist Government in
investment planning analysis and transport coordination. In particular,
assistance will be provided in 1980 and 1981 during the preparation of the
country's next five-year plan 1982-86.
The Transport System
Road Transport
1.06      The present highway system is still inadequate to cope with the
rapid growth of road transport, despite the Government's effort since 1968 to
develop a modern road network. Only 58% of the national road, 8% of the pro-
vincial roads, and 3% of the county roads are paved, and a high level of
investment will continue to be required. The Bank Group has financed four
highway projects, totalling US$334.5 million: Loan 769-KO in 1971 \
(US$54.5 million), Loan 956-KO in 1975 (US$47 million), Loan 1203-KO in 1976
US$90 million) jointly with a loan by the Saudi Fund for Development, and



- 3 -
Loan 1640-KO in 1978 (US$143 million). Performance on these projects
generally has been satisfactory. The major institutional achievements of
these projects have been the creation and development of the Bureau of Public
Roads in the MIlnistry of Construction (MOC) and the setting up of MOC field
organization fof maintaining the national road system. A study is now
underway to review the institutions dealing with provincial and gun roads,
which come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and
it is expected that future road projects will assist with institution building
within MOHA for the development and maintenance of these roads.
1.07      Road transport of freight and passengers grew rapidly over the last
decade and, as mentioned above, the share of road transport increased
dramatically at the expense of the railways. However, the motor vehicle fleet
in Korea is still small. when compared with other countries of similar and even
lower income levels. The 385,000 four wheel road vehicles registered at the
end of 1978 amount to only 10.4 per 1,000 persons; while the ratios are 14.3
in Thailand, 15.4 in the Philippines, and 48.2 in Malaysia, all with lower per
capita income than Korea. There are many reasons why Korea's vehicle fleet is
small: the high taxation of private cars, the restrictive licensing of
commercial vehicles, the high cost of locally manufactured vehicles, and the
recent development of the road network. Only 15 years ago, Korea had less
than 1,000 km of roads.
1.08      Starting from a small base, the vehicle fleet is growing rapidly;
the number of private automobiles almost doubled over the last two years. One
of the most important issues now faced by Government in the transport sector
is the appropriate roles of private (automobile) and public transport. While
the private car and taxi offer a versatile and economic way to meet transport
demand in rural areas and small towns, their uncontrolled use in the larger
cities would create congestion and require massive investments and space.
This point is illustrated by recent road investments by the cities of Seoul
and Busan, which totalled US$374 million in 1977 and 1978, and thus exceeded
central government road investments for the rest of the country over this
period. The Government is, however, pursuing its policy to restrict
ownership and use of private cars. The cost of the smallest car is about
US$5,600 of which 40% is tax; annual license for the same is around
US$200; and the price of regular gasoline was increased to US$4 per gallon in
January 1980.
Railways
1.09      As mentioned above, the railway has lost its predominant position
in relative terms, but both freight and passenger traffic have continued to
increase in absolute terms. Cost comparisons indicate that rail transport
is still the most economic means of moving bulk traffic over medium and long
distances, and also has an important role to play in long distance passenger
traffic. In 1978, about 76% of rail freight traffic consisted of six bulk
commodities. In addition to its long distance hauling of bulk freight\ and
passengers, KNR plays a growing role in providing rapid transit service for
Seoul and its suburbs. Details are given in Chapter 2.



-4-
1.10      Since 1962, the Bank Group assisted KNR through six projects total-
ling US$340 million. The first four lending operations have been satis-
factorily completed. Disbursements of the Fifth Railway Loan 1101-KO) are
96% completed. The Sixth Railway Loan (1542-KO of US$120 million in 1978)
is proceeding on schedule and the loan is expected to be almost fully
disbursed by end 1980; at which time the disbursement of the proposed
project will start. Much progress has been made through this continuous
assistance in providing KNR with more autonomy, both operationally and
financially. A management study carried out under the Fifth Project has
recently been completed and its recommendations form the basis of a time
phased plan to complete the transformation of KNR into a public corporation
(para. 2.02 to 2.04).
1.11      KNR earned positive returns until 1971.  Since then, the financial
performance deteriorated under rapid inflation and the reluctance of
Government to increase public sector tariffs so as not to further contribute
to inflation. Tariff increases agreed under the Sixth Project were granted
in 1978 and 1979 and the financial situation has improved. The proposed
project will concentrate more on the structure of tariffs than on overall
tariffs increases (para. 2.34). The requirements of covenants covering
operational and technical matters have, in general, been met satisfactorily,
with a consequent improvement in KNR's level of performance. Progress has
also been made in building up on organization in the Ministry of
Transportation to coordinate transport planning and investment (para. 1.15
to 1.17).
Ports and Shipping
1.12      Freight traffic through the ports has increased from about 13 mil-
lion tons in 1966 to over 110 million tons in 1978. This tremendous increase
resulted in serious port capacity problems, particularly at Busan, the largest
port, which handles 20% of the country's external trade and is chronically
congested. The Bank has assisted development in Busan through two port
projects totaling US$147 million and the Asian Develpment Bank (ADB) is
financing the expansion of Incheon, the port nearest to Seoul. The Saudi Fund
for Development participated in the financing of the first Busan Port Project.
The Government has also proceeded to develop a number of specialized ports
serving specific industrial sites, e.g. Bugpyeong for cement, Pohang for
steel, Ulsan for oil and petrochemicals, Onsan for nonferrous metals, Changwon
for heavy engineering, and Samil (Yeosu) for fertilizer and petrochemicals.
1.13      The role of coastal shipping has greatly increased in the last
decade, from 10% of the ton-km moved in Korea in 1966 to 25% in 1978. This
is mainly due to the construction of industrial complexes on coastal loca-
tions, and, to a lesser extent, to shortages in rail and road capacity.
Korea's share in the merchant shipping of its external trade has been
increasing and reached 50% of the total tonnage handled in 1978.



-5-
Aviation
1.14      Although domestic air passenger traffic grew rapidly until 1973,
it still amounts to less than 1% of total passenger-km; air-freight is also
neglibible. Domestic routes are served by the privately-owned Korean Air-
lines (KAL), which also operates internationally. Most international traffic
is handled at the Seoul-Kimpo International Airport; other international
airports are at Busan and at Jeju Island, a major tourist center.
Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
1.15      The Government set up in 1970 a Transport Planning Office on the
recommendations of a study by consultants under the Bank Technical Assist-
ance Project - Transport, Credit S4-KO, and with assistance provided under
that Credit, the First Highway Project Loan 769-KO, and the Third Railway
Project Credit 183/Loan 669-KO. Over the past few years, the Government
has taken steps to further improve transport coordination. In 1975, this
function was reorganized by the establishment of a Transport Coordination
Committee (TCC) consisting of nine directors, representing ministries most
directly concerned with transport matters, and a Transport Coordination
Office (TCO) in the Ministry of Transportation (Chart 19013)./1 In 1977,
recognizing the importance of its function, the Government upgraded the
position of the head of the TCO from director general to assistant minister,
and in 1979 the newly appointed assistant minister reorganized the TCO,
centralizing the planning and coordination of all modes of transport into
one division with the bulk of TCO's staff. Smaller divisions deal with
matters pertaining to KMPA and KNR, and with economic cooperation.
1.16      The planning and coordination division now prepares annual traffic
forecasts for all modes of transport. Early in the year, it also compiles
and reviews all investments in the sector and, after discussions with the
respective agencies, submits an agreed investment budget to EPB. The TCO
also prepares, with other bureaus of MOT, proposals for tariff changes
which are then discussed with EPB. The EPB, which exercises budgetary
control and plays a senior role with regard to all other ministries, has
the final decision on investment projects as well as on tariffs in the
sector. To review major investment projects, EPB has established a separate
Bureau of Project Evaluation. The function of this bureau is however
mainly to ensure that the investment projects are adequately prepared and,
in the case of transport projects, the Bureau has so far relied on the
preparation work of specialized agencies and TCO. This arrangement is
adequate to avoid duplication of work.
1.17      the TCC does not meet often formally, but its members have informal
discussions as problems warrant. For instance, a working group for the
preparation of the next five year plan, 1982-86, has already been formed under
the direction of the assistant minister TCO, and with representatives of
J1 Charts are given in Annex 3.



the ministries and agencies dealing with transport and those using transport
such as agriculture, commerce, and industry. Five year traffic forecasts for
all modes will be prepared by the spring of 1981, and a sector investment plan
by the end of July 1981. This effort will be greatly assisted by the compre-
hensive transport study now being carried out by the Korea Institute of
Science and Technology (KIST) under the Sixth Railway Project. The study is
expected to be completed toward the middle of 1980. Training of Government
staff is needed to improve in particular TCO's capability of performing its
role in transport coordination. During negotiations, agreement was reached on
a schedule for training Government staff in transport planning and
coordination.
2. RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
KNR Organization
2.01      KNR is a semi-autonomous agency within the Ministry of Transporta-
tion, with its own management, accounts and portion of the national budget.
The legal basis for KNR's administration and operation is set out in:
(a) Law for Government Organization No. 2907, revised December 31, 1976;
and (b) KNR Organization-Presidential Decree No. 7310, dated November 4,
1974. The Government, largely through EPB, exercises control over staff,
financial, budgetary and tariff matters. The Administrator of KNR is
appointed by the Government to assume the function of General Manager. While
most previous KNR general managers were appointed from outside the Railway,
the present Administrator was appointed from the railway staff. The
Administrator is assisted by a Deputy-administrator who comes from within KNR
and is in charge of the day-to-day operations. Chart 20944 shows KNR's
organization. KNR's management enjoys reasonable day-to-day managerial
freedom.
Management, Staff and Training
2.02      Management is generally satisfactory, as reflected by KNR's high
operating efficiency. However, some improvement in KNR's organization is
desirable to rationalize managerial functions and responsibilities. There
is an immediate need to reinforce KNR's capability for financial, economic
and investment planning. The Government, aware of these weaknesses, had
agreed to utilize remaining funds under the Bank's Fifth Railway Loan
(1101-KO) to carry out a comprehensive management study under Terms of
Reference agreed during negotiations of Loan 1542-KO (Sixth Railway Project).
The study was completed in September 1979.
2.03      The study's main conclusion is that KNR should be gradually
transformed from its present status as a semi-autonomous Government Agency
to that of a Public Corporation; to give it the necessary independence and
managerial and financial freedom to fully play its role as a competitive
carrier. Managerial functions would be delegated, under the guidance of a



- 7 -
Board of Directors and the control of the Administrator (renamed President),
to three line managers (renamed Executive Vice Presidents) in charge
of Planning, Coordination and Control; Operations; and Administration
respectively. Chart 20995 shows KNR's recommended organization. This
transformation wDuld be prepared by a set of short and mid-term measures
focussing on: (a) the establishment of a management information system and of
an aggressive Marketing Organization within KNR; (b) the strengthening of
KNR's capability in the fields of economic analysis for investment planning,
financial management and accounting procedures, with special emphasis on
implementation of performance budgeting and incremental long-term variable
costing; and (c) progressive reorganization of KNR's management along the
lines described above to ensure KNR's smooth transition to a public
corporation.
2.04      During negotiations, it was agreed that KNR would become a public
corporation no later than January 1, 1987; this date corresponds to the end
of the forthcoming five-year plan (1981-86). Also agreed, was a timetable of
short and mid-term measures necessary to achieve this transformation, and in
particular detailed short-term measures which are given in Annex 2.
2.05      KNR presently employs about 40,000 staff of whom about 33,500 are
permanent employees with Government civil service status. The rest consists
of semi-permanent and temporary personnel used in workshops and on track
works on a seasonal basis. Total staff is expected to attain about 48,500
by the end of 1982 to meet anticipated traffic demand. Staff productivity
in terms of traffic units (pass km plus net ton km) per employee is one of
the highest in the world. It reached 808,000 units per employee in 1979 as
against some 500,000 in European railways. This is due partly to the dense
urban and intercity passenger travel and heavy bulk mineral traffic and partly
to KNR's staff discipline and professional conscientiousness.
2.06      Basic salaries and allowances are generally in line with Government
pay scales. Although they were increased in average by 6.5% p.a. in real
terms and 13.5% p.a. for inflation between 1970 and 1979, they are substan-
tially lower than in comparable private industrial and commercial enterprises
in Korea. This causes some difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified
and experienced personnel. Present basic salaries range from about W 40,000
(US$67 equivalent) to about W 250,000 (US$429 equivalent) per month.
Allowances, which increase with length of service, range from W 25,000 to
W 150,000 per month. Salaries in real terms are expected to grow at a slower
pace during the next five years, in line with a somewhat lower general
economic growth.
2.07      Training programs were reviewed by the Bank during the Fifth and
Sixth Railway Projects under which necessary equipment and material for prac-
tical training was purchased. Training programs are now adequate and generate
considerable interest among the staff. The proposed loan includes some funds
for overseas training of staff, particularly in the field of investment
planning and computerized commercial and cost accounting in relatior with the
implementation of measures referred to in para. 2.04.

Railway Facilities
Tracks
2.08      The system consists of 3,111 route-km of standard gauge (1.435 m)
and 47 km of narrow gauge (0.76 m) lines; 607 km are double track and the
remainder single track (Table 2.1 and 2.11 and Map 13134). There are many
lines in sharp curves. There are about 140 km of tunnels and 97 km of
bridges. The main lines are laid with 50 kg/m rails, while secondary lines
have mostly 50 kg/m and 37 kg/m rails (see Table 2.2).  All rail renewals are
presently carried out with 50 kg/m rails, and 60 kg/m rails will be used on
heavy traffic lines from 1981 on. Of the total number of sleepers in use
about 79% are timber and 21% are concrete. Rail joint welding is carried out
to an increasing extent with about 244 km completed by the end of 1978. All
lines have crushed stone ballast.
2.09      During the proposed project period (1980-81), KNR plans to carry
out renewal of about 320 track-km of worn out rails. KNR will also continue
its sleeper and ballast renewal program. A workshop for the manufacture of
points and crossing components, the preparation of timber sleepers and
the rehabilitation of used track material is being set up.
2.10      Existing double track lines are the Gyeong Bu and Gyeong In lines,
section Daejeon-Iri of the Ho Nam line and section Bongyang-Jecheon of the
Jung Ang line. Doubling of the Chung Bug line is ongoing and will
be completed by the end of 1980. In the Seoul area, quadrupling of the
Yeongdeungpo-Suweon section and doubling of the Yongsan-Susaeg and Seongbug-
Euijeonbu sections for suburban services will be completed by 1981.
2.11      The single track industrial lines between the northeast and
Seoul are electrified. The electrification of the Jung Ang line between
Jecheon and Yeongju, earlier considered for 1980/81 has now been deferred to
the next plan period. Most of the Seoul urban tracks are also electrified,
in association with the Seoul Metropolitan Electrified Suburban Railway
System (SMESRS); extension of the electrification to the Yongsan-Susaeg and
Seongbug-Euijeonbu lines will be completed by 1981.
Signalling
2.12      Centralized traffic control (CTC) has been installed in the Seoul
urban area and on the heavily trafficked electrified single line Seoul-
Jecheon. Under the new project, CTC is to be installed on the section
Yeongju-Gyeongju of the Jung Ang line (about 164 km deferred from the sixth
railway project) and the Tae Baeg line (about 107 km). The CTC installation
on the Dae Gu line, which was included in the sixth railway project, has
been deferred to the next plan period. The above deferrals were agreed
with the Bank. The Gyeong Bu line has an automatic block system while on
other lines electric interlocking or token block systems are used. For
safety, an automatic train stopping system is being installed.



-9-
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
2.13      KNR's motive power and rolling stock fleet at the end of 1979 is
given in Tables 2.3 and 2.4. The fleet consists of 406 diesel and 90 electric
locomotives (with about 10 steam locomotives still on shunting duties),
120 diesel rail cars, 252 electric railcars (on the Seoul urban electrified
lines), about 1,815 passenger cars, and about 16,000 freight cars (including
about 1,600 privately-owned cars). Another 10 diesel locomotives, 37 electric
railcars, 246 passenger cars and 1,520 freight cars (of which 100 privately
owned) have been ordered for delivery in 1979/80. An additional 10 diesel
locomotives, 12 diesel railcars, 146 electric railcars (of which 130 for
SMESRS), 246 passenger cars and 100 freight cars are included in the project.
2.14      Under the Sixth Railway Project KNR agreed to:  (a) furnish to the
Bank for review a plan to improve: (i) the maintenance; and (ii) the utili-
zation of KNR's locomotives and rolling stock; and (b) implement such plan
thereafter in consultation with the Bank. The plans have been submitted to
the Bank and are being implemented, resulting in improved availability and
utilization (see para 2.28).
Workshops
2.15      At present, KNR has main workshops at: Seoul (electric locomotives,
diesel and electric railcars, passenger cars and freight cars), Yeongdeungpo
(steam locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars), Incheon (passenger cars
and freight cars), and Busan (diesel locomotives, passenger cars and freight
cars). Steam locomotives are expected to be completely phased out by 1981. A
new rolling stock workshop is being constructed at Daejeon; the freight car
shop is just completed and the passenger car shop is expected to be in use by
1981. Some additional subsidiary shops at Daejeon are included in the
project. KNR is planning to transfer all passenger and freight car
maintenance to the new workshops at Daejeon and, by 1981/82, to close the
existing workshops at Yeongdeungpo and Incheon after transferring usable
equipment to other workshops. Provision is also made in the project for
necessary improvements to remaining running sheds.
Telecommunications
2.16      The telecommunication system is in general satisfactory.  Some
further improvements of station-to-station and station-to-train communications
are included in the project.
Freight Terminals
2.17      Due to rapidly increasing traffic there are difficulties handling
the freight at the existing stations in the Seoul area.  KNR, therefore,
has developed a plan for the construction of new freight terminals near Seoul.
The first two of these terminals, at Bugog south of Seoul, and Susaeg west of
Seoul, were included in the Sixth Railway Project. At Bugog some preparation



- 10 -
study, carried out by Korea Institute for Science and Technology (KIST), are
available. The Susaeg terminal is now deferred to the proposed project.
Other Property
2.18      In general, buildings, stations, offices and general plant of the
railways are reasonably maintained.
Traffic
Freight Traffic
2.19      KNR's freight traffic statistics from 1966 to 1979 and forecasts
to 1986 are given in Tables 2.5 through 2.7 and illustrated on Chart 20993.
Freight traffic has grown at average annual rates of 6.7% in tons and 6% in
tons-km since 1966. Major commodities which contributed to these increases
were coal and cement.  Coal transport by rail increased from 10.5 million
tons in 1966 to 18.0 million tons in 1979, and cement from 1.7 million tons
to 11.2 million tons during the same period. In 1979, freight traffic was
50.9 million tons and 11.1 billion ton-km, the average transport distance
was 218 km. Freight net ton per route km averaged 3.0 million in 1979.
Freight densities (see Chart 21015) are highest on KNR industrial lines
between Seoul and the northeast region of coal mines and cement plants,
exceeding 13 million tons on the heaviest section. The net highest freight
densities are on the Jung Ang line south of Jecheon and on the Seoul-Busan
line, with the busiest sections carrying around 4 million tons annually.
2.20      Bulk commodities best suited for rail transport - such as coal,
cement, ore, oil, fertilizer, and grain accounted for 77% of KNR's total
freight ton-km in 1979, up from 69% in 1966. Apart from some military and
KNR's own transport, the remainder consists mainly of general cargo.
Tonnage of this carried by KNR since 1966 has fluctuated between 4.5 million
and 6 million tons p.a., reacting to factors such as the opening of the
Seoul-Busan expressway in 1970 (much of the general cargo originally carried
by KNR was suitable for highway transport), and the economic slowdown in
1975.
2.21      Past freight traffic forecasts have all been too optimistic with
the exception of the forecast in the Fourth Project (Loan 863-KO) of 1972
which followed the traffic downturn in 1971 and 1972 (Chart 20993). Despite
this past experience, lengthy discussions developed between KNR and the Bank
during the appraisal of the Sixth Project in 1977 about the need to take
a more conservative approach for the future and the forecasts made in 1977 are
running about 8% above actual traffic in tons and 10% in ton-km. The major
shortfall is on coal where the ambitious production target set earlier
by Government has not been met.



- ii -
2.22      For the future, a more conservative growth between 3% and 5% p.a.
in ton-km has been assumed and detailed forecasts by commodities for high,
low, and best estimates are given in Tables 2.5 to 2.7. The best estimate
shows freight traffic reaching slightly over 65 million tons and 14 billion
ton-km by 1986, with the basic composition of the traffic remaining
unchanged, except for the emergence of more container traffic. These
forecasts were agreed with KNR during the appraisal and appear realistic.
Passenger Traffic
2.23      Tables 2.8 through 2.10 show KNR's passenger traffic statistics
from 1966 to 1979, as well as forecasts to 1986. Significant changes occur-
red in the last ten years which greatly affected passenger traffic. They
were the opening of expressways in 1970-71, followed by the development of
longdistance bus transport; the rise in personal incomes, which increased
mobility and the demand for greater comfort, resulting in a shift to the
higher class trains; and, finally, the opening in 1974 of the first Seoul
subway line connected to KNR's electrified suburban lines.
2.24      Regarding long-distance travel, passenger traffic grew regularly
until 1969, when it reached 115 million passengers and 9.7 billion pass-km.
Due to sharp bus competition, particularly following the opening of the
Seoul-Busan and the DaeJon-Gwangju expressways, the number of long-distance
passengers fell to 85 million in 1971.  By 1973, however, passengers and
pass-km were back to their 1969 levels, and both have been growing steadily
since then, despite the 1974-75 economic slowdown. In the first three years
of the FFYP, 1977 to 1979, the number of long-distance passengers increased
25% and at the end of 1978 it reached the level forecast for 1981 of 156 mil-
lion.
2.25      As mentioned above, the growth in long-distance passenger traffic
has been paralleled by a shift from lower class (ordinary) trains to limited
express and special express. The number of passengers on express trains
increased fivefold in the last five years, while the number of ordinary
passengers remained almost constant (Table 2.9). Regarding suburban lines
in the Seoul metropolitan area, SMESRS passenger traffic grew rapidly from
the start of service in 1974 and exceeded 240 million passengers in 1979.
2.26      Contrary to freight forecasts, passenger forecasts have systematic-
ally been exceeded by actual traffic (Chart 20992). The developments referred
to above make forecasting extremely difficult. To illustrate the point, the
number of special express passengers doubled between 1975 and 1978 and limited
express passengers more than tripled during the same period, while the number
of ordinary passengers only increased by 5%.



- 12 -
2.27      For the future, annual growth rates between 5% and 7% in
passengers and between 7% and 10% in passenger-km have been retained, on the
assumption that GNP would continue to grow at around 7% to 8% p.a. over
this period, and that the Government would continue to maintain a restrictive
policy on the ownership and use of private cars. Detailed forecasts by types
of service for high, low and best estimates are given in Tables 2.8 to 2.10.
the best estimates show the number of intercity passengers reaching 268 milion
in 1986 with about 30 billion passenger-km. In the absence of a comprehensive
urban transport study covering the entire metropolitan area, forecasts of
Seoul suburban traffic are difficult. KNR's forecast of over 760 million
passengers on its suburban lines in 1986 appears reasonable.
Operations
2.28      Table 2.11 gives a summary of KNR's operating statistics for
1971-79. Operating efficiency remains high and in general continues to
improve; some examples are given in the following table.

forecasts are defined in para. 3.18.

2.29      The following table gives unit average operating costs, revenues
and net operating revenue comparisons for the years 1973-1979.

1979      8.42       6.73       (1.69)            4.96       5.63        0.67
While freight suffered a loss every year, passenger traffic generated a profit
every year except in 1976 when it incurred a small deficit.
2.30      Table 2.12 gives cost data for 1979.  The table shows that the
sizeable net operating revenue generated by passenger traffic, for which the
operating ratio is expected to reach a low of 88%, stems from special and
limited express passenger services while regular, ordinary express and
commuter train services, and baggage services are operated at a loss.
Ordinary express and baggage service tariffs cover total variable costs but
only 70% of overheads while regular and commuter train tariffs cover only 93%
and 46% respectively of variable costs. All freight tariffs cover full
variable costs but only cement and ore contribute fully to overheads. The
lowest contribution to overheads is generated by fertilizer tariffs (5%).
2.31      Although average fully distributed operating costs per freight
ton/km doubled and corresponding costs per passenger/km increased by about
69% between 1975 and 1979, the respective costs of Won 8.42 (US¢ 1.24) per
ton/km and Won 4.96 (US¢ 1.02) per passenger are still low.  This is due to
a high degree of utilization of rail facilities and rolling stock, low
salaries and wages and high staff productivity. KNR's profitability
therefore depends on the adequacy of tariffs.
2.32      KNR's tariffs are uniform throughout the system and are regulated
by the Government. In the past, the latter has only reluctantly permitted KNR
to raise its tariffs, mainly for social reasons. The following table shows
average tariff increases implemented by KNR since 1975:

/a Result of reclassification.
Between 1975 and mid-1978, the Government, mainly under Bank pressure,
permitted KNR to increase freight tariffs at a faster rate than passenger
fares. However this trend was reversed in 1978-79 with the result that the
average deficit per freight ton/km rose from Won 0.51 in 1977 to Won 1.26 in
1979. This shows the inadequacy of KNR's tariff policies.
2.33      KNR's tariff policies should take into account the following
criteria:
(a) the ability of tariffs to provide sufficient revenue to
cover all costs, including a fair return on invested capital;
(b) the ability of the tariff structure to effectively encourage
productive use of the transport service and discourage wasteful
or less productive use; and
(c)  where competing modes of transportation exist, the tariff
structure should also encourage utilization by each user of the
most cost-effective transport mode. This is particularly
important in view of the continuous increase in the cost of
energy.
2.34      To meet these criteria, KNR's tariff structure needs to be revised
to make sure that:
(a) it provides KNR with revenues sufficient to cover all
operating costs including depreciation provisions based on
fixed assets revalued annually plus the rates of return
specified in para. 5.17; and
(b) no single tariff would be lower than KNR's variable costs
unless the Government subsidizes the difference between
variable costs and the actual tariff.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to make progressive changes in
KNR's tariff structure, starting with the next tariff increase, in order to
achieve the goals above no later than December 31, 1984.

Budget, Accounting and Audit
Budget
2.35      In compliance with the provisions of Section 3.02 of Loan Agreement
1542-KO (Sixth Railway Project) KNR has been allowed to submit its budgets in
a commercial form starting in 1979 and given flexibility in reallocating
operating budget funds as necessary to handle changes in traffic demand. The
Government has not, however, granted KNR the freedom to fix the emoluments of
its staff. Expenditures under the Investment budget are still rigidly con-
trolled against budget provision by the Government's Office of Audits.  The
proposed change in KNR's status (para. 2.03) implies that KNR be given the
freedom to fix salaries and to reallocate all budget funds; this would allow
KNR to attract and retain qualified staff, and to react quickly to changes in
traffic demand. The Government's plan for implementing this change was agreed
at negotiations (para. 2.04).
Accounting
2.36      Work on implementing the computerized commercial accounting system,
devised by consultants under the Fourth Railway Project in 1975-76, is still
under way. The late start in implementing the system was caused by KNR's
inability to recruit sufficient qualified and experienced accounting staff
with computer experience. In addition, when the management study consultants
(paras. 2.02 and 2.03) reviewed implementation of the system, they found that
KNR staff, who had attempted to complete implementation of the system after
departure of its originators in 1977, had had difficulties in understanding
the system. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in 1979 with the
assistance of the management study consultants. However, KNR will need
further help in updating the system and completing its implementation. The
foreign cost of this assistance will be financed under the technical
assistance component of the proposed loan.
2.37      This assistance will also help KNR to update and complete implemen-
tation of the traffic costing system. The management study consultants found
that while the basic principles used for devising the system are sound,
detailed suggested calculations, formulas and factors may no longer be valid
within the framework of KNR's improved accounting and statistical procedures.
In addition, the system needs to be revised to provide data for incremental
variable costing.
Audit
2.38      The auditing of KNR's accounts by auditors satisfactory to the Bank
is now carried out regularly. The audit reports for 1976, 1977 and 1978 were
received within six months of the end of the fiscal year. During negotia-
tions, the time allowed to produce the audit report for the Bank was extended
from the present five months to six months after the end of each fiscal year.

3. INVESTMENT PLAN AND PROJECT
Project Objectives and Relation to the Sector
3.01       The proposed project would be the Bank Group's seventh lending
operation to KNR which has received $340 million in loan and credit since
1962 to assist its modernization and expansion. The objectives of the
project are directly focused on the goals set jointly with Government for
Bank involvement in the sector (paras. 1.03 to 1.05), namely to increase
capacity of the transport system in a most economically efficient way to
develop and strengthen the institutions dealing with the transport sector.
3.02       Although the railway has lost its predominant position it remains
the most economic mode of moving bulk commodities to inland destinations. It
plays a particularly important role for the movement of coal in an energy-
short economy, and also for the distribution of cement, ore, oil, fertilizer
and grains. The analysis conducted since the sixth project also indicated
that KNR has an economic, as well as energy saving role to play in the
increasing movements of containers in the Seoul Busan corridor. The Bank's
continuous involvement will lend support to KNR in playing its appropriate
role in container transport.
3.03      Over the past three to four years, the combination of increasing
incomes and the Government policy of restricting the ownership and use of
private automobile has led to sharply increasing demand for the more
comfortable and faster train services. The number of passengers transported
in the intercity express trains quadrupled between 1974 and 1979. KNR has
done its best to accommodate this demand, but capacity is strained. Rolling
stock financed under the sixth project is now coming on stream, but demand
continues to increase faster than supply. The forthcoming project offers an
opportunity to the Bank to support two essential Government policies: (a) to
hold down the use of private automobile by continuously improving public
transport both for long distance and urban passenger services; and (b) to
structure the country's physical development, focusing on five cities:
Daejon, Daegu, Masan, Gwangju and Jeonju, by improving passenger train
service to these cities from Seoul and Busan. Recent analyses also indicate
that with the high occupancy of passenger trains experienced in Korea, trains
consume less fuel per passenger than expressway buses on the long distance
routes such as Seoul-Busan.
3.04      Apart from providing the financial resources to cover a decreasing
portion of KNR's capital expenditures (30% of 1978/79 requirements through the
sixth project and about 15% of the 1980/81 requirements through the proposed
project), the Bank has been closely associated with the formulaton of KNR's
investment plans and measures which have made KNR one of the most efficiently
operated railroads in the world. Continued Bank assistance on these matters
is sought both by the Government and KNR. Despite great progress in opera-
tions, KNR still needs assistance in planning and management. Invariably,
project preparation by the Bank have resulted in substantial revisions in
the size and phasing of investments. In the course of preparing this,



- 17 -
project with KNR, the mission suggested reductions of investment of about
US$160 million or about 20% of KNR's original proposal. The point is that
KNR is highly receptive to the Bank's review of its investment plan exercises
and will continue to rely on and benefit from them until in-house planning
capacity can be strengthened sufficiently. Because of the shortage of
qualified transport specialists in Korea and the constraints of 'R's salary
structure in recruiting and retaining such qualified personnel, the problem
will remain in the medium-term and particularly for the preparation of the
next five-year plan 1982-86. In the interim, the Bank should continue to
provide KNR and Government with the required advice and guidance in investment
planning.
3.05      To remedy KNR's shortcomings in investment planning and other
commercial, financial and managerial aspects, a management study was carried
out in 1979. KNR will need assistance for the full implementation of the
study recommendations and in particular to complete its commercial and cost
accounting system. The system was developed a few years ago by consultants
but its implementation has been plagued by a variety of problems; difficulty
of understanding the instructions partly because of a deficient translation,
rapid turnover to staff who are attracted by higher salaries in a very
competitive private sector, less than full support from higher management who
feel uncomfortable with the changes, etc. Again here, the Bank should
continue to provide support and guidance which some of the managerial
improvements are being made and in particular a reliable costing system is
implemented and fully operational.
3.06      While the financial objectives agreed between the Bank, the
Government and KNR are gradually reached, KNR is not yet at a stage where
it could borrow on the international capital market and therefore, Bank's
financial contribution, although reduced as indicated in para. 3.04, is
still needed. The less favorable macroeconomic situation of Korea in 1979
and 1980 with renewed balance of payment deficits is another reason for
continuous lending to KNR, which runs a top quality operation and can
make use of the funds both quickly and efficiently. It is expected that
the sixth project of 1978 will be completed by mid-1981, about six months
earlier than originally scheduled.
KNR's Investment Plan 1977-81
3.07      During the appraisal of the Sixth Railway Project in 1977, agreement
was reached between the Government and the Bank on KNR's 1977-81 Investment
Plan totalling W 503 billion (US$1,037 million) with a foreign exchange
component of W 211 million (US$436 million). This Plan was later revised
taking into consideration:
(a) larger price increases than expected, mainly for local currency
items;
(b) additional works and equipment, mainly (i) doubling of the
Chung Bug line, (ii) expansion of the Bugog freight terminal,
(iii) improvement of station facilities on the SMESRS lines,



- 18 -
and (iv) additional rolling stock to meet the higher than fore-
cast passenger traffic demand (180 electric railcars, of which 164
are for SMESRS, 12 diesel railcars and 92 passenger cars);
(c)  deferment of works to 1982 and later, mainly (i) electrifica-
tion of the Jecheon-Yeongju (64 km) and Seoul-Susaeg sections
(8.5 km), (ii) extensions of marshalling yards at Jecheon and
Deogha, and (iii) CTC on the Dae Gu line;
(d)  reduction in provision of concrete sleepers (from 800,000 to
220,000), points and crossings (from 980 to 530) and ballast (from
640,000 to 95,000 cu m);
(e)  reduction in motive power and rolling stock by 2 diesel and 6
electric locomotives, and 460 freight cars; mainly due to a lower
than the forecast freight traffic increase; and
(f)  devaluation of the Won against the US$ effective January 15, 1980.
3.08      The composition and cost of the revised plan, as now agreed between
the Government and the Bank, are shown in detail in Table 3.1, a summary of
which is given below. The Plan as now drawn up assumes continued high and
further improving operational efficiency (see para. 3.23).

Cost Estimates
3.20      Project costs are based on estimated prices at the end of 1979
(Annex 4, reference C-3, Table 5). The cost of technical assistance is
estimated i. about US$4,000 per man-month of local staff and US$11,000 per
man-month for expatriate staff; out of which about US$2,000 are for foreign
and local travel and local subsistence. Physical contingencies of 5% in 1980
(since quantities are more precisely known) and 10% in 1981/82 have been
included fof all items except rail and track renewal and motive power and
rolling stock. PUice contingencies have been included for all items; assumed
price increases for local currency items are 25% annually in 1980, 15% in 1981
and 10% in i982; and for foreign currency items 10.5% annually in 1980, 9% in
1981 and 8% in 1982. Contingencies, physical and price, on all items taken
together reLresc_t about 24% of project cost (Table 3.03).

Procurement
3.24      Government procurement of equipment and material in Korea is
handled by the Office of Supply (OSROK). All items to be procured under the
proposed loan will be subject to international competitive bidding, in
accordance with Bank guidelines. In bid evaluation, Korean manufacturers of
equipment will be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. cost of
competing imports, or the relevant prevailing level of customs duties,
whichever is lower. Equipment financed by US Export-Import Bank will be
procured through negotiated contracts; for other items financing agency's
guidelines will apply. Civil works contracts will be awarded by KNR after
local competition among prequalified bidders.
Disbursements
3.25      Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and materials;
and/or
(b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment
and materials if local bidders are successful;
(c) 100% of cost of technical assistance; and
(d) 100% of foreign cost of overseas training.
Any savings under the loan would be used for financing additional, but
similar, project items, subject to review and agreement with the Bank.
3.26      An estimated schedule of disbursement is given in Table 3.11.
Disbursements are based on the assumption that the proposed loan would
become effective by July 15, 1980.
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
General
4.01      KNR continues to play a vital role in the economy of Korea.
Although road transport and coastal shipping have increased their share
over the last decade (para. 1.02), the railway remains the most economic
mode of moving bulk commodities to inland destinations. The line haul costs
are only a fraction of road costs and, while coastal shipping costs are
competitive with rail costs on a ton-km basis, the circuitous sea routes
often give rail the advantage. The traffic forecasts given in Chapter 2
have taken into consideration competition from other modes, particularly



- 27 -
coastal shipping, for bulk movements of commodities from coastal plants.
However, for coal and most cement, which account for over 50% of railway
ton-km, the major production areas are inland.  It is imperative that rail
capacity is sufficient to handle this traffic, which is vital for the
country's continued development.
4.02      The combination of increasing incomes and the government policy of
restricting the use of private automobiles has led to a sharply increasing
demand for the more comfortable and faster passenger train services. As
noted in para. 1.07, Koreans own fewer automobiles then citizens of other
countries despite a relatively high per capita income. For long distances of
300-400 km express trains are more comfortable, safer and faster than highway
buses, and also compete favorably with air travel, as the fare is half the
airfare and travel time comparable, taking into account transport
time between airports and city centers. In view of this, the development of
express train services to satisfy the rapidly increasing demand is justified
particularly since these are KNR's most profitable services. Operating ratios
for the special and limited express services were, respectively, 37% and 43%
in 1979. Traffic forecasts are given in Chapter 2.
Benefits and Economic Returns
4.03      The original KNR Investment Plan for 1977-81 was analyzed as a
whole during the appraisal of the Sixth Railway Project (Loan 1542-KO) in
1977-78. Investments starting in 1980 and 1981, which form the proposed
project, are analyzed below.
4.04      The economic evaluation focuses on project investments globally,
and on particular items whenever possible. Table 4.1 shows project
investments classified for the purpose of economic analysis. The larger
group, accounting for nearly half of all project costs, consists of
investments which are primarily geared to increase railway capacity
to carry types of traffic for which rail transport is the most economic.
The second group, amounting to 30% of project costs and also consisting of
capacity-increasing investments, is for suburban passenger services in the
Seoul Metropolitan Area. The remaining project items are way and structures
renewal (10%), and miscellaneous investments (13%).
Capacity Increasing Investments (Intercity Services)
4.05      These investments are fixed installations on the lines and
stations, and motive power and rolling stock. The latter, which can, of
course, be used more flexibly throughout the network has a lower risk factor
than line installations. Consequently, line capacity investments have been
very carefully analyzed on a line-by-line basis. Ways to increase estimated
existing capacity through improved operations has been reviewed. KNR



- 28 -
retained consultants (KDA Korea/Wilbur Smith Associates USA) for the
technical and economic feasibility analysis of major investments to be
included in the projects, the results of which have been used partially
for this report. As a result of discussions during project preparation
capacity-increasing investments were reduced by about US$160 million or
about 20% of KNR's original proposal.
4.06      Capacity in motive power and rolling stock has been analyzed on a
network-wide basis. Possibilities for increasing operating performance were
considered , such as increasing train-km for locomotives, lowering turnaround
times and increasing loadings and distances traveled for wagons. For rate of
return calculations, capacity-increasing investments have been allocated to
freight and passenger services. This was done directly for freight and
passenger cars, and for some fixed investments. For locomotives and joint
fixed investments on lines - such as crossing loops, bypass lines and
signalling - allocation was in proportion to the relative capacity provided
for each service (Table 4.2).
4.07      Freight.  The benefits of investments to increase the railway's
capacity to carry freight traffic are measured in terms of transport cost
savings for the overall economy, calculated as the difference between the
economic cost of rail transport and the economic cost of the next best
alternative mode. The major variables involved in the calculation of
benefits are: (a) the amount of traffic that would be diverted to other
modes based on the capacity of the railway with and without the project; and
(b) the economic costs of transport by various alternative modes (Table
4.3). Alternative modes could be road, or a combination of either rail or
road and coastal shipping. Rail traffic forecasts already reflect the share
of coastal shipping when the latter has a definite economic advantage. For
the remaining traffic, for which rail capacity is provided by the proposed
project, coastal shipping is no longer a valid alternative, as it would
involve long terminal transport at either end, requiring either rail
capacity or higher cost road transport. Consequently, in this analysis,
rail costs are compared to road costs, as the costs of using coastal
shipping as a partial alternative are even greater than the all-road
alternative. The economic benefits in terms of transport cost savings would
yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of 33% (Table 4.4). This is a
conservative estimate, since the amount of traffic that would divert to
other modes without the project has been assumed at only two thirds of the
traffic increase forecast between 1979 and 1982, with the remaining
one-third to be handled by improvement in use of existing facilities.
Assuming that only one-third of the traffic increase would divert to other
modes without the project would reduce the rate of return to an acceptable
17%.
4.08      Passengers.  The proposed capacity increases are for the better
quality special and limited express trains services. The economic cost of



- 29 -
these services are becoming lower than bus costs because fuel costs have
increased and rail services, when used to capacity as in Korea, consume
less fuel per passenger-km than buses. Fares are substantially higher for
special express (2.7 times) and for limited express (2.3 times) than either
rail costs or bus fares (Table 4.5). The fact that people are ready to pay
double the bus fare reflects the benefits they derive from express train
travel, e.g. comfort, speed, safety, etc. Consequently, the benefits of
increasing the capacity of the better passenger services are measured in
terms of willingness to pay for the services over and above their costs.
They are calculated as the difference between the cost of the services and
their revenues, and give a return of 17% on the investment (Table 4.6).
Seoul Suburban Services
4.09      Urban development in Seoul, (over 7 million inhabitants) has
spread beyond the city boundaries along the transport lines. The larger
cities on the rail lines such as Incheon (800,000), Anyang (135,000) and
Suweon (225,000) are growing rapidly and create, together with Seoul, an
interconnected urban system of some 9 million people. Until 1974, urban
transport consisted almost exclusively of buses and taxis. Because of the
configuration of the center of Seoul, which includes large blocks penetrated
by narrow streets suitable only for pedestrians and small delivery vehicles,
traffic congestion on the major arteries is acute despite the very low rate
of private car ownership.
4.10      In 1974, the first sections of a mass rail transit system were put
into service, consisting of a 9.5 km underground line (Seoul City Subway)
and 86 km of electrified existing KNR lines (Map 13135). The system (KNR
SMESRS and Seoul City Subway) met with immediate success and passenger
traffic, which was over 300 million in 1978, is increasing rapidly. Work
has started on a second subway line in Seoul and is about to start on the
proposed third and fourth lines.  Meanwhile, KNR is upgrading about 63 km of
existing lines with electrification and some double tracking to expand
suburban services. The densities of urbanization in Seoul, present a good
case for making the maximum use of existing rail infrastructure and
right-of-way. Costs of upgrading existing rail lines are small compared to
subway construction. However if maximum benefit is to be gained from the
investment, it is necessary to analyze in detail potential transport demand
in the corridors on which KNR proposes to expand service, to forecast
traffic in relation to other modes, ensure the optimum location of stations,
and establish priority and timing for construction of the various sections.
An urban transport study which was to address these issues was completed in
1979 by Korean consultants KIST. Unfortunately it did not fulfill
expectations; conclusions were limited to the city of Seoul and provided no
information on suburban services. The Bank is planning an urban sector
mission in 1980 to prepare future assistance to urban transport in Seoul
and other cities in Korea, and subsequent urban transport studies are
included in this project.



- 30 -
4.11      The project includes 130 electric rail cars to carry the expected
increase in traffic; and continuation of the quadrupling of the line from
Seoul to Suweon. This investment, started under the Sixth Project will enable
KNR to separate urban from long-distance traffic on the most heavily (in
number of trains/day) used section of the entire network. The population
served by the Seoul-Suweon line is over half a million now and expected to
about double by the early 1990s. The benefits of increasing service on
existing lines are in terms of transport costs savings from the alternative
mode, mostly buses, taxis and cars. The economic rate of return is conser-
vatively estimated at 19% assuming that without the project all trips would be
made by bus (Table 4.7). To carry the traffic that will be handled by the
railcars included in the project, would require about 600 new buses or about
10% of the existing bus fleet in Seoul. The benefits thus calculated do not
include the higher costs of some diverted trips which may be done by taxis or
private cars, nor savings in road passenger time which would be affected by
the increased congestion which extra buses would add to already congested
streets.
Way and Structures Renewals
4.12      The main items in this category are rail and track renewal,
including sleepers replacement and new ballast; the remainder of the cost
is for strengthening of bridges and tunnels. While it is a general practice
of railways to show way and structure renewal costs in their investment
programs, the nature of these costs is more periodic maintenance than
investment. Rail and sleepers have to be periodically replaced, and ballast
has to be added in order to keep the trains operating safely at normal
speeds.
4.13      KNR's network consists of 4,100 km of track.  Some 930 km or 23%
of the network have rails over 20 years old; another 880 km have rails
between 10 and 20 years old. A broad indication of rail renewal timing is
the number of gross tons which have passed over a given line section, but
conditions will vary widely according to topography, aligment, and train
types. Assuming, however, that the useful rail life is on average around
300 million gross tons, there would be some 1,000. km (24% of the network) of
rail with a life of between 10 and 20 years, and another 250 km with a 20-30
year life (based on 1976 traffic volumes). For the rest of the network,
rails would last up to 40 and 50 years. On the above assumptions, renewal
should average about 140-150 km/year, increasing over time, according to
traffic growth.
4.14      The rail and track renewal program agreed with KNR under the Sixth
Project for implementation during the FFYP would cover the recurrent need and
some of the urgently needed rail replacement in curves on the industrial
lines. If this program were not carried out, the quality of the track would
deteriorate, with the risk of increased accidents. Speed restrictions would
gradually reduce capacity, particularly on single track lines which account



- :1 -
for most of KNR's network. Rates of return for the program calculated in the
Sixth Project range from 20% to 32% with a weighted average of 27% (Annex 4,
reference C-4).
Miscellaneous
4.15      This category, comprising some 13% of the project cost, all in
local currency except for some technical assistance, includes numerous small
investments throughout the network. The largest amount, about one-fourth,
is for improving safety at rail and road crossings. This ranges from
simple signalling, to level crossing barriers and grade separation where
justified. The cost of these safety measures is shared equally between KNR
and the Ministry of Construction (MOC), who jointly select the locations of
these improvements according to established rules, based on respective
levels rail and road traffic. Other items include improvement of existing
workshops and sheds, relocation of lines to accommodate new industrial and
urban developments, and general improvements to right of way, buildings,
housing and training facilities, technical assistance and research.
Overall Economic Evaluation
4.16      The weighted average economic return on the capacity-increasing
investments and on way and structure renewals is 22%.
Sensitivity and Risks
4.17      The main area of risk for railway projects is traffic forecasting.
However, in Korea's rapidly growing economy even optimistic forecasts will
be achieved within one or two years, and full project benefits delayed
accordingly. For the purpose of sensitivity analysis, the ERRs of the
capacity-increasing investments have been recalculated assuming the low
estimate both for future freight and passenger traffic (Tables 2.5 to 2.9).
Estimated costs for Korea railway projects have typically been realistic, or
even on the high side, with funds remaining in previous loans after project
execution. For the sensitivity analysis, the ERRs of the capacity-increasing
investments have been recalculated with cost variations of + 10%. The results
of sensitivity analysis are given in the table below:

4.18      As expected, the impact of even substantially slower traffic growth
on the rate of return is not large, since benefits are only postponed.
Another risk which is impossible to quantify and time, is the effect of an
easing of Government's policy of restricting private car ownership. Passenger
traffic would certainly be negatively affected, however, the effect of
increased car ownership would spread over a period of years and may be
tempered by overall growth in transport demand. Since railway equipment has a
long life (assumed at 25 years for the ERR calculation), it is important to
closely monitor shifts in demand for rail services to avoid excess capacity.
5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
Background
5.01      Part B of the proposed Project deals with studies and technical
assistance initiated on behalf of the Government which will serve the relevant
portion of the proposed Loan. Its implementation has no immediate financial
impact. The following analysis consequently focusses on Part A of the
Project, implementation of which will substantially affect KNR's future
financial performance and situation.
5.02      KNR's financial objective is to generate operating revenues suffi-
cient to cover operating expenses, debt service, and a reasonable proportion
of the capital investments needed for fulfilling its role in Korea's trans-
portation system. KNR's acounts showed small annual profits through 1969;
however, these profits were overstated due to inadequate provision for main-
tenance expenditures and depreciation. Between 1970 and 1976 operating



- 33 -
revenues barely covered operating costs and KNR had to borrow for most of its
investment requirements, which increased its debt service burden and further
reduced available funds. The Government therefore had to provide KNR with
increasing annual cash subsidies to cover its debt service. As passenger and
freight traffic were heavy and KNR's unit costs low, the main reason for KNR's
inadequate financial performance during 1970-76 was the Government's
reluctance to permit necessary railway tariff increases.
5.03      The Sixth Railway Project aimed at assisting KNR to become
financially viable by 1981 without Government subsidies and at the same
time to implement an ambitious Won 197 billion (US$406.5 million) investment
program. The following analysis reviews KNR's progress since the start of
the Sixth Railway Project; determines a financing plan for the Seventh
Railway Project and establishes the conditions under which the project can
provide a rate of return sufficient to enable KNR to meet its financial goals.
5.04      The financial tables backing this analysis have been prepared in
current Won under inflation assumptions listed in paras 5.16 and 5.20,so
that KNR's liquidity position during implementation of both the proposed
project and the Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-1986) can be
realistically assessed. Tables showing breakdowns of operating revenues and
working expenses have been prepared for the years following 1979 both in
constant 1979 and current Won. All proposed targets are based on current
prices. The analysis considers the three following periods: 1977-79 (prior
to start of the proposed project), 1980-82 (project implementation) and
1983-86 (Fifth Five-Year Plan).

Operating Revenue and Overall Results
5.06      The table shows that 1MR operating revenues, which were insuffi-
cient to cover evern operating expenses in 1977, have increased steadily
and KNR would have been. able to finance about 90% of its interest charges
from its net operating revenue in 1979 if its passenger traffic had not
collapsed during the last quarter of that year as a result of the country's
political problems. This is mainly the result of two tariff increases
authorized by the Government in compliance with agreements reached during
negotiations of Loan 1542-KO. The first increase in June 1978, provided for
an average 19% increase in passenger rates and 15% in freight rates, and the
second, in May 1979, for 15% in passenger and 10% in freight rates. In
1979, freight traffic still operated at a net loss while passenger traffic
generated a net profit, almost making up for the deficit on freight traffic.
Operating Expenses
5.07       Total working costs (Table 5.3) increased by about 20% per year in
both 1977 and 1978,. compared with previous years. This annual increase
reached 29% in 1979 due mainly to increases of 59.2% in the cost of diesel
fuel and 37.7% in the cost of electricity, effective July 12, 1979. The
proportion of fuel costs to total costs increased from 13% in 1977 and 1978
to 16% in 1979, and is likely to continue growing. Staff salaries increased
on average by about 20% in 1978 and 31% in 1979, comprising respective
increases of 5 and 11% in real terms. This results in an increase in the
proportion of staff costs to total costs from 53% in 1977 to 56% in
1979. The latter proportion is still low compared with most railways in the
world and is an important factor in KNR's low operating costs. Depreciation
provisions represent about 2.3% of fiscal assets in use in 1979, which is an
acceptable proportion, given that it is based on revalued fixed assets.
Cash Flow
5.08      KNR's Cash Flow for 1977 through 1986 is given in table 5.5 and

KNR's financial situation improved steadily as shown by the improvement of the
debt service coverage ratio. However, due to the collapse of the profitable
passenger traffic during the last quarter of 1979, KNR was short about W 19
billion to finance its debt service requirements from its cash generation and
could not participate in the financing of its 1979 capital investments
(W 126.7 billion). As all capital investments in foreign currency were
financed from foreign loans (W 46.1 billion), KNR financed the rest of its
debt service and the local component of capital investments from government
subsidies (W 49.2 billion) and loans from the Korean Development Bank
(W 47.5 billion). To cover the remaining W 2.8 billion gap KNR was obliged to
practically exhaust its working capital.
5.09      KNR's balance sheets for 1977 through 1986, given in Table 5.6,
are summarized below:

Working Capital
5.10       Under Section 4.04 of Loan Agreement 1542-KO, KNR was to reach a
1:5 ratio of current assets to current liabilities in 1979. Table 5.03 shows
that KNR was far from meeting this target, and that its net working capital by
the end of 1979 was practically drained out. It was consequently agreed at
negotiations that the target date for reaching the above ratio would be set
to December 31, 1983. In order to closely monitor KNR's liquidity position
it was also agreed that KNR, assisted if necessary by the Government, should
take all action required to attain by that same date and maintain thereafter
(a) a cash balance of not less than 1/12 of labor costs of the previous twelve
months, (b) accounts receivable of not more than 1/6 of gross receipts from
freight transactions of the previous twelve months and (c) accounts payable
of no more than 1/6 of fuel, materials and other operating expenses of the
previous twelve months.
Fixed Assets
5.11       The valuation of KNR's fixed assets from 1978 through 1986 (Table
5.4) includes the effects of a global revaluation of fixed assets which KNR
carried out in 1976 and of annual revaluations thereafter. KNR has agreed
to continue revaluing its fixed assets on an annual basis in the future.
Other assets consist mainly of accumulated exchange fluctuations which have
been charged to the long-term debt account.



Long-term Debt
5.12      A close estimate of DIR's total debt outstanding at-the end of 1979
is summarized as follows:

Total             419.5          865.0
The 39/61 long-term debt to equity ratio by the end of 1979 (Table 5.8)
shows that KNR could substantially increase borrowing without endangering
its long-term financial position. Since implementation of the Fourth
Railway Project all Bank loan agreements included a debt limitation covenant
which requires Bank agreement before KNR incurs any new long-term debt if



- 40 -
its net cash revenues are less than 1.2 times its maximum debt service
requirement. KNR's previous cash revenues have not been sufficient to
achieve this ratio and the outstanding debt has continued to grow with a
consequent rise in debt service requirements. KNR's net cash revenues were
still insufficient to achieve the ratio in 1979, obliging KNR to increase its
borrowing from KDB to help finance its debt service (para. 5.07).  To ensure
that KNR's future liquidity position and debt service remains within an
acceptable level the investment limitation covenant (Section 3.12 of Loan
Agreement 1542-KO) should be re-affirmed at loan negotiations with a ceiling
of W 20 billion instead of W 10 billion. The debt limitation covenant should
also be re-affirmed. However, given KNR's easy present and anticipated long-
term financial situation and its management's prudent borrowing policy, the
1.2 ratio can be reduced to 1.1.
KNR's Overall Financial Situation Before Project Commencement
5.13      Based on KNR's financial results during the first eight months of
1979, the Project's appraisal mission had anticipated that KNR's financial
situation by the end of 1979 would show a marked improvement thanks to KNR's
high operational efficiency in carrying fast growing passenger and freight
traffic and to the implementation of relatively high tariff increases. The
mission's anticipations did not materialize because of the collapse of long
distance passenger traffic during the last part of the year and KNR's short
term financial situation before project commencement was precarious. Further
improvement in KNR's financial performance mainly through increased traffic
and higher tariffs is necessary to increase KNR's participation in the
financing of its investments and decrease its borrowing and dependence on
Government assistance.

Funds to be Generated by KNR
5.15      Given Korea's shortage of foreign currency it is assumed that the
Government will, as far as possible, borrow funds from abroad on KNR's
behalf for financing the foreign component of its capital investments, and
lend foreign currency to KNR if no foreign lender can be found. In
addition, the Government has already agreed to provide equity for financing
or partial financing of industrial and urban transportation related-
investments. KNR's funding needs will consequently be reduced accordingly.
Based on agreed traffic forecasts converted to revenues by applying December
31, 1979 tariffs, KNR's gross operating revenues would amount to Won 254.9
billion in 1980, 286.7 billion in 1981 and 321.5 billion in 1982. The
Government has agreed to increase these revenues through selective tariff
increases calculated to generate annual revenues 24% higher in 1980,/1
47% higher in 1981 and 57.5% higher in 1982 than those generated using
December 31, 1979 tariffs. The remaining financing gap would be covered by
additional borrowing from KDB, supplemented by Government subsidies when
necessary.
5.16      KIR's basic financial statements, based on the best estimate traffic
forecasts (paras. 2.19-2.27) and taking into consideration working and invest-
ment costs and debt service described in para. 5.14, and financing means
explained in para. 5.15, are summarized as follows:
/1 20% by January 1, 1980 and an additional 8% by July 1, 1980.

Inflation assumptions used for calculating project costs are explained in
para. 3.15.  Staff numbers were calculated under the asumption that staff
productivity expressed in number of traffic units per staff member will
improve by 5% in 1980 and 81, and 4% in 1982.  Salaries in real terms were
assumed to remain steady in 1980, increase by 2% in 1981 and 3% annually
thereafter. In addition, salaries were assumed to inflate by 20% in 1980,
17.5% in 1981 and 12% in 1982. In early 1980 the Government increased fuel
prices by 59.4% and electricity prices by 37.8%. In addition to these
substantial increases, fuel and electricity prices were assumed to increase
annually by 3% in real terms and inflate by 17.5% in 1981 and 12% in 1982.
Other material prices were inflated by 25% in 1980, 15% in 1981 and 10% in
1982. All these inflation rates were thoroughly discussed and agreed
with the Government.
5.17      Due to the unexpectedly steep increase in the cost of energy Korea
incurred in early 1980, its economy, and consequently KNR's profitable long
distance passenger traffic will not grow as fast as in past years in 1980.
The consequent shortage in operating revenue compounded with the adverse
effect on KNR's working expenses of the above-mentioned increase in the cost
of fuel and electricity explain why KNR's share in the financing of its
capital investments will be a low 1% in 1980.  As the country's economic
growth pace is anticipated to slightly improve in 1981 and to fully recover
in 1982, KNR's traffic will progressively recover and tariffs will be raised
enough to offset the high level of inflation anticipated during project imple-
mentation. Its share in the financing of investments will increse in parallel
with this recovery to 2% in 1981 and 4% in 1982. Achievement of these invest-
ment financing shares implies that KNR achieve rates of return on its net
fixed assets in use of not less than 3.2% in 1980 and 5.5% in each 1981 and
1982. These rates of return were discussed with KNR and the Government who
formally agreed on them at negotiations.
5.18      Implementation of the above projections would result in a gradual
improvement of KNR's short-term financial situation as reflected by the
current ratio which would improve from 1.0 in 1979 to 1.3 in 1982. Further
projections show that implementation of the project would result in a
substantial increase in KNR's fund generation which is anticipated to more
than triple between 1980 and 1986 from W 68 billion in 1980 to about W 220
billion in 1986 with the current ratio reaching 1.7%. Due to the need for
substantial local borrowing to finance the local component of the project,
the debt to equity ratio would deteriorate from 39/61 at the end of 1979 to
48/52 in 1982. The latter level is close to the ceiling of KNR's prudent
borrowing capacity. However, the following analysis demonstrates that KNR's
long term financial situation will reasonably improve as a result of
implementation of the project.
Forecast Financial Performance (1983-1986)
5.19      The following table summarizes KNR's income accounts (Table 5.1),
cash flow (Table 5.5), and balance sheets (Table 5.6) as anticipated during

The following assumptions were used for preparing the table:
Traffic: Achievement of best estimate alternative of traffic
forecasts (Tables 2.7 and 2.9)
Tariffs: Raised selectively as necessary to allow KNR to achieve
the annual rate of return on average net fixed assets in use of 6% agreed upon
at negotiations for 1983-1986. Under present traffic, operating costs and
investment assumptions, tariffs would need to be raised over the preceding
year by an average of about 8% in 1983, 4% in 1984 and 1985 and 6% in 1986.
Increases applied to each type of passenger train and freight commodities
would be calculated as to reach by December 31, 1984 the level required under
the revised tariff structure described in para. 2.34.
Working Costs: Staff: Staff productivity increased by 4% in 1983
and 1984, and 3% thereafter. Salaries increased by 3% every year for
increases in real terms and promotions and by 12% in 1983 and 7% in 1984
through 1986 for inflation.
Fuel: Prices increased in real terms by 3% in 1983 and 1984 and by
2.5% in 1985 and 1986 and for inflation by 12% in 1983 and 7% in 1981 through
1986.
Other Material and Other Expenses: Prices increased for inflation by
10% in 1983 and 9% in 1984 through 1986.
Capital Investments: As per KNR's tentative 1982-86 Investment Plan
(Reference C-5,Table 14). The plan is based on KNR's first draft of its
1982-86 Investment Plan prepared for insertion in the Government's Fifth
Five Year Plan. It was reviewed by the mission and is a first approximation
of minimal investments needed by KNR for carrying forecasted traffic. It
amounts to a total of W 1,093.4 billion of which W 239.1 in foreign currency.
Depreciation provision: As per Table 5.4 showing calculations of
annual values of depreciable assets and depreciation.
Debt Service (interest and repayment). As per Annex 4, reference
C-5, Table 16 under assumptions for financing the 1982-86 Investment Plan
shown in reference C-5, Table 14. The foreign component of the plan would
be financed entirely from foreign loans, 69% of the local component would
be financed from loans provided by the Korean Development Bank, and the rest
from KNR's own funds and/or Government subsidies as necessary.
Conclusion
5.20      In addition to providing an adequate rate of return on fixed assets,
implementation of the above scheme would result in a substantial improvement



- 47 -
in ONR's both short- and long-term financial position. The current assets
to current liabilities ratio would improve from 1.3 by the beginning of 1983
to a comfortable 1.7 by the end of 1986. During the same period, the cash
position would increase nearly six-fold from Won 21 billion in 1983 to Won 123
billion in 1986 while accounts receivable and payable would be in line with
the requirements explained in para. 5.10. Should this forecast fully
materialize, IKR could use excess cash to increase its share in the financing
of its capital investments beyond present projections and reduce borrowing
from the Korean Development Bank accordingly. The debt to equity ratio,
which reflects adequately KNR's long-term financial position would further
improve from the comfortable 45/55 level it is planned to reach by December
31, 1986. Implementation of the Seventh Railway Project is consequently fully
justified from the financial point of view.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.22      The objective of the sensitivity analysis of financial forecasts is
to test KNR's ability to meet its cash needs in case its operating revenues
would not attain anticipated levels and/or working expenses, or if the cost of
capital investments and the debt service would exceed forecasts used in the
main analysis. The sensitivity analysis will be limited to the years 1980 to
1983, during which time the Sixth Railway Project and the proposed project
would be completed.
5.23      The main analysis assumes that KNR will achieve the best estimate
alternative of the traffic forecasts shown in Tables 2.7 and 2.9. Although
these forecasts assume conservative growth rates for both passenger and
freight traffic, there is a risk that KNR may fail to meet this target, and
particularly if GNP does not grow as anticipated. There is also a risk that
tariff increases will not be implemented as anticipated due to social
considerations. Another possible hitch is that working costs would exceed
appraisal forecasts if the Government and KNR were obliged to grant substan-
tial real term or inflationary salary increases, or if the cost of imported or
domestically produced goods or services exceed appraisal estimates. A fourth
risk would be an increase in the cost of capital investments beyond present
estimates.
5.24      Taking into consideration that simultaneous or full occurence of the
above risks is possible, but unlikely, the sensitivity analysis was based on
the three following potential cases. (Detailed calculations are given in
Annex 4, reference C-5, Table 18)
Case 1: Simultaneous occurence over 1980-83 of: (a) a decrease in
operating revenues of 10% due to a possible reduction in traffic
combined with a 50% decrease in tariff increases; (b) a 50% increase
in inflation assumptions used for calculating working costs; and
(c) a 50% increase in price escalation assumptions for capital
investments.



- 48 -
Case 2: Simultaneous occurence over 1980-83 of: (a) a decrease in
operating revenues of 5% due to a possible reduction in traffic
combined with a 25% decrease in tariff increases; and (b) a 25%
increase in inflation assumptions used for calculating working
costs.
Case 3. Decrease in operating revenues of 10% over 1980-83 due to a
reduction in traffic.
5.25      Table 5.9 shows how full materialization of each of the three sen-
sitivity cases over 1980-83 would affect KNR's annual net operating revenue,
net income, variation in working capital and balance sheet. Rates of return
on net fixed assets in use would be negative under Cases 1 and 2 and be about
one-third of forecasts should Case 3 materialize. The balance sheet and
significant ratios as of December 31, 1983 would be as follows:

- 49 -
5.26      In the unlikely event that Case 1 would fully materialize, KNR's
situation would become untenable as it would be short of about W 850 billion,
cumulated over 1980-83, to cover its cash needs, and the debt to equity ratio
would reach an alarming 79/21 level which would preclude any additional
borrowing. The Government would consequently have to provide KNR with the
needed equity to keep its railway in operation. Materialization of Cases 2 or
3 would raise far less problems and KNR should be able to overcome them by
additional borrowing. The following table summarizes KNR's balance sheet and
significant ratios as of December 31, 1983 under sensitivity Cases 2 and 3,
assuming that KNR borrows funds necessary to make up for its shortage of funds
and restore its working capital to the minimum level required for continuing
its operations. It is further assumed that these funds would be borrowed from
the Korean Development Bank at an interest rate of 7.5% with repayment over 20
years, including five years grace. The amounts assumed to be borrowed are W
400 billion under Case 2 and W 170 billion under Case 3.

The table shows that KNR's financial situation would be at the lowest accept-
able border-line should sensitivity assumptions 2 or 3 materialize. However,
this would be enough to allow KNR to take full advantage of the physical
investments and the organizational improvements provided for under the Seventh
Railway Project.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations satisfactory assurances were obtained from
the Government on the following principal points:
(a) The training of staff to improve the Government's capability
in transport planning and coordination (para. 1.17);
(b) a date at which KNR will become a Public Corporation and
a time phased plan for implementing short and mid-term measures
that will enable this transformation (para. 2.04);
(c) a time phased plan to achieve cost based tariffs (para. 2.34);
(d) the execution of transport sector and urban transport studies
(para. 3.19)
(e) a definition of KNR's desirable net working capital and a
target date by which FqR should reach it (para. 5.10); and
(f) the rate of return objectives to be achieved by KNR during the
project period (para. 5.17).
6.02      With above assurances and agreements, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$94 million for a period of 17 years including
4 years of grace to the Government of Korea, for onlending to the KNR.

KOREAN NATIONAL RAILROAD
ASSISTANCE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE STUDY ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE KOREAN
NATIONAL RAILROAD CARRIED OUT BY OVERSEAS BECHTEL
INCORPORATED/SAMIL ACCOUNTING CORPORATION
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS
I. Background
1.        The Korean National Railroad (KNR) is a semi-autonomous government
agency in charge of handling railway services in Korea under the control of
the Ministry of Transportation (MOT). Its management structure follows that
of the Korean government agencies with the administration having full
responsibility of the operations of KNR but only limited authority over KNR's
organization, personnel administration and financial matters.  KNR's
management personnel are government officials and personnel policies are in
accordance with the Korean civil service system.
2.        KNR's management is generally satisfactory, as reflected by KNR's
high operating efficiency. However, some improvement in KNR's organization is
desirable to rationalize managerial functions and responsibilities and rein-
force its capability for financial, economic and investment planning. Aware
of these weaknesses the Government decided to carry out a comprehensive
management study under a contract between KNR and Overseas Bechtel Incor-
porated (Bechtel) in association with the Samil Accounting Corporation dated
January 26, 1979. Bechtel's final report was issued on November 12, 1979.
Its main conclusion is that KNR should be gradually transformed from its
present status to that of public corporation granted with the necessary
independence and managerial and financial freedom to fully play its role as an
efficient and competitive carrier. This transformation would be prepared by a
set of short and mid-term measures aimed at ensuring KNR's smooth transition
to a public corporation. To implement certain of the short- and mid-term
measures KNR will need the assistance of consultants and/or technical assis-
tants. The objective of the present terms of reference is to define the
assistance to be given to KNR for implementing agreed short-term measures.
The relevant contract will be financed from a loan granted by the World Bank
(the Bank).
II. Objectives of the Short-Term Program
3.        The objectives of the short-term program are to:
(a) improve KNR's management decision making process;

(c) improve KNR's competitive position against other modes of trans-
portation;
(d) increase KNR's profitability;
(e) develop managerial and technical skills within KNR required, in
the long term, to manage and operate KNR as a public corporation.
These objectives are intended to provide KNR with the management and
organization base from which it can effectively develop the long range
management and organization needed to operate successfully as a public
corporation.

/a The difference between the total road investment given here (W 391 bil-
lion) and that in Table 1.3 (W 458 billion) is made up by the costs of
maintenance and studies which are included in the plan document, but not
above.
/b The large increase in local government investments in roads are mostly
the fact of the two special cities Seoul and Busan which invested W 54
billion in 1977 and W 84 billion in 1978 (in 1975 prices). In 1978
this was almost twice as much as total central government investment in
roads.

Rate of Return is 33%
/a Includes investment in lines, motive power and rolling stock, new repair
facilities, telecommunications and power (see detailed allocation in
Table 4.2).
/b This is taken conservatively as two thirds of the freight traffic in-
crease from 1979 to 1982. The remaining traffic increase is assuned to be
handled by improvement in use of existing facilities. Assuming that
only one third of the freight traffic increase would divert to other
modes without the project would reduce the rate of return to an accep-
table 17%.
/c Difference between transport cost by rail and the least costly alterna-
tive. This is generally road transport since coastal shipping is only
competitive for traffic with origins and destinations at or near ports
and this has already been taken into account when forecasting railway
traffic. An average of W 20 per ton-km is assumed as the cost differ-
ence (see Table 4.3). This assumes a terminal cost for rail operations
of W 1,200 per ton, and a road cost which is a weighted average of heavy
truck costs on paved and gravel roads (3/4 paved and 1/4 gravel).

/a Includes investment for the entire quadrupling of the Seoul-Suweon line
started under the sixth project and to be completed under this project, and
130 electric railcars to be acquired in 1980 and 1981.
/b Traffic forecasts (Table 2.10) are greater than the capacity provided by
the added railcars implying a general increase in utilization of the entire
fleet. The figures above reflect the share of total traffic that will be
handled by the new cars assuming uniform utilization for all cars in the
fleet.
/c Difference between cost by rail and cost by bus. This is conservative as,
without the project, some trips may divert to taxis and cars at higher
costs. Costs of urban buses in Seoul are estimated at some W 10/passenger-
km while costs of SMERS for 1979 were W 4/passenger-km.
