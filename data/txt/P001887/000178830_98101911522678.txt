APPRAISAL OF TIIE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
SUMMARY
i.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established by the Gov-
ernment in 1964 to finance industrial, agricultural, and tourism development
projects. DBM was reorganized with the help of the Bank Group in 1970/1971.
Since then it has received two credits and two loans from the Bank Group, three
of which (amounting altogether to US$16 million) for financing industrial and
tourism projects, and one (US$4 million) for the development of an industrial
estate at Coromandel, Port-Louis. This report appraises DBM for a further
loan of US$7.5 million for industrial, agro-industrial and tourism projects
financing.
ii.       After a period of stagnation between 1964 and 1969, economic activ-
ity in Mauritius expanded rapidly in recent years with GDP growing at an aver-
age rate of about 7% p.a. in constant terms between 1969 (average for 1968-70)
and 1974 but declined in 1975 due to cyclone damage. This high rate of growth
is linked to the sugar sector in the following way: average export prices for
sugar rose by 18% in 1972, 15% in 1973, 164% in 1974 and 30% in 1975, thus
having a major impact on the country's income and foreign exchange earnings.
It appears that a large part of this increase in income was used to finance
investments which soared from 14% of GDP in 1970 to 25% in 1973-75. In 1976,
the sugar boom came to a halt and the price of sugar Mauritius received
was 45 percent lower than that of 1975. Prices, however, have since stabilized.
For the foreseeable future, the Mauritian economy will continue to depend on
sugar and the prospects for the sugar industry are good.
iii.      Whereas most industrial development in the 1960's took place in
import-substitution activities, mostly food and beverages, chemicals (paints,
plastics), metal and woodworking, and construction materials, the orientation
of industrial investments changed rapidly in the early 1970's and especially
since 1973 toward export products, mainly textiles and assembly of electrical
and electronic components. Gross value added in manufacturing (excluding
sugar cane milling) grew at a rate of 17% p.a. between 1970 and 1975, to a
level of Rs 265 million in the latter year. The value of industrial exports
increased from Rs 11 million in 1972 to Rs 164 million in 1974. Mauritius
success in setting up export industries can be attributed to (a) the package
of fiscal incentives granted under the Export Processing Zone Act promulgated
in 1970; (b) the preferential access to the EEC market granted under the
Yaounde and Lome Conventions; (c) the development of Mauritius entrepreneurial
class; (d) the close cultural and economic ties between Mauritius and India,
Pakistan and Hong-Kong.
iv.       In spite of this rapid rate of growth in recent years, there has
been some concern over the immediate economic situation of the country.



v
This is particularly true with regard to a weakening Government budgetary
situation due to the slow down in the growth of government revenue caused by
the drop in sugar prices, and increases in recurrent expenditure. On the
other hand, the inflationary pressure which had plagued the economy in the
early seventies has more or less been stemmed._ The Government took a number
of measures in 1974 and 1975 to correct these trends. First, following an
increase in money supply of more than 50% in 1974, the Government imposed a
ceiling of 15% on credit expansion to the private sector in 1975. Secondly, a
decision was made to raise the minimum cash balances which commercial banks
are required to maintain from 8% to 12% of total deposits. Thirdly, the
Central Bank decided to apply a two-tier structure of interest rates in
respect of its advances to commercial banks. Under this arrangement, commer-
cial banks are permitted to borrow at the prevailing bank rate (7%) up to the
limit specified in each individual case, but are charged a rate of interest of
12% for any amount borrowed in excess of the specified limits. Also, the
rediscounting facility in respect of sugar bills by the Central Bank was
withdrawn. As a result of these measures, and lower world inflation, price
increases in 1975 have remained below 15% as compared to 29% in 1974. In 1976
the rate of inflation was less than 10%.
v.        The Government's basic development objective, as set out in the
1975-80 Development Plan, remains basically the same as that retained under
the previous plan, i.e. the achievement of full employment by 1980. This is
expected to help reduce the relatively wide income disparities between the
various segments of the population, which is another major objective of the
present plan. The employment policies initiated under the previous Plan
have already met with some success. The number of unemployed, which was
estimated at 16% of the labor force in 1970, decreased to an estimated 8%
by 1975.
vi.       The FY 76-80 Plan forecasts a growth rate in GDP of 6.5% p.a. in
real terms. It is somewhat ambitious in view of some of the physical
constraints to growth such as an insufficient transport infrastructure and
public transport services, and shortages in trained manpower, water and
electricity supply as well as possible financial constraints. We believe
that growth in real terms of 5% p.a. is feasible.
vii.      Regarding the industrial sector, the factors which have explained
the rapid growth in this sector in the early seventies will continue to
sustain growth in this sector in the future. However, two of the major
advantages offered by Mauritius to investors (preferential access to the EEC
and very advantageous provisions for investors under the investment code)
are now being offered by the Maghreb 1/ countries which are likely to present
a challenge to Mauritius exports. Nevertheless, besides these fiscal and
market advantages, Mauritius retains substantial unique characteristics which
make it attractive to local and foreign investors, among which a well function-
ing administration, low labor cost, and, last but not least, a cosmopolitan
character which should continue to be attractive to foreign investors.
1/   Maghreb countries:  Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia.

viii.     In the past few years, DBM has been the major institutional source
of term finance for industrial and tourism development in Mauritius. From
Rs 19 million in FY 73, approvals (of loan and equity investments) in these
sectors reached Rs 53 million in FY 76, for a total of Rs 135 million for the
period FY 73-76. DBM has also been in charge of the financing of industrial
estate development which for the period FY 73-76 amounted to a total of Rs 71
million. DBM's activities in the other sectors of the economy have remained
limited in amount but have had an important impact on the development of
artisanat and small-scale agriculture. During FY 73-76, 634 loans were
made to the agricultural sector for a total of Rs 7.6 million while the
artisanae sector received 1134 loans for an amount of Rs 7.7 million.
ix.       DBM's present Managing Director, an expatriate on secondment
from the World Bank, took up his duties on a two-year contract in May 1975.
Under his leadership, the impact of DBM on term financing operations has
been greatly enhanced. DBM's volume of business has significantly increased
as has its internal operating efficiency. A vigorous training policy has
been pursued and has resulted in DBM having a qualified and competent Mauri-
tian management team. At the request of the Government, the present Managing
Director has agreed to the extension of his contract to May 1978 which will
allow additional time for the training of a Mauritian to succeed him.
x.        DBM's net income in FY76 at Rs 3.6 million more than trebled from
FY75 level of Rs 1.05 million due mainly to increased earnings from a rapidly
expanding loan portfolio whilst administrative costs were being contained; net
income in FY76 amounted to 9.8% of average net worth. DBM has made significant
progress over the last two years in reducing the size of the arrears affected
portfolio from 18% in June 1974 to less than 3% as of December 1976. Provi-
sions totalled Rs 2.7 million as of June 30, 1976 or 2.2% of the loan and
equity portfolio outstanding which is adequate considering the low level of
arrears and good recovery prospects. In FY76 the term debt/equity ratio
increased from 0.9 to 1.7 which is well below the term debt/equity limit of
4.1 specified in the last Bank loan agreement. Thus DBM as of December 1976
represents a financially sound and creditworthy institution.
xi.       For the future DBM intends temporarily expanding its sectors of
operation, with a two-year agro-industrial lending program to the sugar
estate sector (para 5.02). With significant growth forecast for lending to
the traditional industry and tourism sectors and an increased on lending rate
as of March 1977 of 10.5% (previously 10%) to these sectors, DBM's net profit
is forecast to increase to 13% as a percent of net worth by FY80. DBM has
therefore a strong earnings potential.
xii.      DBM is a well-managed, creditworthy institution, having an impor-
tant impact on the development of Mauritius. Continued Bank Group assistance
to help meet its financing requirements is warranted. DBM's commitments
for the period December 31, 1976 to June 30, 1979 are estimated to reach
Rs 309 million (US$46 million). The financing of medium and large-scale
industrial and tourism operations will remain DBM's main activity accounting
for an estimated 62% of DBM's total gross requirements during the period
mentioned above, with agro-industry 13% and financial sector 12%.



vii
xiii.     The local cost component estimated at Rs 133 million (US$19.7 mil-
lion) or 43% of DBM's total gross requirements is expected to be financed
by (a) DBM's cash generation (Rs 50 million); and (b) Government existing
or expected loans (Rs 83 million). The foreign exchange component is esti-
mated at Rs 176 million (US$26.1 million) or 57% of DBM's gross requirements.
The financing of this component is expected to be covered in the following
way:
(a)  uncommitted funds from African Development Bank (ADB)
loan 75/002, IDA Credit 411-MAS and IBRD loan 1168-MAS of
about Rs. 39 million equivalent (US$5.8 million);
(b)  line of credit from Industrial Development Bank of India
(IDBI) of about Rs. 38 million equivalent (US$5.7 million);
(c)  line of credit from Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) of about Rs. 17 million equivalent
(US$2.5 million);
(d)  line of credit from European Investment Bank (EIB) of about
Rs. 23 million equivalent (US$3.4 million);
(e)  the proposed IBRD loan of about Rs. 50 million equivalent
(US$7.5 million);
(f)  additional funds from either Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) and/or African Development Bank (ADB) with whom
discussions are taking place.
xiv.      The proposed IBRD loan would finance the foreign exchange compo-
nent of DBM's investments in industry agro-industry and tourism, including
small-scale enterprises. Projects needing finance below this limit are
considered as belonging to the artisan category qualifying for a 4-1/2%
interest rate charge and are financed from Government loans to DBM. The loan
will be made to DBM with the guarantee of the Government of Mauritius at the
standard IBRD interest rate. The foreign exchange risk will be passed on by
DBM to the subborrowers. The amortization of the loan would be the aggregate
of the amortization schedules of subprojects, with a maximum maturity of 15
years for industrial and tourism subprojects including appropriate grace
periods depending on the nature of the sub-projects. The free limit should be
raised to US$600,000 with an aggregate free limit of US$2 million.



APPRAISAL OF THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established by the Gov-
ernment in 1964 primarily to finance industrial and tourism development. In
1970/71, at the request of the Government, the Bank Group assisted in reor-
ganizing DBM. Since then, DBM has received a US$3.5 million IDA Credit in
June 1972 (project 313-MAS) and two Bank loans of US$5 million and US$7.5
million (Projects 979-MAS and 1168-MAS) in April 1974 and October 1975 re-
spectively; the principal objectives of IDA and the Bank in this lending
were:
(i)  to provide a source of medium and long term foreign
exchange finance to meet DBM resource needs, in the
financing of medium and large scale industrial and
tourism projects which were economically and finan-
cially attractive;
(ii)  to assist DBM in its development as an effective and
efficient development finance institution;
(iii)  to provide a basis for discussion with Government on
industrial, economic and financial policies having an
impact on industrial and tourism development.
1.02      These objectives have been largely fulfilled.  The Bank has been
the major source of term foreign exchange finance for DBM until recently
when, at the Bank's request, DBM has successfully sought to diversify its
sources of such finance (para. 5.13). Economically and financially attrac-
tive projects have been financed (para. 4.04 and Annex 9). A vigorous
staff training policy has been pursued particularly recently and sixteen
staff have now attended overseas training courses including six who have
attended EDI courses. Considerable progress has been made in the quality
of appraisal and supervision work and the operational performance of DBM
particularly over the last 18 months has been very good (para. 4.14).
Through the appraisal and supervision missions, the Bank has been able
to maintain a dialogue with Government on policies affecting industrial
development.
1.03      A second IDA Credit of US$4 million (Project 411-MAS) was approved
for DBM in June, 1973 to finance the development of an industrial estate at
Coromandel. The construction of this estate as of December 1976 was ahead
of schedule (para. 4.07).
1.04      As DBM's present resources are expected to be fully committed
by the middle of 1977, the Government has applied for further assistance
from various financing organizations including the World Bank Group. This



-2-
Report appraises DBM for a fourth loan of US$7.5 million. The main objectives
of the proposed loan would be a continuation of the objectives outlined
above in previous lending to DBM for medium and large scale industrial and
tourism projects; additional assistance would be given for agro-industrial
projects in the sugar estate sector.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
The Economy
2.01      After a period of stagnation between 1964 and 1969, economic activ-
ity in Mauritius expanded rapidly in recent years with GDP growing at an aver-
age rate of about 7% p.a. in real terms between 1969 (average for 1968-1970)
and 1974 but declined in 1975 due to cyclone damage. This high rate of growth
is linked to the sugar sector in the following way: average export prices for
sugar rose by 18% in 1972, 15% in 1973, 164% in 1974, and 30% in 1975, thus
having a major impact on the country's income and foreign exchange earnings.
It appears that a large part of this increase in income was used to finance
investments which soared from 14% of GDP in 1970 to 25% in 1973-1975. As a
result, the other sectors of the economy achieved a high rate of growth as
well. Thus, value added in manufacturing increased at more than 17% p.a.
in constant terms between 1970 and 1975; tourism grew at about 30% p.a.,
which, although starting from a small base, is quite remarkable. In 1975,
in spite of continued rapid growth in most sectors, GDP in constant prices
declined as a result of cyclones which destroyed 35% of the anticipated
sugar harvest. Moreover, the sugar boom came to a halt in 1976, the price of
Mauritian sugar in the European Common market declined by 45% and the terms of
trade fell by 25%. Sugar prices have since stabilized. For the foreseeable
future, the economy will depend primarily on sugar, and the prospects for this
industry are generally good.
2.02      The sugar industry accounted on the average for about 40% of GDP
over the past ten years. Services (including Government) represent at pres-
ent about 33% of GDP, while the remainder is accounted for by industry (i.e.,
manufacturing 8%, construction 6%, and public utilities 3%) and agriculture,
other than sugar production (10%).
2.03      In spite of this rapid rate of growth in recent years, there has
been some concern over the immediate economic situation of the country, par-
ticularly with regard to a weakening Government budgetary position, caused by
recent increased government recurrent expenditure and reduction in revenue due
to lower tax receipts from sugar. With respect to inflation, the Government
took a number of measures in 1974 and 1975 and it has more or less been
brought under control. First, following an increase in money supply of more
than 50% in 1974, the Government imposed a ceiling of 15% on credit expansion
to the private sector in 1975. However, in line with its policy of promoting
industrial development, the Government has exempted industries operating in



-3-
the Export Processing Zone or holding a Development Certificate 1/ from the
credit ceiling. The impact of this measure was intended to bear mainly on
consumer goods, semi-luxuries, and luxuries. Secondly, a decision was made to
raise the minimum cash balances which commercial banks are required to main-
tain from 8% to 12% of total deposits. Thirdly, the Central Bank decided to
apply a two-tier structure ofi interest rates in respect of its advances to
commercial banks. Under this arrangement, commercial banks are permitted to
borrow at the prevailing bank rate (7%) up to the limit specified in each
individual case, but are charged a rate of interest of 12% for any amount
borrowed in excess of the specified limits. Also, the rediscounting facility
in respect of sugar bills by the Central Bank was withdrawn. As a result of
these measures, and lower world inflation, price increases in 1975 have
remained below 15% as compared to 29% in 1974. In 1976 the rate of inflation
was below 10%.
2.04      The high price for sugar exports led to a considerable surplus in
the current account of the balance of payments in 1974, in spite of a 83%
increase in imports. In 1975, cyclone damage to sugar crops reduced export
earnings somewhat but reserves continued to increase as a result of (a) the
restrictive measures taken towards imports and (b) the insurance compensa-
tion payments made to Mauritius. At the end of 1975, net foreign exchange
reserves amounted to US$166 million, equivalent to about five months' imports
but declined in 1976 to about US$95 million (3 months' imports).
2.05      The Government's basic development objective as set out in the
1975-80 Development Plan, remains essentially the same as that under the
previous plan, i.e. the achievement of full employment by 1980. This is
expected to help reduce the relatively wide income disparities between
the various segments of the population, which is another major objective of
the present Plan. Policies initiated under the previous Plan have already
met with some success. The number of unemployed in 1972 was estimated at
41,000 equal to 16% of the labor force. By 1975 the unemployment rate was
estimated at about 8%, affecting largely the population between 15 and 25
years of age. In the latter age group, unemployment is estimated at 20% of
the labor force. Therefore, in spite of the success of the employment
creating policies, the unemployment problem persists.
2.06      The FY76-FY80 Plan forecasts a growth rate in GDP of 6.5% p.a.
in real terms.  It is somewhat ambitious in view of some of the physical
constraints to growth such as an insufficient transport infrastructure and
public transport services and shortages in trained manpower, water and
electricity supply as well as possible financial constraints.  We believe that
a growth rate in real terms of 5% p.a. is feasible.
1/   Development Certificates are granted to import-substitution industries
and entitles them to special concessions, protective duties and/or
quotas under the investment code.



-4-
The Manufacturing Sector
2.07      Sugar cane milling accounts for about half of value added in manu-
facturing or 8% of GDP. The discussion below refers only to the non-sugar
industries which accounted in 1975 for about 9% of GDP, 16% of exports and
provided employment to 37,000 workers (14% of the labor force).
2.08      Whereas most industrial development in the 1960's took place in
import-substitution activities, mostly food and beverages, chemicals (paints,
plastics), metal and woodworking, and construction materials, the orientation
of industrial investments changed rapidly in the early 1970's and especially
since 1973 toward export products, mainly textiles and assembly of electrical
and electronic components. Gross value added in manufacturing (excluding
sugar cane milling) grew at a rate of 17% p.a. between 1970 and 1975, to a
level of Rs 265 million in the latter year.
2.09      The value of industrial exports increased from Rs 11 million in
1972 to Rs 164 million in 1974. Of course, the net foreign exchange gain
from these developments is only part of this increase as the export indus-
tries largely depend on the transformation of imported raw materials and in-
termediate products.
2.10      Establishments employing 10 or more workers are responsible for
over 90% of value added in the sector and 50% of total employment. Little
information is available on the small-scale industry and artisanal sector.
However, there -s evidence that this sector has been playing a much more
dynamic role in recent years. Whereas this sector absorbed only Rs 0.5 mil-
lion in term finance from DBM in 1972 corresponding to 84 loans, it received
more than Rs 3 million in FY 76 for 467 loans. Information on value added
and employment by manufacturing subsectors is presented on the following page
in Table 1.
The Government Industrial Policies
2.11      The Government's role in the industrialization process has been
a two-fold one. First, it has attempted to create the necessary climate in
which private investors can be attracted and can flourish, by providing gen-
erous incentives and assistance in the start-up and operation of enterprises.
Second, it has tried to ensure a degree of equity in the whole process by
imposing domestic price and wage guidelines, so that the benefits of growth
are more widely distributed among the population.
2.12      The package of incentives granted by the Government to investors
in Mauritius is one of the more attractive in the world and includes the
granting of Development Certificates and Export Processing Zone Certifi-
cates (paras 2.13 and 2.14 and Annex 2). The Government has also set up
industrial estates with all the necessary infrastructure, generally divided
into plots with standard factory buildings. Investors are thus saved some
of the initial capital, time and effort needed to secure authorization from
a variety of authorities for land and utilities. Two major schemes near Port
Louis, at Plaine Lauzun and Coromandel, have been completed and partly
occupied, while plans are afoot to develop some land at Beau Vallon.

2.13      The Development Certificate Scheme.  Between 1964 and 1970, the Gov-
ernment's main means of stimulating industrial development consisted in the
granting "Development Certificates" to those entrepreneurs who seemed best
able to carry out projects in a selected group of import-substitution indus-
tries considered to be of importance to the island's economy. Development
Certificates entitle companies to many benefits, the most important of which
are import duty exemption or rebates on materials and equipment, a five-to-
eight year income tax holiday, exemption from income tax on dividends, profit
repatriation facility, etc.
2.14      The Export Processing Zone Scheme.  With opportunities for import-
substitution more or less exhausted in the 1960's, a worldwide study of in-
dustry by a Government-financed team of specialists led to the idea of offer-
ing an attractive package of incentives to overseas manufacturing firms.
Under the Export Processing Zone Act of December 1970, an enterprise setting
up a factory to sell its entire output outside Mauritius is granted a ten-
to-twenty year company tax holiday on retained earnings, tax free dividends
in the first five years, and duty-free imports of machinery and raw materials.



- 6 -
Other benefits offered include: free repatriation of profits, liberal work
permits for specialist expatriate staff and export financing at preferential
rates. Priority is given to industries which are highly labor-intensive or
create substantial indirect employment opportunities, and which introduce new
technology and marketing know-how.
2.15      Textiles and garments, electronic components, footwear and toys have
been the most important industries established. The predominance of textiles
and electronic components follow the pattern of industrialization in other
countries, such as Hong-Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, which have
offered similar export processing incentives.
2.16      Besides the EPZ scheme, Mauritius' success in setting up export in-
dustries can be attributed to the following factors:
(a) In 1970, Mauritius became an Associated Member of the
EEC, thus joining the 18 African countries already
associated through the Yaounde Convention, according
to which exports from the Associated Countries were
granted preferential access to the EEC market. This
preferential treatment was expanded under the 1975
Lome Convention between the EEC and the ACP 1/ coun-
tries which grants free access to the EEC market for
manufactured goods of ACP origin. The conditions to
be met to qualify as "originating" product vary from
product to product. In many cases, the value added
in the ACP countries has to represent at least 50%
of the value of the finished product.
(b) Mauritius was in a better position to take advan-
tage of the agreement with the EEC than most other
ACP countries given the development of its entre-
preneurial class, a low wage level coupled with a
comparatively easily trainable labor force, and
little administrative red tape.
(c) These factors attracted a number of foreign entre-
preneurs from many countries including India, Pakistan
and Hong Kong, with which Mauritius has cultural ties.
2.17      These advantages largely offset the fact that wages in Mauritius
are estimated by Indian entrepreneurs established in Mauritius to be about
15% higher than in India and Pakistan (while the productivity of labor is
estimated to be comparable in the three countries) and that construction
costs may be 30% higher. According to Hong-Kong industrialists established
in Mauritius, labor productivity in Mauritius may in certain instances be
25 to 30% lower than in Hong-Kong. However, as wages are only about one-
third of Hong-Kong wages, Mauritius remains very competitive.
1/   ACP Countries:  African, Caribbean and Pacific countries associated with
the EEC.



- 7 -
2.18      Besides the factors affecting future economic growth in Mauritius
(para. 2.06), the main disadvantage affecting the manufacturing sector is
its distance from the main export markets. This is reflected in the cost
of airfreight between Paris and Mauritius which is about four times that
between Paris and Tunis. Shipments by sea to Europe take on average about
two months as compared to a few days to cross the Mediterranean. Moreover,
the frequency of ship calls decreased with the reopening of the Suez Canal,
as ships which used to sail around Africa now use the Suez Canal again.
2.19      The Government intends to continue its policy of active support
to the industrial sector through the granting of EPZ and Development Certi-
ficates with the particular fiscal advantages attached to them. Government
considers that the award of these fiscal advantages to stimulate industrial
investment has been generally beneficial to Mauritius; however, in the
FY76-80 plan Government proposes to undertake a review of some import-sub-
stitution industries to ensure the rates of protection offered are not too
advantageous to the companies.
Prospects in the Manufacturing Sector
2.20      In the short run, a number of factors may negatively affect indus-
trial growth in Mauritius. In the first place, the general level of profit-
ability of manufacturing enterprises in Mauritius, particularly in the
textile sector, has declined in 1975, as a result of the world recession
and a marked increase in wages. This may temporarily slow down industrial
investments. In addition, in the short term some investors may adopt a
wait-and-see attitude following the recent elections. Mauritius has some
limitation on water supplies available for industrial purposes at present.
This water limitation may affect the pattern of industrial development in
the next year or two, although the development of the Beau Vallon indus-
trial estate (where water availability is ensured) has been given prior-
ity.
2.21      In the long run, the factors which have explained the rapid growth
in the industrial sector in the early seventies will continue to sustain
growth in this sector in the future. However, two of the major advantages
offered by Mauritius to investors are now being offered by some other coun-
tries as well.
2.22      The first is Mauritius' free access to the EEC.  Although this
preferential treatment was also given to 45 other ACP countries associated
with the EEC, competition from these countries was not very strong. However,
in January 1976, the Maghreb countries 1/ signed a trade agreement with the
EEC. These countries will benefit from the same preferential treatment as
Mauritius for most of their industrial exports. These countries are likely
to present a greater challenge to Mauritius industrial exports than the ACP
countries did in the past.
1/   Maghreb countries:  Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia.



- 8 -
2.23      Second, the substantial advantages granted to investors by the
Mauritius Investment Code are now being offered by more and more countries
(Tunisia, Morocco, UAR). Mauritius will also have to face the competition
from more and more free trade zones (FTZ). Whereas in 1970 competition in
this respect was mainly from Taiwan and Hong-Kong, there are now FTZ's in
Tunisia, Morocco, UAR, etc. Mauritius will therefore suffer from greater
competition in the future than it has in the past, particularly from Morocco
and Tunisia which will be able to offer many of the advantages of Mauritius,
without having the handicap of Mauritius' high transportation costs.
2.24      Nevertheless, besides these fiscal and market advantages, Mauritius
retains substantial unique characteristics which make it attractive to local
and foreign investors, among which a well functioning administration, low
labor cost and, last but not least, a cosmopolitan character which should
continue to be attractive to foreign investors, particularly from India,
Pakistan, and Hong-Kong with which Mauritius has strong cultural ties. In
spite of some short-term cLnstraints (para. 2.20), growth in the non-sugar
manufacturing sector could .ach 7-8% in the coming years.
The Tourism Sector
2.25      Past Developments.  In spite of its rapid rate of growth in the
past few years, tourism still represents a very small fraction of GDP. The
number of tourists increased from 15,000 in 1968 to 95,000 in 1976 represent-
ing an annual rate of growth of 30%. Despite the adverse international eco-
nomic situation in 1975 and a cyclone which interrupted tourism to Mauritius
in early 1975, total tourist arrivals during 1975 have been about equal to
arrivals in 1974. Tourists visiting Mauritius come from Reunion (accounting
for 30% of tourist arrivals in 1975), South Africa (20%), France (10%) and
other European countries (15%). By the end of 1976, there were 10 first-
class hotels in Mauritius with a total of 2,280 beds.
2.26      Prospects.  The rate of growth of tourism in Mauritius is likely
to slow down for the following reasons: First, the Government would like
to see the number of tourists increase at a more moderate rate. Although
the Government does not yet have a formal tourism policy, Government offi-
cials emphasize the strain that hotel construction places on the construc-
tion industry and public utilities. Also, the investment cost per job is
high for hotels and tourism provides little opportunity to upgrade labor
skills. Secondly, growth in the traditional markets for Mauritian tourism
is bound to decline. Reunion, which is Mauritius' major market, has little
growth potential. The future of tourism from South Africa, the second largest
market, is uncertain.
2.27      Most projections of tourism assume that tourist arrivals will
increase at about 9% per annum until 1980, which appears reasonable.

The Sugar Estate Sector
2.28      About 86,500 acres are under sugar cane cultivation, of which about
56% are cultivated by sugar estates having processing and refining facilities
attached to them; some 31,000 small independent growers cultivate the re-
mainder. Total cane production amounts to about 5.9 million metric tons and
actual sugar production to about 696,000 metric tons. A target of 800,000
metric tons has been forecast for 1980, and to achieve this, the industry will
have to invest in additional milling capacity. There are 21 mills in Mauri-
tius, 20 privately owned and one Government owned, having a total capacity of
700,000 tons.
Financial Sector
2.29      Despite its relatively small size, Mauritius has a wide range
of financial intermediaries. The banking system consists of the Bank of
Mauritius (Central Bank), nine commercial banks, the Cooperative Central
Bank, the Post Office Savings Bank and the Development Bank of Mauritius.
There are also a number of insurance companies, a housing corporation which
offers mortgage finance and raises funds from both the public and private
sectors, investment trusts, pension funds and the Sugar Insurance Fund which
charges premia on all sugar production and pays benefits in years of poor
harvests. Because of the predominant position of the sugar sector in the
Mauritian economy, the sugar insurance and pension funds are larger than all
other intermediaries except the commercial banks. The nine commercial banks
are as follows: Barclays Bank International, Mauritius Commercial Bank,
Habib Bank (Overseas), Bank of Baroda (which operates a mobile unit), Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, State Commercial Bank, First National
City Bank, Banque Nationale pour le Commerce et l'Industrie, and Mercantile
Bank. The Mauritius Commercial Bank accounts for about half of the commer-
cial banking sector, financing 60% of all sugar financing in Mauritius, fol-
lowed by Barclays Bank International and Mercantile Bank. These three banks
account for the predominant share of the banking services offered in Mauritius
in particular to the sugar and industrial sectors, mainly due to historic rela-
tionships built up with the Mauritian private sector.
2.30      The banks operate an interbank market with the Bank of Baroda and
the State Commercial Bank, the normal surplus lenders and Mauritius Commer-
cial Bank, Barclays Bank International, Mercantile Bank, First National
City Bank and the Development Bank of Mauritius, the borrowers. The main
Mauritian sources of funds for term financing of the industrial sector are
the Development Bank of Mauritius, the Finance Corporation 1/ of the Mauritius
Commercial Bank, the Sugar Pension Fund, insurance companies and direct financ-
ing by the private sugar companies.
2.31      Because the sugar sector is so dominant in the Mauritian economy,
the liquidity of the banking system has been largely dependent on the success/

(MCB) and Lloyds Bank whose resources are, besides its share capital
deposits of one year and above placed with the Mauritius Commercial
Bank.

failure of the sugar crop. Over the last two years the revenues from the
sugar crop have been good and the banks have therefore been liquid and able
to meet the working capital/short-term financing needs of the seasonal sugar
crop and the growing level of demand from the industrial sector. The profit-
ability in the sugar sector has also enabled the sugar companies to finance
their own term needs and have term resources available for term investments
in the industrial sector. However, due to falling sugar prices and increased
operating costs, the profitability of the sugar sector in 1977 is expected
to fall. This is expected to result in the Mauritian private sector having
reduced resources for term investments in both the sugar and industrial
sectors as well as illiquidity in the commercial banking system at times of
seasonal peak demand for sugar crop financing. To resolve this liquidity
problem, the Central Bank may offer additional rediscount facilities to
priority sectors. Increased demands on DBM for equity and term loan financing
are expected for the industrial and sugar estate sectors (see para. 5.05).
2.32       In order to help mobilize private savings and provide a channel
for the investment of such funds in commercial and industrial concerns, the
Government is forming a Commercial and Investment Trust. The Trust will have
a share capital of Rs 5 million financed equally by the Government, the
Central Bank, DBM and the State Commercial Bank and "units" of Rs 10 each will
be sold to the public. In its initial stages DBM will advise the Board of
Trustees on investments.
2.33       In March 1977, the Central Bank which sets ceiling rates for
deposits and advances for all banks, announced an overall increase in the
Mauritian interest rate structure (Annex 1); this was the first general upward
raise in the interest rate structure and the first major change in rates since
1974. Over the last two years, in view of inflation rates and savings levels,
the Bank had been indicating to the Government that a review and upward
adjustment of the interest rate structure would be timely. The maximum on-
lending rate for commercial banks has been raised 1% to 10% and with only 1/4%
increase in deposit rates, the increased spread will allow commercial banks to
accommodate rising internal operating costs. As the rates remain fixed
however, competition between banks will continue to be in terms of banking
services offered.
2.34       Following the increase in the on-lending rates for commercial
banks, DBM increased its term lending rates for the industrial and tourism
sectors (excluding SSI) from 10% to 10.5% and for the agro-industrial sector
from 7% to 10.5%.  Thus DBM charges 10.5% plus 1% commitment fee for term
lending as opposed to a maximum 10% for lending by commercial banks. In
addition DBM passes any foreign exchange risk to its sub-borrowers. The
inflation rate which was about 12% in late 1976 is expected to be reduced to
7-8% from 1977. With an on-lending rate of 10.5% this would imply for DBM, a
real positive interest rate of 2-1/2% - 3-1/2%.  DBM maintains a continuous
review of its interest rates in relation to economic conditions, DBM profit-
ability and the prevailing interest rate structure in Mauritius and will
continue to initiate adjustment to its onlending rates, as appropriate,
through the DBM Board.

III. THE COMPANY
Ownership Board and Policy
3.01      DBM is a public institution, owned by the Government (91% of the
share capital) and the Bank of Mauritius (9%). The Board consists of twelve
directors: four are Government representatives, six are from the private
sector, one from the Bank of Mauritius and the Managing Director. A list
of directors is shown in Annex 3. During 1976 Messrs. Manna and Mohith
from the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce and Industry respec-
tively became full Board members (they were alternates) replacing existing
members from the same Ministries. The Board is both experienced and capable,
and offers a broad mix of investment interests. Annex 4 is a general state-
ment of DBM policy.
Management
3.02      The present Managing Director, an expatriate on secondment from the
World Bank, took up his duties on a two-year contract in May 1975. His
performance has been impressive; under his leadership the impact of DBM in the
financing of industrial and tourism investment in Mauritius has been greatly
enhanced. DBM's volume of business has significantly increased as has its
internal operating efficiency. A vigorous training policy has been pursued
and has resulted in DBM having a qualified and competent Mauritian management
team. During 1976, a Mauritian staff member, was promoted to the position of
Assistant Managing Director.
3.03      At the request of the Mauritian Government, the present Managing
Director has agreed to the extension of his contract for a further year. This
will allow additional time for the training of a Mauritian to succeed him,
as Managing Director of DBM, on completion of his new contract in May 1978.
Organization and Staff
3.04      DBM's organization chart is shown in Annex 5.  As of March, 1977,
DBM had 26 professionals out of a total staff of 73. The staff is adequate
in number, educational background and experience to cope with the present
workload, apart from the Industrial Estate Division (see para. 3.06). With
regard to training, sixteen members of the DBM staff have attended overseas
training courses including six people who have attended EDI courses in
Washington. Other staff members have been encouraged to pursue further
professional qualifications in Mauritius in law, accounting, banking and
secretarial studies.
3.05      DBM has four operational lending divisions (i.e. Industrial, Indus-
trial Estate, Small Enterprise and Agricultural), plus an Administrative Divi-
sion which includes the legal and accounting functions. Five professional
staff members work on medium/large-scale industrial and tourism loans, five



- 12 -
on agricultural loans, four on industrial estates and one on small-scale in-
dustrial projects. There are twelve clerks who act as regional representa-
tives of DBM for the agricultural and small-scale industrial lending divi-
sions, one of whom is based on the Island of Rodrigue.
3.06      During 1976 the professional staff of the Industrial Estates Divi-
sion was expanded by the recruitment of two additional engineers; this staff
is considered adequate to handle the planning, construction and operational
management of DBM's Industrial Estate Program. However, with the full 628,000
sq. ft. of factory space due to be completed at the Coromandel Industrial
Estate as of June 1977, there is a need for further promotional effort to be
undertaken to attract additional overseas clients (see para. 5.02(ii)(a)). To
assist in this promotional work DBM is seeking an industrial estate promotion
and commercial management advisor for a one-year assignment; a Mauritian
commercial manager will be appointed as a counterpart to the foreign advisor.
Procedures
3.07      Project Appraisal.  The appraisal of projects is undertaken in-
dividually by the investment officers and is then reviewed by the assistant
Managing Director and then by the Managing Director before presentation to
the Board. All agricultural loans and industrial loans above Rs 10,000
(about US$1,500) are presented to the Board for approval. The quality of
appraisal work is good and the staff are now familiar with the calculation
of internal economic rates of return. More recently, DBM has had a greater
impact on the projects it has financed through changes in project design as
well as reduction of technical and financial management fees being charged.
3.08      Project Supervision.  Considerable progress has been made by DBM
in the efficiency of its supervision operations as evidenced by the decline
in portfolio affected by arrears (see para. 4.11). Clients in arrears are
reviewed monthly and regular meetings and discussions with the client are
undertaken to assist in resolving client operating problems and the recovery
of arrears.
3.09      Accounting.  DBM has a capable firm of auditors in Kemp Chatteris
(which is associated with Touche Ross & Co.) and the quality of the annual
reports has been good.  The accounts section within DBM is efficient and
responsive in providing information to the operating divisions.
3.10      Legal.  Since the recruitment of a part-time attorney and the train-
ing of the legal staff, the preparation of legal documents has been speeded
up considerably and now takes approximately two weeks in contrast to the sev-
eral months taken previously.
3.11      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement and disbursement on
DBM's loans are generally satisfactory. DBM requests its clients to seek
alternative quotations for both equipment and construction contracts. Assis-
tance is given to the artisans receiving DBM loans to help prevent them from
being overcharged by local dealers and suppliers of equipment. The introduc-
tion by DBM of a commitment charge which now begins accruing three months



- 13 -
after Board approval of a project, has reduced the delays on disbursement.
Disbursements are usually made through letters of credit (for import financing)
or after receiving evidence of completion of work on construction contracts.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
4.01      DBM has been the major institutional source of term finance for
industrial and tourism development in Mauritius. As of December 31, 1976
either through direct financial assistance or through the industrial estate
program, DBM has assisted 51% of the companies receiving Development Cer-
tificates or Export Processing Zone Certificates (see Annex 6). Many of the
projects have been jointly financed by DBM in conjunction with the commer-
cial banks as well as with IFC, and relations between DBM and the Mauritian
financial community are excellent.
4.02      The evolution of DBM's operations is shown in Annex 7.  Since the
last appraisal report dated October 8, 1975 there has been a major expansion
in the volume of operations by DBM. Total approvals in FY76 rose by 25% to
Rs 62 million from Rs 49 million in FY75. This growth in FY76 was a reflec-
tion of a boom in industrial investment in Mauritius. Commitments also
increased rapidly in FY76 at Rs 65 million from Rs 41 million in FY75.
Disbursements in FY76 rose to Rs 85 million from Rs 33 million in FY75; this
was in part due to DBM introducing a commitment charge on all projects six
(in 1977, three) months after DBM Board approval of the project. DBM does not
have liquidity problems as resources can be either borrowed from the interbank
market or alternatively direct from Government. The increased level of
disbursements was also a result of DBM improving the efficiency of its internal
loan processing/disbursement procedures. However, for FY77 there has been
some slowing in industrial investment due to uncertainties relating to the
December 1976 general elections in Mauritius, resulting in total approvals to
December 31, 1976 amounting to Rs 27 million.
4.03      Medium- and Large-Scale Industry and Tourism.  In value terms, this
sector has shown the biggest growth in FY75 - FY76 with loan approvals rising
from Rs 36 million to Rs 52 million. Approvals during the first six months
of FY77 at Rs 21 million were a little lower than the FY76 rate but investment
demand is expected to increase again during the latter part of the fiscal year
following the elections. In FY76 four equity investments were made in this
sector for Rs 1.2 million total and one further equity investment for Rs 3.7
million has been made since then. Disbursements in this sector rose from Rs
15 million in FY75 to Rs 59 million in FY76 as disbursements were made on a
backlog of projects.
4.04      In FY76 the average size loan approved by DBM was Rs 1.6 million
(US$240,000). Total project costs have ranged in size from Rs 155,000 for
a printing works to Rs 60 million for an acrylic yarn factory. The distribu-
tion of the industrial loan portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 1976
(Annex 8) indicates a continuing heavy concentration in the textile export



- 14 -
sector (46%) although in FY76 attempts were made to reduce the level of new
investment in this sector. The risk of DBM due to its exposure in textiles is
mitigated by the diversity of products produced in Mauritius (i.e. jute bags,
carpet backing, yarn, knitwear, ready-made garments, etc.) and by the geographic
dispersion of the markets. Hotel investments acccount for a further 23% of
the portfolio and other sectors include food processing (4%), fishing and fish
processing (2%) and agribusiness (2%), i.e. subsectors which are primarily
serving the domestic markets. Annex 9 indicates that the 58 industrial
projects financed by DBM between July 1, 1974 and December 31, 1976 created
5,227 new jobs on projects having economic rates of return ranging from 10% to
42%. The average investment cost per job created in this medium- and large-
scale industrial sector amounts to approximately US$10,000. Because the Bank
Group has, through three previous loans, contributed a significant porportion
of DBM's financing for projects in this sector, the characteristics of Bank-
financed projects are not essentially dissimilar to those identified above.
4.05      Artisan Financing.  This program being undertaken by DBM is probably
the most advanced and successful artisan financing operation yet undertaken
by an African development finance company. Its objective is primarily to
create employment through the development of the entrepreneurial skills of the
small businessman. DBM provides medium-term finance to the artisans in
amounts up to Rs 15,000 (about US$2,300) at Government-set interest rate of
4-1/2% for the purchase of equipment. 1/ For amounts above Rs 15,000 DBM
charges its full 10.5% interest rate. 2/ The Government provides DBM with
local currency funds for both industrial and agricultural artisan financing at
4-1/2% (there is no direct foreign currency element involved). Working
capital is made available to the artisans by the Government-owned State
Commercial Bank (at 10% interest rate 3/) with which DBM has a very close
working relationship. The Government covers the operating costs incurred by
DBM on such lending and is also prepared to cover actual losses on loans. The
operational costs recovered by DBM from the government in FY75 and FY76
amounted to Rs 525,000 and Rs 625,000 respectively.
4.06      At present DBM staff appraise and supervise the artisan lending
operations but do not provide technical assistance to the artisans; however,
most artisans are already conversant with elementary business management
techniques. The DBM appraisal procedures have been streamlined such that DBM
is now in a position to approve or turn down a prospective borrower, one week
after the initial application. Since the 1975 appraisal, DBM has signifi-
cantly expanded its lending operations to the artisanal sector; in FY76 467
loans were approved for Rs 3.15 million and Rs 2.76 million were disbursed.
During the first half of FY77, a further 179 loans for Rs 1.28 million had
been approved and Rs 1.20 million disbursed. As shown in Annex 10 there have
been four major subsectors for artisan financing, i.e. mixed farming, gar-
ments, light engineering and furniture manufacture. DBM considers metal
working, construction and road work clients as attractive subsectors for
1/ 2/ 3/ Prior to M1arch 1977, these interest rates were 2.5%, 10 and
9% respectively.



- 15 -
further investment. No overall figures for employment generation have been
collated for this sector financing but the average cost per job created
amounts to Rs 6-7,000. The repayment record in the artisan sector has been
remarkably good and as of December 31, 1976 only 41 loans totalling Rs 193,000
were in arrears from a portfolio of 1038 loans totalling Rs 6.0 million. The
arrears affected portfolio amounted to only 3.2% of the portfolio outstanding
and actual amounts in arrears to only 0.7%, due to the close contact retained
by DBM staff with client artisans.
4.07      Industrial Estates.  At the request of the Government DBM has
been undertaking a program of construction of industrial estates. As of
December 31, 1976 the value of the industrial estates developed and managed
by DBM amounted to Rs 62.5 million and included an estate at Plaine Lauzun
which is fully occupied and operational and one at Coromandel which is not
yet completed and only partially leased. A further industrial estate at Beau
Vallon is shortly to be implemented and further industrial estates are in the
planning stage. DBM is currently in charge of the estate/EPZ development
program and coordinates development with Government through an Industrial
Estate Advisory Committee composed of DBM, relevant ministries and various
parastatal bodies.
4.08      The construction of the industrial estate at Coromandel (financed
by IDA) is proceeding ahead of schedule and is now expected to be completed
in June 1977. As of May 1977, 463,000 sq. ft. of the total 627,000 sq.
ft. had been completed; 173,000 sq. ft. had been occupied, 54,000 sq. ft.
leased another 70,000 sq. ft. are under negotiation. To assist in the leasing
of the estate which is a little behind schedule, it is proposed to recruit an
expatriate adviser on industrial estate commercial management and promotion
who will operate with a Mauritian counterpart.
4.09      Agriculture.  During FY76, DBM instituted a scheme whereby the
Mauritius Cooperative Central Bank which has very limited term funds, could
refinance its medium- and long-term lending to cooperatives through DBM. The
Cooperative Central Bank would refinance at 7.25% at DBM and onlend the funds
to the cooperatives at 8.5%. DBM received funds from the Government at 2-1/2%
for agriculture. There was also a small increase in DBM's agricultural
lending to small sugar, tea, mixed farming and livestock projects in FY 76 at
Rs 2.55 million from Rs 1.03 million in FY 75.
Portfolio Evaluation
4.10      Loan Portfolio.  An analysis of loans in arrears over three months
as of December 31, 1976 is included in Annex 11. DBM has made significant
progress over the last two years in the reduction of arrears. As of June 30,
1974, 18% of a loan portfolio of Rs 42.9 million was affected by arrears of
over three months and this has been reduced to only 2.9% of a loan portfolio
of Rs 135 million as of December 31, 1976. The actual amount in arrears over
three months as of December 31, 1976 was only Rs 1.2 million or 0.9% of the
loan portfolio outstanding.



- 16 -
4.11      DBM is only at risk on its lending operations in the medium- and
large-scale industrial and tourism sector and the agricultural sector; loans
to tea planters and to the artisanal sector are under Government guarantee.
Thus the arrrears affected portfolio for which DBM is at risk, amounts to 2.1%
of the portfolio outstanding at December 31, 1976 and actual arrears over
three months amount to Rs 0.77 million or 0.6% of the portfolio outstanding.
Prospects for the recovery of the majority of the medium- and large-scale
industry and tourism projects in arrears which account for 50% of total
arrears are good. The low level of arrears reflects the diligence with which
DBM has pursued defaulting clients, the assistance DBM staff has provided to
its clients in resolving operational problems, and also the fact that many
projects are still under construction.
4.12      Within the loan portfolio, as of December 31, 1976, only 7 loans out
of a total of 195 outstanding were in arrears in the industrial and tourism
sectors, 41 out of 1038 in small-scale industry, 32 out of 422 in agriculture
and 4 out of 4 in the tea planting projects.
4.13      Equity Investments.  As of December 31, 1976, DBM had made equity
investments in 16 companies amounting to Rs 13 million (Annex 12). The
portfolio includes a diverse subsectoral mix including hotel, textile, bank-
ing, cement, bagasse board, fertilizer, distillery and industrial farming
projects. DBM's participation ranges from 6% to 42% of the equity, but
in the majority of projects is between 10% - 15%. DBM would normally only
take up more than 25% of the equity as a temporary measure to promote a
project and would seek to reduce to holding below 25% as soon as possible.
In FY76 five of the projects were operating profitably (four paid dividends
during the year), three were approaching breakeven positions, seven were in
the construction or start-up stage and one project, Universal Board Company,
manufacturer of bagasse board, had stopped operation. This company which
began operations in 1971, will be liquidated in FY77 if it cannot secure large
guaranteed orders from the Government. DBM's investment in this company is
Government guaranteed.
Profitability
4.14      Summarized financial statements of DBM for fiscal years 1972 - 1976
appear as Annexes 13 and 14. Financial ratios are given in Annex 23. DBM's
net income in FY 76 at Rs 3.58 million more than trebled from the FY 75 level
of Rs 1.05 million.  A number of factors contributed to this increase.   The
industrial loan portfolio outstanding increased from Rs 39.8 million to Rs
97.1 million as DBM rapidly increased the rate of disbursement on approved
loans. The spread earned on the loan portfolios increased from 2.7% to 4%
as the average interest rate increased from 8.0% to 9.7% due to all new in-
dustrial lending being at 10% whilst the average cost of debt rose only from
5.3% to 5.7%. Rent from the industrial estates increased from Rs 1.6 million
to Rs 2.1 million, and interest on short-term investments rose from Rs 1.37
million to Rs 1.93 million. Whilst DBM was thus drastically increasing its
level of operations, internal salary and administrative costs were being con-
tained at FY 75 levels with the result that these expenses as a percentage of



- 17 -
average total assets fell from 1.6% to 1.1%. The net profit as a percentage
of average total assets rose from 0.9% in FY 75 to 2.0% in FY 76 whilst the
profit as a percentage of average net worth rose from 3.5% to an attractive
9.8%. FY 76 was a year of very good financial performance which is being
maintained in FY77 with half year earnings to December 31, 1976 at Rs 3
million.
4.15      Annex 15 shows a breakdown by sector of DBM's FY 76 earnings.
Industrial investment operations generated 72% of the FY 76 total earnings.
Revenues generated by the agricultural operations during the year were only
sufficient to just cover the operating costs. For the small-scale industry
operations, funds were on-lent by DBM at cost, i.e. 2-1/2% interest rate from
the Government (4-1/2% as of March, 1977), and DBM reclaims administrative
overheads and loan losses from the Government. Thus no earnings are shown for
the small-scale industry operations; however, DBM claimed administrative costs
from the Government of Rs 625,000 for the year to June 30, 1976. The indus-
trial estate operations generated net earnings of Rs 986,000 or 27.5% of total
earnings.
Financial Condition
4.16      DBM's financial condition is satisfactory.  Provisions totalled
Rs 2.7 million as of June 30, 1976, which represents 2.2% of the loan and
equity portfolio outstanding. This would appear adequate given the low level
of portfolio affected by arrears above three mon_hs (para. 4.11), and that
much of the portfolio outstanding has only been recently disbursed on new
projects. The term debt/equity ratio (excluding sinking fund from debt)
rose from 2.0 to 3.2 when all subordinated Government loans are consid-
ered as term debt, and rose from 0.9 to 1.7, when the portion of Government
subordinated loans maturing after the repayment of the Bank loans is treated
as equity; this is well below the term/debt equity limit of DBM of 4:1 spec-
ified in the last Loan Agreement with the Bank. (Annex 16 shows DBM borrow-
ings.)
V. PROSPECTS
DBM's Strategy
5.01      The overall development objectives defined by the Government in the
Five Year Plan (FY76-FY80) and sumiaarized in paras. 2.05 and 2.06, require in-
dustry to generate 47,000 new jobs in the Plan period. This is an ambitious
objective and will require inter alia, a major promotional effort both in
Mauritius and abroad to attract industrial investors, investment incentives,
availability of suitable industrial sites and sources of finance in Mauritius.
5.02      In attempting to achieve the Plan's objective, DBM will clearly have
an important role to play. DBM will continue to be the major Mauritian
financial institution providing tetm finance for investment projects which
have been well conceived on economic financial and technical grounds. DBM's
strategy will include the following:



- 18 -
(i) Sectoral Strategy
(a) Medium and Large Scale Industry and Tourism: DBM will
seek to diversify its portfolio to reduce the present
concentration in the textile and hotel sub-sectors. New
project proposals in these sub-sectors will be closely
scrutinised to ensure that they can be fully justified on
financial and economic grounds.
(b) Small Scale Industry. DBM will continue its policy of
providing liberal financial facilities to small scale
industries. As a number of traditional occupations like
tailoring, poultry farming, furniture making and fishing
have been assisted, DBM will now seek to assist non-
traditional occupations such as serigraphy, pin manufacture
salt refining and food processing.
(c) Industrial Estate Development. DBM will continue to plan
the development of the industrial estate program in coordi-
nation with Government through the Industrial Estate
Advisory Committee. Particular attention will be paid to the
further development of the La Tour Urban Housing/ Industrial
Estate project. The project site is adjacent to Fort Louis
covering 220 acres owned by DBM; 130 acres are presently
designated for housing, 70 acres for industrial estate ware-
housing facilities and 20 acres for green areas.
(d) Agricultural Sector (excluding Sugar Sector). DBM will
continue to make loans for land development and occasionally
for agricultural equipment purchase as well as providing
refinancing facilities for the Mauritius Cooperative Central
Bank for its term lending to cooperatives. Lending in this
sector which amounted to 7% of total FY76 approvals, will
not be expanded significantly but DBM will finance attractive
investment opportunities as they arise.
(e) Agro-Industrial Sector. Government and DBM Board in early
1977 gave approval for DBM to begin providing term financial
assistance to the large sugar estates for sugar processing
operations. As noted in para. 2.30 the large sugar estate
sector currently requires term financial assistance. DBM
proposes to assist sugar companies in acquiring equipment
for replacement/extension/modification of processing
facilities as well as some agricultural machinery such Ps
loaders, harvesters and transporters. Each project will
have to meet DBMs standard criteria for assistance with
regard to quantum of financing, promoters contribution,
rates of return etc. Particular attention will be paid
to the impact on employment and only those projects which



- 19 -
result in a perceptible increase in productivity will be
assisted. Assistance to this sector is considered to be
of a temporary nature i.e. 1 - 2 year program. (Conditions
for use of Bank funds for loans to this sector are detailed
in para. 5.13 Proposed Terms of Bank Loan).
(f) Financial Sector. DBM will act as intermediary to other
Mauritian financial institutions for the IDBI loan which
will be used to finance purchases of Indian equipment for
Mauritian transport sector (para. 5.11(b)).
(ii) Promotion
(a) The EDF has allocated about Rs 5.5 million to the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry to finance an overseas program to
promote industrial investment in Mauritius. DBM will collobo-
rate with the Ministry in drawing up such a program. However,
for DBM the focus of its industrial promotion activities will
be in Mauritius and will involve trying to meet the requirements
of industrialists responding to the Ministry's overseas pro-
motion program. DBM may assist in undertaking feasibility
studies, finding co-financiers and identifying plant facilities
possibly on industrial estates. DBM will continue to influence
the design of projects to better suit the Mauritian environment
both through direction negotiation with investors and and
through active participation in the Industrial Development
Committee. 1/
(b) DBM in collaboration with the State Commercial Bank and
Bank of Mauritius has actively promoted the formation of
the Commercial and Investment Trust. DBM is carrying
out studies on the finances of other joint stock companies
to facilitate the work of the Trust and will advise the
Trustees on suitable investment opportunities for the
Trust.
(iii) Organization and Procedures
(a) DBM will continue to encourage its staff to undergo
training to further upgrade their skills.
(b) As regards procedures, DBM will seek to reduce the time
taken to prepare project appraisals without affecting the
quality of the appraisals which are good.
1/   Composed of representatives of the Ministries of Planning, Finance,
Industry and Public Works and the Development Bank. The Committee
determines what benefits can be granted to specific projects under the
Investment Code provisions.



- 20 -
(c) DBM will place additional emphasis on supervision work
and will increase the frequency of plant visits in relation
to difficulties being encountered on the project, require
more detailed information in supervision reports from
clients and also intensify loan collection procedures to
further reduce the arrears. DBM staff will also increasingly
take up positions on boards of client companies.
Projected Operations
5.03      DBM's industrial and tourism sector project pipeline as of
March 30, 1977 (Annex 17) includes 21 projects with a total project cost
amounting to Rs 323 million, of which an estimated Rs 89 million will be
requested from DBM. About half of these projects by number, amounting to a
total investment cost of Rs 40 million, are import-substitution projects
mainly in the food and beverage, construction and assembly sectors. The other
projects, including most oi the large-scale projects, will be serving the
export market. Based on the project pipeline, it appears that textile export
projects will continue to represent a significant proportion of DBM's indus-
trial and tourism approvals, as was the case in the past, for two reasons:
(i) this is the sector where Mauritius has its largest comparative advantage,
given the low cost and capability of its labor force; (ii) textile projects in
the pipeline are complementary with the projects already existing in Mauritius,
i.e. they represent a step towards the integration of the textile sector in
the country. The other important projects are planned to take place in
the tourism and sugar by-products sectors.
5.04      Although a significant proportion of DBM's portfolio is in textiles,
DBM has sought and will continue to seek to reduce the risk by investing
in: (a) various subsectors which are sufficiently diverse (i.e. grey cloth,
men s clothing, jute, women's knitwear, and their various subdivisions) that
it is unlikely all enterprises would be adversely affected at the same time;
(b) projects which are generally well integrated in the operations of inter-
national organizations and have geographically dispersed markets.
5.05      With regard to investments in the sugar estate sector, total require-
ments for the two year program are estimated at approximately Rs 135 million.
DBM may possibly lend up to Rs 60 million of which about Rs 35 million would
be in foreign exchange. In the transportation sector, DBM will on-lend to
other Mauritian financial institutions the Rs 38 million line of credit made
available by IDBI (see para 5.11) to finance the supply of Indian manufactured
equipment.
5.06      DBM's projected operations for FY77-81 and the main assumptions on
which they are based, are shown in Annexes 18 and 19. In spite of a temporary
slow down in industrial investment prior to the December elections, total
approvals for FY77 are expected to reach Rs 76 million which is about 20%
above FY76 levels. In FY78 and FY79 total approvals would increase to Rs
147 million and Rs 158 million respectively reflecting the additional appro-
vals in the agro-industrial and financial sectors of about Rs 55 million in



-21 -
each year. Medium and large scale industry approvals increase from FY78
through FY81 at a rate of 15% per annum in current terms (7% in constant
terms).
5.07      The other sectors are expected to remain a small part of DBM's
activities by value. Approvals for equity participations are forecast at
Rs 2.5 million per annum to FY81. Approvals in the small-scale industry
sector are expected to increase by about Rs 0.5 million per annum to reach
Rs 5.5 million in FY81. In absolute amounts, DBM's activity in this sector
is expected to make a substantial contribution to reducing the level of
unemployment and improving the standard of living of the poorer section of the
population.  Agricultural approvals are forecast at Rs 4.8 million in FY77 and
will increase by about Rs 0.3 million per annum thereafter, with similar
economic effects as the loans to the SSE sector. With the completion of the
Coromandel industrial estate, approvals in this sector are expected to drop to
about Rs 2.0 million per annum from FY78 until the planned industrial estate
at Beau Vallon is undertak, i.
Resource Requirements and Financing
5.08      DBM's commitments for the period January 1, 1977 to June 30, 1979
are estimated to reach Rs 309 million (US$46 million). This estimate assumes
that 45% of industrial loans are committed in the year of approval and 45% in
the following year, allowing for 10% cancellations. Agricultural loans, equity
investments and industrial estates approvals are assumed to be committed in
the year of approval, in line with DBM's experience (Annex 18).
5.09      Total resource requirements and their financing for the period
April 1, 1977 to June 30, 1979 are summarized on page 23.
5.10      The financing of medium- and large-scale industrial and tourism
operations will remain DBM's main activity accounting for an estimated 62%
of DBM's total gross requirements during the period under consideration.
The remaining 38% are split between agro-industrial (13%), financial sector
(12%), agricultural loans (5%), small-scale industrial operations (3%),
industrial estates (3%) and equity participations (2%).
5.11      The overall foreign exchange component is estimated at Rs 176
million (about US$26 million) or 57% of DBM's gross requirements. The
financing of this component will be met by:
(a)  Uncommitted funds under ADB loan 75/002, IDA credit 411-MAS
and IBRD loan 1168-MAS amounting to about Rs 39 million
equivalent (US$5.8 million).
(b)  A line of credit from IDBI for Rs 38 million equivalent
(US$5.6 million) at an interest rate of 8.5% (no commitment
fee) for a term of about eight years. DBM will act as inter-
mediary to on-lend these funds to other Mauritian financial
institutions lending to the transport sector. The credit is



- 22 -
tied to Indian procurement and is guaranteed by the Mauritian
Government. DBM will on-lend the funds to other Mauritian
financial institutions with a 0.5% spread for reviewing projects
and will pass on the exchange risk.
(c) A line of credit from CCCE for about Rs 17 million equivalent
(US$2.5 million) at an interest rate of 6% (no commitment fee)
with four years' grace and no fixed term. The credit is tied
to French procurement. DBM will on-lend at 10.5%, taking a 3%
spread and committing the remaining 1.5% to a fund for training,
feasibility studies etc. The exchange risk will be passed on to
sub-borrowers.
(d) Negotiations have been completed with the EIB for a line of
credit of about Rs 23 million equivalent (US$3.4 million) at an
interest rate of 5-7/8% (commitment fee 3/4% following subproject
approval) for 12 years' including four years grace.
(e) The proposed IBRD loan of about Rs 50 million equivalent
(US$7.5 million).
(f) Additional funds from either KfW and/or ADB with whom discussions
are taking place.

5.12      The local cost component estimated at Rs 133 million (US$19.7 mil-
lion) or 43% of DBM's total gross requirements is expected to be financed
by (a) DBM's cash generation (Rs 50 million); and (b) Government existing
or expected loans (Rs 83 million). The Mauritian government has confirmed its
preparedness to meet DBM local currency needs either by itself lending to DBM
or allowing DBM to borrow on the local market.
Proposed Terms of Bank Loan
5.13      The loan will be made to DBM with the guarantee of the Government
of Mauritius at the standard IBRD interest rate. DBM will pass on the foreign
exchange risk to the sub-borrowers. The amortization of the Loan would be the
aggregate of the amortization schedules of subprojects, with a maximum maturity
of 15 years for industrial and tourism subprojects including appropriate grace
periods depending on the nature of the sub-projects. The free limit will be
raised to US$600,000 with an aggregate free limit of US$2 million. The first
five sub-loans in the sugar estate sub-sector will be reviewed by the Bank
regardless of investment size.
5.14      The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange component
of DBM's investments in industry, agro-industry and tourism, including small-
scale operations above US$2,300 (Rs 15,000). Projects needing financing below
this limit are considered as belonging to the artisanal category qualifying
for a 4-1/2% interest rate charge. DBM's agro-industrial lending to the sugar
estate sectgor will be limited to a maximum 15% of portfolio outstanding and
will have to meet normal DBM investment criteria with particular emphasis
being placed on employment/productivity aspects. DBM would prior to the first
sub-loan approval furnish to the Bank for review a summary of the collective
financial requirements of all sugar estates, including the purposes, employment
impact and DBM's projected participation. The foreign exchange component is
defined as the CIF cost of direct imports, 75% of the invoiced price of goods
previously imported into Mauritius, 50% of the invoiced price of goods produced
in Mauritius to a substantial extent from imported inputs, and 45% of the
construction costs of subprojects. Annex 24 shows an estimated disbursement
schedule for the proposed loan.
5.15      The proceeds of the proposed loan would be relent by DBM at a rate
of 10.5%.
Projected Financial Results
5.16      DBM's gross revenues, which reached 7% of total assets in FY76,
are expected to increase to about 9% by FY81 as a result of the gradual
increase in the average interest rate charged on the loan portfolio. Revenues
from industrial estate operations in FY77 are expected to cover the adminis-
trative costs and financial charges on external borrowing for that purpose.
Nevertheless, net profits as a percent of average total assets are expected
to decline in FY77 to about 1.7% (from 2% in FY76), as a result of a reduced
spread, a 30% increase in administrative costs (resulting from a general wage
increase in Mauritius) and a conservative allocation for provisions, which is
not a reflection of the state of the portfolio. Net profit as % of average net
worth is expected to decline slightly in FY77 to 9.6% and then increase again



- 25 -
in the following years to reach 13.0% by FY80. Although the spread earned on
lending operations declines through FY81, the increasing size of the portfolio
outstanding funded, from borrowings, results in profitability rising to Rs 9
million by FY81.
5.17      DBM's term debt/equity ratio (excluding the sinking fund from
the debt) is expected to increase from 3.2 as of June 30, 1976 to 5.5 by FY81.
However, including subordinated Government loans maturing after repayment
to the Bank of the proposed Loan as quasi-equity, the debt/equity ratio
increases from 1.7 in FY76 to 3.9 by FY80. In FY81, DBM may just exceed the
limit if actual operations conform to the projections.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      DBM has played and  ill continue to play an important role in the
development of Mauritian industrial sector to assist in meeting the Gov-
ernments objectives of eliminating unemployment. Previous Bank lending
has been utilized by DBM to fund both financially and economically attractive
projects. DBM has financed generally about 20-30% of total project costs
with private Mauritian and foreign investors funding the remainder. The
average cost/job created in the medium and large scale industrial sector
has been about US$10,000/job which is quite low for African DFCs. DBM is
both a sound and creditworthy institution and little risk is envisaged in
Bank lending to such an institution. Both Government and DBM wish the
Bank to continue to offer both financial assistance and institutional
support to DBM. A Bank loan of US$7.5 million is recommended to assist in
meeting part of DBM's foreign exchange requirements for industrial, agro-
industrial and tourism projects to June 1979.

ANNEX 4
Page I
THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
Statement of General Policy
Approved by the Board of Directors of DBM on October 27, 1971 and Amended
subsequently
1.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established in the
year 1964 as a result of Ordinance No. 34 of 1963 and may be described
as a Successor to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank (MAB) whose assets and
liabilities it took over. The main reason leading to the establishment of
the DBM was to bring into existence a single institution which would cater
to the needs of industry, agriculture and tourism and other related activi-
ties that have relevance to the country's economic development.
2.        The purpose for which the Bank has been established have been
defined in the Ordinance itself under Section 5 quoted hereunder:
5.(1)     The purposes of the Bank shall be to facilitate the
industrial, agricultural and economic development of the
country by promoting, encouraging and assisting in all
or any of the following activities:
(a) the financing, management and establishment of:
i)   new undertakings;
ii)   schemes for the expansion, better organization,
modernization and more beneficial exploitation
of any undertakings;
(b) the conduct of research into the industrial, agri-
cultural, mineral, maritime and commercial poten-
tialities of the country;
(c) the participation of private enterprises and capital,
whether from abroad or from within the country, in
the said activities;
(2)  Subject to the provision of Section 15 of the Ordinance,
in carrying out the objects provided for in subsection (1)
of this section, the Bank shall, when considering the
economic and commercial ainterests and the merits of any
undertaking, have due regard to the general economic
interests of the country.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(3) While under Section 15 of the Ordinance the Minister of
Finance is empowered to give the Bank general directives
as to the policy to be followed by it under certain
conditions, the administration shall be in the hands of
the Managing Director subject to the control and
supervision of the Board of Directors.
Resources
3.        The Bank, subject to the approval of the Bank of Mauritius, would
raise funds from public and private sources upon which terms and conditions
as the Board may determine by any or all of the following means:
(1) negotiating loans within or outside Mauritius;
(2) the issue of bonds, debentures or certificates of
indebtedness;
(3) negotiations or arrangements with any bank for overdrafts;
(4) acceptance of deposits on demand or at terms.
DBM will accept deposits from the public in the shape of savings and
fixed deposits and short-term bills, but the fixed deposits will not be
for a period of less than 1 year.
The total amount of moneys borrowed, raised or guarantee and owing or
outstanding shall not at any time exceed in the aggregate 4 times the total
amount of the Paid-up Capital Surplus and Reserves for the DBM plus any
subordinated loans provided by the Government.
Operations
A.   Industry
1.   The Bank will provide assistance to industry in the
following ways:
a)   tIedium and long-term loans.
b)   Equity participation (through underwriting, direct
subscription, conversion rights or in any other
manner).
c)   Issue of guarantees (arising out oif payment for
machinery and equipment imported or otherwise
or for any other purpose).



ANNEX 4
Page 3
d)   Allotment of Sheds in Industrial Estates owned
by the Bank.
e)   In any other appropriate manner.
2.   DBM's financial assistance will primarily be for
expenditure on fixed assets, save in exceptional cases
where working capital requirements, if they are not
forthcoming from other usual channels, will be
considered at the discretion of the Board, provided
adequate security as normally required for its lending
operations is available.
3.   The Bank will normally require that each loan is ade-
quately secured according to terms and conditions pre-
scribed by the Board at its discretion. It is, however,
the present policy (which is subject to modification
at the discretion of the Board and without any formal
notice) to provide loans to the extent of 50% (which
may be extended to 75% depending on the circumstances
of each case) of the available security by way of
fixed assets.
4.   The total commitments of the DBM in a single enterprise
loans, equity, guarantee any any other type of assistance
will normally not exceed 15% of the DBM's Paid-up Capital,
Free Reserves and subordinated Government loan outstanding.
5.   The DBM's investments in the Share Capital of a single
enterprise will normally not exceed 25% of the Issued
Capital of the enterprise or 10% of the DBM's Capital,
Reserves and Subordinated Government Loan outstanding and
disbursement thereof will be proportionate to the amount
of capital paid-up. The DBM will normally not seek to
acquire controlling interests in any enterprise. The
aggregate investments of the DBM in Share Capital of
enterprises will not exceed the DBM's Paid-up Capital,
and Free Reserves.
6.   Assistance by the Bank willk be decided purely on merits
of each case. The feasibility of the projects, its
viability, profitability, debt service coverage, the
market potential, its quality of management, its ability
to earn foreign exchange or save foreign exchange, the
extent of employment opportunities created and its
ultimate contribution to the economy of the country will
be the paramount considerations in deciding whether or
not to render assistance to a project.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
7.   The DBM may grant loans or provide other forms of
assistance either by itself or jointly with other
institutions both local and overseas.
8.   The period of the loans/assistance will depend upon
a study of each case depending on the repayment potential.
The period of repayments for loans for investment projects
for tourism may extend to 20 years and for other invest-
ment projects to 15 years.
9.   The Bank would, save in exceptional circumstances, expect
long-term debts of the Company charged against its fixed
assets not to exceed its Paid-up capital.
The Bank will normally require personal guarantees in the case of Companies.
B.   Small Industries
In the case of Small Scale Industries, the Bank would lend
against the security of Fixed Assets of the borrower. Where
the primary security is not adequate, non-industrial assets
provided by the borrower may also be considered for acceptance
as security. In addition, the Bank may ask for the guarantee
of third parties wherever it is considered necessary. All
loans to Small Scale Industries, i.e., loans to manufacturing
activities for loans below Rs 15,000 will be automatically
guaranteed by the Government. In deciding assistance to
Small Scale Industries, a liberal attitude will be taken
regarding the Loan/Fixed Assets Coverage.
C.   Industrial Estates
The DBM will also engage in the building of industrial sheds
in Industrial Estates and provide the sheds to industries at
reasonable rents and on such terms and conditions fixed by
the Board.
General Conditions
4.        The Bank, in cases where the Board considers appropriate, would
seek a right to convert its loans to industries into equity. It will be
the policy of the Bank to gradually dispose its equity holdings in the
market or elsewhere and in so doing it will, to the extent possible, see
to it that the Shares are dispersed as widely as possible and that the Shares
do not, by such sale, bet into the hands of rival groups.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
5.        The DBM will have the right to inspect the enterprises including
their operations and accounts and will therefore have the right of access
to visit the factory at any time to carry out its inspections. The DBM
will require its borrowers to keep recoirds and maintain accounts in
accordance with sound accounting practices and to furnish whatever infor-
mation DBM may seek on their operations and accounts.
D.   Agriculture
1.   The Bank will provide assistance to agriculture for the
following purposes:
a)   Application of planting materials, manure and
fertilizers;
b)   Diversification of crops;
c)   Mechanical preparation of land;
d)   Repayment of prior debts;
e)   Development of land including replantation and
planting of virgin soilk;
f)   Improvement of yields;
g)   Breeding and rearing of livestock.
2.   Agricultural loans are provided as under:
1)   Sugar Cane Cultivation - The following are the
criteria:
a)   Loan applied for;
b)   80% security value;
c)   The loan sanctioned is usually the lowest
of the two figures of a & b.
2)   Tea Cultivation - The same criteria as for sugar
cultivation are applied.
3)   Other Agricultural Loans - In the context of agri-
cultural diversification and agro-industrial projects,
loans may be sanctioned between 50 to 75% of the
project cost. It is the present practice to limit
this type of loan to around 50% of the project cost.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
Other Considerations
1.   DBM will diversify its portfolio in order to spread its
risks widely so that such risks are kept at a reasonable
level. Such diversification will be sought to be achieved
through investment in different types of enterprises and
through different types of financing.
2.   DBM will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to
maintain the value of its capital. In appropriating its
profits, due care will be taken to see that adequate
reserves are built to provide for any bad debts, possible
losses or any other risks that the Bank may have to undertake.
3.   The DBM will not incur any exchange risk in respect of those
of its borrowings that are repayable in foreign currencies.
DBM will pass to its clients any foreign exchange risk it
assumes or find other suitable means to cover it.
4.   DBM's assistance will be confined to private enterprises.
It will not provide assistance to industries owned by the
Government wholly or partly or in works undertaken by the
Government.
5.   The current rates of interest on loans (which can be charged
by the Board without notice) are as under:
a)   4-1/2% (Small Scale Industries)
b)   10-1/2% (other industries)
c)   Agriculture:  7-1/2% (up to 10 Arpents)
9% (over 10 to 50 Arpents)
10% (between 50 and 200 Arnents)
10.5% (above 200 Arpents)
