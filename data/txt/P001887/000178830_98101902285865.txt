INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED FOURTH LOAN TO THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF MAURITIUS
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
fourth loan to the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) with the guarantee
of Mauritius, for the equivalent of US$7.5 million to help finance lending
for industry, agro-industry and tourism. The loan would have a term sub-
stantially in conformity with the aggregate of the amortization schedules
of sub-loans and equity investments made by DBM, but not exceeding a period of
17 years, with interest at 8.2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (No.
268a-MAS) was circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974. A
basic economic mission visited Mauritius in April 1976, and its report en-
titled "Mauritius: A Basic Economic Report" will be finalized following
further discussions with the Government in July 1977. The following re-
flects the findings of the mission. Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop: sugar. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the population growth
rate averaged 2.8 percent annually, while the economy stagnated. A program
to limit the population growth rate was begun in the early 1960s, as a result
of which the population growth declined to only 1.2 percent a year by the mid-
1970s. Since independence in 1968, the Government has successfully promoted
the establishment of export industries and the development of tourism. This,
combined until recently with the impact throughout the economy of a booming
sugar industry, enabled employment to be expanded rapidly.
4.        The First Plan for Social and Economic Development covered the
four years up to 1974/75. During this period, output of all sectors increased,
and real GDP grew at an average real rate of 8 percent from 1970 to 1974.
In 1975, GDP fell temporarily as 35 percent of the sugar crop was lost through
cyclone damage, but in 1976 growth resumed, owing to a more normal sugar crop.
GNP per capita stood at US$580 in 1975. The terms of trade rose from 100 in
1970 to 145 in 1974, and advanced further to 169 in 1975, largely due to the
sharp rise in the price of sugar. These unprecedented improvements generated
considerable increases in domestic income, the growth rate of which increased
from 4 percent in 1971 to 29 percent in 1974, and averaged 13 percent in
real terms through the four years. The high level of demand stimulated rapid
growth in the sectors producing for the domestic market, such as manufac-
turing, construction and the service industries, but also caused a rapid rise
in imports and in domestic prices. In 1976, sugar prices declined sharply.
While Mauritius had realized US$575 per ton for its 1975/76 crop, the c.i.f.
price for the 1976/77 crop was only US$313 per ton. As a result, terms of
trade deteriorated but for 1980 they are still projected to be 15 percent more
favorable than in 1970.



- 2 -
5.        The rapid increase in real domestic income, combined with a higher
proportion of profits in the total, led to substantially increased savings
and investment rates in recent years. Savings rose from 13 percent of gross
domestic income in 1970 to 26 percent in 1975. Over the same period the
investment rate rose from 12 percent to 24 percent, with private investment
increasing more steeply than government investment. Most of the increased
savings accrued in the private sector, and financed reequipment and renovation
in the sugar industry, hotel and factory construction, and private residences.
In 1974 and 1975, Government mobilized considerable private savings to finance
its investment, largely by means of bond issues totaling over US$75 million.
6.        The main objective of the First Plan was the creation of new jobs.
In 1970 there were over 50,000 unemployed in Mauritius, and the labor force
was increasing by more than 7,000 annually. The target was the creation of
13,000 new jobs annually as a step towards full employment by 1980. Recorded
employment in larger establishments rose by an annual average of 7,800 from
1970 to 1975. There is evidence that unrecorded employment also grew rapidly
and that the plan target was virtually achieved. The unemployment rate fell
from over 16 to 8 percent of the labor force between 1970 and 1975. Part
of the credit for the lower unemployment rate rests with Government for
attracting foreign investors by means of fiscal and other incentives, and
organizing a labor intensive program of public works. The latter alone
provided about 7,000 new jobs. The rapid expansion of the economy result-
ing from high sugar prices and the strong growth of private investment in-
directly created a large number of new jobs in construction and the service
sectors.
7.        Despite the success in expanding employment, Mauritius still has
some unemployment that is proving hard to eliminate. Almost all the new jobs
created during the last five years are located in the urban strip running from
Port Louis to Curepipe, which, despite the small size of the country, is not
readily accessible from several of the high unemployment areas. Furthermore,
about 85 percent of the jobs created in the manufacturing sector are for young
women working in garment manufacture and light assembly work. The result has
been localized shortages of specific categories of labor while a substantial
number of people remained without jobs, many of them young men with some
secondary education.
8.        Deficiencies in education and training are a major constraint to
development. Schools do not provide proper training for the jobs available.
Shortages of trained workers have already slowed down the expansion of the
construction industry, and employers in industry and tourism have difficulty
in finding qualified workers. In order to raise the productivity in those
activities, and to attract new industries to Mauritius, it will be necessary
to adopt a more systematic approach to practical training.
9.        Mauritius also faces physical and organizational constraints to its
continuing rapid development. Water and electricity supply will need to be
expanded substantially to meet industrial, agricultural and domestic needs.



- 3 -
Closer planning of land use is necessary to take advantage of existing infra-
structure. Public transport and traffic management are in need of improvement
in the urban areas. The expansion of certain export industries is hampered by
the inadequacy of existing port facilities. Construction and public works are
likely to be constrained by the capacity of the contracting industry. To some
extent these constraints developed because of the high growth in the past five
years, which considerably exceeded expectations. The Second Five-Year Plan
(1975-80), published in May 1976, broadly recognizes the constraints noted
above. It proposes- a public investment program amounting to US$575 million,
with priority being given to the diversification of agricultural production
and to power and water development. Full employment by 1980 remains the key
objective to be achieved, mainly by the continued expansion of manufacturing.
The Plan objectives assume a growth rate of 6.5 percent per annum in real
terms which, given the present constraints, may be somewhat ambitious. A
growth rate of 5 percent per annum up to 1980 would appear more likely.
10.       Over the past five years, the distribution of income has become
somewhat more uneven as a result of changed relative prices and wages. In-
creases in sugar export prices caused the share of sugar in GDP (at current
factor cost) to rise from 27 percent in 1970 to over 45 percent in 1975, and
the real earnings of every economic group connected with sugar rose substan-
tially. This percolated into most organized sectors such as government,
manufacturing, the hotel industry and transport, but many unorganized and
informal sectors and those groups with limited economic bargaining power
may not have raised-their real incomes at all. The share of wages in GDP
dropped markedly from 1970 to 1974, but rose in 1975.
11.       A number of government policies were devised in response to the
deterioration in income distribution, but were unable to offset it entirely.
The National Remuneration Board, which was established in 1973 to review wage
claims and present recommendations to the Ministry of Labor, was largely re-
sponsible for the rise in real wages of organized workers in 1975. Govern-
ment spent 20 percent of its recurrent budget from 1973/74 to 1975/76 on
subsidies for rice and flour consumption, and also increased various wel-
fare payments. Price controls on 33 major items of consumption were intro-
duced to reduce consumer price increases and have since been expanded to
cover 75 items. These measures had some short-run impact on improving the
real income of poorer groups, especially as the bulk of direct taxes is paid
by a limited and wealthy group of the population.
12.       The wage increases for civil servants, and higher payments for
subsidies and imported goods had a substantial impact on government current
expenditure, which rose from US$46 million in 1970/71 to US$126 million in
1974/75. To finance this increase, several fiscal measures were taken, in-
cluding a 25 percent increase in import duties, a 10 percent surcharge on
income taxes, and a number of changes in the graduated sugar export tax,



- 4 -
which raised the top rate from 6 to 10 percent of value. As a result, revenue
rose from US$47 million in 1970/71 to US$127 million in 1974/75. Unfortunately,
there were almost no budgetary savings over this five-year period, even though
the rapid increase in income and demand arising from high sugar prices presented
a unique opportunity for using domestic revenues to finance development.
In 1975/76 and 1976/77 has been a cumulative increase of about 72 percent
in current expenditures over the two year period which have not been matched
by higher taxation receipts. A current deficit of US$16 million equivalent is
anticipated for 1976/77. Thus development expenditures have been financed by
internal and external borrowing. The budget outlook for the next fiscal year
also indicates a large overall deficit.
13.       The Government's concern at the high level of demand was reflected
in a number of monetary measures. A ceiling to credit growth of 15 percent
annually was imposed over the past three years, the privilege of rediscount-
ing sugar bills was withheld, and the cash reserve requirement of commercial
banks was raised from 5 percent in 1972 to 12 percent in 1974. As a result
of these combined factors, price inflation was brought down from 29 percent
in 1974 to 15 percent in 1975. In 1976, the increase in the price index was
less than 10 percent.
14.       The high price for sugar exports led to a considerable surplus in
the current account of the balance of payments in 1974, despite a 83 percent
increase in imports. Exports of goods and nonfactor services were US$372
million, while imports were US$333 million. In 1975, cyclone damage reduced
export earnings to US$344 million, but insurance compensation of US$28 mil-
lion from overseas was also received. Imports rose to US$342 million, though
their increase was much tempered by the effect of demand management policies.
In 1974 and 1975 there were net capital inflows (including transfers) of US$27
million and US$31 million, respectively, which permitted a substantial buildup
of international reserves. At the end of 1975 these stood at US$166 million,
equivalent to about 5 months imports. Owing to the decline in the price of
sugar in 1976, terms of trade fell sharply in that year. However, import
demand remained strong and foreign exchange reserves fell by over 40 percent.
They still are equal to about 3 months of imports.
15.       At the end of 1975 external public debt outstanding and disbursed
was US$43 million, of which US$8.0 million each to IBRD and IDA, while un-
disbursed debt amounted to a further US$82 million. Total service payments
during 1975 were US$3.7 million, of which US$0.6 million to IBRD and less
than US$0.1 million to IDA. The ratio of debt service to exports was 1.1
percent in 1975. However, in view of the large amount of undisbursed debt
and prospective capital requirements in the coming years, the debt service
ratio might reach about 9 percent in 1985 and 12 percent by 1990.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       To date Mauritius has received five IDA credits and six Bank loans
(including one loan on Third Window terms) totaling US$56.8 million to help



finance projects in industry (US$20 million), infrastructure (US$20.6 mil-
lion), agriculture (US$9.2 million) and education (US$7 million). IFC has
made a loan in 1971 for hotel construction and is presently considering a
second project in the same sector. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank Group operations in Mauritius as of May 31, 1977, as well as notes
on the status of execution of ongoing projects. Implementation of the indus-
trial and infrastructural projects is generally satisfactory. The education
and agriculture projects initially faced management problems but these have
now been brought under control.
17.       The program for Bank Group lending to Mauritius will continue to
support the Government's strategy of promoting economic diversification and
creating employment through the development of industry. Growing industrial-
ization has resulted in a heightened need for infrastructural improvements.
We expect to participate in projects aimed at improving and expanding infra-
structure and related institutions. In the immediate future a second power
project, which would expand distribution and transmission facilities, is
planned. We envisage also supporting the Government's proposed educational
reform through a second education project. We have also indicated our will-
ingness to assist development in water supply as soon as measures can be
taken to strengthen the Central Water Authority's financial position.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL, TOURISM AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
Manufacturing
18.       Mauritius' industry is still dominated by sugar processing, which
accounts for about 45 percent of value added. At present services represent
30 percent, manufacturing 17 percent, construction 5 percent, and public util-
ities 3 percent. Value added by non-sugar manufacturing in 1976 amounted to
8 percent of GDP, 16 percent of exports and provided employment to 37,000
persons or 14 percent of the labor force. Until recently, most of the non-
sugar manufacturing output came from industries catering to the domestic
market, primarily food and beverage, construction materials and printing.
Because of the small size of the domestic market, import substitution has
limited potential and such possibilities have been exhausted substantially.
The major scope for industrialization now lies in the transformation of
imported raw materials and intermediate products for export markets. The
dexterity and high quality of the Mauritian labor force and its low cost
compared with competing countries is'a considerable asset, particularly for
industries where labor cost has a large share in value added, such as manu-
facture of transistors, textiles, clothing, footwear and toys.
19.       The Government's basic development objective remains the achieve-
ment of full employment by 1980, through job creation in industry and services.



- 6 -
Until 1970, the Government's main means of stimulating industrial development
consisted of granting Development Certificates which offered certain advantages
to entrepreneurs in import-substitution industries considered important to the
island's economy. With opportunities for import substitution more or less
exhausted by the late 1960s, a worldwide study of industry led to the idea of
offering an attractive package of incentives to overseas manufacturing firms.
Under the Export Processing Zone Act approved in December 1970, export-oriented
labor intensive projects are offered incentives including preferential rates
for power, tax holidays on dividends and retained earnings, exemption from
import duties on raw materials and capital goods, and guaranteed foreign
exchange for raw material imports and for repatriating profits and capital.
These factors have attracted a number of foreign entrepreneurs in textiles and
garments, electronic components, footwear and toys, primarily from India,
Pakistan and Hong-Kong, with which Mauritius has cultural ties.
20.       In 1970, Mauritius became an associate member in the European Com-
munity which gave Mauritius-based industry easier access to that major market
area. This preferential treatment was expanded under the 1975 Lome Conven-
tion, which grants free access to the European Community market for manufac-
tured goods originating in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries associated
with the European Community. Australia has also conceded preferential tariff
rates on certain Mauritian products and, consequently, exports to that coun-
try are growing.
21.       The Government has also set up industrial estates with all the nec-
essary infrastructure, generally divided into plots with standard factory
buildings. Investors are thus saved some of the initial capital, time and
effort needed to secure authorization from a variety of authorities for
land and utilities. Two major schemes near Port Louis, at Plaine-Lauzun
and Coromandel, have been completed and partly occupied. Plans to develop
additional areas are under preparation.
22.       Recently, a number of factors have negatively affected industrial
growth in Mauritius. In the first place, the general level of profitability
of manufacturing enterprises in Mauritius, particularly in the textile sector,
declined in 1975 as a result of the world recession and a marked increase
in wages; this temporarily slowed down industrial investments. Some inves-
tors may also have adopted a wait-and-see attitude pending a clarification of
the political situation following the general elections of December 1976.
Mauritius also has some limitations on water supplies available for industrial
purposes. These may affect the pattern of industrial development in the next
year or two.
23.       In the long run, the same factors which have explained the rapid
growth in the industrial sector in the early 1970s will continue to sustain
future growth. However, some of the major advantages offered by Mauritius
to investors are now being offered by some other countries as well. Morocco,



- 7 -
Algeria and Tunisia have signed a trade agreement with the European Community,
which will give them the same preferential treatment as Mauritius for most of
their industrial exports. These countries are likely to present a greater
challenge to Mauritius' industrial exports than the African, Caribbean and
Pacific countries associated with the European Community did in the past.
24.       Nevertheless, Mauritius continues to retain substantial unique char-
acteristics which make it attractive to local and foreign investors, including
a well-functioning administration, low labor cost and a cosmopolitan character.
In spite of the above-mentioned short-term constraints, a continuation of the
past annual growth rate in the non-sugar manufacturing sector of 7-8 percent
per year is expected.
Agro-industry (Sugar)
25.       Out of some 86,500 acres under sugar cane cultivation, about 56
percent are cultivated by 21 sugar estates having processing and refining
facilities. Some 31,000 small independent growers cultivate the remainder.
Of the 21 estates, 20 are privately-owned while one has been acquired by the
Government. The current five-year Plan contemplates an expansion of sugar
production from 680,000 tons, the average achieved during the previous plan
period, to 800,000 tons by 1980. This proposed increase will have to come
primarily through improvements in cane yields and technical factors such as
improved varieties, pest control and irrigation. Modernization of the sugar
mills will also be required. As a result of the Government's success in
creating new job opportunities and thereby reducing unemployment, the estates
are encountering increasing difficulties in securing labor, particularly
during the harvesting season, and the industry is beginning to look towards
some degree of mechanization to overcome labor shortages.
Tourism
26.       Mauritius has distinct attractions for tourism; it has unspoiled
white sand beaches, coral reefs, lagoons and subtropical temperatures with
long daily periods of sunshine on the coast. Since 1969, tourism in Mauritius
has developed rapidly and visitor arrivals increased by an average of 30 per-
cent a year, reaching 95,000 in 1976. The 2,300 hotel rooms and bungalows
in Mauritius were estimated to have a 70 percent occupancy rate in 1976.
The largest increase in arrivals has been in the number of visitors from
South Africa, the Indian Ocean area, Europe and Australia, due in part to
the introduction of special promotional air fares.
27.       Nevertheless, new applications for hotel projects are being care-
fully considered, as the rate of growth of tourism in Mauritius is likely to
slow down in the future. Although the Government does not yet have a formal
tourism policy, officials emphasize the strain that hotel construction places
on the construction industry and public utilities. The investment cost per
new job is high for hotels, and tourism provides little opportunity to upgrade
labor skills. Secondly, growth in the traditional markets for Mauritian tour-
ism is bound to decline. Reunion, which accounted for 30 percent of tourist



- 8 -
arrivals in 1975, has little growth potential. The future of tourism from
South Africa, the second largest market, is uncertain. Therefore, most
projections assume that tourist arrivals will increase by about 9 percent
per annum until 1980.
Finance
28.       Despite its relatively small size, Mauritius has a wide range of fi-
nancial intermediaries. The banking system consists of the Bank of Mauritius
(Central Bank), the Mauritius Commercial Bank and eight other commercial banks
(which are branches of overseas banks), the Cooperative Central Bank, the
Post Office Savings Bank and the Development Bank of Mauritius. There are
also a number of insurance companies, a housing corporation which offers
mortgage finance and raises funds from both the public and private sectors,
investment trusts, pension funds and the Sugar Insurance Fund, which charges
premia on all sugar production and pays benefits in years of poor harvests.
The main Mauritian sources of funds for term financing of the industrial sec-
tor are the Development Bank of Mauritius, the Finance Corporation of the
Mauritius Commercial Bank, the Sugar Pension Fund, insurance companies and
direct financing by the private sugar companies.
29.       Because the sugar sector is so dominant in the Mauritian economy,
the liquidity of the banking system has been largely dependent on the success/
failure of the sugar crop. Over the last two years the revenues from the
sugar crop have been good and the banks have therefore been liquid and able
to meet the working capital/short-term financing needs of the seasonal sugar
crop and the growing level of demand from the industrial sector. The profit-
ability in the sugar sector has also enabled the sugar companies to finance
their own needs and have resources available for investments in the indus-
trial sector. However, due to falling sugar prices and increased operating
costs, the profitability of the sugar sector in 1977 is expected to fall.
This is expected to result in the Mauritian private sector having reduced
resources for investments in both the sugar and industrial sectors as well
as illiquidity in the commercial banking system at times of seasonal peak
demand for sugar crop financing. To resolve this liquidity problem, the
Central Bank may offer additional rediscount facilities to priority sectors.
Increased demands on DBM for equity and term loan financing are expected for
the industrial and sugar estate sectors.
30.       In order to help mobilize private savings and provide a channel
for the investment of such funds in commercial and industrial concerns, the
Government is forming a Commercial and Investment Trust. The Trust will
have a share capital of Rs 5 million financed equally by the Government,
the Central Bank, DBM and the State Commercial Bank, and "units" of Rs 10
each will be sold to the public. In its initial stages DBM will advise the
Board of Trustees on investments.
Interest Rate Structure
31.       In March 1977, the Central Bank, which sets ceiling rates for
deposits and advances for all banks, announced an overall increase in the
Mauritian interest rate structure. This was the first general upward raise



- 9 -
in the interest rate structure and the first major change in rates since
1974. The maximum on-lending rate for commercial banks has been raised by
1 percent to 10 percent p.a. Deposit rates were increased by 1/4 of 1 percent
only and now range between 4-3/4 and 6 percent p.a. The resulting increased
spread will allow commercial banks to accommodate rising internal operating
costs. As the rates apply uniformly, competition between banks will continue
to be in terms of banking services offered.
32.       Following the increase in the on-lending rates for commercial banks,
DBM increased its term lending rates for the industrial and tourism sectors
(excluding Small-Scale Enterprises) from 10 to 10.5 percent and for the
agro-industrial sector from 7 to 10.5 percent p.a. Thus DBM charges 10.5
percent plus 1 percent p.a. commitment fee for term lending as opposed to a
maximum 10 percent for lending by commercial banks. In addition DBM passes
any foreign exchange risk to its sub-borrowers. The inflation rate which was
less than 10 percent in late 1976 is expected to be reduced to 7-8 percent
from 1977. With an on-lending rate of 10.5 percent this would imply for DBM,
a real positive interest rate of 2-1/2 - 3-1/2 percent. DBM maintains a
continuous review of its interest rates in relation to economic conditions,
DBM profitability and the prevailing interest rate structure in Mauritius and
will continue to initiate adjustment to its on-lending rates, as appropriate,
through the DBM Board.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project would assist DBM, as the major institutional
source of term finance in Mauritius, in financing the foreign exchange com-
ponent of its investments in manufacturing, agro-industry and tourism, in-
cluding loans to small-scale enterprises. A report entitled "Appraisal of
the Development Bank of Mauritius" (No, 1476 -MAS, dated June 20, 1977) is
being circulated separately. The proposed project was appraised in December
1976. Negotiations were held in Mauritius from May 9-16, 1977 with a dele-
gation consisting of Mr. V.S. Raghavan, Manager Director of DBM, and
Mr. Ghoorah, Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
History and Oblectives of DBM
34.       DBM was established in 1964 as a statutory corporation to finance
industrial, agricultural and tourism development projects. The Government
holds 91 percent of its share capital and the Bank of Mauritius, the remain-
ing 9 percent. In 1970 DBM was reorganized with the help of the Bank Group,
following which DBM was the beneficiary in 1972 of an IDA credit of US$3.5
million (No. 313-MAS). This credit has been fully disbursed. In 1973, IDA
made a credit of US$4.0 million (No. 411-MAS) to Mauritius to help finance
DBM's investments for the development of an industrial estate at Coromandel;
the project is expected to be completed shortly, about six months ahead of
schedule.  In 1974, the Bank made a loan of US$5.0 million (No. 979-MAS) to



- 10 -
DBM for industrial lending, which has also been fully disbursed, and in 1975
DBM received another Bank loan of US$7.5 million (No. 1168-MAS). This loan
is expected to be fully committed by mid-1977.
Management and Organization
35.       DBM's Board of Directors consists of twelve members, chosen by
the Government and including representatives of the Ministries of Finance,
Commerce and Industry, and Fisheries, and the Bank of Mauritius; six private
businessmen; and DBM's Managing Director. The current chairman is Mauritius'
Assistant Financial Secretary. The Board is both experienced and capable, and
encompasses a broad range of investment interests.
36.       DBM's management and staff are also capable and experienced.   A Bank
staff member on secondment has been Managing Director since May 1975. Under
his leadership the impact of DBM in the financing of industrial and tourism
investment in Mauritius has been greatly enhanced. DBM's volume of business
has significantly increased, as has its internal operating efficiency. A
vigorous training policy has been pursued and has resulted in DBM having a
qualified and competent Mauritian management team. During 1976, a Mauritian
staff member was promoted to the position of Assistant Managing Director. At
the request of the Mauritian Government, the Bank's seconded staff member has
agreed to an extension of his contract until May 1978. This will allow
additional time for the training of a Mauritian succesor.
37.       DBM has presently 26 professionals out of a total staff of 73 per-
sons. The staff is adequate in quality and number, with the exception of
the Industrial Estate Division, where DBM is seeking a promotion and com-
mercial management advisor for the Coromandel industrial estate; a Mauritian
commercial manager would be appointed as a counterpart to the foreign advisor.
Sixteen staff members have attended overseas training courses, including six
who have attended Economic Development Institute courses in Washington, D.C.
Others have been encouraged to pursue further professional qualifications in
Mauritius in law, accounting, banking and secretarial studies. DBM has four
operational lending divisions for Industry, Industrial Estate, Small Enter-
prises, and Agriculture, plus an Administrative Division, which includes
the legal and accounting functions. The quality of appraisal work has been
generally good, and supervision has been efficient.
Operations
38.       DBM has been the major institutional source of term finance for
industrial and tourism projects in Mauritius. As of September 30, 1976, DBM
has assisted about 51 percent of the companies receiving development certifi-
cates or export processing zone certificates, through direct financing and
through its industrial estate program. Many projects have been jointly
financed with the commercial banks as well as IFC, and relations between DBM
and the financial community are excellent.



- 11 -
39.       The evolution of DBM's operations is shown by a major expansion in
approvals which rose in FY1976 by 25 percent to Rs 62 million, reflecting the
boom in industrial investment in Mauritius. Disbursements in FY1976 rose to
Rs 85 million from Rs 33 in FY1975, which was also a result of DBM improv-
ing the efficiency of its internal loan processing and disbursement proce-
dures.
40.       In value terms, the medium   and large-scale industry and tourism
sectors have shown the largest growth during FY1975 and FY1976, with loan
approvals rising from Rs 36 million to Rs 52 million. Approvals during
the first six months of FY1977 were slightly lower than the FY1976 rate,
but investment demand is expected to increase again during the latter part
of the fiscal year. In FY1976 four equity investments were made in this
sector for Rs 1.2 million total and one further equity investment for Rs 3.7
million has been made since then.
Loan Portfolio
41.       The average size loan approved by DBM was Rs 1.6 million (US$240,000).
Total project costs have ranged in size from Rs 155,000 for a printing works
to Rs 60 million for an acrylic yarn factory. The distribution of the indus-
trial loan portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 1976 indicates a contin-
uing heavy concentration on textile exports (46 percent) although in FY1976
attempts were made to reduce the level of new investment in this sector. The
risk to DBM due to its exposure in textiles is mitigated by the diversity of
products produced in Mauritius (i.e., jute bags, carpet backing, yarn, knit-
wear, ready-made garments, etc.) and by the geographical dispersion of the
markets. Hotel investment accounts for a further 23 percent of the portfolio
and other sectors include food processing (4 percent), fishing and fish pro-
cessing (2 percent) and agribusiness (2 percent), i.e., subsectors which are
serving primarily the domestic markets.
42.       The 56 industrial projects financed by DBM between July 1, 1974
and October 31, 1976 created 5,227 new jobs on projects having economic rates
of return ranging from 10 percent to 42 percent. The average investment cost
per job created in this medium- and large-scale industrial sector amounts to
approximately US$10,000. Because the Bank Group has, through three previous
operations, contributed a significant proportion of DBM's financing for proj-
ects in this sector, the characteristics of Bank-financed projects are similar
to those identified above.
Equity Investments
43.       As of December 31, 1976, DBM has made equity investments in 16
companies amounting to Rs 13 million. The portfolio comprises a diverse
sub-sectoral mix, including hotel, textile, banking, cement, bagasse board,
fertilizer, distillery and industrial farming projects. DBM's participation



- 12 -
ranges from 6 percent to 42 percent of the equity, but in the majority
of projects is between 10 percent and 15 percent. In FY1976 five of the
projects were operating profitably (four paid dividends during the year),
three were approaching break-even positions, seven were in the construction
or start-up stage, and one project, the manufacture of bagasse board, had
stopped operation. This company, which began operations in 1971, will be
liquidated in FY1977 if it cannot secure large guaranteed orders from the
Government. DBM's investment in this company is government-guaranteed.
Industrial Estates
44.       At the request of the Government, DBM has been undertaking a program
of construction of industrial estates. As of December 31, 1976 the value of
the industrial estates developed and managed by DBM amounted to Rs 62.5 mil-
lion and included an estate at Plaine Lauzun, which is fully occupied and
operational, and one at Coromandel (described in greater detail below) which
was still under construction and only partially leased. A further indus-
trial estate at Beau Vallon is shortly to be implemented and other estates
are in the planning stage. DBM is currently in charge of the Estate/Export
Processing Zone development program and coordinates development with the
Government through an Industrial Estate Advisory Committee composed of DBM,
relevant ministries and various parastatal bodies.
45.       The Industrial Estate Credit No. 411-MAS of 1973 was to finance
construction of a 60-acre industrial site at Coromandel, including infra-
structure and all services to ten owner-occupied factories, and to finance
factory buildings for 40 to 50 small-to medium-scale industries. Total
employment created on completion of the project is estimated at 8,000 to
10,000 people. The construction is proceeding ahead of schedule and the
estate is expected to be completed shortly. As of May 1977, 463,000 sq. ft.
of the total 627,600 sq. ft. had been completed; 173,000 sq. ft. had been
occupied, 54,000 sq. ft. leased, and another 70,000 sq. ft. were under
negotiation. To assist in the leasing of the estate, it is proposed to
recruit an expatriate adviser on industrial estate commercial management
and promotion who will operate with a Mauritian counterpart. So far, the
project has generated 1,000 factory jobs and 300 construction jobs.
Artisans
46.       DBM also operates a successful scheme for making loans for small-
scale industrial development. It provides medium-term finance to artisans
in amounts up to Rs 15,000 (about US$2,300) at government-set interest rates
of 4.5 percent per annum for the purchase of equipment. For amounts above
Rs 15,000, DBM charges the full 10.5 percent per annum interest rate. Work-
ing capital is made available to the artisans by the government-owned State
Commercial Bank (at 10 percent per annum interest rate) with which DBM has a
very close working relationship. The Government covers the operating costs
incurred by DBM on such lending and is also prepared to cover actual losses
on loans.  In FY1976, DBM approved 467 loans totaling Rs 3.15 million, fairly



- 13 -
evenly distributed among food processing, light engineering, garment-making,
furniture and other projects. The repayment record in the artisan sector
has been remarkably good and as of December 31, 1976 only 41 loans totaling
Rs 193,000 were in arrears from a portfolio of 1,038 loans totaling Rs 6.0
million. The arrears-affected portfolio amounted to only 3.2 percent of the
portfolio outstanding and actual amounts in arrears to only 0.7 percent, due
to the close contact retained by DBM staff with client artisans.
Agriculture
47.       During FY1976, DBM instituted a scheme whereby the Mauritius Co-
operative Central Bank, which has limited term funds, could refinance its
medium-and long-term lending to cooperatives through DBM. DBM receives funds
from the Government at 2.5 percent for agriculture, which it lends at 7.25
percent per annum to the Cooperative Central Bank, which in turn on-lends to
cooperatives at 8.5 percent. There was also a small increase in DBM's agri-
cultural lending for small sugar, tea, mixed farming and livestock projects
in FY76.
Financial Condition
48.       DBM's financial position is sound.   DBM has made significant
progress over the last two years in arrears recovery, reducing the arrears-
affected portfolio (arrears over three months) from 18 percent as of June 30,
1974 to the very low level of 2.9 percent as of December 31, 1976. This has
been achieved through DBM staff diligently pursuing defaulting clients and
also assisting clients in resolving operational problems. Loans to 0.8
percent of the arrears-affected portfolio are government-guaranteed and the
other loans are well-secured. Provisions totalled Rs 2.7 million as of June
30, 1976 which represents 2.2 percent of the loan and equity portfolio out-
standing, which is adequate given the low level of arrears. The state of the
portfolio and the adequacy of provisions are reviewed annually at the time of
the audit. The quality of DMB portfolio is good. The term debt/equity ratio
(treating as equity the portion of government-subordinated loans maturing
after the repayment of the Bank loans) rose from 0.9 to 1.7. This is well
within the debt/equity limit of 4:1 specified in the last Loan Agreement with
the Bank.
DBM Strategy
49.       The development objectives defined by the Government in the Five-
Year Plan (FY76-FY80) require industry to generate 47,000 new jobs in the
Plan period. This is an ambitious objective and will require, inter alia,
a major promotional effort both in Mauritius and abroad to attract indus-
trial investors, investment incentives, availability of suitable industrial
sites and sources of finance in Mauritius. In attempting to achieve the
Plan's objective, DBM will have an important role to play. DBM will con-
tinue to be the major Mauritian financial institution providing term finance
for investment projects which are well conceived on economic, financial and
technical grounds. DBM's operational strategy will emphasize the following:



- 14 -
(a) Medium and Large Scale Industry and Tourism: DBM
will seek to diversify its portfolio to reduce the
present concentration in the textile and hotel sub-
sectors. New proposals in these sub-sectors will
be closely scrutinized to ensure that they can be
fully justified on financial and economic grounds.
(b) Small Scale Enterprises. DBM will continue its policy
of providing financial assistance to small scale enter-
prises. As a number of traditional occupations
like tailoring, poultry farming, furniture making and
fishing have now been assisted, DBM will also seek to
assist non-traditional occupations.
(c) Industrial Estate Development. DBM will continue to
plan the development of the industrial estate program
in coordination with Government. Particular attention
will be paid to the long-term development of the La
Tour Urban Housing/Industrial Estate project. The
project site is adjacent to Port Louis covering 220
acres owned by DBM; 130 acres are presently designated
for housing, 70 acres for industrial estate warehousing
facilities and 20 acres for green areas.
(d) Agricultural Sector. DBM will continue to make loans
for land development and occasionally for agricultural
equipment purchase as well as providing refinancing
facilities for the Mauritius Cooperative Central Bank
for its term lending to cooperatives.
(e) Agro-Industrial Sector. Government and DBM Board in
early 1977 gave approval for DBM to begin providing
financial assistance to the large sugar estates for
sugar processing operations. DBM proposes to assist
sugar companies in acquiring equipment for replace-
ment/extension/modification of processing facili-
ties as well as some agricultural machinery such as
loaders, harvesters and transporters. Each project
will have to meet DBMs standard criteria. Particular
attention will be paid to the impact on employment
and only those projects which result in a perceptible
increase in productivity will be assisted.
(f) Promotion. DMB also intends to continue collaborating
with the Government in drawing up an overseas program
to promote industrial investments in Mauritius.
Projected Operations
50.       DBM's project pipeline as of November 30, 1976 includes 21 proj-
ects with a total project cost amounting to Rs 323 million. About half of



- 15 -
these projects by number, amounting to a total investment cost of Rs 40
million, are import-substitution projects mainly in the food and beverage,
construction and assembly sectors. The other projects, including most of
the large-scale projects, will be serving the export market. Based on the
project pipeline, it appears that textile export projects will continue to
represent a significant proportion of DBM's approvals, as was the case in
the past, for two reasons: (i) Mauritius has its largest comparative advan-
tage in this sector, given the low cost and capability of its labor force;
and (ii) future textile projects are complementary to existing ones and
designed to integrate the production processes. Other important projects
are planned to take place in the tourism and sugar by-products sectors.
51.       With regard to investments in the sugar estate sector, total re-
quirements for the two year program are estimated at approximately Rs 135
million. DBM may possibly lend up to Rs 60 million of which about Rs 35
million would be in foreign exchange. In the transportation sector, DBM
will on-lend to other Mauritian financial institutions the Rs 38 million
line of credit made available by the Industrial Development Bank of India
to finance the supply of Indian manufactured transport equipment.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
52.       In spite of the recent slow down in industrial investment described
in paragraph 22 above, total approvals for FY77 are expected to reach Rs 76
million which is about 20% over FY76 levels. In FY78 and FY79 total approvals
are expected to increase to Rs 147 million and Rs 158 million respectively
reflecting the additional approvals in the agro-industrial and financial
sectors of about Rs 55 million in each year. Medium and large scale industrial
operations are expected to increase from FY78 through FY81 at a rate of 15
percent per annum in current terms (7 percent in constant terms).
53.       The other sectors are expected to remain a small part of DBM's
activities by value. Approvals for equity participations are forecast at
Rs 2.5 million per annum to FY81. Approvals for small-scale enterprises
sector are expected to increase by about Rs 0.5 million per annum to reach
Rs 5.5 million in FY81. DBM's activity in this sector is expected to make a
substantial contribution to reducing the level of unemployment and improving
the standard of living of the poorer section of the population. Agricultural
approvals are forecast to reach Rs 4.8 million in FY77 and increase by about
Rs 0.3 million per annum thereafter, with similar economic effects as the
loans to the small-scale sector. With the completion of the Coromandel in-
dustrial estate, approvals in this sector are expected to drop to about
Rs 2.0 million per annum starting in FY78 and until the planned industrial
estate at Beau Vallon is undertaken.
54.       DBM's overall foreign exchange requirements to mid-1979 are
estimated at Rs 176 million equivalent (about US$26 million) or 57 percent
of DBM's gross requirements. Financing is expected to be covered mainly
by: the uncommitted balances of IDA Credit 411-MAS, IBRD Loan 1168-MAS
and of a loan made in 1976 by the African Development Bank, totalling



- 16 -
US$5.8 million; an existing line of credit from the Industrial Development
Bank of India for US$5.6 million; recently negotiated lines of credit of
about US$2.5 million from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(France) and of about US$3.4 million from the European Investment Bank; and
the proposed Bank loan of US$7.5 million. Thus, only about US$1.2 million
would remain uncovered. DBM is currently discussing the possibility of
additional financing with the Kredietanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau and the
the African Development Bank.
55.       The local cost component estimated at US$19.7 million or 43 per-
cent of DBM's total gross requirements is expected to be financed by DBM's
cash generation and Government funds. The Mauritian government has confirmed
its intention to meet DBM local currency needs either by lending to DBM or by
allowing DBM to borrow on the local market.
Forecast Financial Results
56.       DBM's financial position is expected to remain favorable.   DBM's
gross revenues, which reached 7 percent of total assets in FY76, are expected
to increase to about 9 percent by FY81 as a result of the gradual increase in
the average interest rate charged on the loan portfolio. Revenues from indus-
trial estate operations in FY77 are expected to cover the administrative
costs and financial charges on external borrowing for that purpose. Neverthe-
less, net profits as a percent of average total assets are expected to decline
in FY77 to about 1.7 percent (from 2 percent in FY76), as a result of a 50
percent increase in DBM's borrowing costs which offsets the increase in the
average return on the loan portfolio, a 30 percent increase in administrative
costs and a substantial increase in provisions. Net profit as percent of
average net worth is expected to decline slightly in FY77 to reach 9.6 percent
and then increase again in the following years to reach 13 percent by FY81.
57.       On the basis of present projections, DBM's term debt/equity ratio
would increase to 3.9 by FY1980, and might exceed slightly the agreed 4:1
limit in FY81. The matter will be kept under review in light of actual opera-
tions and measures will be taken as appropriate.
Terms of Bank Loan
58.       The proposed loan would be made to DBM with the guarantee of
Mauritius, at an interest rate of 8.2 percent per annum. The amortization
schedule of the loan would be the aggregate of the amortization schedules of
subprojects, with repayments beginning in 1979 and ending in 1994. The free
limit will be US$600,000 with an aggregate free limit of US$2 million (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 2.02 (a) and (b)). This limit will enable the Bank
to review about 60 percent of the financing provided under the loan and about
half by number, which we consider adequate. Before sending to the Bank its
first request for approval of a sub-project for a sugar estate, DBM will fur-
nish a survey of the collective financial requirements of all sugar estates,
including the purposes and impact on employment and DBM's projected partici-
pation. The first five sub-projects of this type will not be presented under
the free limit procedure. In addition, only US$2.5 million of the proposed
loan would be used for onlending to sugar estates and DBM will limit its ex-
posure in sugar estates to a maximum of 15 percent of its total loan portfolio



- 17 -
(draft Loan Agreement, Sections 2.02 (a) and (b) and 3.06). The proceeds of
the proposed loan would be relent by DBM at an interest rate of at least 10.5
percent per annum. DBM would continue to pass the foreign exchange risk to
its sub-borrowers.
Procurement and Disbursements
59.       Procurement is executed through normal existing channels, and DBM
requires its clients to seek alternative quotations for equipment and con-
struction contracts. The proposed loan would be disbursed against the for-
eign exchange requirements of DBM's investments in industry, agro-industry
and tourism. The foreign exchange component of each investment would be
estimated as 100 percent of the CIF cost of direct imports, 75 percent of
the invoiced price of goods previously imported through normal trade chan-
nels, 50 percent of the invoiced price of goods produced in Mauritius to a
substantial extent from imported inputs, and 45 percent of the construction
costs of industrial buildings and hotels (draft Loan Agreement, Section 2.02
(a)).
Justification and Risks
60.       Industrial growth remains one of the most important elements of
the Mauritian economy. The Government's overall economic and industrial
policies are appropriate to the stage of the country's growth. DBM has
played, and will continue to play, an important role in the development of
the industrial sector through direct financing of projects, development of
industrial estates and assistance to the artisanal sector. It is a well-
managed, creditworthy institution, which deserves further institutional
and financial assistance from the Bank Group. DBM has made significant
progress in the training of staff, development of its appraisal and super-
vision capabilities, and efficiency of operating procedures. However, the
Bank can still greatly aid in further developing DBM, particularly in the
supervision and promotion areas, where DBM has not yet achieved the pro-
ficiency of some of the more mature development banks financed by the Bank.
DBM has a pipeline of promising projects, which meet with the country's
objective of industrialization and job creation, and its continued growth
is not expected to be constrained by a lack of demand for the financing and
other services it offers. The proposed loan will fill a resource gap and
enable DBM to cover foreign exchange resource requirements until mid-1979.
DBM and Government have requested continued close collaboration with the
Bank. As DBM's role continues to expand, assistance by the Bank Group to
DBM can provide an important base for maintaining a dialogue on overall
industrial and financial development and policies in Mauritius. The pro-
posed project does not present unusual risks, although in the short run,
the factors mentioned in paragraph 22 above could continue to affect the
timing of new investments, in which case loan commitments by DBM might be
somewhat slower than projected.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and DBM, the draft Guaran-
tee Agreement between Mauritius and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
62.       Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraph 60 of this Report.
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 239-MAS Tea Development Project; US$5.2 million credit of
April 9, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: June 11, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Project field development experienced problems due to poor soil
and drainage conditions, poor quality of planting materials (seedlings
instead of VP plants) and the effect of a cyclone which hit Mauritius in
February 1975. These difficulties were aggravated by general problems
facing the Mauritian tea industry, especially rapidly increasing wage rates
in the sugar industry with which the tea sector is unable to compete. These
problems were examined about two years ago by a study group which included
Bank staff members. The recommendations of the study group, which included
suggestions on what the role of the Tea Development Authority (TDA) should
be, were accepted by the Government and are being implemented. Project
accounts are now in better shape, following the appointment of a qualified
financial controller and a chief accountant. Pield work is now proceeding
on schedule and the first project plantations should be ready for handover
to smallholders in 1977-78.
Credit No. 411-MAS Industrial Estate Project; US$4.0 million credit of
June 29, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: October 1, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Construction of the Coromandel industrial estate is ahead of sched-
ule by six months. Infrastructure (land grading and fill, roads, power, water,
etc.) was substantially completed in June 1976. However, occupancy rate is
still low, at 55 percent of available space. By March 1977, about 218,000
sq ft of factory buildings were committed. Of the 27 acres of developed
land available on long-term (20 years) lease for owner-built factories, 12
acres have been taken up by 3 firms. Project cost-to-completion is estimated
at US$9.0 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$8.0 million. Pro-
jected revenues show a higher increase than at appraisal, which would yield
a 10 percent financial return over 20 years. The employment trend in estate
factories is satisfactory.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 419-MAS Rural Development Project: US$4.0 million credit of
July 9. 1973; Date of Effectiveness: October 11, 1973;
Closing Date: October 31, 1977
The implementation of the rural development project, initially slow,
has now improved. Several factors caused a slow progress, including procure-
ment difficulties and the rise in sugar prices which caused land prices to rise
sharply, thus making it difficult for the Government to obtain land for the
project; the February 1975 cyclone contributed to the delay. There were
also managerial problems which have been recently rectified. Government in-
volvement in management decisions has expedited land acquisition, re-organi-
zation of the Development Works Corporation (DWC) and the training program
for younger workers. Progress under the productive self-help component and
with worker vocational training continues. The monitoring and evaluation
unit, after a slow start, is now working well and its first operational eval-
uation studies are being issued to project management and IDA for review.
An in-depth evaluation mission is scheduled for August 1977.
Loan No. 976-HAS    Port Prolect; US$10.0 million loan of April 12, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: June 13. 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
Loan No. 1339-T-MAS Revised Port Project: US$3.6 million Third Window loan of
December 9. 1976: Not yet Effective;
Closing Date:  December 3I. 1980l
Most civil works contracts under the project have been awarded and
physical execution of the project is proceeding well. Port dredging was
to have been carried out as part of a nearby reclamation project. However,
it was not completed and additional financing was required. This was pro-
vided under the Third Window loan. The Port Authority has been formally
established and is now hiring staff. The loan is expected to become effective
shortly, following promulgation -expected July 1, 1977- of legislation
governing the Port Authority and submission to the Bank of the usual legal
opinion.
Loan No. 1033-MAS    First Education Project: US$3.5 million loan and US$3.5
and          million credit of July 29, 1974; Date of Effectiveness:
Credit No. 501-MAS October 29, 1974; Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Implementation continues to proceed satisfactorily. The Bank Group
has recently approved the award of civil works contracts for the Industrial
Trade Training Center, and six Laboratories and Workshop Centers. The Project
Unit is fully staffed and operating well. Present indications are that the
project will be completed by the closing date.

Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is proceeding well. About US$4.9 million has been com-
mitted and USS1.6 million disbursed.
