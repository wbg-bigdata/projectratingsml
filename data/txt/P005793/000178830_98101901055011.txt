YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Urban Development in the Yemen Arab Republic -
Urban Trends
1.01     Urban growth in the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) is a relatively recent
phenomenon which began to accelerate only  in the early  1970s.   The  total
resident population of YAR, estimated at about 5.3 million in 1975, grew at
about 2.9% per annum to about 6.1 million in 1980.  However, the total urban
population, estimated at about 365,000 in 1975, grew at about 7.7% per annum
to about 530,000 in 1980.2-'  Rural-urban migration, especially of males who
leave their families in the countryside, has accounted for most urban growth.
If such trends continue, the YAR urban population, which now stands at around
10% of the total population, will increase to 2.2 million, or 20% of the
expected YAR total resident population, by the year 2000.  Lower international
emigration rates and the migration of entire families to cities are all
distinct possibilities which, singly or in combination, will lead to
increasing urban growth pressures.
1.02     The  urban  population  is  fairly  evenly  distributed.   A  widely
dispersed rural population, a rugged topography, and deeply rooted traditions
of regional autonomy have combined to impede the development of overwhelming
primacy by any one city.   Three cities--Sana'a,  the capital;  Hodeidah,  the
country's main port; and Taiz, the principal southern trading city--had 1980
populations of 210,000, 120,000 and 110,000, respectively, and accounted for
more  than  80%  of  the  total  1980  urban  population.   The  most  striking
demographic characteristic of YAR, however, is the large proportion of the
labor force working abroad, which had approached one-fifth of the country's
total work force as early as 1975.
Administration
1.03     YAR is  divided  into  eleven  governorates,  each  administered  by  a
governor appointed by the President of  the Republic.   Fifteen major urban
areas are organized into municipal offices, which represent the Ministry of
Municipalities and Housing (MMH) at the local levels of government.  They are
headed by "directors general" who are administratively under the governor.
1/   For further details on sectoral background, see Yemen Arab Republic-
Urban Sector Report (No. 2699-YAR, March 1981).
2/   Urban defined here as communities of over 10,000 population.



- 2 -
1.04     At the national level, responsibility for managing urban development
is shared among the Central Planning Organization (CPO), the MMH, the Ministry
of Power, Water, and Sewerage (MPWS), and the Ministry of Public Works (MPW).
At the local level, these responsibilities are vested in the municipalities.
The latter, however, depend almost entirely on the Central Government for
funding  and  for  the  provision  of  most  urban  services,  including  the
maintenance   of   infrastructure   facilities.    This   highly   centralized
administrative structure is, moreover, seriously constrained by the shortage
of qualified personnel at all levels.
Infrastructure and Housing Conditions
1.05     The most striking feature of the urban setting in YAR is the lack of
infrastructure.   Although the development of infrastructure is now receiving
increasing attention, only about 40% of the urban population has access to
potable water.   Sewer systems in Hodeidah and Taiz are now in operation, and
contracts for the sewerage in Sana'a were tendered in early 1983.  The major
cities still lack adequately designed and surfaced vehicular and pedestrian
facilities.   Circulation  schemes,  traffic  signs  and  markings  are  almost
non-existent.   As a result,  most city centers  experience heavy and nearly
chaotic  traffic  conditions  and  congested  roads.   Garbage  collection  and
disposal is limited, and education and health services are still at an early
stage of development.
1.06     The provision of housing is seriously constrained by three factors.
Foremost amongst these is the absence of a formal land registration system.
The lack of cadastral surveys and of a modern ownership registry ias
substantially increased the uncertainty of tenure in rapidly expanding urban
areas.  There is often a proliferation of conflicting deeds for the same, or
overlapping, properties.  This situation has also undermined the establishment
of an effective real estate taxation system and the urban planning effort of
MMMH. Land development has, therefore, occurred in a very haphazard way,
complicating the task of providing infrastructure.
1.07     The second constraining factor lies in the high cost of housing due
primarily to the high cost of labor and materials, the low productivity of
local building contractors and the high demand for housing.  For example, the
cost of a typical house increased almost fourfold from about $180/M2 in 1975
to about $670/mz by mid-1978.  This continuous upward trend has been further
exacerbated by the widespread use of costly building materials, and wasteful
and expensive building  construction  techniques.   Rising housing  costs  have
siphoned off a significant proportion of the income of the urban population
and have made it increasingly difficult for the lowest income groups to obtain
access to housing.
1.08     Third, access to housing, again particularly for low-income groups,
has been further restrained by the absence of a well-developed housing finance
system.  The Housing Credit Bank (HCB) was established in 1978, and so far
about 1,000 households, mostly medium- to high-income, have benefitted from
its loans.  Low-income groups have had to rely on informal and hence costlier
sources of finance, mostly from absentee landlords working abroad, to obtain
access to housing or to rented accommodation.



- 3 -
1.09     YAR's urban problems are likely to be compounded in the future by the
expected  continued high rates of urban growth.   The institutional framework
for dealing with these urban problems is, however, limited as is the
availability of municipal revenues to finance and maintain existing and new
services, thus posing serious obstacles to development in the urban sector and
to improving the well-being of low-income groups.
B. Government Responses to Shelter Needs
1.10     Since  the  emergence  of  urban  issues  is  relatively  recent,  the
Government  of  YAR  has  just  started  developing  a  comprehensive  urban
development  policy.   Until  1979, much government  intervention  in the urban
sector had been on an ad hoc basis with various ministries and agencies being
involved in the preparation, promotion and implementation of urban related
schemes. In 1976, the MPW prepared master plans for the five major cities of
YAR. Although they constitute an appropriate framework for directing future
urban growth, these master plans propose standards that are not related to the
financial capacity of the urban institutions nor to their implementation
capacity.   Moreover,  the absence of adequate  laws  for land acquisition and
registration is hampering the implementation of the plans.
1.11     The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA), Sana'a University,
the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development (YBRD), and the First
Cooperative Housing Society, all have launched large housing programs with
mixed  success.   These  consist  mostly  of  clusters  of  4-5  storey  walk-up
apartments for a total number of about 5,300 units, of which about 50% are now
completed.   These  programs  have  been  plagued  with  poor  infrastructure
planning,  implementation delays and cost overruns.   The cost of these units
exceed  YRls  250,000  (US$55,000)  and  is  affordable  only  by  medium-  to
high-income families.
1.12     Concerned  at  the  lack  of  coordination  between  the  activities  of
various ministries and agencies, the Government decided in 1979 to vest all
authority  regarding  urban  development  including  housing  in  the  MMH.   The
Ministry has therefore become the focal point for all government decisions in
the field of urban development.   Its capacity to implement urban policies anc
programs was strengthened first under the Sana'a Urban Development project
(para. 1.15) and will be further reinforced under the proposed project.
C. IDA Involvement and Strategy in the Sector
1.13     IDA's involvement in urban infrastructure began in 1974 with a credit
(Cr. 464-YAR) to help the Government finance the first public water supply
system in Sana'a and to strengthen the National Water and Sewerage Authority
(NWSA, established in 1973).  Since then, three additional credits have been
made to YAR's major urban centers in the water supply and sewerage sector.
IDA also played a significant role in the establishment in 1975 of the Yemen
General Electricity Corporation (YGEC), which has already received three IDA
credits.   IDA involvement in the urban sector was expanded in 1979 when the
Government requested assistance to carry out a sector review to identify major
urban development issues. The review concluded inter alia that:



- 4 -
(a) Government urban development programs should be directed towards
the development of urban land rather than the delivery of
housing units, which is best left to private initiative;
(b) Government programs should be targeted to the lowest income
groups;
(c) Government should sponsor specific programs to strengthen the
capabilities of local building contractors and encourage the use
of low-cost building materials and construction techniques; and
(d)  the  above  activities  would  require  the  development  of  an
institutional capacity to define and implement appropriate urban
development  policies,  rules  and  regulations;  to  acquire  and
register land; and to implement integrated urban development
projects.
1.14     The  findings  of  this  review,  which  was  completed  in  December
1980,-L`' were thoroughly discussed with the Yemeni authorities.   In addition,
a review of the construction industry was initiated in 1980, under the
UNIDO/World Bank cooperative program.
1.15     Both reviews formed the basis of the first IDA-assisted Sana'a Urban
Development Project, which was approved in February 1982 (Credit No.
1202-YAR).  This project is a demonstration project whose main objective is to
assist Government in addressing the major policy issues identified during -tbe
urban sector review.  Project components include:  (i) Infrastructure UpgrldirLg
and Sites and Services to assist Government in focusing its intervention on
the cost effective development of land and on the provision of infrastructure
in low-income settlements; (ii) a Pilot Shelter and Housing Finance Scheme
designed to reduce the cost of housing and to provide access to mortgage
financing for low-income groups; and (iii) Institutional Development to
provide MMH with the capacity to execute and expand the above programs,
including a land registration program.
1.16     The implementation of the first project is proceeding well.  The two
major infrastructure contracts for upgrading and sites and services,
representing about 40% of total project cost, were awarded in February 1983
and  construction  works  are  proceeding  on  schedule.   Contracts  for  the
construction of demonstration houses  will be  let  in January 1984 and plot
sales in the sites and services are expected to start in December 1984.   Key
technical assistance positions have been filled and counterpart staff has been
recruited.  The framework for a new land registration system has already been
established by the Survey Department of the MPW.  This is now being expanded
through the collaboration of the MPW with MMH and technical assistance
provided under the project and could serve as the basis for the eventual
introduction of a municipal property tax system.

1.17     Discussions on the Urban Sector Report and the preparation of the
First Urban Development Project have been instrumental in creating the
Ministry of Municipalities and Housing and initiating with it the dialogue on
major policy issues such as design standards, land registration, cost recovery
and housing finance.   Under the first project, the design standards formerly
applied for civil works were modified to make the improvements and sites and
services affordable to the target population.  These have proven adequate and
acceptable to both beneficiaries and government agencies in charge and will be
replicated in future projects.  In view of the current economic situation and
the need to mobilize resources, the principle of cost recovery has received
much wider acceptance and the Government is giving serious consideration to
the establishment of a country-wide municipal property tax system, the
framework of which would be studied under the proposed project.  An expert on
housing finance is expected to join the Housing Credit Bank soon and will
advise on setting up a viable housing finance system.  IDA will continue to
assist the Government in addressing these issues through the implementation
process.
1.18     In view  of  the progress  made under  the first urban project,  the
Government now intends to further strengthen MMH's capacity to direct and
control urban growth and to expand its activities to other cities in YAR.
This  policy  is  consistent  with  IDA's  lending  strategy,  particularly  with
respect to institutional development, including improved planning, project
preparation,   execution,   maintenance   and   operation.    IDA's   continuous
participation  in urban  development  would  therefore  help  foster Government
development  plans  in  the  sector.   The  proposed  second  urban  development
project would be located in Hodeidah, the second largest city in YAR and its
main port and industrial center.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Genesis of the Project
2.01     During pre-appraisal of the Sana'a Urban Development Project in April
1981, the Government decided that the upgrading and sites and services com-
ponents  originally  proposed  for  Hodeidah  should  be  dropped  because  of
insufficient preparation and financing constraints.  It was, however, agreed
at that time that these components could constitute the core of a second urban
project.  Hodeidah was retained for three main reasons:   (i) it has continued
to be the fastest growing city in YAR, (ii) it contains the largest squatter
settlements in the country, and (iii) its urban management structure is weakly
developed compared with that of the capital, Sana'a, and that of the tradi-
tional trading city of Taiz.  In December 1982, an IDA mission visited YAR to
resume discussions  on  the  proposed  project.   Preparation  work  started  in
January 1983 and  the project was  appraised  in May  1983.   The Ministry of
Municipalities and Housing prepared the project through its Urban Development
Project Unit (UDPU), which had been set up under the first project, without
resorting to consulting firms; it constitutes a significant achievement of the
institution-building effort made under the first project.

B. Objectives
2.02     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(i)   to  further  strengthen  MMH's  capacity  to  plan,  design  and
execute  integrated  urban  development  projects  at  the  local
level; and
(ii)  to provide affordable infrastructure services to the lower-
income  segment  of  the  population  at  minimum  cost  to  the
Government.
C. Main Features
The Project City: Hodeidah
2.03     Hodeidah, the second largest city of the YAR, is the main port and
principal industrial city of the country.   Because of its strategic coastal
location, enhanced port facilities and transportation links, Hodeidah has
received a significant portion of national investment during the past decade.
It has experienced considerable economic growth, partly as a result of its
locational advantage and partly because of the overall pace of development in
the YAR stimulated by remittances from Yemenis working abroad.  The dominance
of HocLeidah in the national economy is clear.  It accounts for about a quarter
of   the  nation's   non-agricultural   activity.    Almost   60%  of  economic
establishments with ten or more employees were located in Hodeidah in 1975.
About 50% of the loans granted by the YBRD have benefitted enterprises located
in the city.
2.04     Hodeidah's population has grown at about  8% per annum from 83,000
inhab-Ltants in 1975 to about 120,000 inhabitants in 1980.  Most of this growth
is accounted for by rural migrants in search of job opportunities.   This has
resulted in the very rapid development of unserviced low-density squatter
settlements located at the fringe of the city which now account for about 35%
of  the  housing  stock  in  Hodeidah.   A water  supply  and  sewerage  project
covering mainly the core of the city, and partly financed by IDA (Cr. 559-YAR)
was completed in December 1982.  Nonetheless, municipal authorities have not
been able to keep pace with the development of squatter settlements and to
provide urban services and serviced  land to low-income  people.   Under  the
project, the area of Ghuleil, one of the largest settlements in Hodeidah, will
be upgraded and sites and services will be provided to address the needs of
the growing low-income population.
The Project Area: Ghuleil
2.05     Ghuleil is a sandy area of about 250 hectares  in the southeastern
section of Hodeidah, with a population of some 13,000 low-income persons
living on roughly 65 hectares.  It follows a rectangular, geometrical pattern,
gently sloping from east to west.   Population density is highest along the
main access--Jamal Street--and decreases towards the east with vacant areas
suitable for infill plots and community facilities.  About 25% of the houses
are built with concrete blocks and the remainder of salvaged materials or



thatched huts.   Some 45% of the resident population have incomes below the
1980 Bank-defined absolute poverty threshold of YRls 1,650 per household per
month.
2.06     All access  tracks and alleys within the area are unpaved and have
sand running surfaces.  The majority of the residents presently obtain their
drinking water from private vendors at a cost about three times higher than
that charged by NWSA. Newly installed 300 and 200 mm diameter water mains are
located in Jamal Street.  Waste water is disposed of in unused shallow wells
or directly into the ground; a few households have pit latrines.  A sewer line
installed under the Hodeidah water and sewerage project runs along Jamal
Street and a 500 mm diameter spur has been constructed a little way into the
site.   The YGEC has installed a limited number of low-voltage lines in the
area but most households supplied with electricity rely on private generators.
There  is no street lighting.   In the absence of a solid waste collection
service, streets and alleys are littered with garbage, a significant health
hazard.
Project Components
2.07     A detailed description of the components is given in Annex 1 and is
summarized in the following paragraphs:
(a)  Physical component.  The main objective of this component is to
further assist MMH in focusing its intervention on the cost
effective  development  of  land  and  on  the  provision   of
infrastructure to low-income groups. It includes:
(i) Preparation of a general layout and preliminary design
of the Ghuleil area with a view to integrating it
within the existing master plan of Hodeidah;
(ii)  Upgrading  of  the  existing  built-up  area  (65  ha)
benefitting  some  13,000  inhabitants   (25%  of   the
population of Hodeidah presently living in unserviced
areas) and including reblocking and plot subdivision as
appropriate; and
(iii) Development of about 1,650 infill and serviced plots on
vacant land (40 ha) to accommodate future urban growth
for low-income groups (incomes between the 15th and
50th percentile of the income distribution curve).
About 100 plots would be reserved for rehousing
families  displaced because  of upgrading  works.   Plot
2
sizes would range from 100 to 150 m
(b)  Institutional  Development  Component.    In  order  to  further
strengthen  MMH's  capacity  to  prepare,   execute  and  expand
integrated urban development schemes, consultancy and advisory
services would be provided to MMH for the following purposes:



- 8 -
(i)  Execution and Management:   The project  would  finance
two engineers and one accountant for 44 man-months
each, and one architect/planner and one socio-economist
for 24 man-months each.  This staff would be attached
to the UDPU.
(ii)  Strengthening  the Municipal Office  in  Hodeidah.   One
expatriate municipal engineer would be assigned for 24
months to the Municipal Office in Hodeidah to help
reinforce its implementation and maintenance capacity.
(iii)  Preparation  of  a  study  on  cost  recovery  of  urban
services.   Twelve  man-months  of  consultant  services
would be provided to assist MMH in preparing a study
aiming at the establishment of fees and taxes to
maintain and finance existing and new urban services.
During negotiations, the terms of reference for the
cost   recovery   study   were   reviewed   and   found
satisfactory to IDA; Assurances were obtained that the
timing  and  arrangements   for  the   study  will  be
satisfactory to IDA.  Assurances were also obtained at
negotiations that, following completion of the study,
the Government will exchange views with IDA and on a
plan to implement agreed recommendations.
(iv)  Training  and  Preparation  of  Future  Projects.   Funds
(US$50,000) would be earmarked for overseas training
and fellowships for the local staff of the UDPU in the
field of urban planning,  engineering and procurement.
In addition, on-the-job training is being provided by
the expatriate staff of the UDPU during the preparation
of the project and further training would be provided
during  project  implementation  (Annex  I,  Para.  19).
US$500,000 would also be included for financing the
preparation  of  a  possible  third  urban  development
project.
2.08     The combination of both sites and services and upgrading on the same
site would allow an increase in the present density of 100 persons/ha to about
225  persons/ha  so  as  to  make  effective  use  of  infrastructure.   Major
improvements would include the provision of roads and footpaths, water supply
and sewerage including private connections, electricity and street lighting.
Project beneficiaries, selected as described in para. 4.06 below, would be
given land title through the land registration program being implemented under
the First Urban Project.   Land would be reserved  for social and community
facilities.   Although financing for construction of dwellings is not included
under the project, UDPU would provide technical advice and architectural plans
to assist beneficiaries in construction on the plots.  The Municipal office in
Hodeidah  carries  out  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal,   which   is
strengthened by a project funded by the Netherlands government.   Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the Municipal office in Hodeidah will
operate and maintain a solid waste collection scheme in Ghuleil by December
31, 1985.



III. PROJECT COSTS, EXECUTION AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
3.01     Total project costs, including contingencies (government projects are
exempt from taxes and duties) is estimated at YR 82.3 million (US$17.9
million) with a foreign exchange component of YR 50.1 million (US$10.9
million) or about 61% of project costs.  Summary cost estimates are given in
Table 3.1 and detailed cost estimates are shown in Annex 2.  Baseline costs
are in December 1983 prices. Cost estimates are based on:
(a)  preliminary engineering design for the whole project  area and
detailed engineering design for an area of about 40 ha.
(b)  unit   costs   from   tenders   recently   received   for   similar
infrastructure works financed under the first urban project in
Sana'a; and
(c)  prices obtained from the MPW, MMH, NWSA and YGEC.
3.02     Consultant  services  to  be  provided  under  the  project  amount  to
US$2.49 million (Annex 2, Table 3) including (a) US$1.62 million for project
management and execution; (b) US$0.20 million for strengthening municipal
services in Hodeidah; (c) US$0.12 million for carrying out a study on cost
recovery for urban services; and (d) US$0.55 million for training and
preparation of a future project.   The average man-month cost of expatria:e
consultants, including salary, international travel, transportation and
subsistence is estimated at about US$7,000 for long-term contracts and at
US$10,000 for short-term consultants in line with recent experience in YAR.
3.03     Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% of infrastructure
costs for upgrading and sites and services.   Price  contingencies  take  into
account the projected implementation schedule and likely increase in services,
construction costs, materials, and equipment during the execution of the
project.   Price contingencies for local costs have been estimated at 15% for
1984, 12% for 1985 and 10% per annum thereafter.  These increases are based on
an analysis of recent civil works contract price increases and are consistent
with those used for  IDA  supported  projects  in  YAR.   Price  increases  for
foreign costs have been estimated at 7.5% in 1984, 7.0% in 1985 and 6.0% per
annum  thereafter.    These   increases   follow  guideline   rates.    Physical
contingencies amount to 7.6% of the base cost estimate and price contingencies
amount to 22.6% of baseline costs plus physical contingencies; total
contingencies represent 31.9% of base costs and 24.2% of total project costs.
B. Financing
3.04     The proposed  IDA credit  of US$12.0 million would  finance  (i)  the
entire foreign exchange cost (US$10.91 million) of the project, (ii) the local
cost (US$0.24 million) of the technical assistance component, and (iii) about

15% of the local cost (US$0.85) of the infrastructure works component.   The
balance of the project cost (US$5.89 million ) would be financed by the
Government. The project financing plan is as follows:
YRls Million Equivalent         US$ Million Equivalent
Source of Finance        Local  Foreign   Total          Local   Foreign    Total
Government of YAR          27.08    -       27.08         5.89     -          5.89

3.05     The IDA credit would be made to the YAR Government under standard IDA
terms and conditions.  The Government would take the foreign exchange risk and
would make available all project funds (IDA and counterpart funds) as a grant
to its Ministry of Municipalities and Housing to finance project expenditures.
No co-financing is included under the project.
3.06     Counterpart funds needed to finance  project  expenditures would not
exceed YRls 10.5 million in any one year (Table 4.1).  However, lags between
payments to contractors and disbursements by IDA would create a maximum
funding need of about YRls 14.1 million in 1987.
C. Execution and Maintenance
3.07     In order  to expedite  project execution,  the implementation of the
physical component has been divided into two phases.   Final detailed design
and conditions of tender for the first phase of the works consisting of
upgrading and provision of sites and services on 40 ha and preliminary designs
for the infrastructure works of Phase II of the project on the remaining 65 ha
were submitted to IDA for review during negotiations and were found
satisfactory to IDA.  Tenders for the first phase would be invited by March
1984  and  works  are  expected  to  commence  by  January  1985.   The  expected
completion date for all project works and the technical assistance program is
March 31, 1988, with an additional twelve month period to allow for completion
of payments and full withdrawal  of  the credit  proceeds.   The closing date
would be March 31,  1989.   The project  implementation  schedule  is shown  in
Annex 3.
3.08     Table 3.2 shows the agencies that would be responsible for project
implementation, operation and maintenance.  The Housing Department within MMH
would be the executing agency with overall project responsibility (See Chapter
V). All contracts (civil works, equipment and advisory services) would be let
by  MMH  and  supervised  by  MMH  in  collaboration  with  NWSA  and  YGEC  when
warranted.   After project  completion,  the infrastructure networks would  be
handed over as an equity contribution to NWSA for water supply and sewerage,
and to YGEC for power.  These agencies would be responsible for operation and



- 12 -
maintenance  out  of  their  own  resources.   Maintenance  activities  of  MMH
including roads, solid waste collection and street lighting would be directly
carried out by its municipal office in Hodeidah.  In order to strengthen the
municipal services, a municipal engineer would be financed under the project
(para. 2.07-b-ii).   NWSA and YGEC would provide each a qualified engineer to
the UDPU to check and inspect the construction of the infrastructure networks
in  the project  area.   The cost of  these engineers would be borne by the
project.   Agreements  between  MMH  and  NWSA,  and  MMH  and  YGEC  on  the
administrative arrangements for (i) providing technical supervision during
project  execution,  and  (ii)  operating  and  maintaining   the  respective
infrastructure provided under the project were submitted to IDA for review
during negotiations  and  were  found  satisfactory  to  IDA.   Assurances  were
obtained at negotiations that the agreements would be maintained for the life
of the project.

Procurement
3.09     Civil  works  for  the  combined  upgrading  and  sites  and  services
component of the project, amounting to YRls 64.1 million (US$13.9 million) and
consisting of roads, footpaths, water supply, sewers, electricity and street
lighting, as well as preparation and servicing of new plots would be procured
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with guidelines
for  procurement  under  IDA  credits.   These  would  be  procured  through  a
prequalified general contractor for both contracts (Phases I and II), or one
for each contract. Water supply, sewerage and electrical subcontractors would
have qualifications acceptable to NWSA and YGEC, respectively.



- 13 -
3.10     Goods and equipment financed under the project and amounting to YRls
552,000 (US$120,000) would be procured through solicitation of at least three
price quotes.
3.11     Consultant services amounting to YRls 11.5 million (US$2.5 million)
would be procured by MMH which would employ consultants with qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA.
Disbursement
3.12     Disbursement from the IDA credit proceeds would be made as follows:
(i)   67% of total expenditures for civil works.
(ii)  100%  of  foreign  expenditures,  100%  of  local  expenditures
ex-factory and 70% of other local expenditures for goods and
equipment; and
(iii) 100% of total expenditures for technical assistance.
3.13     The estimated disbursement schedule based on the estimated schedule
of expenditures is shown in Table 3.3.  It is also based on the disbursement
schedule of the first project which is proceeding on target.  This is about a
year less than the profile for projects with heavy civil work components and
is justified on the basis of MMH performance under the first project.
3.14     A provision of four months for credit effectiveness and a provision
of six months for processing of credit withdrawal applications have been
included.  Disbursements will be fully documented.  Any undisbursed balance at
the completion of the project would be cancelled.

E. Accounts and Audit
3.15     Accounting standards within MMH are not yet suited to the financial
monitoring of the project.  To remedy this, MMH will keep separate accounts of
all project-related financial transactions.   The project accounts would also
include all operations related to the proposed revolving fund (para. 4.11).
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.   Separate  project
accounts will be kept by the expatriate financial analyst provided under the
project  who  will  train  a  Yemeni  counterpart.   An  independent  auditor
satisfactory to IDA would audit the project accounts which would be submitted
to IDA through the UDPU not later than six months after the close  of each
financial year. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.16     The execution of a combined upgrading and sites and services scheme
in one large area will require close monitoring to ensure proper implementa-
tion and to evaluate the impact upon project beneficiaries.   Monitoring and
evaluation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  UDPU  which  will  prepare
semi-annual progress reports for submission to IDA not later than two months
after the end of each semester.   Semi-annual progress reports would include
the financial status of the project and key indicators to measure the progress
in  meeting  project  objectives.   Key  indicators  will  include  inter  alia,
subdivision and sale of plots, profile of plot beneficiaries and cost recovery
impact, and infrastructure maintenance performance.  Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations.
G. Supervision
3.17     IDA supervision of the project would require some 60 man-weeks over
the four-year period of project implementation.  Supervision efforts would be
concentrated in the first two years to facilitate timely execution of the
project  components.   The  staff  needed  for  supervision  would  include  an
engineer, an architect/planner and a financial analyst.
IV. COST RECOVERY, FINANCIAL TERMS, AFFORDABILITY
AND REPLICABILITY
A. Cost Recovery Principles
4.01     About  84%  of  total  project  costs would be directly recovered  in
nominal terms under the project from beneficiaries through monthly improvement
charges  (70%)  and  direct  sales  (14%).   Of  the  16%  of project  costs not
directly recovered from project beneficiaries, 1% would be recovered through
NWSA's current tariff structure (which has been negotiated with IDA), and 15%
would be charged to the Government budget.
4.02     Project costs fully recovered through improvement charges and direct
sales would include site preparation, demolitions, plot demarcation, on-site
infrastructure, design and supervision, project administration as well as a
provision for default and NWSA collection fee (para. 5.08).



- 15 -
4.03     Project  costs  not  directly  recoverable  from  beneficiaries  but
recovered through tariffs would include the cost of off-site water supply and
sewerage.   Other  expenditures  not  recovered  would  include  (a)  off-site
electricity which is underwritten by the Government (b) technical assistance
(except that related to design and supervision); (c) short-term training; (d)
special advisory services; and (e) equipment and office supplies.
4.04     Pricing arrangements in the project area would aim at ensuring (a)
effective cost recovery, and (b) affordability by the existing and intended
low-income  population.   Plots  would  be  differentially  priced  to  reflect
location, accessibility and related levels of services, plots on paved roads
bearing a greater share of the infrastructure.  The cost of land estimated at
market value would also be charged to project beneficiaries.   Land reserved
for community facilities would be transferred to the appropriate ministry at
development cost whereas land for commercial development would be sold at
market value.   Assurances were  obtained at negotiations that the terms and
conditions for cost recovery from beneficiaries and for pricing of plots would
be as above.
B. Financial Terms and Conditions for Beneficiaries
4.05     Improvement  costs  in  the  project  area  would  be  recovered  from
beneficiaries  at an interest  rate of 11% over  a  period  of  20  years.   A
downpayment of 10% would be required for all residential plots in the project
area. Project beneficiaries would also be given the option of acquiring their
plots for cash or of repaying the improvement costs within a shorter period of
time.  The above on-lending rate of 11% for residential land is similar  to
that applied under Urban I and is in line with those discussed between the YAR
Government and IDA for specialized institutions.  This rate would be positive
in real terms compared to the projected rate of inflation of 10% from 1984 to
1986.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the financial terms and
conditions to project beneficiaries would be as above.
C. Beneficiary Selection
4.06     For new serviced sites to be provided on vacant land in the project
area, a Selection Committee chaired by the Governor of Hodeidah or his
designated  representative would be established  (para 5.07).  This committee
would be responsible for the preparation of an initial beneficiary list.
Final selection would be made on the following basis:  First priority would be
given to beneficiaries whose dwellings would have to be demolished because of
upgrading infrastructure works or who are presently tenants; second priority
would be given to households presently living in similar squatter settlements
in Hodeidah whose 1983 monthly income is no more than YRls 2,000 in 1983
prices.  In the event that demand outstrips supply, qualified applicants would
be chosen by lottery.  Criteria and procedures for selection of beneficiaries
were reviewed at negotiations and are satisfactory to IDA.



- 16 -
D. Cost Recovery Arrangements
4.07     Cost  recovery  arrangements  would  be  as  follows.   On  assuming
possession of their plots, prospective owners would enter into an agreement
with M4H under which they would be given a leasehold on their plots.  Upon
full repayment of the improvement costs, beneficiaries would be given a
freehold  title.   Beneficiaries would not be allowed to resell  their plots
(except through MMH) until at least five years from the date of obtaining the
leasehold on their plots.  Monthly payments would be applied to the purchase
price which would be established at the time the agreement is entered into.
In cases of default on payments for three consecutive months, plot holders
would be given three months' notice, then MMH would apply existing legal
remedies to recover payments, cancel the agreement and eventually evict the
beneficiary.   Beneficiaries  would  be  required  to  use  the  land  for  the
construction of a dwelling and to start construction within one year of plot
delivery.   Repayments from beneficiaries are expected to start  in September
1985.  Collection of improvement charges would be carried out by NWSA staff
according to the procedures described in para. 5.08.  Terms and conditions for
cost   recovery  and  arrangements   for  collection  of  payments  would  be
incorporated in the land allocation contracts between MMH and the project
benef-iciaries.  Draft land allocation contracts were reviewed at negotiations
and are satisfactory to IDA.
E. Affordability and Urban Poverty
Affordability
4.08     The income distribution and the household expenditures of prospective
beneficiaries in the project area were derived from surveys carried out by MMH
consultants in 1981 and subsequently updated by the UDPU in 1983.   They form
the basis  for the affordability analysis.   These surveys show that shelter
accounts for 30 to 35% of the total budgets of households.  About 15 to 20% is
spent on current housing expenditures (rent, utilities, etc.); the balance of
15% is available for investment and improvement of dwellings.  On the basis of
household expenditures of about 15% of income, the cost of improvement
including  monthly  utility  payments  for  the  minimum  plot  option  (100  m2)
would be affordable by more than 95% of the beneficiaries of both upgrading
and sites and services.   Plot options,  improvement  charges  and percentiles
reached are indicated in Annex 5.
Urban Poverty Impact
4.09     The project would address the needs of the poorest segments of the
population in Hodeidah who have presently little access to serviced land.  At
present, about 35% of households in Hodeidah have incomes below the 1980
Bank-defined absolute urban poverty threshold of YRls  1,650  per family per
month..  It is estimated that 11,040 people falling into this category would
directly benefit from the project, representing 23% of the urban poor in
Hodeidah.   Of  the  total  project  cost  of  US$17.9 million,  49% or US$8.77
million is attributable to the urban poverty group.  (See Annex 5).

F. Replicability
4.10     Financial  replicability  of  the  combined  upgrading  and  sites  and
services scheme is feasible for virtually all families presently living in low
density  squatter  settlements  in  Hodeidah  (about  35%  of  Hodeidah  1982
population).   Design features  of  the proposed scheme are easily replicable
since most of the land in Hodeidah belongs to the Government.
4.11     The  cost  recovery  arrangements  discussed  above  would   provide
Government with a steady inflow of recovered funds as shown in the cash flow
of MMI related operations (Table 4.1). All directly recovered funds would (a)
accrue to the revolving fund to be administered by MMH and being set up within
the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) under the first project; and (b) be made
available to underwrite similar future operations in the urban sector.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
4.12     The above financial arrangements combined with the strengthening of
MMHi would further enhance the capacity of the Ministry to implement an
expanded and self-supporting urban development program.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01     One of the main objectives of  the proposed project is to further
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing to
prepare, plan and execute low-income urban development programs in YAR.   To
achieve  this  objective,  MMH  would  be  responsible  for  overall  project
execution,l/  through  the  UDPU.   This  arrangement  represents  a  further
opportunity to build up the planning and executing capacity of this department
which is already in charge of executing the first project in Sana'a.
5.02     The UDPU is currently headed by an expatriate project manager and
consists  of  eight  expatriate  staff,  three  of  them  (1  chief  engineer,  1
architect/planner, and 1 engineer) recruited in May 1983 for preparation of
final design and supervision of execution of the proposed project, and eight
local  staff  (engineers, surveyors).   To implement the proposed project,  the
staff of  the UDPU would be further strengthened  through the  provision  or
technical assistance (1 accountant and 1 socio-economist).  Each expert would
be assigned  local  counterpart  staff who would gradually  take over project
implementation  responsibility.   A  schedule  of  recruitment  of  key  project
implementation staff was agreed upon at negotiations and is shown in Annex 7.
5.03     Upon completion of tendering for major civil works for Phase  I, a
core team of UDPU personnel consisting of one chief engineer, one
implementation  engineer,  one  architect/planner,  one  accountant,  and  one
socio--economist with their counterparts and administrative staff would be
transferred to Hodeidah to implement the project.   Assurances  to this effect
were obtained at negotiations.
1/ Details on MMH and its Municipal office in Hodeidah are given in Annex 6.



- 19 -
5.04     In close consuLtation with the Director of the Department of Housing,
the Director General of the Municipal Office in Hodeidah and the Project
Manager of UDPU, the chief engineer for HIodeidah would be responsible for
directing all aspects  of the execution of the proposed project.  Under his
direction, the staff mentioned in para. 5.03 would inter alia:
(a)   prepare and supervise, in collaboration with the staff of NWSA
and YGEC when warranted, all infrastructure works including (i)
preparation of bidding documents; (ii) evaluation of bids and
recommendations   for   award;   and   (iii)   supervision   of
construction and procurement operations, and preparation of
procedures for the handing over of project components (para.
3.05).
(b)   prepare,   arrange   and   supervise   the   development   of   an
advertising campaign to make project beneficiaries aware of
sales of plots, and also provide technical advice to individual
home builders; and
(c)   monitor all physical,  financial and administrative aspects of
the project including (i) establishment of separate project
accounts (para. 3.15); (ii) submission of plans, documents,
progress reports and other materials for review and clearance
(para. 3.16; and (iii) organization, coordination and control
of any program necessary for staff training and development.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the duties and responsibilities
of the UDPU implementation staff in Hodeidah will be as above.
5.05     Upon completion of the project, the UDPU staff in Hodeidah would be
transferred back to Sana'a.  Those staff whose expertise is not required for
execution would be either released or assigned to the preparation of new
projects for which funds have been earmarked (para. 2.07).  These arrangements
would allow for the experience gained under the first and second projects to
trickle down to other cities in YAR.
5.06     To assist  the  Municipal  office  in  Hodeidah  in  strengthening  its
implementation and maintenance capacity, MMH would make available a municipal
engineering expert for a period of two years, starting in January 1985.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the municipal engineering expert
will start his assignment not later than January 1, 1985, for a period of two
years and that his duties and responsibilities will be as indicated in Annex
7, para. 7.
5.07     A  selection  committee  to  select  project  beneficiaries  would  be
established (para. 4.06).  This committee would be chaired by the Governor of
Hodeidah or his designated representative and would include inter alia
representatives of MMH, the Municipal Council in Hodeidah, CPO, and MLSA.
Each agency represented on the selection committee would make available to the
Governor of Hodeidah an appropriate number of staff to process beneficiary



- 20 -
applications.   During negotiations,  the Government provided assurances  that
(i) the selection committee will be set up not later than six months before
the completion of infrastructure works  of Phase  I; and  (ii)  the  staffing
arrangements for processing beneficiary applications will be as mentioned
above.
5.08     As  under  the  first  project,  MMH  has  entrusted  NWSA  with  the
collection  of  improvement  charges.   NWSA was again selected as collecting
agency since all project beneficiaries, being eventually connected to water
and sewerage, would have to deal with NWSA.  Moreover, the selection of any
other agency to collect improvement charges would have required the setting up
of a collection unit within this agency and entailed problems regarding
staffing, particularly in a situation of scarce skilled manpower.  NWSA has
the administrative and staff capacity to collect such charges at minimum
additional cost.  NWSA will  therefore  collect  the improvement  charge along
with the water bill.  It will keep 3% of the collection proceeds to meet its
collection costs, and remit the balance to MMH.  MMH will be responsible for
enforcing the payment of such charges and for accountability.   An agreement
between MMH and NWSA on the procedures and administrative arrangements for the
collection of improvement charges was submitted to IDA for review during
negotiations  and  is  satisfactory  to  IDA.   Assurances  were  obtained  at
negotiations that this agreement would be maintained for the life of the
project.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. General
6.01     The  project's  fundamental  objective  is  to  further  strengthen  the
MMH's capacity to plan, prepare, and execute low-cost urban development
schemes with a view to replicating them in the long run.  The preparation of
the proposed project directly by MMH itself is an encouraging step in this
direction.
6.02     The project would continue to help government focus on resolving key
bottlenecks in the urban sector while making full use of private initiative.
Of particular importance in this respect are (a) the combined development of
the existing built-up area and of the vacant land in Ghuleil so as to ensure
an efficient use of infrastructure, and (b) the study on cost recovery for
urban services.  The project is financially sound.   Some 84% of the project
cost in nominal terms would be directly recovered and recovered funds would be
used by MMH to promote similar schemes in other areas.
B. Economic Evaluation
6.03     The economic appraisal of the project is based on sale of serviced
land as the benefit stream and the related investment and operating costs as
the cost stream.  The analysis covers about 80% of project costs.  The results
are summarized below and detailed in Annex 8.



- 21 -
6.04     Most benefits of the project are captured in the value of serviced
land   in  Ghuleil,   and  include  infrastructure  services  and  access   to
commercial/industrial and community facilities.  Land prices in Hodeidah vary
from YRls 5-10 per m2 for agricultural land to YRls 200-250 per m2 in the
city center. Under the project, base line values for land are set at YRls 100
to  YRls  150/m2  for  residential  land  according  to  location  and  type  of
access, and YRls 200/mZ for commercial/industrial land.
6.05     Costs  included  in the analysis  are  (a) land and site  works,  (b)
on-site   infrastructure   including   individual   connections,   (c)  physical
contingencies, (d) project administration, design and supervision, and (e)
operation and maintenance expenses estimated at 4% of investment costs.  These
costs include no taxes or transfers and the technical assistance component has
been excluded due to difficulties in quantifying the benefits.
6.06     On the ba'fis of the above estimates where cost and benefit streams
are expressed in end 1983 prices, the rate of return on the project is 25%.
This rate of return to urban fringe development reflects the rapid rise in the
demand for serviced urban land in the absence of serviced land supplied in a
systematic and coordinated fashion.  The sensitivity tests (Annex 9, Table 2)
show that under any reasonable set of assumptions, the rate of return would
remain above the opportunity cost of capital, estimated at 10%.
C. Project Risks
6.07     Project risks are minimized by two factors.   First,  the project is
basically a replication and extension of the first project and builds on its
satisfactory  implementation.   Second,  the  design  of  the  project  has been
deliberately kept simple and specifically tailored to the implementation
capacity of MMH.
6.08     There are, nevertheless, risks, although it should be emphasized they
are largely of a "country" nature given the economic, social and institut. -al
environment in YAR, and not exclusively project related.  Specifically, tLare
are two areas of potential concern:
(i) The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing is still new and
is gradually building up its planning and implementation
capacity.   MMH  has  already  demonstrated  its  ability  to
recruit qualified expatriate and local staff.  It, however,
still faces the challenge of being able to retain competent
local  staff  on  a  long-term  basis.   Under  the  proposed
project, extensive use of technical assistance will still be
needed in the early years of project implementation and
local staff training will be a regular function of the
expatriate staff.
(ii)   Cost recovery is politically sensitive and will require a
continued  strong  government  commitment.   Under  the  first
urban project the UDPU is about to undertake an advertizing



- 22 -
campaign to sensitize project beneficiaries to cost recovery
but experience in this matter is still limited.  Under the
proposed project, improvement charges have been tailored to
the beneficiaries' financial ability to pay and will not
constitute an undue financial burden on them compared with
their current expenditures for urban services.
VII. ASSURANCES OBTAINED AT NEGOTIATIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following points:
(i) The timing and arrangements of the study on cost recovery of
urban services will be satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.07),
and, following completion of the study, the Government will
exchange views with IDA and agree on a plan to implement
agreed recommendations
(ii) The Municipal office in Hodeidah will operate and maintain a
solid waste collection scheme in Ghuleil by December 31,
1985 (para. 2.08);
(iii)  The agreements between MMH and MWSA, and MMH and YGEC on the
administrative arrangements for (a) providing technical
supervision during project execution, and (b) operating and
maintaining the relevant infrastructure provided under the
project will be maintained throughout the life of the
project (para. 3.08);
(iv)  MMH  will  keep  separate  project  accounts  including  all
operations related to the revolving fund (para 3.15);
(v) The project accounts will be audited by an independent
auditor  satisfactory  to  IDA,  and  the  project  accounts
including the auditor's opinion will be submitted to IDA not
later than six months after the close of each financial year
(para. 3.15);
(vi) The Urban Development Project Unit will submit to IDA a
semi-annual progress report not later than two months after
the end of each semester (para. 3.16);



- 23 -
(vii) MMH terms and conditions for cost recovery from project
beneficiaries and for pricing of plots will be as described
in paras. 4.02 to 4.04, and interest rates charged by MMH to
project beneficiaries will be as stated in para. 4.05;
(viii)  Recovered funds from MMH's operations under the project will
(a) accrue to the revolving fund being set up under the
first project, and (b) be used exclusive'y for the financing
of similar urban schemes (para 4.11);
(ix) Key project implementation staff will be recruited according
to the schedule shown in Annex 7;
(x) Upon completion of tendering for major civil works for Phase
I, a core team of UDPU personnel consisting of one chief
engineer,      one       implementation       engineer,       one
architect/planner, one accountant and one socio-economist
with their respective counterparts and administrative staff
will be transferred to Hodeidah to implement the project
(para. 5.03);
(xi) Responsibilities and duties of the UDPU implementation staff
in Hodeidah and the expert municipal engineer will be as
mentioned in para. 5.04 and Annex 6, respectively;
(xii) The municipal engineer will start his assignment not later
than January 1, 1985, for a period of two years (para. 5.06);
(xiii) The selection committee will be set up not later than six
months before completion of infrastructure works of Phase I,
and the staffing arrangements for processing beneficiary
applications will be as mentioned in para. 5.07; and
(xiv)  The agreement signed between MMH and NWSA on the procedures
and administrative arrangements for the collection of
improvement charges (para. 5.08) will be maintained for the
life of the project.
7.02     With the above assurances received, the project is suitable for an
IDA credit of US$12 million to the Government of the Yemen Arab Republic.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Upgrading and Sites and Services
Introduction
1.       The project area has a relatively regular, rectangular shape.  It is
bounded to the north and west by two major paved roads, the Airport Road and
Jamal Street, respectively.  The southern and eastern edges will be bounded by
the future Ring Road proposed in the Hodeidah Master Plan.  Newly installed
300 mm and 200 mm diameter water mains located in Jamal Street have ample
capacity to serve the immediate needs of the population of Al-Ghuleil.
Similarly, a newly installed sewer main along Jamal Street, with a 500 mm spur
into the site near its southwestern corner is sufficient to evacuate the
sanitary wastes.  The HV network of the Yemen General Electricity Corporation
has sufficient power to provide the area with electricity and street lighting,
and the existing sewage treatment plant has sufficient capacity to carry the
additional load.
2.       To ensure  suitable  access  to the  site  and  provide  the  necessary
utility services, it will be necessary to carry out certain "off-site" works,
serving neighboring areas.  Such works will be financed through the project,
but only half the cost will be charged to project beneficiaries, the rest
being borne by the relevant national  and municipal  agencies.   They  include
primary vehicular roads, water supply, sewerage, electricity and street
lighting.   They also include high-voltage cables  that will be necessary  to
bring power from the HV grid to the site.
3.       The level of service that would be provided by the infrastrucutre is
in compliance with the following:
- Affordability by the target group of beneficiaries.
- Minimum standards that are essential in terms of public health,
access to emergency and service vehicles, and safety.
- Compatibility with the standards of service provided in similar
areas of Hodeidah and by similar projects in the Yemen Arab
Republic.
Road Network
4.       The road network has been designed to secure:
- easy vehicular access to within 75 meters of any plot, and
- easy pedestrian access to any plot.



- 25 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 5
5.       Roads will be divided into paved, primary vehicular roads, improved
secondary vehicular roads and unpaved pedestrian ways.  The paved roads will
themselves be divided into two types:
-  Type I with a 15-meter R.O.W. and a 7 m paved roadway, built up
with a 200 mm sub-base, 200 mm base, 50 mm asphalt base course and
25mm asphalt wearing course.
-  Type II with a 12-meter R.O.W. and a 6 m paved roadway, built up
with a 200 mm base course and a 50 mm asphalt surface.
Secondary access roads and pedestrian ways will be formed of the in-situ
material.
6.       Four categories of vehicular access ways will be provided:
- 2,300 meters of Type I primary local roads.
- 6,800 meters of Type II primary local roads.
- 10,100 meters of secondary access roads with a R.O.W. of 8 meters.
- 14,000 meters of secondary access roads with a R.O.W. of 6 meters.
7.       In addition to the above vehicular roads, 18,000 meters of pedestrian
paths  of 3 m width will  provide  access  to  each  plot.   Barriers  will  be
installed at the intersections of pedestrian ways with the vehicular access
roads to prevent their use by motorists.
8.       Due to the very low rainfall  conditions  in Hodeidah  and  the free
draining characteristics of the granular soil, unsurfaced roads will give an
adequate service level within the blocks.  For the same reason, the shoulders
of paved roads will be untreated; concrete blocks will be installed at both
edges of paved roadways  for the protection of  the road  base.   Stormwater
drainage will not be required.
Water Supply
9.       Although the capacity of the existing network cannot supply more than
60 l/c/d, future extensions to the network will be capable of supplying the
standard of 140 l/c/d required by NWSA.  The internal network was designed for
the ultimate capacity and will consist of two main loops of 200 mm pipe
connecting to a 100 mm secondary system and a tertiary distribution network of
80 mm and 40 mm pipes.  House connections will be provided to every existing
house, with a boxed--in water meter built into the boundary wall.  Connections
to vacant infill plots will be plugged at the boundary; all water meters will
be  procured  under  the  project  and  will  be  stocked  at  NWSA  for  future
installation.
10.      The following quantities of piping are expected to be installed:
- 4,100 meters of 200 mm pipe
- 6,200 meters of 100 mm pipe
- 30,000 meters of 80 mm pipe
- 16,000 meters of 40 mm pipe



- 26 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 5
These will be supplemented by valves, fire hydrants and fittings.   Provision
will be made for about 2,700 house connections and about 1,450 future
connections.
Sewerage
11.      The sewerage network was designed  to evacuate  the  ultimate  flow.
Slopes adopted were the minimum necessary for self cleansing velocities
without the need for pumping.  The topography of the ground provides natural
drainage towards the existing spur from Jamal Street and towards the Airport
Road for the northeastern sector.
12.      Connections will again be provided to every existing house, by means
of an inspection chamber within the building perimeter. For the infill plots,
the connection will be carried to the boundary and plugged.   For economy and
convenience, the vertical shafts of manholes will be built with circular
asbestos-cement pipe sections.
13.      The sewerage works will include the following quantities of work:
- 1,300 meters of 300 mm pipe.
- 2,000 meters of 250 mm pipe.
- 19,000 meters of 200 mm pipe.
- 785 manholes.
Electricity
14.      High voltage  cables will  connect  from the HV network to step-down
transformers on site.  From these, LV cables will provide power to homes aid
to  pole-mounted  street  lamps.   The  total  power  needs  of  the  area  were
estimated  at  4,500  KVA.   Household  demand  was  based  on  the  average  for
Hodeidah and was estimated at 1 KW/hr. House connections would be carried out
directly by YGEC.
15.      The electrical works to be carried out include the following:
- 4,500 m of HV-ug cables.
- 6 - 750 KVA transformers.
- 48,000 m of LV wiring.
- 875 electric poles.
- 450 - 70W street lights.
Communiity Facilities
16.      Land will be set aside for all necessary community facilities such as
schools,  mosques,  health  centers,  social  centers,  parks,  etc.   The  site
development plans have also made provision for commercial development along
the main roads.  The number and sizes of facilities will be in accordance with
recommended international standards and will comply with the requirements of
the Hodeidah Master Plan.

Solid Waste Disposal
17.      Solid waste collection and disposal for the city of Hodeidah will be
provided under a separate, city-wide project to be financed by the Government
of the Netherlands.
B. Technical Assistance and Project Administration
Technical Assistance
18.      In  order  to  enable  the  MMH  and  Municipality  of  Hodeidah  to
successfully carry out the project, the UDPU will be strengthened through the
appointment  of  additional  foreign  experts.   Altogether,  15  man-years  of
technical assistance will be provided, including:
- A Chief Engineer for 44 months.
- An Architect/Planner for 24 months.
- An Implementation Engineer for 44 months.
- A Socio-Economist for 24 months.
- A Financial Analyst for 44 months.
19.      In addition to the appointment of expatriate technicians to the UDPU,
the project will provide direct technical assistance to the Municipality of
Hodeidah through the appointment of an experienced municipal engineer for a
period of 24 months.  Funds will also be provided for the overseas training of
technical staff from the MMH and the Hodeidah Municipality.   Under the Sanaa
Urban Development Project, Yemeni, counterparts - engineers, architects,
accountants, etc.   are receiving extensive on-the-job training from a team of
experienced expatriate professionals.   This program has now been extended to
training on project preparation through the design of the Second Urban
Development project, which is completely carried out in-house. As a result of
this training, Yemeni technicians will be able to better benefit from the
advanced overseas training in urban planning, municipal engineering and
procurement that will be provided under the proposed project.
20.      One of  the major problems  faced by  the MMH  is  that,  apart  from
budgetary allocations made by the Central Government, the Ministry does not
have a steady source of income to finance and maintain new services and
investments.   Past  efforts  to carry out a study on the establishment of a
municipal tax system have failed because of lack of financing and commitment.
Aware of the current budgetary constraints, the Government has requested IDA
assistance in reaching a decision as to the best way for the recovery of
project costs from beneficiaries, and facilitation of the financing of future
urban projects.   A Cost Recovery Study will be financed under  the project.
This will include 12 man/months of a municipal taxation expert's time in the
Yemen Arab Republic.   The  study will  end up by  recommending  the  type  of
legislation that would need to be implemented for an equitable system that
would lighten the burden on the Government without unduly taxing any
particular groups of the population.

ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 5
21.      Finally, provision has been made for financing the preparation of a
Third Urban Development Project in the YAR.  The project will be identified
and  selected  in  collaboration  with  the  MMH.   It  is  expected  that  the
Directorate of Housing, through the UDPU, will carry out the preparation of
the project.
Project Administration
22.      To  ensure  maximum  transfer  of  technology,  Yemeni  staff  will  be
appointed  as  counterparts  to  the  expatriates.   About  42  man-years  of
professional, technical and administrative staff time has been estimated,
distributed as follows:
- 3 engineers for a total of 108 man/months.
- 2 architects for a total of 68 man/months.
- 1 accountant for 44 man/months.
- 2 surveyors for a total of 68 man/months.
- 2 draftsmen for a total of 88 man/months.
- 2 administrators for a total of 88 man/months.
- Support staff for a period of 44 months.
23.      Upon  completion  of  the  project,  the  water  supply  and  sewerage
networks will be handed over to NWSA and the electrical network will be handed
over to YGEC.  The project provides for an engineer from NWSA to supervise the
implementation of the water supply and sewerage works (30 months) and another
engineer from YGEC to supervise the electrical works  (24 months).   Although
their salaries will be paid by the MMH, these engineers will be members of the
staff of NWSA and YGEC and will be responsible to ensure project implementa-
tion to the standards set by these agencies.
24.      During the implementation of the project,  it is likely  that  legal
problems will arise that will require legal advice or ruling.  Provision has
been made for a total of 10 man/months for legal services during the life of
the project.
25.      To facilitate project implementation, provision has been made for the
purchase of three vehicles for use by project staff.  Provision has also been
made for the procurement of essential office supplies and equipment.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MINISTRY OF MUNICIPALITIES AND HOUSING
1.       The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing was created in March 1979
by separating municipalities from the former Ministry of Public Works and
Municipalities.   It is responsible  for urban development  affairs  including
planning, execution and administration, as well as for local municipal offices
in  each  of  the  governorates.    It  is  divided  into  six  departments:
Administration and Finance, Projects, Physical Planning, Environmental Health,
Housing and Statistics and Planning (see Chart 25767 ).
2.       Since its creation, MMH has steadily built up its project planning
and implementation capacity.  Through its Physical Planning Department it has
been involved in the implementation of master plans in the five major cities
in YAR and more recently in the preparation of an urban development study for
the city of Rada.   Through its implementation office,  the Physical Planning
Department is providing  local municipal  offices with  technical  support  for
implementing urban  services projects such as drainage works, street paving,
street lighting, public markets, slaughterhouses and sanitary facilities.
3.       The  Environmental  Health  Department  is  responsible  for  providing
solid  waste  collection  and  disposal  services.   It  has  implemented  two
city-wide collection and disposal schemes mostly financed by the Netherlands
government and benefitting from Jordanian technical assistance in Sana'a and
Taiz.  The Ministry is now about to implement, through its municipal office in
Hodeidah and with the financial assistance of the Netherlands, a similar
scheme in Hodeidah, including a pilot primary health care component (para. 7).
4.       The Housing Department is still very young and is mainly responsible
through the Urban Development Project Unit (UDPU) for the execution of the
first IDA supported urban project in Sana'a (Credit 1202-YAR), and for the
preparation of the second urban project in Hodeidah.  The UDPU is headed by an
expatriate project manager and consists of six expatriates and eight local
staff (see Chart 25336).
5.       The annual budget of MMH for construction works increased from YRls
40-65 million in 1981 to YRls 120 million in 1983.  The Ministry is currently
supervising several major road construction projects with a total value of

about 800, half of it in the city of Hodeidah and half working in 16 other
smaller municipal offices throughout the governorate.  It is divided into five
main departments:  Administration and Finance, Environmental 'ealth, Projects,
Technical Affairs, and Utilities (See Chart 25337).
7.       The Department  of  Environmental  Health  is  responsible  for  street
cleaning and solid waste collection, eradication of animals, food control and
health education.  It will receive technical assistance from the Netherlands
to implement a city-wide solid waste collection and disposal scheme including
a pilot primary health care component.  The Projects Department is responsible
for  preparation,   implementation  and   supervision  of  projects  such  as
construction  of  markets,  slaughterhouses,  playgrounds  and  street  paving
including  road  maintenance.   However,  because  of  lack  of  equipment  and
qualified staff, most of the road maintenance activity is subcontracted.  The
municipal engineer,  financed under the proposed project, will inter alia (i)
initiate the setting up and organization of a comprehensive road inventory for
the city, covering road classification, length and width, type of surfacing
and conditions of surfacing; and (ii) introduce a system of assessment of
priorities, using the road inventory for routine maintenance.
8.       The Technical Affairs Department is responsible for town planning, in
particular for implementing the master plan of Hodeidah.   To that effect,  it
receives   extensive   technical   backstopping   from   the  Physical  Planning
Department of MMH.  It is also responsible for delivering building permit-.
The Utilities Department is responsible for street lighting, tree planting and
emptying cesspools.
9.       All capital investments are planned on a yearly basis and submitted
to MMH for review, approval and direct funding. In 1982, the Municipal office
in Hodeidah implemented projects for a total amount of YRls 27.0 million
(US$5.9 million).  Its operating budget is approved every three months by MMH
and amounted to YRls 10.8 million (US$2.3 million) for 1982.
10.      The Municipal office collects the following fees:
(a) Building fee. For new construction.
- YRIs 2.0/lm for inspection
- YRls 0.5 to 1.5/lm for road maintenance whether the access
road is paved or not paved
(b)    Commercial and Economic Activity Licensing Fee
- YRls 500 to 1,000 per year
(c)    Emptying Cesspools Fee:  YRls 75 per cesspool.
(d     Street Cleaning Fee:  YRls 20 to 50 per month for commercial
and economic activity.  This fee is collected yearly together
with the licensing renewal.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
1.       Most of the project benefits are captured in the value of serviced
land in Ghuleil.  This includes the value of infrastructure services provided
as well as people's valuation of access to commercial/industrial and community
facilities.
2.       Current land prices in Hodeidah are summarized in Table 1.  Prices in
the city core are YRls 150-250/m2 and between YRls 80 to 150/m2 in the fringe
areas presently undergoing development, though often without ready access to
services.  Prices vary according to the type of vehicular access and potential
for commercial activity.   Bare  land at the fringes of squatter settlements
located at the outskirts of the city vary between YRls 5 to 10/m2.

(YRls/m2)

Unpaved Access              150-200                  80-100              5-10
3.       The average of the above value  range  is taken as an estimate of
people's willingness to pay for land in Ghuleil.   Specifically,  initial base
line values are set at YRls 100/m2 and YRls 150/m2 for residential land
according  to  the  type  of  access  location,  and  at  YRls  200/ms   for
commercial/industrial land. These values are likely to represent a conser-
vative estimate since they do not fully reflect the higher level of services
provided in Ghuleil nor the lack of service delays.  Higher land values than
those mentioned above are included in the sensitivity analysis.   Furthermore,
the premium for better access to services and better coordinated land uses are
difficult to determine and are not included.   Benefits are distributed over
time starting at the time beneficiaries occupy their plots.
4.       The costs included in the economic analysis are for (a) land and site
works; (b) on-site infrastructure, including individual connections; (c)
physical contingencies; (d) project administration, design and supervision;
and  (e)  annual  operation  and  maintenance  estimated  at  about  4%  of  the
investment costs.

5.       Based on the above estimates where  cost  and  benefit  streams  are
expressed in end 1983 prices, the rate of return on the project's upgrading
and sites and services component representing about 80% of the total project
costs  is  25%  (see Table  1).  Although  this may constitute a conservative
estimate, this rate of return to urban fringe development reflects the rapid
rise in the demand for urban serviced land due to population and income
growth, and the very limited capacity of the Government to supply serviced
land  in a systematic  and coordinated fashion.  The sensitivity analysis is
shown in Table 2.
