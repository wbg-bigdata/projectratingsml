MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 42.8 MILLION (US$55 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed Development Credit to the Repub-
lic of Guinea for SDR 42.8 m (US$55 m equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would help finance a
Transport Sector Project, including a sectorwide policy reform program and
investments in highways, ports and civil aviation.  Part of the proceeds of
the credit would be channelled to the Conakry Port Authority (PAC) and the Air
Navigation Agency (ANA) at an interest rate of 8% for 20 years, including four
years of grace. The exchange risks would be borne by PAC and ANA, respective-
ly.
2.        Background.  After 25 years of neglect, Guinea's transport sector is
among the least efficient in the region and one of the main obstacles to
accelerated development of Guinea's newly liberalized economy.  A system of
some 14,000 km of classified roads is currently reduced to barely 4,500 km of
all-weather roads, many of them in very poor condition. The countrv's vehicle
fleet is among the smallest and most overaged in the region.  Guinea's rail
system  totals  1,047 km, comprising  three mining railways  in satisfactory
condition (385 km), and a deteriorated public railway from Conakry to Kankan
(662 km) which has virtually ceased to operate.  A concerted donor approach
endorsed by IDA would let the railway subsist with minimum maintenance re-
quired only for safety considerations, until the road system is able to take
over. Guinea has two deep-water ports, one for commercial and mining traffic
at Conakry and one mining-oriented at Kamsar, and a small secondary port at
Benty.  The country has one recently modernized  international airport at
Conakry and nine  secondary airfields  in poor condition.  Air safety and
navigation equipment remain sub-standard, and the national carrier's (AIR
GUINEE) financial and operational situation is precarious.
3.        Re-establishing reasonably dependable communications among the main
production, consumption and export centers and opening up Guinea's rich
hinterland will be essential for the success of the recently launched struc-
tural adjustment program for Guinea's economy.  To do so will take at least
ten years. Building sustainable institutions capable of planning, maintaining
and operating the transport systems efficiently will take longer. Pragmatism
and realism are therefore essential in defining a bector strategy.  In ap-
proaching this problem, the Government has sensibly accorded the highest
priority to the formulation and implementation of policy reforms aimed at
introducing a market-oriented environment in the transport sector and to the
re-establishment of essential transport services.  In support of this strate-
gy, the Government's investment program rightly focuses on the elimination of
four major bottlenecks: (a) the heavily deteriorated basic trunk road system;
(b) the serious congestion in the commercial port of Conakry; (c) the unreli-
able and unsafe air transport system; and (d) the difficulties of transforming
a transport industry historically dominated by inefficient parastatals into a
performing,   private  service  industry.   In  collaboration  with  several
co-financing agencies (AfDB, KfW, GTZ, FAC), we propose to support this
strategy through a series of projects in the next few years that will finance
priority investments and support reform measures in the transport sector,
paralleling those being supported at the macro-level by the IDA-supported
ongoing structural adjustment program.



4.        Project  Objectives.   The  project  aims  at  providing  the  policy
framework required to ensure efficiency and effectiveness throughout the
sector. It also supports a major rehabilitation effort in highways, ports and
civil aviation -- the backbone of the country's transportation system.  To
accomplish these objectives, a program of policy reforms, the main elements of
which are detailed in the Government's Letter of Development Policy for the
Transport Sector, has been formulated and partially implemented; the remaining
actions will be carried out during project implementation and comprise
(a) pricing policy and related administrative reforms; (b) public investment
and expenditure policy; (c) restructuring and privatization of public sector
agencies and enterprises including cargo handling and other port-associated
services; (d) deregulation and liberalization; and (e) institutional reform
and development.
5.        Project Description.  The project would finance (a) the rehabilita-
tion of some 360 km of existing paved roads; (b) the construction of a con-
tainer berth, a fuel jetty and a siltation prevention dike in Conakry port,
and dredging of the port area and access channel; and (c) essential naviga-
tional aids and infrastructure rehabilitation at Conakry International Airport
and at selected domestic airfields to re-establish safe operating conditions.
Additionally, the project would finance technical assistance to establish a
regulatory framework for privatized transport sector operations, and to
strengthen and improve Government planning and investment selection, pricing
policies, manpower development and training sectorwide.
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$111.5 m equivalent,
excluding taxes and duties, from which the project is exempt.  Foreign ex-
change costs are estimated at US$99.6 m (89%). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement together with the estimated disbursement schedule ore shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Guinea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Three maps showing project locations are also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6787-GUI, dated May 18, 1987, is being distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Improving the transportation system
in Guinea is high on the agenda of priorities of the Government. The critical
condition of roads and airports has isolated, periodically or permanently,
productive areas of the country and is the major obstacle for the rehabilita-
tion of agriculture and trade.  IDA's involvement in the sector will help
implement fundamental policy reforms, will serve as a catalyst in mobilizing
the substantial resources needed to rehabilitate the sector, and will support
the institution building actions required to ensure a lasting effect of the
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.
8.        Agreed Actions.   Agreements  reached during negotiations  include:
(a) annual review of the three-year rolling transport investment and expendi-
ture program for 1988-93, including limiting funding for railways to that
required for safety reasons and limiting tuture budgetary transfers to rail-
ways to present low levels; for investments, only projects with a 10% economic
rate of return will be included in the program; (b) subsequent annual review
of maintenance budgets for roads, ports, railways and aviation; (c) reor-
ganization of institutions responsible for transport planning, administration
and operations, including adoption by June 30, 1988, of appropriate road
transport regulations conducive to competition, efficiency and safety of
service, in particular, regulations on free entry into and exit from the
industry; (d) a study of road user taxation, including the level and structure
of fuel taxes, to be completed by November 15, 1987; (e) creation of an



autonomous civil aviation agency (ANA) by June 30, 1988; (f) a manpower
development and trainirg program for transport sector administration personnel
to be established by October 31, 1988; and (g) overall project coordination
and management. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness will be: (a) a CF 15 in-
crease in the tax on petroleum products; (b) implementation of PAC's (i) new
tariff structure; (ii) new statutes and port regulations; and (iii) new
organization chart and salary structure; (c) enactment of measures ensuring
PAC's financial autonomy; (d) certification by the Ministry of Finance of
PAC's revalued balance sheet as of January 1, 1986; (e) approval of PAC's
detailed program for improvement of financial management; and (f) completion
of legal arrangements for compensation of reciprocal debts between PAC and the
State.   Conditions  of  disbursement  are  (a) after  January  1,  1988,  the
implementation of a further increase in fuel prices based on the findings of
the  above-mentioned  study;  (b) for  the  road  component:   adequate  1988
budgetary provisions for maintenance of the priority road network; (c) for the
port  component:   conclusion  of  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  and  the
*         fulfillment of all conditions of effectiveness of the co-financing agreements;
and  (d) for  the  aviation  component:   conclusion  of  the  subsidiary  loan
agreement and employment of two members of the technical assistance team.
9.        Justification and Benefits.  The main benefits of the project are
the opening up of areas that now are isolated for several months each year;
the protection of the paved highway network from further deterioration and
even higher reconstruction costs; and a substantial reduction in road trans-
port costs with direct benefits to both urban and rural populations.   In-
creased efficiency will result from the streamlined and reorganized transport
sector institutions and enterprises, and from the deregulation and liberal-
ization which would facilitate an expanded role for private sector operators.
Additionally, the project will establish a sound regulatory framework for a
privatized transport industry, and promote greater efficiency and safety in
port and airport operations. Based on estimated capital and maintenance/oper-
ating costs and a conservative estimate of quantifiable benefits,  and a
natural economic life, the project would yield an economic rate of return of
21% overall for the prved road rehabilitation component and 24% overall for
the port component.
10.       Risks.   Satisfactory  agreement  has been  reached  on  the  policy
reforms underpinning the proposed project, and substantial changes have
already been introduced up front to ensure their implementation.  The main
risks, therefore, would be insufficient or delayed implementation of subse-
quent phases of policy reform. These risks are, however, tolerable since the
more significant steps will be adopted early on and the perspective of
follow-up operations in the sector would help strengthen the Government's
commitment.
11.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied  that the proposed  credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
