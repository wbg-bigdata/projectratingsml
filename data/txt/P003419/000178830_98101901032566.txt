CHINA
RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Government of China has requested Bank Group assistance in
financing a Rubber Development Project in Guangdong Province, South China.
The primary objective of the project is to increase the domestic production
of natural rubber and thereby reduce the dependence on imports which in
1979-81 accounted for 50% of total (natural plus synthetic) rubber
consumption in China. The project would assist in the new planting and
replanting of 40,000 ha of rubber, of which 36,000 would be on state farms
and 4,000 on nearby communes. The project would provide for the planting of
protective windbreaks in typhoon-prone areas and the expansion of
intercropping in immature rubber. It would include expansion of the farm
machinery and transport fleets on participating state farms, upgrading of
sawmills and timber utilization facilities, construction of housing,
administrative and service buildings on state farms, and the construction of
road links within state farms. The project would strengthen the training
programs for staff and workers of state farms and upgrade research and
extension activities. The technical assistance component would facilitate
access by China's natural rubber industry to improved technology developed
in other rubber producing countries over the last three decades. The
assistance to communes provided through the project would support a
recent initiative by the state farm system to provide technical and financial
help to the poorly developed rubber production activities in the communes.
The Agricultural Sector
1.02      Agriculture, including livestock, forestry and fisheries, provides
basic sustenance to China's population of just over one billion people. This
sector accounts for some 30% of the country's gdp and is the main source of
livelihood for the rural population of nearly 800 million. Only about
100 million ha of China's land area of 960 million ha are arable. Farming
systems are intensive, with large inputs of labor and chemical and organic
fertilizers. Nearly half of the arable land is irrigated and more than half
of the arable area grows at least two crops per year. Foodgrains occupy 80%
of the cropland and account for 65% of total agricultural output. This
intensive system of production allows China to meet the basic food needs of
its population (about 22% of the world's total) from less than 8% of the
world's arable land. Grain yields are about 50% greater than those in other
developing countries. Agricultural production is carried out in communes,
state farms and privately managed plots which account for about 87, 5, and 8%,
respectively, of the country's arable land and 80, 4 and 16%, respectively, of
the gross value of agricultural production.

1.03      Agricultural development has been accorded high priority since the
founding of the People's Republic. Investment in agriculture has averaged
about 20% of total national investment and recent economic reforms have been
designed to increase the efficiency of investment in the sector. Despite
declining per capita availability of arable land, efforts to develop China's
agriculture have been broadly successful. Food production has expanded more
rapidly than population growth and a food security system has been put into
place which provides adequate basic nutrients to most of China's population.
The agricultural sector grew by about 3.2% p.a. in the 1955-79 period and by
more than 5% on average since 1979. Reflecting population and income growth
and diversion of larger quantities of grain to livestock feeding, net grain
imports have risen in recent years to about 15 million tons p.a., or less
than 5% of total consumption. Exports of raw and processed agricultural
products contribute about 80% of all foreign exchange earnings.
1.04      The Government controls the pricing and marketing of most agricul-
tural products and inputs. It fixes annual production quotas for the major
crops such as grains, oilseeds and industrial crops (cotton, sugar and
rubber) and purchases them at predetermined prices. Minor crops, such as
vegetables, and other products grown in household plots, are sold in rural
markets at prices regulated by the provinces or counties. Economic reforms
since 1976 have decentralized production decisions, substantially increased
prices paid for most agricultural products, increased the maximum area
allowed in household plots, and expanded the role of rural markets. Instit-
utional reforms in 1982 combined several government agencies involved in
agricultural product marketing and input distribution to improve the
efficiency of these activities.
1.05      A major task of China's agricultural sector will be to meet the food
and agricultural raw material requirements occasioned by population growth and
gains in per capita income. The land constraint will require steady increases
in yields from already cropped areas and the growing problem of surplus rural
labor will make job creation an increasingly important policy objective of
Government. To meet these challenges the Government is implementing new
policies aimed at giving rural workers more production incentives. Area
quotas for particular crops have been relaxed, although minimum grain market-
ing quotas are still maintained. Production incentives are encouraging crop
specialization in economically suited areas and the production of industrial
crops is being fostered by assuring supplies of food grains to farm workers
in those areas. Incentives to workers on both communes and state farms are
being improved to link reward more closely with work effort. Within the
state farm system, financial reforms allow individual farms to retain a
large share of any profits earned in excess of stipulated quotas. In
addition, it will be necessary to use the few remaining opportunities to
expand the cultivated area, increase cropping intensity and yields on
existing cultivated areas through relatively quick-yielding land and water
resource projects, increase the efficiency of investment, and introduce
higher-yielding crop varieties and practices through research and education.



-3-
The State Farm System
1.06      State farms, which predate the founling of the People's Republic,
were established to provide food to the revolutionary armies and were
important sources of employment for demobilized soldiers. Located largely in
less-dovelopel borer regions (the provinces of Heilongjiang, Nei Monggol,
:4ingxia, Gansu, Xin1iant, Qinghai, Xizang, Yunnan an-I Hainan Island in
O,uangdong Province), these farms have become imnortant sources of
commercialized agricultural prodruction to meet requirements of the cities and
food deficit areas in the countryside. As a national average, more than 35%
of grain production on state farms is sold to the state. This contrasts to
some 15" delivered to the state from the collective sector. The approximately
2,100 state farms in China, most of which are under the policy direction of
the Central General Bureau of State Farms and Land Reclamation (CGB) within
the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Hushandry and Fisheries (MAAF) and its
provincial bureaus, manage almost 29 million ha. About 4.5 million ha
total are under cultivation, with much of the balance being grass lands,
forests or land with limited potential for sustained crop production. Nearly
half of the state farms specialize in grain or cotton production, about a
quarter in livestock production and the balance in tea, fruit, aquaculture and
other specialty crops. Some '3% (170) are involved largely in rubber
production. Farm size averages about 12,000 ha, but varies widely from 2 -
3,000 ha in the South to 90,000 ha in the Northeast.
1.07      The population on state farms in 1980 was 11.4 million and state
farm employment was just under 5 million (about one worker per cultivated
ha, as compared with three to four workers per cultivated ha in the collec-
tive sector). Output per worker on state farms is considerably greater than
in the communes, reflecting larger per capita quantities of land, machinery
and equipment with which to work.  NXational average earnings per worker on
state farms in 1932 w7ere about US$350 equivalent, including bonuses. Workers
on state farms receive a monthl7 wage, annual wage bonuses which depend on the
financial performance of the farms, and subsid1ze: social services including
housing, education and health. As relatively self-sufficient economic units
operating 'n noorl- developed areas, individual state farms must finance,
construct and maintain a system of social an1 physical infrastructure (health,
education, transportation, communications and noT7er) which is usually the
responsibility of central and local governments in other countries.
1.03      In 1982 thne gross value (in 1980 prices) of production on state
farms was Y 11.6 blllion, of which Y 6.6 billion came from agricultural output
and Y 5.0 billion from industrial production.  In recent years, state farms
have accounted for about 2% of the country's grain production, nearly 6% of
sugar outpuit, 3% of the cotton, and 95% of the natural rubber production. In
the 1975-31 period, the number of state farms declined by about 10% (largely
through consolidation), while the cropped area on these farms rose by 13% and
the gross value of output by 50%. After realizing financial losses for many



-4-
years, the state farm sector in 1979, 1980 and 1981 reported aggregate profits
of Y 397 million, Y 659 million and Y 192 million, respectively (the sharp
decline in 1981 reflecting a weather-induced loss of Y 346 million on state
farms in Heilongjiang Province). This improved financial performance is due
largely to higher procurement prices for state farm output and, possibly, more
efficient operations growing out of managerial reforms which decentralize
decision-making and enhance production incentives at the family or production
group level.
1.09      To meet future requirements for food and agricultural raw materials,
the Government plans a major land development program by the state farm system
in the current Five Year Plan (1981-86). This calls for the development of
1.1 million ha of unused land for annual field crops, 60,000 ha for tree
crops, and 2.2 million ha for improved pasture. Total estimated cost of the
program is Y 7.1 billion (US $3.7 billion). Although the major focus is on
food crop development in the Northeast, considerable emphasis also is to be
given elsewhere to pasture and meat production and production of raw materials
such as cotton and rubber.
Rubber Production and Utilization
1.10      The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) was introduced into China in
1904, but the planted area expanded very slowly and production in 1949
totalled only about 200 tons. Extensive planting of rubber, largely under the
aegis of the state farms, began in 1952 and focused primarily on Hainan Island
and Zhanjiang Prefecture in Guangdong Province. Until 1967 virtually all
plantings were with unselected, inherently low yielding materials. New
planting since the mid 1960s has been rapid, averaging about 10,000 ha
annually in 1967-81 in Guangdong, the major rubber producing province.
Replanting of over-aged trees began in 1975 and totalled about 4,800 ha by
1981. In 1981 the area under rubber in China totalled 410,000 ha, of which
320,000 were in the state farm sector and perhaps 80,000 ha were in communes,
the balance being on farms of Overseas Chinese and in experimental stations.
More than 80% of the total planted area is in Guangdong Province. Another 13%
is in Yunnan Province and the balance is in Guangxi and Fujian Provinces. An
estimated 41% of China's rubber area is immature; 36% is mature seedling
rubber; and 23% is mature budded rubber.
1.11   In Guangdong Province, the rubber area on state farms totals
264,300 ha (1981), or about 79% of the province's total area planted to this
crop. The area under commune rubber is about 67,000 ha, all of which is
planted to low yielding, unselected, generally over-age trees. Some 39% of
the provincial rubber area is immature, while 40% is under mature seedling
rubber. On state farms in the province, 36,900 ha (14% of total state farm
area) are planted to trees which are 29 years of age or older. Yields on
state farms in Guangdong Province have grown at 3.4% p.a. (1969-71 to



1979-81) and averaged 670 kg per tapped ha in 1981. This figure can be
compared with recent yields of about 1,200 kg/ha in Malaysia, 680 kg in
Thailand and 670 kg in Indonesia. State farm yields from old, unselected
seedling rubber in China are in the 350-500 kg/ha range, while yields of
improved clones planted on a commercial scale on these farms have averaged
about 1,130 kg/ha in the first nine years of tapping. Rubber yields on
communes in 1981 averaged 106 kg per planted ha. Low yields on communes
reflect the dominance of old, unselected trees as well as the virtual
absence of chemical fertilizers. Although communes occupy about 20% of
China's rubber area, they account for less than 5% of total production.
They are in need of technical assistance in rubber production and processing
and a systematic program to replant over-age rubber. China's rubber is
produced within a range of 18 to 24 degrees north of the equator, or well
beyond the latitudes of other major producers of natural rubber. China's
major rubber growing areas are subject to typhoons on Hainan Island and low
temperature on parts of the mainland but production systems involving
windbreaks have been developed to deal with the wind problem and breeding
programs have made some progress in producing cold-resistant planting
materials.
1.12      Domestic production of natural rubber grew by 9.6% p.a between
1970-72 and 1979-81 to 115,000 tons in 1981 (Annex 1, Table 4) while
domestic output of synthetic rubber expanded by 16% p.a. during this period
to 124,900 tons in 1981. With total imports of NR and SR averaging 232,000
tons p.a. in 1979-81, total consumption of rubber (NR and SR) is in the
range of 464,000 tons yearly. Consumption grew by 4.3% p.a. between
1970-72 and 1979-81. About half of recent consumption came from imports of
SR and NR; 27% consisted of domestic production of SR and 23% came from
local production of NR. The rapid growth in domestic production of SR and
NR, albeit from a relatively small base, has permitted a steady decline in
the share of consumption provided by imports. Annual per capita consumption
of rubber in China (about 0.5 kg) is less than 20% of the world average.
Reflecting population and income growth, the domestic market for natural
rubber is expected to grow rapidly over the next several years (para. 5.10).
Project Formulation
1.13      A project proposal, prepared by the Guangdong Provincial Bureau
of State Farms and Land Reclamation, was reviewed by an IDA mission in
April 1982. During that and subsequent missions, discussions involving the
Provincial Bureau, IDA staff and consultants led to several refinements of
the project's design and technical features. These included:
(a)  expansion of the new planting share to increase the number of
jobs created;
(b)  introduction of a component to assist rubber production on
nearby communes;
(c)  addition of a technical assistance component to provide for
overseas training and technical services;



(d) expansion of local training programs for staff and workers on
state farms and communes;
(e) expansion of research and trials in rubber and windbreak
development;
(f) expansion of intercropping in immature rubber and introduction
of private intercropping by families on state farms;
(g) adjustments in the mix of rubber clones to better match clonal
characteristics to weather conditions;
(h) adjustments in the types and rates of chemical fertilizer
applications to use lower cost nutrient sources;
(i) wider spacing of windbreak plantings to increase timber produc-
tion without sacrificing wind protection;
(j) greater emphasis on intensive tapping and yield stimulation by
chemical application in old rubber before felling;
(k) lesser emphasis on de-stumping of old rubber lands to reduce
land preparation costs in replanting;
(1) introduction of improved timber treatment and processing
facilities;
(m)  introduction of sprinkler irrigation systems in rubber
nurseries; and
(n) organization of preproject study tours in 1983 to Japan and
Thailand to study rubber wood processing and technical and
administrative aspects of Bank Group-supported projects in
rubber development.
Bank Group Lending for Agriculture
1.14      Projects are being selected which generate increased output and
have significant demonstration and catalytic effects. The first Bank Group
operation in agriculture, a $60 million IDA credit for the North China Plain
Agriculture Project (Credit 121-CHA), was approved by the Executive
Directors on June 15, 1982 and will provide improved irrigation and drainage
for 200,000 ha in nine counties. Work on this project, the first large
scale approach to problems of soil salinity and water logging in China, is
proceeding well. A second project, the Agricultural Education and Research
Project (Credit 1297-CHA) for $75 million, was approved by the Executive

Directors on November 2, 1982 and will support the Government's program of
strengthening higher education and research in key agricultural colleges and
research institutes. The Heilongjiang Land Reclamation Project (Loan/Credit
2261/1347-CHA), which was approved on April 18, 1983, will develop 200,000 ha
on state farms in Northeast China by constructing surface drains and access
roads and providing various agricultural machinery and other support services
to increase marketable supplies of wheat, maize and soybeans. The proposed
Rural Credit Project is to focus on Guangxi and Hubei Provinces and is
expected to include assistance for aquaculture, livestock and poultry, tree
crops and agro-industrial processing. Discussions with the Government are
underway on possible Bank Group assistance in forestry, agricultural research
and extension.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The proposed project is in Guangdong Province, South China, located
between 18 and 25 degrees north latitude and 109 and 117 degrees east longi-
tude. Most of the project farms are within 18 to 22 degrees north latitude.
Boundaries of participating farms are shown in the Map (IBRD 16867). The
project area comprises parts of Hainan, Tongza and Zhanjiang Prefectures.
Hainan and Tongza Prefectures constitute the land area of Hainan Island and
are located approximately on the southeastern and northwestern halves of the
island. Zhanjiang Prefecture is on the mainland in southwest Guangdong
Province. Of the 40,000 ha in the project, 43% are located in Hainan
Prefecture, 42% in Tongza and 15% in Zhanjiang. Almost 90% of the area to be
new planted is located in Hainan and Tongza Prefectures where unused lands are
more readily available.
Climate
2.02      Climate in the project area is distinctly monsoonal in character,
with marked wet and dry seasons, high solar radiation and abundant rainfall
(Annex 1). Mean monthly temperatures are in the 23-250C range, with highs in
June and July (280C) and lows in January (16-200C). Zhanjiang has the
widest intermonthly temperature variations (12 degrees) and the lowest
temperatures, averaging 160C in January and February, but with minimum
temperature as low as 2-30C reported in the northern hill regions. Annual
mean hours of sunshine varies from about 1,200 in Zhanjiang to just over 2,100
in Hainan, while annual solar radiation is in the range of 110-140 kcal/sq cm.
Low temperatures in Zhanjiang Prefecture reduce the number of tapping days
(about 215 p.a. in Zhanjiang; 230 on Hainan Island) and slow tree growth by
perhaps 10%.



- 3 -
2.03      Average annual rainfall ranges from 1,600 mm in Tongza to 2,000 mm
in Hainan and declines moderately from east to west and south to north.
About 35%O of annual rainfal.1 occurs in the April-Octnber period, with August
and September the wettest months. December and January tend to be the
driest months, although the period of sparse rainfall occasionally
extends to February, March andl Aeril.  Reflecting the area's proximity to the
sea, humidity levels are high throughout the year.
2.04      The project area is subject to typhoons, most of which occur between
May and November and reach their greatest frequency and severity in the
July-September period.  Moving in a northwesterly direction, these storms tend
to affect Hainan Prefecture most frequently buit occasionally hit Tongza and
Zhanjiang. In the 12-year period (1970-81) 27 typhoons struck Hainan Island
with peak wind velocities of Force 8 or above on the Beaufort scale. Most of
the storms have maximum winis in the 8-11 range (68-94 kph), although some
have ratings of up to 12 (125 kph).  Tree damage, which tends to be highly
localized, may afFect 1-2% of the planted area each year.  A few o' the trees
in the affected area are totally destroyed, bht most suffer lesser damage.
Rubber pro-luction declines most sharply in the period immediately following
the storm and may eventuallv largelT recover with subsequent regrowth of the
tree canopy. Cultural practices to minimize wind damage include pruning of
trees to reduce wind resistance, establishment of win1"reaks around rubber
plantings and planting of wind resistant varieties of rubber.  These
practices, singly or in combination, have substantially reduced the adverse
effects of typhoons on China's rubber industry.
Topography and Soils
2.0r      Ilainan Island is high near its center, with contour lines in
approximate concentric circles around lWuzhi Mountain (1,867 m above sea
level).  The island periphery tends tz be flat to gently undulating and
consists largely of coastal and alluvial plains. The relatively large areas
between the mountains and the coastal plains are foothills and valleys with
soils derived largely from arenaceous and metamorphic rock.  The topography of
Zhanjiang Prefecture is flat to undulating and slopes downward from north to
south. Geologic features of Thanjiang include granitic and gneissic mountains
in the north and northeast. The southern coastal area is largely sedimentary
plain, while the Leizhou Peninsula in Zhanjiang consists of sedimentary and
basaltic platforms. Topography in Elainan and Tongza Prefectures is consider-
ably more broken than in Zhanjiang. In Hainan and Tongza 47% and 64% of the
project areas, respectively, have slopes of 36% (200) or less. In
Zhanjiang all of the project area has slopes of 36% or less.
?.06.     Soils in the project area vary widely from site to site, reflect-
ing different parent materials and the influence of differing topographical
and climatic factors. Major soil types include the granitic red loams, the
volcanic laterites, coastal clays and sands and the yellow podzolic soils at
higher elevation.  The granitic loams are located mainly in the central and



- 9 -
southwestern parts of Hainan Island and the northern part of Zhanjiang
Prefecture. These soils have deep profiles and are well suited for rubber
production. The volcanic laterites derive largely from basaltic rocks, have
considerable iron and aluminum content, and are located in the northern and
northeastern parts of Hainan Island and on the southern part of Zhanjiang
Prefecture. These deep, clayey soils, many of which are in typhoon-prone
areas, are suitable for rubber development if appropriate windbreaks are
established. The coastal sedimentary soils vary from relatively infertile
loamy sands to fertile, well-textured sand and clay loams which are already
under cultivation. The yellow soils are generally at elevations above 1,000 m
where steep gradients, cool temperatures and limited sunshine preclude rubber
production. Most of the soils in the project farms have deep profiles,
organic matter content of 2.2-2.7% and pH values in the 4.9-5.6 range. With
proper fertilization and land conservation practices, which are already well
developed in the project area, these soils are capable of sustaining rubber
production at relatively high yields. As of early 1982, the state farm system
in Guangdong Province had available 49,600 ha of undeveloped land suitable for
growing rubber. Sizeable areas of such lands are also available in the
communes, but remain largely undeveloped because of inadequate finance and
technical assistance. Rubber is the appropriate crop choice in most of the
project area when topography, soils and climate are considered.
Agricultural Production, Incomes and Labor Force
2.07      Guangdong is a large province (population in 1982 of 59.2 million)
with a relatively diversified agricultural sector. The land area of just over
20 million ha includes nearly 12 million ha in hills and mountains and
8 million in uplands and plains. Grain production is the most important
agricultural activity (nearly 5 million ha), although the province also
produces large quantitities of industrial crops (rubber, tea, sugarcane, jute
and hemp) and animal and other products (pork, beef, fish, silk).
Agroindustrial production is well developed and accounts for a substantial
part of rural income. Within the Province, average cash incomes on state
farms appear to be about 25% higher than on communes. The inclusion of
benefits received in kind by state farm workers would raise this
differential substantially.
2.08      The 137 state farms in the province occupy 1.1 million ha (5.4% of
the provincial land area) and support a population of 1.2 million (2% of the
provincial total). About 100 farms specialize in rubber production. In 1981
the gross value of agricultural and industrial production on state farms in
the province was Y 715 million, of which 79% was accounted for by rubber, 12%
by other crops and animal husbandry and 9% by industrial and sideline
production. Other items produced in substantial quantities by state farms in
Guangdong include sisal fiber (11,000 tons in 1981), tea (2,335 tons), sugar
(27,700 tons), paper (2,400 tons) and fiberboard (5,000 tons).  State farms in



- 10 -
the province also produce cement, chemical fertilizers and various consumer
products. Agricultural production in the province is supported by an
extensive program of agricultural research and training.
2.09      Most of the project area is too steep for the sustained cropping
of annuals. On the more level lands crops such as pineapple, sugarcane,
sweet potatoes and groundnuts can be grown. Net economic returns per ha for
pineapples appear to be higher than for rubber, although marketing of the
fresh fruit is problematic in China and both the domestic and export markets
for the tinned product are limited. Returns from most other short term
crops are lower than returns from rubber. Other tree crops such as oil palm
and coconut have not done well in the project area. Plantation forestry may
be a possibility, although forestry would absorb much less labor per ha than
does rubber. Taking into account soil, climate, topography, market
opportunities and the government's objective of expanding rural employment,
rubber is the appropriate crop choice for the project area.
2.10      The work force on the state farms totals 640,000, of whom 232,000
are directly employed in rubber production and processing. The labor supply
continues to grow more rapidly than do remunerative work opportunities. In
1978-81 the number of middle school graduates on state farms in the province,
the major source of new entrants to the state farm labor force, grew by 5.8%.
The surplus labor supply on state farms in the three prefectures in 1982 is
estimated to be 95,000 workers (Annex 1).
2.11      The average size of the 50 project farms is 9,500 ha, of which
2,700 ha are in rubber (Annex 1, Tables 10-12). Some of the remaining area
is under food or other industrial crops, but much is not developed because
of unsuitable topography or inadequate financial resources. Gross value of
production in 1981 averaged Y 9.5 million per farm, of which Y 7.1 million
came from rubber. Forty-six of the 50 farms realized profits in 1981.
Project farms have a total population of approximately 558,000 and a labor
force of 290,000. Agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry provide
employment for about 200,000 workers, of whom half are in rubber production.
The balance of the labor force is in administration and other support
services.
Infrastructure and Social Services
2.12      Guangdong is served by a relatively well-developed system of
physical infrastructure. Major urban areas and state farms are linked by
all-weather roads, most of which are hard-surfaced. Deep water ports serve
the mainland (at Guangzhou and Zhanjiang) and Hainan Island (Haikou),
Zhanjiang and Haikou are linked to the provincial capital (Guangzhou) and
Beijing by regularly scheduled air service. Rail lines connect Zhanjiang
with Guangzhou and other major urban centers.



- 11 -
2.13       Wit7itn-farm systerms of electric power, road transport and communi-
cations are largely the responsib, lity of individual farmq, althlough there
are generally good linkages to the provincial and national networks. The
state farms of the province have constructed and maintain 8,400 km of trunk
telephone lines and 13,400 km of local telephone lines.  Every level of
management (para. 4.01) above the production team can be reached by vehicle
and telephone. Most farms are provided with electric power, either through
connection to the provincial grid or through farm-owned power plants and
transmission facilities.
2.14       Medical and educational services are available to virtually all
state farm staff and workers, although these facilities are generally in need
of upgrading.  In addition to the eight hospitals under the general super-
vision of the three administrative bureaus (essentially covering Ilainan,
Tongza and Zhanjiang Prefectures), each state farm operates a hospital and
each subfarm or nroduction brigade maintains a clinic with specialist
medical personnel.  In total, the state farms have available some 12,000
hospital beds ani a slightly larger number oF medically trained personnel.
2.15       The state farm system in the province operates 192 middle schools
(102,400 students) 1,060 primary schools (209,200 stuilents), 8 technical
sclhools, and 5 staff training centers. In 1932 about 33,200 students
gra.Iuated crom lower and upper middle schools on state farms in the three
project prefectures (of which 15,500 graduates came from farms participating
in the project).
III.  THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01       The major objective of the project is to increase the production of
natural rubber by assisting the Government-s program of new planting and
replanting in Guangdong Province. The main features of the project are:
(a)  new planting of about 21,000 ha and replanting of approximately
15,000 ha on 50 state farms, including intercropping during part
of the rubber-s immature phase on a gross area of 9,000 ha;
(b)  new planting of rubber on about 4,000 ha and intercropping on a
gross area of 1,000 ha on nearby communes;
(c)  establishment of about 12,000 ha of windbreaks on state farms and
commnunes;
(d)  expansion of the equipmnent fleets of participating state farms
through procurement of trucks, wheeled and crawler tractors, other



- 12 -
agricultural implements, and transportation and construction
equipment;
(e) upgrading of sawmills on the 19 farms engaged in replanting, and
construction of two integrated timber processing facilities in the
project area;
(f) construction of about 765,000 sq m of buildings, including housing
for staff and workers of state farms, offices, service buildings,
schools, clinics and training centers;
(g) construction or upgrading of bridges and culverts, about 780 km of
rural roads, 400 km of power transmission lines and 780 km of
telephone lines;
(h) strengthening domestic training programs for staff and workers
of state farms and upgrading of research and training programs in
prefectural research institutes; and
(i) provision of overseas training and technical assistance in rubber
production and processing and estate management.
Rubber Establishment
3.02      The project would replant with high-yielding clones about 15,000
ha, first planted to rubber in the early to mid-1950s with unselected,
low-yielding materials, and new plant 21,000 ha of cut-over or new land on
state farms. It would also new plant 4,000 ha of commune land, most of
which is located in Hainan Island. This would involve plantation
establishment, including land clearing and terracing, planting, maintenance
and intercropping. These operations are summarized below, and further
details on agronomy and cultural practices are given in Chapter V. The
distribution of new plant and replant areas is shown in Table 3.1.
3.03      Land Clearing and Terracing.  Land clearing would be done with a
combination of manual and mechanical methods. Tree stumps would be removed
by dynamiting, uprooted by tractors, or treated with chemicals and left to
decay, depending on terrain and whether or not intercropping would be
practiced. All land with a gradient of over 5% (30) would be contour lined
and terraced by hand or tractor, depending on topography. Because of the
ready availability of surplus labor, labor intensive methods would be
emphasized. Terraces would slope inward at gradients of 23% (130); terrace
widths would range from 1.8 m (on lands with slopes of 27% or more) to 2.5 m
(slopes of 5-27%). Field roads would be constructed with an average
density of 45 m per ha and would be of compacted earth with a width of 3 m.

3.04      Planting.  Rubber clones used in the new planting/replanting
program would include proven high-yield materials which are widely grown
locally and a smaller proportion of promising newer materials grown less
extensively in China. About 80% of the area would be planted to budded
stumps and 20% to high-stumped buddings. Following land clearing, and
beginning in April or May of each year, nursery materials would be
transplanted to densities of 600-650 trees/ha. About 16 kg/ha of N and 70
kg/ha of P205 would be applied at planting, along with large quantities of
organic manures. Leguminous covers and intercrops would be established on
about 50% and 25%, respectively, of the planted area. On lands with slopes
greater than about 36% (200) natural cover would be retained to avoid
disturbing the soil surface, but would be enriched by planting of legumes.
3.05      Maintenance and Intercropping.  Rubber is expected to come into
tapping in the eighth (Tongza, Hainan) to ninth year (Zhanjiang) from
planting. The fertilization program during immaturity would require N, P205
and K20 at rates averaging 160, 50 and 30 kg/ha/year, respectively. Organic
manure (6-15 ton/ha/year) would also be applied, consisting of composted
cattle manure and grasses cut from field borders and other marginal land. The



- 14 -
manure would be supplied from cattle raised as a self-sustaining side
enterprise. During years 1-3 of the planting, about 25% of the gross planted
area would be intercropped in pineapple, sugarcane, peanut and sweet potato.
The project would provide planting material and fertilizer for intercropping;
the labor would be supplied by farm families.
Windbreak Establishment
3.06      In high wind risk areas, windbreaks would be established prior to
field planting of rubber. Windbreak areas, which on average would occupy
about 1 ha for every 3 ha of rubber, would be cleared by bulldozer and the
land prepared by disc plowing and by harrowing. Windbreaks would be 10-20 m
wide and arranged in a rectangular pattern with the long axis at right
angles to prevailing winds. They would divide the rubber area into blocks
of 1-3 ha, depending on the nature of the terrain and severity of the winds.
Species for the windbreaks would be chosen to produce a three-tiered effect
to provide protection at all levels. Planting would be at a spacing of
1.5 x 2 m (3,300 trees/ha). About 125 kg/ha of N, 20 kg/ha of P205, and up
to 10 tons/ha of organic manure would be applied at time of planting, followed
by additional organic manure in each of years two and three after planting.
Commercial thinning would begin in the 10th year of planting. Clear felling
would coincide with the felling of the old rubber before replanting.
Construction, Agricultural and Transport Machinery
3.07      The project would expand and replace equipment fleets on project
area farms through procurement of 350 trucks (6-8 ton capacity), 10
crawler tractors (140-150 hp), 60-wheeled tractors (45-50 hp), 10 utility
vehicles, and ancillary transportation, agricultural and construction equip-
ment. This equipment would serve the needs of present production activities
on project farms, as well as those of project construction. Trucks would be
used for on-farm and long-distance (100-200 km) transport of rubber, chemical
fertilizers, logs and sawn timber. Crawler tractors, equipped with tree
pushers, dozer blades and plows, would be used in land clearing, site prep-
aration and road building, to supplement labor-intensive methods. Wheeled
tractors would be used for land preparation and on farm transport of rubber
latex, chemical and organic fertilizer and other inputs. Utility vehicles,
vans and automobiles would meet personnel transportation needs of farms,
training and research centers and project management.
Wood Processing Facilities
3.08      The project would rehabilitate sawmills and construct timber
processing complexes to improve exploitation of timber resources, including
wood from old rubber and windbreaks. Old rubber trees felled in the replan-
ting program would yield about 30 cu m of sawlogs per ha and some fuelwood.
Regular thinnings of the windbreaks would yield another 30 cu m of poles and



- 15 -
fuelwood in year 10 and more thereafter. In the past, these resources have
been poorly utilized, due to lack of proper treatment of rubber wood after
felling and poorly equipped sawmills and woodworking shops on state farms.
The project would introduce proper chemical treatment to preserve rubber logs
after felling and would equip one sawmill on each state farm to increase
throughput and quality and reduce waste and work hazards. Each sawmill would
include a vertical bandsaw, a band resaw, log conveyor belts and secondary
woodworking equipment capable of handling about 35 cu m of round logs per day
on an 8-hour shift. Output would include sawn timber and simple furniture for
use on the farm. In addition, two integrated timber complexes would be
constructed in the project area. Each complex would include a sawmill, a
furniture plant, and a plant to produce wood-based panels. It would utilize
each year about 10,000 cu m of sawlogs in the furniture plant and up to
20,000 cu m of smallwood in the panel plant. Annual output per complex is
expected to be about 2.5 million pieces of furniture, or furniture compon-
ents, and 15,000 cu m of panels. The two complexes together would consume
only about 20% of the rubber wood from the felling of old trees in the
project and would continue to be supplied by logs from the ongoing rubber
replanting program after the project period.
Buildings and Utilities
3.09      As relatively self-sufficient, independent economic units, the state
farms are responsible for providing a wide range of physical infrastructure,
including housing, schools and clinics, as well as buildings for storage,
training, research and administration. Project construction would include
648,000 sq m for housing, 72,000 sq m for service buildings, 39,000 sq m for
schools and clinics, and 6,000 sq m for training centers. Construction of
housing would be limited to that required to accommodate additional workers
needed for the project. About 88% of the housing would be built in the
residential site to be established in the new plant areas and 12% would be
constructed in the replant areas. Construction standards would allot an
area (gross) of about 10 sq m/capita for housing, 0.2 sq m/student for
schools and 0.17 sq m/capita for clinics. This housing standard is modest,
costing about US$500 equivalent/capita, and can be compared with the present
national average of over 11 sq m/capita in rural China. Technical and
managerial staff would be allocated slightly more space than other workers,
although basic housing designs for all groups are similar. Some 80% of the
housing would be single storey, multiple family dwellings, while 20% would
be two storey buildings, all constructed of timber, brick and concrete.
Housing designs have been examined by the Association and are considered to
be reasonable. Fifteen regional centers for training and applied research,
each serving about five nearby state farms, would be created from existing
facilities, by adding 6,000 sq m of floorspace for laboratories, classrooms,
dormitories and small libraries. About 400 km of 10 kv transmission lines
and 780 km of telephone lines would be added, primarily to serve farms
engaged in new planting.



- 16 -
Rural Roads
3.10      The state farms would construct or upgrade about 780 km of rural
roads to provide access to state farms from public highways and link
residential centers within state farms. About 50% of this road construction
would take place in Tongza Prefecture, another 40% in Hainan Prefecture and
the balance in Zhanjiang. Roads would be designed and constructed to the
standards of the Guangdong Provincial General Bureau of State Farms. Roads
within the state farms, accounting for about 90% of rural road construction
in the project, would be of compacted earth and six meters in width. Roads
linking state farms to public highways, constituting about 10% of rural road
construction, would be seven meters wide. A central strip of 3.5 meters
width would have a rock fill base of 15 cm and would be gravel surfaced.
Road standards have been examined and are acceptable to the Association.
Training and Research
3.11      The project would equip fifteen regional extension and training
centers with audio-visual and basic laboratory equipment. These centers would
provide training in topics related to rubber planting and production, wind-
breaks, plant disease control, soil testing and fertilizer use. The project
would provide a total of about 31,000 mandays of training by these centers,
primarily for technicians and administrative personnel employed by project
farms and the joint ventures. The project would also support the costs of
on-farm training of the existing work force, including technical and
administrative staff, and of newly employed workers. This training, largely
in the form of on-the-job instruction by state farm technical and managerial
staff, would include some 30,000 training opportunities, totalling about
500,000 training days, of which 50,000 would be provided to commune members
participating in joint venture rubber production. The project would provide
scientific equipment to upgrade the prefectural rubber research and testing
institutes, which are responsible for applied research in rubber breeding,
soil management and fertilization, intensive tapping systems, disease and weed
control, chemical stimulation, cover cropping and rubber processing.
Technical Assistance
3.12      Higher level training for prefectural, provincial and CGB staff
would be expanded to include overseas short courses and study tours (in rubber
tapping, stimulation and processing, soil and leaf analysis, production and
management of fast growing tree species, estate management, audiovisual
techniques in training and extension, processing of rubber wood and furniture
manufacture) and degree programs (training to the BSc or MSc levels) in
forestry (1), genetics and breeding (1), soil chemistry (1), and agricultural
business and economics (1). Candidates for the degree program would be
selected from managerial and technical staff of the PGB and the prefectural
administrative bureaus.



- 17 -
3.13      China's natural rubber industry has been relatively isolated from
research and development activities in other rubber producing countries for
much of the past three decades. The staff development program would facili-
tate the flow of technical information from abroad. In addition to the
overseas training program, the project would provide 26 staff months of
technical assistance through visits and consultations by experts who will
examine specific technical and managerial areas of China's natural rubber
industry. This assistance has been costed at US$10,000 per man-month,
including travel, per diem and fees. Areas of emphasis would include assist-
ance in treatment and utilization of rubber wood, production of wood-based
panels, data management and computer training and in the formulation of an
applied research program in windbreak establishment and management. The
technical assistance component would include annual visits to China by an
expert who would carry out a comprehensive review of rubber development
generally, and project implementation specifically, to identify problems and
discuss findings with project and government authorities. Assurances were
obtained that all consultants engaged under the project would be employed in
accordance with the Bank Group guidelines on consultants.
Status of Design
3.14      All areas to be new planted or replanted have been surveyed and
estimates of the earthwork required have been made. Alignments of rural and
field roads have been selected and standard designs for farm, training and
research buildings have been completed. Technical specifications for chemical
fertilizers, farm and construction machinery and vehicles have been prepared.
Contract documents would follow closely those used for the Heilongjiang Land
Reclamation Project.
Implementation Schedule
3.15      The project would be implemented over a five-year period beginning
in late 1983 (Figure 3.1). Most project activities are under way as part
of the PGB's on-going program of rubber new planting and replanting. Some
felling and land preparation for windbreaks in parts of the project area
vulnerable to wind damage were started in 1983. The established rubber
nursery area in 1983 included about 1,200 ha and contained 21 million plants
of appropriate materials for field planting in 1984 and 1985. Nurseries for
the production of additional stumped buddings and seedlings for windbreaks
are being expanded to meet full project requirements. The 125 ha in wind-
break nurseries in 1983 are adequate to meet 1984 planting requirements.
Similar areas of windbreak nursery would be established in each subsequent
year. Land clearing and preparation of the project area, including felling of
old rubber trees in replant areas, began in October 1983. Rubber planting
would be completed in years 1984-87. The proposed phasing is 11,300, 13,400,
11,600, and 3,700 ha, respectively in those years, or about 85% of the total
area to be replanted or new planted to rubber in the province during



- 18 -
1984-88. A detailed work plan for the first year has been prepared by the
PGB; assurances were obtained from the Government that by September 30 of
each year a detailed work program and financing plan for the following year
would be prepared for Association review. Procurement actions for goods and
equipment would begin in late 1983, with first deliveries expected in
mid-1984.
Cost Estimates
3.16      Total project cost in mid-1983 prices is US$301.0 million (including
$2.7 million in taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of
$79.5 million, or 26% of the total.. Unit costs for rubber replanting and
new planting, windbreak establishment, roads and building construction are
based on expenditures by the state farms for carrying out similar activities
in the project prefectures. Prices for fertilizers and locally available
equipment are based on data provided to the PGB by local suppliers. Prices
for large agricultural machinery, related equipment and transport vehicles
are based on list price obtained from manufacturers. Physical contingencies
(6% of project base cost) equal 10% of base costs of construction (expenses
on buildings, wood processing facilities, transport and communication) and
5% of base costs of rubber and windbreak establishment. Assumed price
increases amount to 20% of the base cost plus physical contingencies and are
based on annual price escalation factors for goods and services of domestic
and foreign origin in US dollar equivalents of 7.5% in 1984, 7.0% in 1985,
and 6% annually in 1986, 1987 and 1988. A summary of project costs is shown
in Table 3.2 and details are given in Annex 2.
Financing
3.17      Bank Group assistance would be US$100 million (34% of the total
project cost net of duties), consisting of an IDA credit of SDR 37.8 million
(US$40 million equivalent) and an IDA Special Fund credit of SDR 56.8 million
(US$60 million equivalent). The balance of US$201.0 million equivalent
would be met from a combination of local sources, viz.:
(a)  funds from the central government budget totalling US$84.2 mil-
lion equivalent in 1984-88;
(b)  proceeds from the rubber development cess, totalling US$66.6 mil-
lion equivalent, which is levied against participating
state farms at the rate of US$182 (Y 346) per ton of rubber
produced; and
(c) contributions from profits retained by the state farms totalling
US$50.2 million equivalent.
Details of the financing plan are given in Annex 2, Table 4.

/a Includes duties of Y 5.0 million (US$2.7 million equivalent) on imported
fertilizers. Total project cost net of duties is US$298.3 million.
Procurement
3.18      The IDA credit would finance agricultural and construction machinery
and vehicles (US$15.6 million), a timber complex (US$6.0 million), training
and research equipment (US$1.2 million), plantation and windbreak establish-
ment (US$15.5 million) and technical assistance (US$1.3 million). Inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines
would be followed in the procurement of the first three categories above.
The IDA Special Fund credit would finance additional agricultural and con-
struction machinery and vehicles (US$3.3 million), a second timber complex
(US$5.9 million), sawmills (US$1.6 million), chemical fertilizers (US$22.4
million) and plantation and windbreak establishment (US$23.5 million). Under
the IDA Special Fund credit, procurement of all items in categories except
the last would be through ICB limited to suppliers from Part II countries
and those Part I countries eligible for Special Fund procurement. Domestic
manufacturers would receive a preference of 15% or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is less, in bid evaluation. Small items of equipment cost-
ing not more than US$50,000 each and US$1 million in total for the Special



- 20 -
Fund and US$3 million in total for IDA, would be procured on the basis of
three price quotations under procedures acceptable to the Association.
Establishment of rubber and windbreaks on state farms (US$143.9 million) and
in the joint ventures (US$13.4 million), construction of buildings (US$54.2
million) and roads (US$11.3 million) would be carried out by force account
employing the workers on participating state farms and communes. Because
these works would be relatively small, dispersed geographically and carried
out over the implementation period of the project, they would not be
suitable for ICB. Further details of the procurement arrangements are
provided in Annex 2, Table 7.
Disbursements
3.19      Disbursements under both the IDA credit and the IDA Special Fund
credit against expenditures for equipment, vehicles and goods would be at a
rate of 100% of the foreign exchange costs of imported items or 100% of the
ex-factory price of locally manufactured items. Disbursements for overseas
training and expert services would be 100% of total costs. Disbursement for
rubber and windbreak establishment on state farms, excluding chemical
fertilizer, would be 27% of total expenditures (11% from the IDA credit and
another 16% from the IDA Special Fund credit). Such disbursements would be
against statements of expenditure supported by progress reports showing
physical quantities and unit prices. Agreement has been reached at negotia-
tions with the Government on unit prices, as indicated in Annex 5, Table 1.
Unit prices would be updated annually by the PGB and reviewed by the
Association. No disbursements would be made against expenditures for land
development in the joint ventures, construction of rural roads, buildings
and utilities, and cost of domestic training other than costs of equipment
and vehicles. It is estimated that disbursement would be completed by about
June 1989. In view of the PGB's extensive experience with this type of
work, the projected disbursement schedule is shorter than the disbursement
profile for Bank Group Operations in perennial crop development in the
region. Estimated schedules of expenditures and disbursements are given in
Annex 2, Tables 2 and 5.
Accounts and Audits
3.20      Accounting systems are adequate to control project finance and
disbursements. The PGB maintains a comprehensive system of financial
administration and management in which accounting units at each administra-
tive level (production brigade, farm, prefectural administrative bureaus,
PGB, and central general bureau) submit aggregated financial accounts cover-
ing capital construction and production expenses to the next highest level.
These records are paralleled by similar accounts which are maintained within
the banking system and which permit cross checking at each administrative
level. Thorough audits are conducted by higher level units if discrepancies
are detected. Financial accounts of prefectural administrative bureaus are
aggregated by the PGB and sent to the MAAF, the Ministry of Finance, and
provincial offices of disbursing banks. The PGB would maintain a separate
project account in sufficient detail to record expenditures on the major



- 21 -
expenditure categories indicated in Table 3.2. Assurances were obtained
that the PGB would maintain such accounts and that they would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Association and submitted
within six months of the close of each financial year. The audit review
would examine and determine that funds disbursed against statements of
expenditure (SOE) had been used for the purpose for which they were
provided. It is expected that the central government's recently-established
General Auditing Office would audit the PGB project accounts when that
office becomes capable of taking on this responsibility. Meanwhile, it is
expected that annual audits would be carried out by the Ministry of Finance.
Environmental Effects
3.21      The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact.
Improved techniques in windbreak establishment and utilization are expected
to enhance timber and fuelwood supplies and thereby reduce depletion of
existing forests. The planting of additional windbreaks will help to
maintain ground cover and reduce surface runoff and the destructive effect
of typhoons. It is not expected that any environmental problems would arise
from land clearing and planting of rubber and windbreaks because of the
sound conservation practices which have been developed over some 30 years of
experience. These include proper terracing, retaining natural cover
wherever possible, restricting rubber cultivation to lands with slopes of
less than about 47% (250) and establishing leguminous cover crops or
intercrops. Appropriate fertilizer programs would be established to
maintain soil tilth and fertility.  Other agricultural chemicals, largely
herbicides, would be used carefully and in limited quantities.  Assurances
were obtained that provisions would be made by the PGB for proper treatment
of effluents from plants processing rubber produced in the project.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Management and Coordination
4.01      The administrative structure of China's state farm system includes
the Central General Bureau (CGB) within the MAAF, the provincial general
bureaus, the prefectural administrative bureaus and the state farms (Figures
4.1, 4.2). A state farm in Guangdong Province is typically divided into an
administrative headquarters, operational districts (or subfarms) and
specialized production brigades (Figure 4.3). The CGB has responsibility
for helping formulate and implement national policies regarding state farms
and is a conduit for investment funds from the state budget. It is respon-
sible for overall investment planning in the state farm system, for allocat-
ing production and sales quotas to provincial state farm bureaus and ensur-
ing the availability of materials needed to implement planned investments in
the provinces. General bureaus at provincial level-are responsible to the



- 22 -
CGB on matters of general policy and finance and to respective provincial
governments on matters of personnel and local policies. Provincial bureaus
provide policy guidance and administrative and technical support to the
prefectural bureaus which, in turn, exercise control over individual state
farms through well-developed lines of authority.
4.02      Guangdong Provincial General Bureau (PGB).  The PGB is administra-
tively a part of the Guangdong Provincial Government, but is also responsible
to the CGB for carrying out the CGB-approved investment program and for
returning to the center a portion of profits earned by the provincial state
farm system. The PGB allocates to prefectural bureaus the capital and
operating funds from the state budget and approves the investment program to
be undertaken by prefectural bureaus. The PGB also sets production and sales
quotas for prefectural bureaus which in turn allot these quotas to individual
farms. The PGB comprises 13 divisions or offices which provide, through the
prefectural bureaus, a wide range of technical and administrative services,
including research, marketing, health, education and culture.
4.03      Prefectural Bureaus and State Farms.  The four local administrative
bureaus in Guangdong correspond geographically to Hainan, Tongza, Zhanjiang
and Shantou Prefectures. There is very little rubber in Shantou Prefecture
and this administrative bureau is not participating in the project. The
prefectural bureaus are the links between the PGB and individual state farms
and provide them with policy guidance and technical and administrative
support. The organizational structure of the prefectural administrative
bureaus includes specialized crop production support units, construction
units and other service units including research, processing, marketing,
health and education (Figure 4.2). State farms in the province are
organized similarily. Support units at farm headquarters are available to
service the specialized production brigades in each of the operations
districts. The production brigade, consisting on average of about 150
workers, is the basic management and accounting unit on state farms.
4.04      The project would be implemented by the Guangdong Provincial
General Bureau of State Farms and Land Reclamation, although the Planning
Office of the CGB would exercise an oversight function and would have primary
responsibility for liaison with the Association. Within the PGB a Project
Management Committee, comprised of the heads of key divisions, has been
established to provide policy guidance and coordinate project implementation
(Figure 4.4). A Project Management Office, made up of administrative and
technical staff of the PGB, would be responsible for day-to-day activities
in executing the project. Similar groups would be established within the
prefectural bureaus and on participating state farms and communes. An
assurance was obtained that the Project Management Office would be maintained
during project implementation and be adequately staffed with qualified
personnel.



- 23 -
Financial Management
4.05      Funds for capital investment and operating expenses of the state
farm system in Guangdong are provided through a combination of grants from
the Central Government, retained profits from the state farms, replanting
and depreciation charges and bank loans. Grants from the Central Government
are used for capital construction, circulating capital and special purposes
such as small-scale water conservancy projects, social services and adminis-
trative expenses of the prefectural bureaus and the PGB. Annual appropria-
tions from the Central Government to the Guangdong state farm system averaged
Y 168.5 million in 1980 and 1981. Bank loans include short-term funds and
medium-term loans for equipment purchase and tree crop development. State
farm profits retained within the province in 1981 totalled Y 111.7 million,
an increase of 33% from 1980. Some of the funds for replanting originate in a
cess which had been levied at the rate (1982) of Y 400 per ton of rubber
produced, but which is to be reduced to Y 346 in 1983. Seventy percent of
this charge is retained for subsequent use in the individual state farm's
"modernization and renewal" account at the local branch of the Agricultural
Bank; 20% is passed upward to the prefectural administrative bureau; and 10%
goes to the PGB.
4.06      Upward financial flows from the state farm system in the province
include, in addition to the rubber development cess, an agricultural tax
assessed at the rate of 3.5% of the value of rubber production, a 7% tax
(1982) on net profits of rubber producing farms, and an industrial-
commercial (turnover) tax on activities other than rubber production.
Rubber is exempted from this latter tax because it is a key producer good.
All taxes are collected at the level of individual state farms and go
directly to the local tax bureau, or the local government in the case of the
7% tax on rubber profits. The agricultural tax is included in provincial
budgetary revenues and the industrial-commercial tax is shared between the
province and the Central Government, Rubber production is exempt from the
agricultural tax during the first three years of tapping. Of the 7% tax on
net profits of rubber producing state farms, 4% is earmarked for commune
development and 3% is retained for use by the county.
4.07      State farms in Guangdong operate within a well-developed financial
system characterized by increasing profits (Y 221.7 million in 1981, up
14% from 1980) and a robust balance sheet indicating a small amount of
short and long term debt. With the introduction of the economic responsi-
bility system in 1979, financial management has become increasingly
decentralized. Each administrative unit (state farm, prefectural bureau,
PGB) is assigned a fixed target for profits to be remitted to the next higher
level (or subsidy to be received from that level). If a state farm exceeds
its profit remittance target, it is allowed to keep 70% of the surplus but
must remit 30% to the prefectural bureau. Prefectural bureaus retain 20% of
excess profits earned in their respective jurisdictions but remit 10% to the
PGB. In Guangdong annual profit targets have been established through 1985.



- 24 -
The PGB remitted Y 110 million of system profits to the Central Government
annually in 1980 and 1981; this is to increase to Y 140 million in 1985. In
1981 financial flows from the Central Government to Guangdong's state farm
system (about Y 165 million) exceeded the total remitted upward (Y 145 mil-
lion) by the provincial state farm system to government budgets at all
levels, (county, provincial, center). Details of the distribution of profits
from the provincial state farm system in 1980 and 1981 are indicated in
Table 4.1. Notable features include the increased retentions by production
brigades and state farms, increased contributions to local governments and
communes and the smaller relative distribution to the Central Government.
In 1981 about 50% of total profits were remitted to the Central Government
and 32% were retained by production brigades and state farms.
4.08      The domestic financing of the proposed project is not expected to
place an inordinate burden on the state farm system. Funds from the re-
planting cess have been running at about Y 80 million annually, or more than
three times the expected average annual financial contributions to the
project from this source. The Central Government grant in 1981 and 1982 to
the provincial system averaged about Y 168 million, as compared with Y 32
million annually expected from this source in the project. Profits retained
in the province in 1980 and 1981 averaged Y 98 million, compared with Y 19
million annually of project finance from this source. The 50 farms in the
project account for 35% of all state farms in Guangdong and 55% of the state
farm rubber area in the province. Assurances were obtained that the
Government will provide the funds, services and other resources necessary to
bring the project plantings into production.
Execution of Project Works
4.09      All agricultural development and construction activities in the
project would be carried out by specialized units within participating state
farms and communes. Project buildings, roads, and communication facilities
would be constructed by farm-level construction brigades using designs and
standards developed by the technical and engineering divisions of the PGB.
Construction activities would be supervised by PGB staff. Agricultural
development, including land clearing and planting, nursery operations,
intercropping, and establishment of windbreaks would be carried out by
production brigades on participating farms and communes. Participating
farms would enter into annual contracts with individual brigades on the
farms to carry out specific development tasks within a given level of
expenditure. From this budget the brigade would pay wages of its members
and finance the costs of production inputs. Project inputs such as
fertilizers, fuels and building materials would be supplied through a
well-developed system of supply and marketing units at the state farms.
These units are linked to government supply departments which maintain
offices at the prefectural and provincial bureaus. In land clearing and
planting, targets of brigades would relate to the amount of land cleared,
the quality of work performed and the survival rate of the young rubber.

years).



- 26 -
Maintenance tasks specified by the contract would relate to terrace upkeep,
weeding, fertilization and mulching. Bonuses depend in part on satisfactory
growth rate of the young rubber. Payment to tappers would be determined by
the volume of latex produced and the quality of the tapping (absence of
damage to the tree, etc.).
4.10      Intercropping during Years 1-3 of the rubber planting would be
practiced where soils and topography are suitable. About 2,000 ha would be
intercropped to pineapple and sugarcane using paid labor of the state farm
workers and other production workers supplied by the state farms. Another
4,000 ha would be allocated to individual families for the production of
groundnuts and sweet potatoes, or other crops which are agronomically
suitable and profitable. State farms would assist production on these
privately-operated plots by providing technical assistance and production
inputs. State farms would fell, clear, destump, plough and harrow the land
at no charge to the intercropper. Each participating family would receive
up to one ha for the entire intercropping period and would agree to proper
cultural practices, including weeding and care of the young rubber. The
application of fertilizers to the rubber plants would be done separately by
workers of the state farms. At the end of the intercropping period
(generally Year 3), participants would plant cover crops using seed and
fertilizer provided by the farms. State farms would recover the costs of
materials provided and all net returns would accrue to participating
families.
Management of State Farm-Commune Joint Ventures
4.11      The 4,000 ha to be developed through joint-venture arrangements
would be located primarily on commune lands adjacent to the proposed 16 parti-
cipating state farms (5 farms in Hainan Prefecture with joint ventures total-
ling 2,500 ha; 7 in Tongza on 800 ha; and 4 in Zhanjiang on 700 ha). Commune
production brigades would supply their land and labor, while state farms
would provide finance, production inputs (largely planting materials and
chemical fertilizers) and technical guidance. A written contract would
govern each joint venture and would remain valid for the economic life of
the rubber planting. Individual joint ventures would be implemented under
the direction of a Project Management Group comprised of managerial and
technical staff of participating communes and state farms. Technical
standards of production, specified in governing documents, would help ensure
effective use of land and financial resources. Ownership of land under
joint ventures would continue to reside with the commune production brigade,
while rubber trees and windbreaks would be jointly owned by the two partners
in the venture.
4.12      Net benefits would be allocated in accordance with each party's
contribution to production. Financial resources would derive in large part
from the retained profits of participating state farms, although



- 27 -
supplementary funds would be provided by the provincial administrative
bureaus and the PGB. Rubber production from joint ventures would be
processed on state farm facilities and marketed through established state
marketing facilities. Decisions regarding the processing and marketing of
other production from joint ventures would be made jointly by participants.
Accounting and management systems would be developed by technical personnel
of participating state farms in accordance with established standards.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.13      The state farm system in Guangdong province has in place a well-
developed system which provides timely and detailed technical and financial
information to management at all administrative levels. Benchmark data on
yields, production, employment and incomes are generally available on
participating state farms. Data collection systems and benchmark
information on participating communes are likely to be less comprehensive.
Each state farm and commune would provide information on project
implementation on a regular basis to the Project Management Office of the
PGB, primarily to assist in the efficient implementation of the project.
The Project Management Office in turn would prepare twice-yearly reports on
the progress of the project and submit these reports to the Association
within two months of the end of each project semester. At the end of the
disbursement period, the Project Management Office, together with Central
General Bureau of State Farms and Land Reclamation, would prepare an
assessment of project results and compare these with appraisal estimates.
Agricultural Support Services
4.14      Agricultural research.  Basic research on rubber and most other
tropical tree crops in China is carried out by the South China Academy of
Tropical Crops (SCATC), which is attached to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Animal Husbandry and Fisheries (MAAF) and jointly operated by MAAF and the
Guangdong Provincial Government. The SCATC, located on Hainan Island,
comprises six research institutes and four experimental farms covering 6,220
ha. The Academy employs some 400 technical personnel, of whom 27 are senior
research staff. A major thrust of SCATC research has been the search for
high-yielding, cold resistant rubber clones through selection and plant
breeding, including tissue culture techniques. The SCATC would play a
supportive role in the project by providing research results, planting
materials and technical guidance to the prefectural research institutes.
4.15      Rubber research of an applied nature is largely the responsibility
of the three research and one testing units attached to the prefectural
administrative bureaus. The Rubber Research Institute, Wencheng County,
Hainan Administrative Bureau, employs 33 senior research staff, and operates
an experimental station of 1,820 ha (of which 616 are in rubber). A major
research emphasis has been the development of wind resistant rubber clones.
A branch station on a state farm is exploring new techniques of tea and



- 28 -
rubber inter-cropping in typhoon-prone areas. The Tropical Crops Research
Institute, Baoting County, Tongza Administrative Bureau, operates an area of
4,000 ha (of which 1,060 are in rubber) and is staffed by 30 senior research
workers. Major research responsibilities include the development of disease
resistant, high-yielding rubber clones and work on new tapping techniques.
The Rubber Research Institute, Huazhou County, Zhanjiang Administrative
Bureau, is developing high-yielding planting materials which are cold
tolerant. The 20 senior research staff have available about 630 ha, of
which 100 are experimental plots. A branch station on the Leizhou Peninsula
is carrying out work on wind tolerant planting materials and windbreak
improvement. The Rubber Specification Testing Center, Haikou City, Hainan
Administrative Bureau, with 20 senior technical staff, consists of
laboratories to test dry rubber, latex and rubber products and provide soil
and plant tissue analyses to state farms.
4.16      Research at the SCATC is funded largely by grants from the state
budget through the MAAF. Research at the prefectural research institutes is
financed through the replanting cess and depreciation funds provided by the
regional administrative bureaus (38% of the total in 1982), funds from the
PGB (48%) and a small grant (accounting for 13% of total research expediture
by the prefectural institute) from MAAF for high priority projects. In 1982
the costs of operating the prefectural-level research institutes was about Y
4 million, or less than one percent of the gross value of rubber produced in
Guangdong during that year. The project would assist the prefectural-level
research institutes by supplying laboratory and other research equipment and
by providing consulting services on specialized research topics.
4.17      Training.  Specialized training related to rubber production and
processing is provided through training programs operated by the state
farms, by prefectural administrative bureaus and by the PGB. The PGB and
SCATC are responsible for training state farm directors and providing
refresher courses for agronomists and engineers. The prefectural bureaus
and their subordinate research institutes train other state farm staff and
junior technical personnel. State farm extension stations, which have been
established on 120 farms in the province, are responsible for training of
farm workers. These extension stations, which employ about 500 technical
personnel and manage 2,500 ha of experimental and demonstration plots, have
the major responsibility to transfer the technology developed at the
prefectural research institutes to state farms. Operating expenses of the
stations have been financed from the replanting cess and depreciation
charges levied against individual farms.
4.18      The project would upgrade 15 of the existing extension stations to
regional extension centers in different agro-climatic areas. Administrative
support for the centers would be provided by the farms on which the centers
are located while technical support would be the responsibility of
prefectural research institutes. These centers would train primarily the
technical and skilled staff of state farms and joint ventures in specialized



- 29 -
topics related to propagation of planting materials, weed control, soil and
foliar sampling techniques and rubber processing. Training opportunities
would be offered to technical staff of non-project farms and communes when
facilities are available. The project would assist in the construction and
equipping of these centers and support them indirectly by providing
specialized consulting services and advanced-level training opportunities
for technical staff.
V. PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, MARKETING AND PRICES
Rubber Nurseries
5.01      The choice of clones for the project area reflects the need to
balance high yield attributes with resistance to disease, wind and low
temperatures. About 38% of the project area would be planted to RRIM 600,
27% to PR 107, 9% to GT 1, 8% to Haiken 1 and 18% to other less well-known,
but promising materials (Haiken 2, Hongxing 1, Tafeng 95, Nanhua 1 and
others). The RRIM 600 plantings would be concentrated in Tongza Prefecture
and southwestern Hainan Prefecture where winds and low temperatures are less
problematic, while the more cold-resistant Haiken 1, GT 1 and PR 107 are
better suited for Zhanjiang and northern Hainan Prefectures (Annex 3, Table
1). The newer clones would be widely dispersed through establishment of
clone observation plots of two ha per clone, or multiple thereof, on each
participating farm. This would permit an early assessment of their general
suitability for future large-scale plantings. Nurseries are being developed
to supply this mix of clones in a planting program in which about 80% of the
area would be planted to bare root budded stumps and at least 20% to high
stumped buddings. A small number of polybag buddings would be made
available for use as replacements and in limited plantings in Tongza
Prefecture. The record with stumped buddings is good - over 95% survival
rate has been achieved - and state farms would be encouraged to increase the
area planted to this type of material beyond 20% of the total. Incremental
nursery requirements for the project total about 180 ha, with the largest
increase needed for the stumped buddings.
Rubber Planting and Maintenance
5.02      All land with a gradient of over 5% (30) would be contour lined
and terraced and no rubber would be planted on land with slopes of over
about 47% (250). Felling of old trees would be done largely with the use
of chain saws and hand tools. Where root disease is not a problem, and
intercropping is not practiced, tree stumps would be left in the ground and
treated with appropriate chemicals to hasten the kill and natural decay.
Root disease surveys would be carried out in all fields scheduled for
replanting. Removal of stumps would be necessary in areas to be
mechanically terraced, intercropped or devoted to nurseries and some types
of windbreaks. Terraces would be cut by hand or, where topography permits,



- 30 -
by tractor. Planting densities of rubber would range from 600-650 trees per
ha. Tree spacings would be not less than 2.0 m between trees and not more
than 8.0 m between rows.
5.03      The project would continue present practices of using both organic
and chemical fertilizers, although trials would be carried out to determine
whether alternative fertilizer programs are preferable. Organic manure
consists of animal dung and vegetative matter of weeds (Eupatorium odoratum)
and cultivated leguminous bushes (Tephrosia candida). Chemical fertilizer
would include nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and, in few areas,
magnesium. Application rates would vary over the tree life and would be
based on soil and leaf analysis. In general, applications would include
about 16 kg of N and 70 kg per ha of P205 at planting and 160, 50, and 30
kg per ha of N, P205 and K20, respectively, in each of the years 2-7 of
the rubber planting and 130, 50 and 40 kg of N, P205 and K20 annually
during maturity. Some 6-15 tons/ha of organic fertilizer also would be
applied annually.
Intercropping and Cover Crops
5.04      In the rubber's immature phase, the planted area would be
intercropped, planted to leguminous cover crops, or left under natural
covers. Intercropping would be restricted to planted areas with slopes of
150 or less. The steepest lands would be kept under natural cover which
would be enriched by planting of legume covers. It is expected that about
10,000 ha (25% of the area to be replanted or new planted) would be
intercropped (gross intercropped area) and that the net intercropped area
would be about 6,000 ha. Of the net intercropped area, the state farms are
expected to plant 1,000 ha to pineapple (two crops in three years with a
yield of 22.5 tons/ha/crop) and 1,000 ha to sugarcane (two crops in three
years with a yield of 37.5 tons/ha/crop). The remaining 4,000 net
intercropped ha would be planted to annual crops (groundnuts, sweet potatoes,
etc.) under arrangements in which state farms allot the land for private use
to workers and staff of the farms. Crops other than sweet potatoes and
peanuts may prove superior and experimentation with other feasible crops
would be encouraged by farm managers. In the project, assumed yields for
sweet potatoes and groundnuts are 15 and 0.75 tons/ha/crop, respectively,
with two crops each year.
5.05      Where intercropping is not practiced or natural cover retained,
leguminous covers would be established. The preferred cover is a mixture of
Pueraria phaseoloides, Calopogonium mucunoides and Centrosema pubescens.
Experimental plantings also would be undertaken to determine the feasibility
of commercial production and export of high value leguminous seeds (e.g.
Pueraria phaseoleides and Calopogonium caeruleum) which are in great demand
in other natural rubber producing countries as covers but which set seed
poorly in those countries. No net financial returns have been assumed in
the project analysis from production of cover crop seeds. Successful
production of commercial seed from leguminous covers would enhance financial



- 31 -
flows in the early years of the project. Cover crops would receive 30 kg/ha
of N and 30 kg/ha of P205 at planting and another 30 kg of P205 in each
of the years 2-4 of the planting.
Windbreaks
5.06      In wind-prone areas, windbreaks generally would be established one
to two years before field planting of rubber. Windbreak areas would be
clean cleared and the land prepared by disc ploughing to 30-35 cms depth,
followed by harrowing. Camellia oleosa would continue to be the dominant
species for the lowest tier while Acacia confusa would be planted for
middle-tier protection. Although Eucalyptus exserta is now widely planted
to provide upper-tier protection, the project would support field trials to
identify other promising varieties for this purpose. At present plant
spacing is 1 m x 1 m (10,000 plants/ha) or 1 m x 1.5 m (6,700 plants/ha).
Under the project, most of the windbreaks would be planted at a density of
1.5 x 2 m (3,300 trees/ha; 2 m between rows and 1.5 m between plants),
although trials would be undertaken to assess windbreak performance (wind
protection and timber production) at wider spacing such as 2.5 m x 2.5 m
(1,600 plants/ha) which also offer reduced costs of establishment. Chemical
and organic fertilizers would be applied during the first three years after
planting. Under these cultural practices, commercial thinning can be
carried out at ages 10 and 18 years and clear felling at 32 years. Total
wood production (fuelwood, poles, logs) over the life of the planting is
projected to be about 275 cu m/ha of windbreak.
Tapping and Production
5.07      Tapping on rubber plantings would commence when 50% of the trees
in the planting have a girth (measured 150 cm above ground level) of at
least 50 cm. It is expected that this condition would be largely met in the
eighth year from planting in Tongza and Hainan Prefectures and in the ninth
year in Zhanjiang. Where large stumped buddings are planted in Hainan and
Tongza, the trees are expected to reach tappable size in the seventh year
(i.e., after six years of immaturity). Reflecting different soil and weather
conditions and the mix of clones to be planted, rubber yields on state farms
are expected to be highest in Tongza Prefecture (averaging 1,460 kg/ha over
28 years of tapping and peaking at 2,050 kg/ha in the thirteenth year of
tapping) and lowest in Zhanjiang (an average of 1,120 kg/ha and a peak yield
of 1,530 kg/ha). Yields on the state farm-commune joint ventures are
projected to be about 6% lower than yields in Zhanjiang (Annex 3). Yields
in the project area have been adjusted to reflect weather conditions (cool
temperatures in Zhanjiang, possible wind damage in Hainan and Tongza). In
general, half spiral, alternate daily tapping would be practiced, although
for clones susceptible to brown bast (RRIM 600, Haiken 2, Hongxing 1, Tafeng
95, Nanhua 1), the half spiral, every third day system would be followed in
the first three years of tapping. Chemical stimulants would be used on slow
yield starters (PR 107, GT 1) during the first three years of tapping.
Farms would be encouraged to employ upward tapping with stimulants in the
old rubber to be felled for replanting and in the rubber replanted and



- 32 -
newplanted in the project in the last five years of tapping. At peak
production (about Year 2003), the yearly rubber output from the project is
expected to be about 72,000 tons.
Processing and Marketing
5.08      China produces a relatively high grade of rubber.  In 1981 55% of
production was block rubber, 25% was smoked sheet, 17% was latex concen-
trate and the remaining 3% was in the form of crepe rubbers. About 75% of
1981 production graded No. 1 on the basis of grading standards similar to
those used by the Malaysian rubber industry. State farms in the project
prefectures have a total installed rubber processing capacity in 186 fac-
tories of 892 tons per day, or (at 220 operational days/year) about 200,000
tons/year. This capacity, though approximately double 1982 prefectural
output, is widely dispersed and generally in uneconomically-small factories
(average daily capacity of about 4.8 tons). Under the project, 85% of the
output is to be processed into standard block rubber, 9% as latex concentrate
and 6% as crepes. Experience elsewhere suggests that the minimum size
factory for efficient operations in block rubber production is about 20
tons/day in two shift operations. Additional block rubber processing
capacity would be required in the project by the early to mid-1990s. In the
interim, a study would be carried out by the PGB to determine the optimum
size and phasing of factory construction, taking into account the location
of participating farms and communes and the economies of scale in modern
processing facilities. Project costs do not include investment in rubber
processing capacity, but these costs are included in the financial and
economic analysis. Assurances were obtained that, upon completion of the
project, the Government would construct adequate processing facilities.
5.09      All rubber produced in China is purchased by the state through the
National Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (NFSMC) which
maintains offices on most state farms. Rubber production on communes is
usually processed by nearby state farms and marketed by the farms' marketing
units. Prices for natural rubber vary slightly according to quality, but
the basic price of Y 6,090/ton, ex-Haikou or Zhanjiang, has been maintained
for several years to stimulate production and is uniform throughout China's
rubber-growing areas.
5.10      Future population growth in China (perhaps 1.2%/yr) and annual
gains in per capita income (say 4%) would be expected to translate into growth
of domestic consumption of rubber of about 4.0% p.a. This compares with
the 4.3% annual growth registered in the 1970-72 to 1979-81 period.
Official projections of domestic supply for NR and SR are not available,
although an additional 160,000 tons/year of SR capacity reportedly is under
construction. In the next decade expansion of SR capacity may be limited by
tight domestic crude oil supplies, although this constraint could be eased
in later years if large supplies of crude materialize from new sources.
Four percent annual growth in total rubber consumption in China implies
rubber usage by the year 2000 of nearly one million tons. Increased
domestic supplies of NR can be expected from the 165,000 ha of immature



- 33 -
rubber (1980) which will come into tapping in the next several years and
production from the new planting and replanting planned for the next 10
years. A plausible supply scenario would include little additional SR
production beyond the 160,000 tons noted above to about 300,000 tons in
total. The NR demand in the Year 2000 of 700,000 tons (1 million tons total
consumption less 300,000 tons domestic SR capacity) can be compared with
1981 NR production of 115,000 tons and annual incremental production from
this project at peak output of 72,000 tons. It is expected that the
domestic market will easily absorb project output.
5.11      Marketing of other project output should present no difficulties.
Incremental supplies from the intercrops would be relatively small and would
be limited to the early years of the project. Pineapple production of
22,500 tons annually in 1986 and 1987 would be processed by nearby
canneries. Sugarcane production of 37,500 tons/year in 1985 and 1986 would
be milled on nearby state farms which have ample spare processing capacity.
Sugar output would be sold in the local market where consumption is growing
at more than 4% annually. Groundnut and sweet potato production, averaging
2,550 tons and 69,000 tons per year, respectively, in 1984-86, would be
consumed by producing families or sold through local markets. Growing
shortages of timber products (particularly poles and sawlogs) in the project
area imply ready markets for wood from old rubber trees and for the timber
produced in the windbreaks. Most of the output from the timber complexes
(furniture and panels) is expected to be marketed domestically to supply
needs of the expanding housing and construction industries.
Financial and Economic Prices
5.12      Farmgate financial prices generally are projected to remain
constant in mid-1983 values, in view of the Government's commitment to
maintain agricultural production incentives and avoid undue inflationary
pressures. Economic prices for rubber and chemical fertilizers are based
on Bank Group price forecasts, adjusted for location and quality differences
and expressed in mid-1983 values. Conversion factors are used to derive
economic prices for items which do not enter into international trade.
Details on economic and financial prices and conversion factors are in
Annex 4. Financial and economic costs of construction are estimated to be
roughly equal. Although the financial cost of labor in construction is
substantially higher than its economic costs, the financial costs of
construction materials tend to be lower than their economic costs.
5.13      The economic cost of labor is considered to be in the range of
Y 0.50/man-day. This relatively low economic value for labor in the
project area reflects the existing large element of underutilized labor and
the likelihood that the state farm labor force may continue to grow more
rapidly than remunerative work opportunities. Authorities estimate that
95,000 workers on state farms in the three prefectures (15% of the work
force) are surplus in the sense that they could be withdrawn with little or
no impact on production; the comparable figure for the project farms is
35,000 workers, or 12% of their work force. Underemployment on neighboring



- 34 -
communes also is substantial. Possibilities for migration of excess labor
to other areas are severely limited by official policy and lack of job
opportunities elsewhere. About 20,000 middle school graduates enter the
labor force of the Guangdong state farms each year. At this rate, the
increase in the state farm labor force during project implementation
(1984-88) would be more than twice the number of net full-time jobs expected
to be created by the project in rubber production and processing at full
development (para. 6.02). The financial wage of Y 1.50/man-day paid in the
project area is considered to substantially exceed the value of labor's
marginal product and contains welfare elements. The assumed economic cost
of labor of Y 0.50 may be compared with the estimated cost of about Y 0.40
per day of additional consumption (largely food) associated with physical
labor.
5.14      The current financial price for rubber is more than twice the
economic (world) price projected for 1983. This reflects efforts to stimu-
late rubber production and the need for state farms to finance social over-
head costs and physical infrastructure. In view of expected increased
domestic demand for rubber and, given China's potential for expanded pro-
duction at satisfactory economic rates of return, a favorable economic
encironment for rubber production should be maintained. Financial prices
are assumed to remain greater than economic prices, although this differ-
ential is expected to decline as world prices for rubber are projected to
rise in real terms. An understanding was reached that the Government would
examine over the next two years its production and management systems in
natural rubber, with a view to further increasing efficiency. This exam-
ination would cover major cost categories such as labor, material inputs,
and infrastructural costs, the possibilities for cost reductions, yield pros-
pects and their effects on production costs, and recommendations for cost
reductions. Continued productivity gains should permit some reduction in
producer prices, although this would be best done over time as part of a
general price reform. A reduction in the financial price in the short-run
would reduce or eliminate the flow of profits which rubber farms now remit
to the central government. Over time lower prices probably would encourage
the use of less labor in rubber, although employment for displaced labor
would be difficult to find. For fuelwood, poles and sawlogs, financial
prices are only about half as high as economic prices. Among the
intercrops, financial prices in 1983 are equal to or greater than economic
prices.
VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Production Benefits
6.01      New planting and replanting of 40,000 ha of rubber would add an
annual average of 54,000 tons of rubber production, equivalent to at least
5% of China's total rubber consumption in the year 2000. Windbreaks on
12,000 ha would provide 3.3 million cu m of timber, of which 1.3 million cu m



- 35 -
would be sawlogs, over a 32-year period. An additional 0.45 million cu m of
sawlogs would result from the felling of old rubber trees prior to replant-
ing. Improved wood processing technology is expected to increase the value
added from old rubber trees and windbreaks. Intercropping during three
years of the rubber's immature phase would yield 45,000 tons of pineapple,
75,000 tons of sugarcane, 7,650 tons of groundnuts and 207,000 tons of sweet
potatoes for local markets.
Employment and Income
6.02      The traditional concept of farm income derived from an individually
operated plot is not applicable in the project area where land is owned by
the state and managed by state farms which employ wage labor. Pre-project
per capita incomes of families on state farms in Guangdong Province averaged
(1982) about Y 370 (US$195) p.a. State farm workers receive an annual basic
wage of about Y 550, various subsidies and bonuses averaging Y 215 p.a., and
other benefits such as housing, medical care and retirement averaging Y 112.
Income per worker thus totals about Y 879 p.a., or Y 3.25/man-day, assuming
270 workdays/year. Total income (cash and in kind) per worker on state
farms is comparable to other state enterprises in China, but appears to be
substantially greater than incomes of commune workers in the project area.
Because incomes of state farm workers are already relatively high, despite a
continuing labor surplus, further increases in real wages on state farms are
not foreseen. The income benefits of the project, therefore, are likely to
take the form of some income gains for commune members in the joint ventures
and greater employment opportunities for the unemployed or underemployed.
This will be important in both the state farm and the collective sector.
6.03      The state farm-commune joint ventures are expected to provide
supplementary employment opportunities for commune members equivalent to
3,400 full-time jobs per year during project implementation at a wage of
Y 1.5 per man-day. At full development, the tapping and processing of
rubber from 40,000 ha would require an additional 12.1 million man-days
annually, excluding managerial and support labor. Assuming 270 work-days/
year/worker, this would create about 44,800 job equivalents, of which 10%
would be among commune members engaged in joint venture rubber production.
The incremental work requirements on state farms are likely to be met by
new entrants to the labor force, transfers from other farms and, possibly,
additional labor time from those already working, but underemployed. The
joint venture jobs would go to underemployed commune workers. In view of
the considerable degree of underemployment on both state farms and communes,
the number of net new full-time jobs created in rubber production and
processing at full development may be less than the 44,800 job equivalents
estimated for the project. However, additional employment also would be
created in intercropping, in the forestry and wood processing activities and
in managerial and technical support services.



- 36 -
6.04      The major objective of the project is to increase the supply of
natural rubber and its effect on income distribution would be limited. The
most important distributional element of the project is likely to be its
support of the recent state farm initiative to assist rubber development on
nearby communes. In addition to the production, income and employment
benefits to communes from this component, the technology provided to the
communes in the form of improved planting materials and cultural practices
would be helpful in rubber development elsewhere in that sector. Average
rubber yields in the joint ventures are expected to be at least five times
current yields on communes in Guangdong Province. A second distributional
element of the project would be the expected increase in financial
assistance regularly provided from profits of state farms to assist commune
agriculture.
Financial Analysis
6.05      The financial rates of return (FRRs) for rubber and timber
production in Hainan, Tongza, Zhanjiang Prefectures and the joint ventures are
in the range of 13 to 16%. The effects on the FRR of lower rubber yields
assumed in Zhanjiang are approximately offset by early revenues from the
relatively large area under intercrops made possible by more level terrain in
that prefecture. Relatively low financial costs of labor in the joint
ventures (Y 1.50 per day as compared with Y 3.25 on state farms) help to
bolster their FRRs. The FRR for a timber complex which produces furniture and
particle board is about 22%.
6.06      The cash flow analysis (Annex 4, Table 5 ) suggests that income from
felling of old windbreaks and rubber, from the timber complexes, and from
intercrops would make a sizeable contribution to revenue flows during
implementation (1984-88) of the project. The projected cash deficit during
these early years would be financed from retained profits of state farms and
funds from the rubber development cess. The cumulative cash deficit of about
Y 145 million (US$76.4 million) in 1989-92 would require continued funding
from state farm earnings and the development cess. Beginning in 1993, project
income from rubber production and wood processing would regularly exceed
costs.
Cost and Rent Recovery
6.07      Recovery by the Central Government of capital grants and proceeds
from the IDA and Special Fund credits would be made through a combination of
agricultural taxes, profit remittances and the replanting cess. At full
development farms would pay (in constant 1983 values) Y 19.3 million annually
through the development cess, debt service obligations to the Central
Government of Y 4.0 million and taxes on rubber production at the rate of 3.5%
of gross value. In addition, participating farms and joint ventures would



- 37 -
remit about 50% of profits to the Central Government (based on current rates)
and 7% to local governments and adjoining communes. In present value terms,
with all annual values discounted at 12% over the 35-year project life, these
charges would be equivalent to 78% of project rent (Annex 4, Table 6). On
this basis the cost recovery index for contribution from the Central
Government (Y 160 million) and the IDA and Special Fund credits (Y 190
million) would be 166%. These rent and cost recovery indexes are relatively
high in large part because high financial prices for rubber permit sizeable
profits, a substantial portion of which is remitted to the Central Government.
These indexes also could be calculated to reflect the additional cost which
the Central Government pays to obtain project output locally rather than from
foreign sources. This amount, measured on the basis of differences between
foreign and domestic prices for project output, could be viewed as a negative
project charge (i.e., project revenue foregone by the Central Government). On
this basis, the rent and cost recovery indexes (in present value terms) would
fall to about 30% and 70%, respectively. These figures are considered
reasonable.
Economic Analysis
6.08      All economic values were converted to local currency at the
official exchange rate at appraisal of Y 1.9 = US$1.00. Project costs of
US$36.2 million equivalent for construction of housing, schools and health
facilities were excluded from the economic analysis on grounds that these
are normally provided to meet social objectives and that resulting benefits
are likely to at least equal costs. The economic analysis also excludes
estimated project costs of $1.6 million (and possible benefits) for the
farm sawmills. Benefits from the upgrading of these sawmills are expected to
substantially exceed costs because of likely productivity gains in sawmill
operations and the strong local demand for sawn timber and simple furniture.
In the economic analysis the total investment cost of US$156 million includes
physical contingencies, but excludes price contingencies.
6.09      Using the foregoing assumptions and discounting costs and benefits
over 35 years, the project's economic rate of return (ERR) is 17% (Table
6.1). Estimated ERRs for project activities in the three prefectures and
the joint ventures are at least 14%. The ERR for the timber complexes is
about 37%. At a discount rate of 12%, which is considered to approximate the
opportunity cost of capital in China, the net present value (NPV) of the
project is Y 201 million (US$106 million equivalent). The economic return of
17% is relatively high for long-gestation tree crops such as rubber and
reflects the contribution from intercropping and timber procesing in the early
years of the project.

/c Base case assumes economic labor cost of Y 0.5/man-day.
6.10      Sensitivity of the ERR was tested to cost overruns, implementation
delays, shortfalls from projected yields or prices and variations in the
economic value of farm labor (Table 6.1 and Annex 4, Table 9). Switching
values (value of the variable tested at which the NPV of the project, with
benefits and costs discounted at 12%, is reduced to zero) and NPV elastici-
ties (the percentage change in NPVs due to a one percent change in the key
variable) were calculated. No single variant proved crucial to the
project's economic viability. An assumed economic wage of Y 3/man-day,
or about twice the reported market wage for casual labor, would reduce the
ERR to 12%. Economic prices of both rubber and timber at full development



- 39 -
would have to fall simultaneously by about 39% to reduce the ERR to the
opportunity cost of capital. The ERR is moderately sensitive to cost
increases or rubber yield shortfalls. Switching values are, respectively,
39% above or 47% below appraisal estimates.
Project Risks
6.11      The project faces no significant technical and organizational
risks. The major clones to be used in rubber planting have been proven
through local cultivation; the newer clones have shown promise in smaller
plantings in China and are limited to less than 20% of the area. Basic
cultural practices in the windbreaks have been used for a number of years in
the project area. Improved practices in rubber and windbreaks have been
proven in other countries and will be introduced through project-supported
research and training activities. The implementing agency (PGB) has
considerable experience in rubber cultivation and the annual new planting
and replanting program foreseen in this project is within the actual
replanting and new planting achieved by the PGB in 1977-81. The PGB's
industrial experience is less extensive, although it manages a number of
industrial operations, including a hardboard factory near Zhanjiang. A
possible uncertainty relates to full implementation of the state farm-
communes joint ventures where experience is limited. It is expected that
this uncertainty would be kept within acceptable bounds through control and
close supervision of the joint ventures by state farm management.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreements were reached with the Government on the following:
(a)  consultants for the project's technical assistance component
would be employed in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines on
consultants (para. 3.13);
(b)  by September 30 of each year a detailed work program and financing
plan for the following calendar year would be prepared for review
by the Association (para. 3.15);
(c)  the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of State Farms and Land Reclamation
would maintain a separate account for the project. This account
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to
the Association. The audited account would be submitted to the
Association within six months of the close of each financial year
(para. 3.20);
(d)  the Government would ensure that effluents from the plants
which process the rubber produced in the project would be treated
in accordance with sound environmental practices (para. 3.21);



- 40 -
(e) the Project Management Office of the PGB would be maintained
during project implementation and adequately staffed with
experienced and qualified personnel (para. 4.04); and
(f) the funds, services and other resources necessary to bring the
project plantings into production, including the installation
of processing facilities would be provided (para. 4.08).
7.02      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an
IDA credit of SDR 37.8 million (equivalent to US$40 million) and an IDA
Special Fund credit of SDR 56.8 million (equivalent to US$60 million) on
standard IDA terms.

/a  Includes felling (50 man-days), clearing (38 man-days), leveling and terracing (247 man-days).
YE  Includes rubber planting and supplying (138 man-days) and planting of cover crops or intercrops (27 man-days).
7c  Includes weeding and mulching, fertilization, and disease prevention (total of 123 man-days), plus tapping,
collection and processing.
/d  Applied only in the few magnesium-deficient areas.
7e  Includes investment costs of cattle and cattle pens.
77  Largely dynamite and detonators for stump removal.
7g  Higher processing costs compared with joint ventures reflect higher assumed yields.
T7  The work force irn the joint ventures is expected to come largely from the participating communes.  The daily
wage is estimated at Y 1.50 and excludes various non-wage benefits (health services, housing, food subsidies) included
in the state farm labor cost of Y 3.25 per day. Lower labor efficiency in the joint ventures is assumed to
reflect the more limited experience of commune members in rubber development.

/a  In addition to the training program indicated here which is being supported
by the project, the SCATC runs longer-term (up to 1 year) training programs
for research staff of the state farms, the PGB and the prefectural research
institutes.  The PGB provides short courses (2-3 days) in land use planning,
statistics and economics at its staff training school.
/b  These centers would come into operation over the 1984-88 period as existing
extension stations on state farms are upgraded.  Some similar, but less well
developed, courses were being taught at the extension stations prior to
project implementation.
/c This takes the form largely of on-the-job training for existing and newly
employed workers and staff. The number of full-time training day equiva-
lents is approximately half the total number of indicated training day
equivalents.

by 7.0% to adjust to 1983 constant prices.
/b Converted at the official exchange rate of US$1 = Y 1.90. Ocean freight
costs from Southeast Asian producers to the major importing center of
Shanghai may be lower than freight costs to New York.  These costs are
assumed to be approximately offset by internal handling and transport costs,
Shanghai to Guangzhou. Hence, prices CIF, Guangzhou are assumed equal to
CIF, New York.
/c Based on economic cost of port charges and distributor's margin equal to
9% of CIF price. See S. Ichishima and A. Wood, Economic Analysis of
Aluminum Milling in Shanghai (May 1982), p. 2.

Conversion factors based on work by Ichishima and Wood.
/e Weighted average price of dry rubber delivered by the state farms to the
Supply and Marketing Cooperative at Haikou. This is the price received by
state farms before payment of taxes (Y 210/ton) and transport, storage and
handling (Y 96/ton), which are treated as production costs.
/f About 55% of China's rubber production is marketed as standard block
rubber (of which more than 95% is graded No. 1); 25% is sold as high
grade concentrated latex or crepe. The proportion of block rubber
produced in the project is projected to increase to 85% of total output.
Overall, China's rubber production "mix" is assumed equal in quality to
RSS #1.

/a  Based on an update of estimated conversion rates in S. Ichishima and A.
Wood, Economic Analysis of Aluminum Milling in Shanghai (May 1982). The
update used an exchange rate of Y 2.0/USS1, 1982 local or national financial
prices, and international price projections for 1983 (in 1983 constant
values) from EPD, Ouarterly Review of Commodity Markets and Half-Yearly
Revision of Commodity Price Forecasts - December 1982, pp. 18-23. In addi-
tion, the economic price of timber is projected to increase in real terms at
an annual rate of 1.5% through 1995.
/b The price for organic manure excludes the labor cost of gathering and prepa-
ration. The conversion rate assumes that its market value is presentlv
determined by a highly rationed supply of chemical phosphorus and potassium,
and would decline sharply if imports of the chemical products were freely
available.
/c Local conversion factor, assuming state farm labor shadow priced at Y 0.50/
man-day and conversion rates for steel, timber and cement of 1.13, 2.15 and
1.16, respectively.
/d  Unskilled state farm labor is in surplus and its opportunity cost is assumed
to be the additional consumption cost due to its employment.

RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Accounting and Disbursement Procedures
for Works Executed by Force Account
1.        All ot the project works would be carried out by the labor torce
on participating tarms and joint ventures in accord with their annual work
plans. These entities have established accounting systems for keeping track
of expenditures on a wide range of activities for which they are respon-
sible. These accounts are kept in considerable detail and there is believed
to be a high degree of control over public tunds in rural areas.
2.        A system to maintain separate accounts tor project related con-
struction could be devised, but it would have to be instituted in 50 farms
and 16 joint ventures. The system would cover all wages paid and materials
consumed and could serve as complete documentation against force account
work. However, it would involve a vast amount of data prepared in the
Chinese language. This would have to be summarized and translated. There
is the risk that the implementing agency would experience delays similar to
those in other countries where force account disbursements rely on complete
documentation.  This could delay disbursements and create shortages of funds
which would, in turn, delay the project. Furthermore, Government auditors
would face a difficult problem in relating expenditures to physical pro-
gress. This would create problems tor the Association in being sure that
expenditures reported are consistent with works constructed. This is
because documentation would be in the form of wages and material expenses,
but there would be no link to physical quantities.
3.        An alternative approach, to be used in this project, is to dis-
burse on the basis of agreed unit prices for major work items. In this
system individual state farms would be reimbursed quarterly tor this work on
the basis ot statements ot expenditure (SOEs) which would be validated by
the local branch of the Construction Bank, submitted to, assembled and
translated into English by the PGB, and then forwarded to the Association.
The SOEs would be based on unit costs estimates for major work tasks which
were developed during project preparation and are expected to be generally
valid for project works carried out in 1984. Cost estimates tor work tasks
would be updated annually by the PGB.
4.        An example ot a statement ot expenditure is provided as Table 1
and a form to report project progress is included as Table 2.

RUBBER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Glossary of Technical Terms
Arenaceous Rock:  Sedimentary rock derived from sand and sandstone.
Basalt:            Fine grained igneous rock.
Block Rubber:      Technically specified natural rubber produced from latex or
coagulum by a process of granulation, hot air drying, and
baling under pressure.
Budded Stumps:    Planting material produced from rubber seedlings, usually
about 1 year old, which have been grafted with buds from
the clone which is to be propagated.
Budgrafting:       A method of propagation in which a bud from one plant is
induced to unite with the stem of another.
Clonal Seed:       Seed produced from an area of rubber that is generally
uniform as a result of having been vegetatively propagated.
Clone:             Any stock or population of plants that is produced by
vegetative propagation from a single original parent.
In the case of rubber, only the aerial part of the tree
is of clonal origin. Seedling material is used for the
production of rootstocks onto which buds of the desired
clone are grafted.
Crepe Rubber:      Rubber produced by passing sheets of coagulated rubber
through shearing rollers rotating at unequal speeds.
Gneiss:            Metamorphic rock showing light and dark banding.
Granite:           Coarse-grained rock containing visible quartz crystals.
Intercropping:    A cropping system in which crops are grown between the
rows of young rubber. In the early years the root system
of the rubber tree has a limited range, leaving much of
the inter-row space available for planting with other
crops.
Latex:             A milky viscous fluid, consisting of colloidal rubber
dispersed in a watery medium, obtained from Hevea
brasiliensis and other rubber producing plants.

New Planting:      The planting of rubber on land that has not previously
carried this crop. This is to be distinguished from
replanting, which is the replacement of an existing stand
of rubber with a new generation of trees.
Polybag Buddings: Instead of being transplanted directly into the field, a
proportion of the budded stumps would be lifted from the
nursery, replanted in polythene containers -- "polybags" --
and grown on under nursery conditions to serve as replace-
ments for any early losses among the stumps planted
directly in the field.
RSS "Ribbed
smoked sheets:" Slabs of wet coagulum which are passed through a series of
rollers to produce thin sheets of raw rubber. The final
rollers have a grooved surface which imparts a ribbed
pattern to the sheet. The ribbed sheets are smoke dried,
a process requiring 3-4 days, and packed in bales for
marketing.
Stumped            Budded stumps kept for a year or more in the nursery after
Buddings:         being cut back.  During this time the clonal bud develops
into a stem up to 3 meters in length. This is cut off
at a height of about 2.5 meters prior to transplanting in
the field. The tap root and laterals are also shortened
as necessary to facilitate planting.
Unselected         Rubber of unknown parentage and low inherent (genetic).
Seedling Rubber: yield potential. Even under good standards of husbandry,
such rubber is incapable of producing an economic crop.
