MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A SECOND SCARP TRANSITION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation or, a proposed development
credit of SDR 14.8 million (US$20 million equivalent) to the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The project would help finance
small capacity private tubewells (PTWs) to replace larger Government owned and
operated groundwater tubewells and would facilitate transfer of responsibility
for future groundwater development and protection against waterlogging in the
project area to the private sector.
2.       Background.  Pakistan covers an area of over 800,000 sq. km. and has
a population of about 101 million and an average per capita income of about
US$370. About 30X of the population lives below the absolute poverty level of
uS$150. Despite agriculture's declining share in the overall economy, the
_tor accounts for 241 of GDP, employs 52X of the labor force, and generates
551 of total export earnings.
3.        To alleviate the serious problem of widespread waterlogging and
salinity in Pakistan, the Government, in the late 1950s, embarked on a series
of Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPs). These projects,
originally conceived as a draimage relief measure in saline and waterlogged
areas, was subsequently transformed into dual purpose schemes, providing not
only drainage relief but also irrigation water in fresh groundwater (FGW)
areas to supplement canal water. As a result, some 11,000 Government owned
and operated SCARP tubewells (STWs) were installed in FGW areas. SCARPs
performed successfully during the first 10-15 years. However, due to limited
budget for operation and maintenance (Off), the high capital cost of
replacement, and poor management, STWs have deteriorated and are unable to
meet SCARP objectives on a sustained basis. To compensate for shortfalls in
supplementary irrigation water, small capacity diesel and electric private
tubewells have developed in SCARP areas. It would require on average, about
Rs 100,000 (US$4,651 equivalent) a year to operate and maintain each STW in
Punjab and Sindh. At the same time, the gap between O0M expenditures and cost
recoveries has widened as the Provinces have found it difficult to increase
water charges in pace with the 06N costs. The fiscal burden of the SCARPs has
thus become unsustainable.
4.        Recognizing the gravity of this problem and encouraged by the
emerging interest in PTW development, the Government, in 1980, decided on
disinvestment of existing STWs in FGW areas and transfer of responsibility for
supplemental groundwater development to the private sector - in general terms
called SCARP Transition' in Pakistan. However, since farmers have no direct
interest in operating PTWs in saline groundwater areas, some STWs in such



- 2 -
areas will remain Government owned and operated. In 1986, a SCARP Transition
Pilot Project (STPP) (Cr. 1693-PAK) was initiated with IDA assistance to phase
out and replace some 213 STWs in the SCARP-I area in Punjab with small
capacity, mainly electric PTWs. This pilot attempt has largely achieved its
objectives of privatizing usable groundwater pumping while maintaining the
water table at the desired levels. The proposed Second SCARP Transition
Project replacing 1,726 STWs is a follow up to the pilot project and would be
a second step towards a longer range plan for privatizing responsibility for
pumping groundwater and control of waterlogging for the remaining estimated
10,800 STWs in the FGW areas in Pakistan.
5.        Lessons learned.  Although the pilot project is still under
implementation (expected closing date December 31, 1991), experience gained
from the project has conclusively demonstrated that the adopted transition
mode of STWs is not financially replicable on a national scale. The cost of
STPP has been very high, primarily because of the high cost of infrastructure
required for providing electric connections to PTWs. While the proposed
project would follow the overall concept and approach already tested under the
pilot project, it seeks to develop a more cost effective and replicable mode
of transition without additional investment on electrical networks (the
highest cost component under STPP). However, while no expansion of the power
grid would be financed, farmers close to the existing power supply would have
free choice between electric and diesel TWs and electrical connections would
be provided at cost to farmers utilizing capacity released by the closure of
STWs. The project's credit component incorporates lessons learned from
earlier projects in these fields, including the importance of training and
motivating credit staff and providing them with mobility. The project's on-
farm water management (OFWM) component incorporates the need to ensure
increased farmer participation in financing rehabilitation of watercourses and
in their maintenance (through Water User Associations).
6.        Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.   The Bank continues to be
instrumental in mobilizing and promoting private sector involvement and
beneficiary participation in water sector investments in Pakistan. The
ongoing On-Farm Water Management program and the Private Tubewell Development
Project (Cr.2004-PAK) are examples of the Bank's support in this area. Under
the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln 2986-PAK) and the Irrigation
System Rehabilitation-II Project (Cr.1888-PAK), the Bank received assurances
from Government of Pakistan (GOP) that it would privatize the remaining STWs
in FGW areas by 1997. Given the importance of successful and timely
implementation of the SCARP Transition Program and the Bank's unique
experience in the STPP, its continued involvement in this program would be
necessary. Furthermore, it would be incumbent upon the Bank to help the
Government in evolving cost effective and innovative project designs for
future SCARP Transition projects. Successful implementation of this program
would be instrumental in GOP's compliance with the above assurances, and would
strengthen the Bank's continuing dialogue with GOP on private sector
involvement in the water sector.
7.        Project Obiectives.  The primary objectives of the proposed project
are to: (i) increase agricultural production through improved and timely



-3-
availability of supplementaryV irrigation on a financially sustainable basis;
(ii) maintain an appropriate groundwater table through PTWs, replacing the
current STWs which are expensive to operate and are poorly maintained; (iii)
test the viability of SCARP Transition in Sindh; and (iv) prepare a follow-up
project for a larger scale replacement of STWs, based upon the experience
under this project.
8.        Project Description.  The proposed six-year project (FY91-96)
comprises two subprojects, one in Punjab and the other in Sindh. The Punjab
subproject would replace 1,346 STWs with about 13,000 PTWs in the FGW areas of
the remaining part of the SCARP-I area in Punjab, not covered under the STPP.
The Sindh subproject would be a pilot effort to test the viability of SCARP
Transition in Sindh. It would replace about 380 STWs with 1,800 PTWs in the
FGW areas of SCARP North Rohri Project. In most areas STWs would be closed
completely or their bore holes would be sold at salvage value for use by PTWs.
In a few areas where existing STWs have not deteriorated too badly, Water User
Associations (WUAs) or groups of farmers may choose to purchase and operate
such STWs for their remaining economic life. Other project components are:
(i) improvement of about 500 watercourses covering about 95,000 ha which would
facilitate interfarm distribution and sharing of pumped groundwater by PTWs
jointly owned by small farmers in Punjab; (ii) provision of equipment and
vehicles; (iii) provision of consultants for implementation assistance, and
hydrogeological and impact evaluation studies; (iv) incremental operating
costs of project management cell and OFWM field staff and training. In view
of the externalities involved in lowering the water table and preventing
waterlogging for farms neighboring the PTW user, the substantial budgetary
savings to the Government through privatization of responsibilities for water
table maintenance, and the need to accelerate PTW development, the provinces
of Punjab and Sindh would provide cash incentives amounting to US$750
equivalent per PTW to farmers purchasing tubewells. US$8.6 million equivalent
of the proceeds would be on-lent to the Agricultural Development Bank of
Pakistan (ADBP) with interest at the IBRD variable lending rate, to finance
loans for PTUs at interest rates (currently 12.5%) which would be adjusted
from time to time to meet specific criteria, including the maintenance of
positive real interest rates. About 60% of the farmers are expected to seek
institutional credit to purchase PTWs. The remainder of the loar, financing
watercourse improvement, incremental costs of project management staff,
*        technical assistance, and training, would be made available to Government of
Punjab Province (GOPunjab) and Government of Sindh Province (GOSindh).  The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$48.46 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$23.53 million (49%). A cost summary and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
9.        Environmental Issues.  The proposed project has been placed irn
environmental screening category B under the provisions of Operational
I/   PTWS would pump supplementary irrigation water from fresh groundwater
areas for conjunctive use with canal water.



-4-
Directive 4.00, Annex A and will not require the preparation of an
environmental assessment. The project will support: (a) improved water and
soil resources management; and (b) the preparation of hydrogeological studies
to recommend improved measures to prevent intrusion of saline water into the
FGW areas and safe disposal of water pumped in saline water areas.
10.       A8reed Actions.  IDA has obtained agreements as appropriate from
GOP, GOPunjab. GOSindh, and ADBP that they would take the following actions as
conditions of credit effectiveness: (i) hire consultants to provide project
implementation assistance, hydrogeological studies, and impact evaluation
studies; (ii) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOP and ADBP;
(iii) establishment of Project Management Cells and Project Field Units; and
(iv) obtain approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic
Council (ECNEC) of the Planning Commission Proforma (PC-1). In addition, the
following assurances were obtained: (i) adequate budgetary funds would be
allocated for operation and maintenance of STWs in saline groundwater areas;
(ii) electrical connections would be provided to the power grid at full cost,
and reserve the power capacity released following closure of STWs for
connectilons of PTWs; (iii) Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs) would
improve surface irrigation water deliveries at village level in those areas
where STWs are currently a major source of irrigation; (iv) GOPunjab and
GOSindh would provide cash incentives to assist farmers to purchase PTWs; (v)
annual review of the operation of incentive package would be carried out to
assess its effectiveness and availability of funds; and (vi) ADBP would train
Functional Mobile Credit Officers and facilitate availability of Agricultural
Pass Books to farmers. Specifically, GOPunjab would give priority for
watercourse improvements in areas where WUAs or groups of farmers assume joint
responsibility for installation, operation and maintenance of tubewells.
11.       Aenefits.  The project would benefit about 85,000 farm families.
The project components would accelerate closure of STWs and facilitate private
sector investment in replacement tubewells, and would give farmers control of
groundwater resources, as well as improving operation an. maintenance of pumps
providing control of soil salinity and waterlogging. The improved management
and optimization of supplementary groundwater utilized by farmers are expected
to increase cropping intensities by 6-8X and crop yield by about 7-12X. As a
result, the annual per capita income of smallholders (less than 5 ha) in the
Punjab area is expected to be about US$225 equivalent, as compared to US$185
without the project, while the annual per capita income of smallholders (less
than 10 ha) in Sindh is expected to increase from US$175 to US$210. The
estimated economic rate of return for the project is 24X. Furthermore, the
fiscal burden of operating and maintaining STWs in FGW areas of the project
would be eliminated, which should help, inter alia, in releasing funds to
permit adequate O&M of STWs remaining in saline areas.
12.      Risks.  Unless the PTWs are in place at the time the Government stops
operating the STWs, production losses, waterlogging and salinity could occur.
The successful implementation of the STPP, which is nearing completion, shows
that farmers' response to privatization of STWs has been positive and that
their operation and maintenance of PTWs has been good, providing suitable
maintenance of the water table. However, experience under STPP has been
mainly with electric PTWs which were provided with highly subsidized electric



connections, whereas under the proposed project, mostly diesel PTWs are
envisaged. Since diesel tubewell technology is widely known in Pakistan,
where the majority (661) of the existing PTWs are diesel operated, the risk of
farmers not investing in diesel PTWs is not high. It is expected that
adoption of diesel PTWs by fanmers within the project areas would be
accelerated through the provision of financial incentives and credit
facilities for PTW purchase (also available for electric PTWs). However, since
the financial incentives are only 54X of those under STPP, close monitoring of
farmer response is necessary. A second risk comes from adoption of a model
for STW replacement tested in Punjab, to the somewhat different socio-economic
conditions of SinOh. This is the reason that this component is a small pilot
operation. A provision for a mid-term review has been included under the
project, to provide a mechanism for adjusting the project design as
appropriate based upon initial experience.
13.      ReSgUen"aton. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the credit.
