BANKING, ENTERPRISE AND LEGAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CREDIT
I. BACKGROUND
1.    Over the past six years, Mongolia has made considerable progress in transforming
its economy into a market system. The country was plunged into economic turmoil in
1990 when the collapsing Soviet Union withdrew its subsidies, and the CMEA trading
system disintegrated. Within months, Mongolia lost 35 percent of its GDP and 95 percent
of its export markets. In response, the Government embarked on a program of economic
stabilization and structural reform, and implemented an impressive range of measures to
expand the scope of market transactions. These included price and trade liberalization, a
mass privatization program, establishment of a two-tier banking system, and enactment of
new laws and regulations favorable to private economic participation.
2.    After four years of decline, Mongolia succeeded in reducing inflation and restoring
economic growth. The growth was led by copper exports and increased agroindustry and
service sector activities. Mongolia achieved 2.5 percent GDP growth in 1994, and a
further 6.3 percent growth in 1995. Lower copper prices, however, disrupted growth in
1996, and the estimated GDP growth rate for 1996 is 2.6 percent. Inflation, which
reached 325 percent in 1993 fell to 53 percent by the end of 1995, and remained at that
level in 1996. During 1996, the Mongolian economy was hit by a succession of adverse
developments that reversed some of the progress painstakingly made over the past years.
Much of Mongolia's recent economic developments were the result of terms of trade
shocks. A 25 percent decline in world copper prices in 1996, a 10 percent fall in cashmere
prices, and further increases in world petroleum prices', induced a cost to the Mongolian
economy equivalent to 10.3 percent of GDP in 1996, compared to a windfall gain of 8
percent in 1995. Extensive forest and steppe fires in April 1996 resulted in lower
agricultural supplies and exports. While the agriculture exports and the copper, cashmere
and petroleum terms of trade problems are likely to self-correct, the problems in the
financial and enterprise sectors pose a longer-term threat to stabilization and growth.
3.    Current Status of the Banking Sector. Mongolia saw a major erosion of public
confidence in the banking system in 1996, with the collapse of a small private bank and the
closure of two large banks that held approximately 50 percent of total deposits in the
country. On December 13, 1996, the Government successfully closed two large insolvent
banks. The 1996 banking crisis poses severe implications for inflation, financial control,
and growth in the real sector. The authorities will have to further resolve the banking
crisis and consistently implement strict macroeconomic policies to restore stability.
iThe copper sector accounts for a quarter of GDP, half of export earnings, and about a third of overall tax
receipts. Cashmere is the second leading export item, accounting for about 15 percent of export
receipts. Petroleum and petroleum products account for 20 percent of its imports.



- 2 -                TECHNICAL ANNEX
Mongolia's commercial banks are unable to offer effective financial intermediation due to
a combination of factors: a legacy of government intervention in credit allocation, poor
commercial banking skills, non-creditworthy borrowers and weak management. The
banking sector as a whole has become insolvent and illiquid. Many of its largest enterprise
clients consistently fail to service their debts. All banks have become heavily burdened
with bad debt, and in desperate need of relief from this debt in order to survive. Loan
recovery, including debt workout and financial restructuring of distressed enterprises, as
appropriate, is therefore a prerequisite for building a healthy banking system. A radical
bank restructuring and loan recovery strategy has been developed by the Mongolian
authorities, in conjunction with the IMF, ADB and IDA, in response to the crisis.
4.    Current Status of the Enterprise Sector. Structural reforms are needed to
enhance the credibility of stabilization, and to spur growth by increasing productivity of
the real sector. Mongolia's public and privatized enterprises face a variety of problems in
conducting business, ranging from liquidity shortages and limited access to long-term
credit, to diminishing markets and acute skills shortages at the micro-level. The
Government's proposes to implement a medium-term enterprise reform agenda focusing
on general hardening of budget constraints for enterprises, developing enterprise
infrastructure and management skills, and accelerating the ongoing cash privatization
program.
5.    The Legal Environment. Progress in banking and enterprise reform relies heavily
on the existence of a transparent legal framework, one which enjoys public confidence.
Rules of the game for economic activity (concerning property rights, entry and exit of
business vehicles, transactions, competition and dispute settlement) should be clear on
paper and implemented in practice by institutions equipped in human and material terms to
discharge their responsibilities. Since 1991, Mongolia has enacted an impressive set of
laws and regulations related to the operation of the emerging market economy. However,
the application of the new laws and regulations and their interpretation by the courts
remain problematic, largely because of inadequate institutional capacity. As a result, banks
and enterprises are seriously hampered by difficulties in such areas as contract
enforcement (including loan collection), secured transactions, and the failure of
bankruptcy procedures. Whilst legislative reform continues at full speed, Mongolia will, in
view of enforcement problems highlighted above, have to focus increasingly on the
difficult task of making its laws work in practice. This will require substantial and long
term investments in support institutions like the judiciary, ministry of justice, property
registries and legal education, as well as the dissemination of legal information (including
legislation and case law).
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.    The purpose of the Project is to facilitate the implementation of key components of
the Government's reform program in the banking and enterprise sectors, and to foster a
legal environment which supports financial intermediation. The primary focus of all the
proposed interventions is to develop effective and standardized procedures for default
resolution, debt workout and loan collection, and to support bank-led restructuring of



- 3 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX
distressed enterprises. This will create a valuable demonstration effect. The Government's
policy reforms in these sectors are being supported by IDA's proposed Banking and
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (BESAC), and the Asian Development Bank's
Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL). Both of these projects are scheduled to become
effective in early 1997. BELTAC will support the core institutions executing the policy
reforms over the short term.  The Project is also designed to promote longer-term
institutional and technical skills development, so that the programs implemented under the
BESAC may be sustained. BELTAC will provide advisory support, training, and where
appropriate, materials and equipment for the Trade and Development Bank (T&D bank), a
newly-established Debt Workout Unit (DWJU) in T&D bank, the State Property
Committee (SPC), participating enterprises, MOJ, the judiciary and other legal support
institutions.
Coordination with Other Donors
7.    The Project design takes into account completed, ongoing and proposed technical
assistance activities financed by other donors. These are summarized in Annex I  The
importance of systematic and continuous donor coordination is one of the key lessons
learned in project development in Mongolia. Moreover, aid coordination and efficient
external resource allocation are priorities for the new Government.  Several donor
organizations, including NGOs, are currently active in the areas of banking, enterprise and
legal reform, most notably:
- IMF:  assistance to the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Mongolia in
macroeconomic management, fiscal and monetary policy, central bank
supervision, accounting and settlement, and payment systems;
* ADB: central bank supervision, commercial bank restructuring, equipment
upgrading and staff training, bank and enterprise accountancy development,
privatization support, legal reform including banking legislation and training of
legal professionals;
* GTZ: rural finance, commercial law development, revision of the Civil Code,
registration of property rights over immovable property;
* KFW:  commercial bank skills development; support to small and medium
enterprises;
* Other Bilaterals: EU/TACIS (enterprise development, financial, policy and legal
reform); OECF (financial and enterprise reform); USAID (banking skills
development and judicial training); UNDP (restructuring of privatized
enterprises); New Zealand (enterprise restructuring); Asia Foundation, Center
for Institutional Reform and the Informal Sector (IRIS) (legal training), and the
Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, Japan, and German NGOs (legal training).



- 4 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX
Project Components
A. Commercial Bank Institutional Development ($0.6 million)
8.    This component is a highly targeted  intervention to  support long-term
development of a single financial institution, as a follow-up to TA provided by other
donors. This TA will focus particularly on building skills in loan accounting, loan workout
and restructuring functions of the selected institution, as this has been identified as a
priority area for external support. Further to a memorandum of understanding between
the Government, IDA and ADB agreed in May 1996, ADB is taking the lead in policy
discussion and provision of technical assistance in Mongolia's financial sector to facilitate
bottom-up restructuring of the banking system. ADB has developed restructuring plans
for the large commercial banks, and provided preliminary training in accountancy
development to Ardyn and ITI banks. In parallel with its FSPL, ADB proposes to finance
long-term advisory assistance and training for BOM's supervision department. This will
cover financial statement analysis, principles of accounting and auditing, and exercise of
authority under the recently-enacted Central Bank Law (October 1996). ADB also
proposes to assist major commercial banks in loan recovery, credit and risk management,
project appraisal, accounting and auditing, and development of operational strategies. In
addition, KFW is proposing a program of skills development to three commercial banks to
enable them to provide effective intermediation to small and medium enterprises.
Bank Twinning Arrangement
9.    Experience from several countries indicates that emerging banks may benefit
considerably from developing financial, business and institutional relations with foreign
banks integrated in international capital markets.  This arrangement may also assist
emerging banks in improving operational procedures through access to professional advice
from  banking professionals practicing in advanced market economies.  Twinning
arrangements are widely considered the most efficient and cost effective way to develop
long-term institutional development programs in the banking sector. This component
would finance the twinning, over an 18-month to 2-year period, of the Trade and
Development Bank with a reputable foreign bank, with a provision for a possible
continuing business relationship thereafter. T&D bank is a fully state-owned commercial
bank, with three branches, and a total of 79 employees. It has the best financial position
of Mongolia's large banks, with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate safely and
efficiently. It would benefit substantially from long-term assistance in designing and
implementing business plans and operational strategies, defining the roles and
accountability of staff, and workflow.
10.   The foreign bank would provide long-term  advisory services and on-the-job
training in strategic planning and implementation, organizational structure and network
development, marketing plans and customer services, development of new products and
services, credit management and loan workout, treasury and asset/liability management,
internal audit, communications and effective use of human resources.  Given the
importance of transparent financial reporting, the foreign bank will also undertake to train



- 5 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX
staff in general international bank accounting concepts and practices, preparation of
appropriate manuals, use of general ledger systems, and systematic preparation of financial
statements.
Debt Workout Capacity-Building
11.   A Debt Workout Unit (DWU) will be established in T&D bank to recover
outstanding loans from UB carpet factory, Erdenet carpet factory, Domod carpet factory,
and Eermel textile company. T&D bank is the sole creditor of these loans which amount
to 74 percent of its total loans outstanding, and 30 percent of all nonperforming loans.
The initial mandate of the DWU will be to recover the outstanding loans from these
companies, through a combination of changes in the terms of repayment with or without
concessions, sale of assets, and liquidation proceeds as partial satisfaction of the loan.
Under the terms of the contract for the T&D bank twinning arrangement, short-term
consultants will assist the DWU in maximizing the recovery on each troubled loan. The
consultants will review the financial position of the selected enterprises to determine their
ability to meet the new terms of the loan based on projected cash flows, profitability and
other credit factors. Based on this analysis, T&D bank will initiate bankruptcy procedures
and/or develop repayment schedules linked to enterprise performance, as appropriate. The
objective of these initial workouts, in addition to loan recovery, is to create a core group
of local experts that can replicate the restructuring/recovery exercise in the years to come.
The DWU will continue its operations as a permanent department within T&D Bank, to
provide a model for other debt workout units to be established in other commercial banks.
Terms of Reference are in Annex 5.
B. Public Enterprise Financial Restructuring ($0.2 million)
12.   The Government's enterprise reform program, supported by BESAC, is being
managed by the State Property Committee (SPC), a high-level independent body of
Government, reporting to the Prime Minister. SPC has wide-ranging powers to initiate
and oversee privatization, and public enterprise enterprise restructuring or liquidation as a
respresentative of Government or dominant creditors. SPC will initiate workout exercises
for two large politically-sensitive enterprises, the Bagahangai Meat Company and the
Darkhan Mini-Metal Plant. These are among the largest defaulters to the banking system.
Under this financial restructuring program, they will be isolated from all sources of
financing except the budget which will finance limited working capital expenditures. A
moratorium will be established on their debt-service obligations. SPC will carry out
viability assessments and recommend liquidation or restructuring, to be implemented
within an 18 month period.
13.   BELTAC will finance two short-term advisors to assist SPC in preparing viability
assessments, restructuring or liquidation plans and debt restructuring programs for these
enterprises. Thereafter, the advisors would work with the companies to implement
priority actions identified in the restructuring plan, and with SPC to prepare loan
repayment schedules, so that the enterpriss can service their debts. The case of Darkhan
mini-metal plant presents particular difficulties. The plant was financed by a $30 million



-6 -                TECHNICAL ANNEX
commercial loan from Japan's EXIM Bank, guaranteed by the Government of Mongolia.
This loan therefore represents a contingent liability on the budget. Japan is continuing to
provide official development assistance to improve the plant's physical performance.
C. Legal Reform Program ($1.2 million)
14.   The Legal Reform Program consists of a series of subprojects, identified by local
stakeholders as addressing priority areas of reform that require external assistance. The
subprojects were designed and will be implemented by interinstitutional working groups,
comprising representatives of the Ministry of Justice, Bank of Mongolia, Ministry of
Finance, Supreme Court, Bureau of Foreign Investment, and commercial banks. Client
ownership and continuing participation will remain essential for effective implementation
of this component, given the broad-ranging and interinstitutional nature of proposed
reforms and interventions. The subprojects also take into account the TA activities
financed by ADB, GTZ and USAID, among others. The Program will be implemented in
stages, based on an agreed annual work program. An initial pipeline of subprojects has
reached an advanced stage of preparation (see paras 15-17). Further resources will be
allocated to additional subprojects (see para 18), based on initial outcomes and
performance indicators. All subproject proposals are subject to IDA's prior approval, on
recommendation of the Steering Committee.
Execution of Judgments
15.   The objective of this subproject is to strengthen the operations of the Bailiffs
Department under the MOJ with a view to improving enforcement of civil judgments.
Current problems have resulted in a widespread lack of confidence in the court system,
particularly on the part of banks. The subproject will finance a study tour to two foreign
jurisdictions to familiarize Mongolian bailiffs with enforcement procedures and operations
in other countries. On the basis of this study tour, recommendations for the improvement
of the Bailiffs Department will be prepared and submitted to the Minister of Justice for
implementation. In addition, a basic training course for bailiffs focusing among others on
loan recovery will be designed and held at least once in Ulaanbaatar. The design of the
course will emphasize sustainability by including a training of trainers module and ensuring
that the course can be replicated throughout the country. Course design will be based on
creative teaching methods including role playing and moot courts.
Collateral Registration
16.   Registration of property rights and secured interests facilitates and reduces the
transaction cost of financial intermediation. A functioning and credible collateral system is
essential to the long-term viability of commercial banking. A prefeasibility study (financed
by IDA in 1996 under a Norwegian trust fund) has confirmed the complexity of the
establishment/reform  of such registers in Mongolia.  A working group has been
established to provide guidance on this subject. In view of GTZ's involvement in the
registration of immovable property, the proposed subproject focuses on the registration of
secured interests in movable property. A workshop will be held in Ulaanbaatar to review



- 7 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX
all legal, technical and institutional issues involved, including the need for clear and
transparent procedures regarding the taking, perfecting and foreclosure of collateral, as
well as what is required to actually establish and operate a registry. Specific
recommendations resulting from the workshop will be followed by the development and
implementation of a business plan for the establishment of a registry for secured interests
in movable property. IDA will finance foreign advisors, hard and software required for the
establishment of the registry and training of operators.
Insolvency
17.   A revised insolvency law is under preparation. This process is being guided by a
working group established for this purpose. A first draft has been prepared and reviewed
by IDA. Submission of a revised draft to IDA for review is a Credit Effectiveness
condition for BESAC. The Government expects to submit a draft law to Parliament for
enactment during the 1997 fall session. The subproject focuses on training and a public
information campaign to familiarize the public and legal professionals with enterprise
restructuring and liquidation.. Training courses will be designed and held for trustees (a
new concept introduced in the draft law) judges and other legal professionals likely to be
involved in the implementation of the new insolvency law. Course design will promote
sustainability by including a training for trainers module and will be based on creative
teaching methods like role plays. The subproject will also finance part of a broader public
information campaign that is being planned by the MOJ.
Additional Subprojects
18.   BELTAC  would support additional subprojects identified by the Steering
Committee based on evolving needs and priorities, and the availability of funds under this
component.. In this regard, potential subprojects concern: (a) the development of model
loan, collateral and guarantee documentation: (b) the training of legal professionals in the
use of these documents and the application of relevant procedures; and (c) the training of
legal professionals regarding the recently enacted banking laws.
Performance Indicators
19.   Regular monitoring of TA inputs and evaluation of outcomes is essential for
sustainability of the reform  process.  It should be borne in mind, however, that
measurement of long-term impacts is less straightforward in an operation of this type,
particularly one which relies heavily on donor coordination. The performance indicators
established for BELTAC, subject to agreement with the Government on suitability and
monitoring responsibility, are detailed in Annex 3, and summarized below. In the case of
the Legal Reform Program component, performance indicators will be established for each
individual subproject to be approved by IDA.

prepared in consultation with the Borrower.
III. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Project Cost and Financing
20.   The total cost of the project is $2.3 million, of which $2.0 million is in foreign
exchange. All costs have been subjected to price contingencies of 15 percent. The
estimates for consulting assignments, studies and training are based on typical current
costs for such assignments. The foreign exchange costs will be met by IDA. The local
currency requirements ($0.3 million) would be met by the Borrower from its own
resources and from available grant funding.
Project Implementation and Reporting
21.   The TA will be implemented over a two-and-a-half year period. Each component
will be managed by a designated counterpart institution:  (a) Commercial Bank
Institutional Development--Trade and Development Bank; (b) Public Enterprise Financial
Restructuring--SPC; and (c) Legal Reform Program-- Ministry of Justice, through the
Legal Reform Project Unit. Each counterpart agency will make available competent staff
in adequate numbers to be responsible for coordination and supervision of project
implementation. Each counterpart agency will monitor procurement and disbursement
under their component, and maintain records of all transactions, including supporting
documents for statements of expenditure, in accordance with sound accounting practices
acceptable to IDA. The counterpart agencies will submit quarterly progress reports in a
format acceptable to IDA within two weeks from the end of each quarter. In addition, the
counterpart agencies will submit a mid-term report on project implementation on or about
December 31, 1998. This report will integrate the results of the quarterly reports and set
out recommendations to ensure efficient implementation and achievement of project
objectives thereafter. Reporting requirements for consultants will be specified in Terms of
Reference.
Legal Reform Program: Special Conditions for Project Implementation
22.   MOJ will establish  and  maintain  a  Steering  Committee  composed  of
representatives of the public and private sector, including ministries of Finance and Justice,
BOM and commercial banks. The Committee will meet at least on a quarterly basis to
review component implementation. In addition, MOJ will establish a Legal Reform
Project Unit for the duration of the project. This Unit will be staffed on a full-time basis
by at least one lawyer and an administrative assistant, each with qualifications and

experience acceptable to IDA. The Legal Reform Project Unit will be responsible for day-
to-day management of this component, including preparation of annual work programs,
design of new subprojects, liaising with local stakeholders and the local donor community.
The Steering Committee and the Project Unit will be established prior to Board
presentation. The Unit will be headed by a Program Coordinator; draft terms of reference
are in Annex 4. The Unit will prepare subprojects for review by MOJ, the Steering
Committee and IDA.
23.   Individual subprojects will be prepared according to a standard format, and
reviewed on the basis of the following criteria: purpose and scope, implementation
method, and budgetary requirement. The standard format for preparation of proposals is
based on the following core elements:
(a)   description of objectives;
(b)   analysis of key issues;
(c)   description of ongoing initiatives;
(d)   relevance to ongoing initiatives and overall project objectives;
(e)   implementation timetable;
(f)   cost breakdown, including foreign and local currency requirements;
(g)   description of expected benefits and strategy for monitoring progress,
based on agreed indicators; and
(h)   confirmation of Steering Committee endorsement.
Accounting and Auditing
24.   The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for preparation of consolidated
Project Accounts. All accounts will be audited within six months of the end of the fiscal
year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. MOF will retain all documentation for at
least one year after receipt by IDA of the audit report for the year in which the last
disbursement was made, and would make documents available for review by IDA
supervision missions and external auditors.
Procurement
25.   Selection and appointment of consultants for technical assistance and support of
project implementation will be carried out in accordance with IDA's Guidelines on
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. All
contracts for consultant services valued at $50,000 and above, and for all contracts with
individuals, regardless of value, will be subject to IDA's prior review and approval.
Contracts with firms valued at less than $50,000 will be subject to selective post award

reviews by IDA. Procurement of equipment will be made in accordance with the
Guidelines for Procuirement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, published by the Bank
in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. Procurement of equipment will
be made through International Shopping. Equipment estimated to cost less than $50,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding $150,000, may be procured under
contracts awarded on the basis of National Shopping.
Disbursement
26.   Disbursements will be restricted to the subcomponents outlined above, for
advisory services and training (100 percent of expenditures), and limited quantities of
related equipment and materials (100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local
expenditures--ex-factory cost- and 75 percent of local expenditures for other items
procured locally). Disbursements will be made on the basis of documented disbursement
applications, except for expenditures below $50,000 equivalent for goods, consulting
services, study tours and workshops which will be based on statements of expenditure.
These statements will indicate the services provided, invoice, customs declaration, and
evidence of payment.
27.   To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will establish a Special Account
in US dollars at a bank acceptable to IDA to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures.
The authorized allocation of this account would be $500,000 million equivalent. At the
request of the Borrower and, based on project needs, IDA would make an initial deposit
into the special account up to the amount of the authorized allocation. Applications for
replenishment of the special account would be submitted quarterly, or when one third of
the amount deposited has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation
requirements would follow the same procedure as described in para 26. In addition,
monthly bank statements of the special account, reconciled by the Borrower, should
accompany all replenishment requests.

judgments, (c) contractual defaults, (d) secured transactions, and (e) property and
collateral registration. Implementation of these subprojects is likely to start in the first
quarter of 1997.  Further subprojects will be designed in the course of Project
implementation based on evolving needs and priorities, and availability of funds.
3.    The Legal Reform Program will be implemented through the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ), and under the guidance of an interinstitutional and multidisciplinary steering
