MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IflTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A SECOND SMALL SCALE FLOOD CONTROL,
DRAINAGE AND IRRIGATION PROJECT
1. The following report on a proposed development credit to the People's
Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 61.7 million (US$81.5 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The propo-ed credit would he on standard IDA terms
with a maturity of 40 years and help finance a sma.l scale flood control,
drainage and irrigation project. The proposed credit would have two parts:
(a) US$40 million equivalent to finance small scale flood cortrol, drainage
and irrigation works (SSFCDI Works); and (b) US$41.5 million equivalent to
finance flood reha5ilitation works (FRW). Parallel cofinancing for the
SSFCDI part of the project would be provided in the form of a grant by the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for technical assistance and
training (US$ 9.6 million equiva.ent).
2. Background. With a per capita income of US$150, Bangladesh remains one
of the poorest countries in the world and over 70% of its population of about
100 million (1985) continues to live in conditions of absolute poverty.
Agriculture accounts for about 50% of GDP and over 60% of employment and
exports. The country's production of foodgrains falls about 101-15% short of
requirements and annual imports vary between one and two million m ton in
most years. Annual growth in food production averaged about 3.2% during the
Second Five-Year Plan Period (FY81-85) slightly exceeding the population
growth rate of about 2.6% per year. However, large variations in agricul-
tural production are common due to vagaries in weather conditions, par-
ticrlarly rainfall and flooding. Flooding is a normal feature in Bangladesh'
life and is caused by snowmelt in the upper catchment areas of the Ganges and
Brahmaputra rivers and by monsoon rainfall in the lower catchments. A major
flood disaster struck Bangladash in 1987 due to exceptionally high rainfall
during the months July through September. The floods caused loss of life,
and unusually heavy damage to crop, property, livestock and infrastructure.
It is tentatively estimated that the 1987/88 monsoon rice crop will be
reduced by about 1.5 million m ton (from a targeted production of 8.6 million
m ton) and that damcge to major infrastructure is about US$225 million. In
respunse to Government's appeal for assistance to the international donor
community, IDA intends to provide assistance for: (a) rehabilitation of
priority works in five subsectors (main roads; local government roads; flood
control, drainage, irrigation and town protection projects; inland water
transport facilities and school buildings) to be undertaken in the 1987/88
dry season under a free-standing Second Flood Rehabilitation Project to be
presented to the Board shortly; and (b) rehabilitation of other damaged
infrastructure in the five subsectors, cited above, under several other IDA
financed proje-:ts (either proposed or ongoing), including the present Second
Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project. With regard to



-2-
future development, Government recognizes that growth of agricultural produc-
tion has to come from intensification of lfnd use since virtually all avail-
able cultivable land is already cultivated. This requires the construction
of additional flood control and drainage works, furthe- development of
irrigation facilities, and accelerated adoption of productivity increasing
practices, including the use of improved crop varieties, fertilizers and
pesticides. It also requires the alleviation of constraints impeding the
performance of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and other key
Government agencies supporting agricultural development. Main problem areas
for BWDB, identified during past Bank sector work and earlier lending opera-
tions, include: (a) delays of pre-construction activities, particularly
acquisition of land; (b) operation and maintenance (O&M) after construction;
and (c) recovery of O&M cost. A first Small Scale Drainage and Flood Control
Project (Cr. 955-BD), which closed on December 31, 1987, has contributed
successfully towards the growth of agricultural production in Bangladesh and
has helped improve the performance of BWDB through the execution of staff
training programs.
3. Rationale for IDA Involvement. Firstly, the proposed project would be
consistent with Government's and IDA's strategy to increase foodgrain produc-
tion in Bangladesh through investments in low-cost ane quick-yielding flood
control, drainage and irrigation schemes. Secondly, . e project would help
improve BWDB's institutional capacity to plan, construct and maintain water
sector projects. Thirdly, the proposed project would improve the quality of
support provided by the World Food Programme (WFP) and thus enhance col-
laboration between IDA and WFP. Support for the flood rehabilitation works
is justified because the 1987 floods have caused substantial damage and
brought heavy and unexpected pressure on the Government's budget.
4. Project Objectives. The proposed project would: (a) help increase
agricultural production and rural incomes by supporting investments in small
scale subprojects to protect agricultural land against floods, prevent salt
water intrusion, improve drainage, provide water for irrigation or combi-a
tions of these; (b) strengthen BWDB's capacity to implement new projects :ad
to operate and maintain completed projects; and tc) restore damaged flood
protection, drainage, irrigation, and town protection infrastructure in the
shortest possible time in order to minimize losses to the country's economy.
5. Project Description. Under the SSFCDI part, the project would finance:
(a) construction of permanent water control structures in about 200 small
subprojects, covering about 200,000 ha, where earthworks nad beer undertaken
under the Food-For-Work Programme (FFW); (b) construction of about 15 new
subprojects, covering about 5o,OOO ha, requiring both earthworks and struc-
tures; (c) operation and maintenance of completed subprojects for about two
years; (d) procurement of vehicles and equipment; (e) continuation of techni-
cal assistance to BWDB to improve its: (i) capacity to plan and design small
subprojects; (ii) financial management system; and (iii) capacity to estimate
operation and maintenance costs of completed subprojects; and (f) training of



-3-
BWDB staff, local level staff of support agencies and farmers. As under the
first project, subprojects would be selected during project implementation in
full consultation with the beneficiaries and in accordance with agreed
guidelines. Under the FRW part, the project would finance the rehabilitation
of flood proteccion, drainage, irrigation, and town protection infrastructure
destroyed or damaged during the 1987 floods. The FRW part of the project
would also include technical assistance for design work and construction
monitoring and for a mathematical modelling study of the river sections
protected by the existing Brahmaputra Right Embankment which would be essen-
tial for efficient design of future flood protection works along the river.
The SSFCDI part of the project would be carried out over eight years and the
FRW part over three years. The project provides funds for civil works,
7ehicles and equipment, engineering and administration, and technical assis-
tance. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$111.0 million equiv-
alent, with a foreign exchange component of US$19.7 million (18%). A break-
down of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,No.
6904-BD, dated December 22, 1987, is also attached.
6. Agreed Actions. Conditions of effectiveness for the IDA credit would be:
(a) appointment of a consultant firm to assist BWDB with the implementation
of the SSFCDI part of the project; (b) appointment of consultants to assist
BWDB with the design and monitoring of construction work for the FRW part of
the project; (c) signing of the agreement between the Government and CIDA,
which is cofinancing this project; and (d) approval by the Government of the
project proforma. Other agreed actions include: (a) selection of sub-
projects and rehabilitation works in accordance with agreed criteria; (b)
appointment by June 30, 1988 of consultants to undertake benchmark and
evaluation studies; (c) appointment by June 30, 1988 of consultants to assist
BWDB in modernizing its financial management and accounting systems;
(d) appointment by June 30, 1988 of a consultant expert in cost estimating to
assist BWDB in establishing an O&M Cost Cell; (e) appointment by October 31,
1988 of consultants to undertake a mathem.tical modelling study of the Brah-
maputra river; (f) allocation of adequate funds and processing of applica-
tions for land acquisition at least nine months before construction of the
works and transfer of land to BWDB at least one month before construction
would start; (g) establishment of a Subproject Committee at the planuing
stage of each subproject; (h) preparation of a construction manual by June
30, 1988; (i) assignment of 40 sub-assistant engineers to the subproject
sites from the FY89 construction season until completion uf works; (j)
preparation of annual work programs by July 31 of each year; (k) preparaticn
of an operational plan during engineering and an O&M manual within two years
of completion of each subproject; (1) collection of water rates in selected
BWDB projects covering about 100,000 ha to reach full O&M cost recovery by



-4-
June 30, 1995; (m) improvement of water rate collection procedures in accord-
ance with a program satisfactory to IDA; and (n) preparation of proposals to
improve irrigation services in other BWDB projects by June 30, 1988.
7. Justification. The SSFCDI part of the project would result in increases
of farm production due to: (a) lower crop losses because of flood protection
measures; and (b) higher cropping intensities and crop yields because of
improved drainage conditions and expansion of irrigation. Increased produc-
tion at full development is estimated at 160,000 m ton per annum. Average
incomes of about 220,000 families in the subproject areas, comprising
owner-operators, sharecroppers and landless laborers, would increase by about
15% - 20%. Employment would increase by about 4.6 million mandays per annum.
The overall economic rate of return of the SSFCDI part of the project is
estimated at 31%. The FRW part of the project would help restore flood
damaged infrastructure and agricultural productivity in the affected areas
which has one of the highest priorities at this time.
8. Risks. Delays in project implementation due to protracted
pre-construction activities is a risk facing the SSFCDI part of the project.
However, the project comprises a large number of small subprojects and even-
tiial delays are likely to affect only a limited number of subprojects.
Arrangements have been incorporated in the project design to minimize this
risk. Inadequate operation and maintenance of completed subprojects is
another risk. To reduce tiis risk, arrangements have been made to involve
the beneficiaries and representatives of local government authorities in all
stages of subproject planning and implementation. Maintenance of completed
small subprojects would be financed under the project for a period of two
years after completion of construction. Implementation of the FRW part of
the project may also be delayed due to institutional constraints. However,
the works are relatively simple and within the capacity of BWDB. Consultants
services would be provided under the project to assist BWDB with the
implementation of the project.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
