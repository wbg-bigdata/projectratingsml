MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTYVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A MUNICIIPAL SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of C6te d'lvoire for SDR 27.2 million, the
equivalent of US$40 million, on stanldard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance
a Municipal Support Project.
2.    Economic and Sector Background. C6te d'lvoire is one of the principal countries of
the West African Monetary Union (CFA zone), with a population of about 13 million and an
estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$6.7 billion in 1994. The country has been in
recession since 1986 and has a severe external debt problem. High population growth coupled
with economic decline has caused a steady fall in living standards. The Gross National Product
(GNP) per capita is estimated at about US$515 in 1994, compared with more han US$1,000 in
the early 1980s. Social indicators have also been deteriorating, reflecting the effects of the
economic crisis and the neglect of basic social services. Confronted with a lingering economic
crisis since 1986, the govermment decided, with its partner countries in the CFA zone, to
complement ongoing internal adjustment efforts with a realignment of the parity of the CFA franc
from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF per French franc in January 1994. Preliminary results for 1994
suggest that with this parity change and the implementation of the accompanying fiscal, monetary,
and structural adjustment policies, the Ivcrian economy has been able to maintain and strengthen
its international competitiveness and restore economic growth.
3.    The parity change has triggered a quick response of the Bank and the Fund. In 1994,
the government concluded a three-year ESAF program and met virtually all macro-economic
targets. As a result, the IMF disbursed about US$170 million while the Bank approved US$554
million and disbursed about US$469 million. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
paper was prepared in the wake of the devaluation and discussed by the Executive Directors on
June 28, 1994. Major priorities under the FY95-97 CAS are to help the government: (a)
maintain macroeconomic stability and strengthen public sector finances; (b) promote private
sector development; (c) increase the effectiveness of the human resources development program;
(d) strengthen institutional capacity: and (e) intensify environmental work through projects and
the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) process.
4.    In the last three decades, the country has experienced an irreversible social transformation
from a predominantly rural population to an increasingly urban one. The urban population,
distributed in 178 settlements accounted in 1994 for 50 percent of the total population. Ivorian
cities account for nearly two-thirds of the GDP (Abidjan by itself contributes half of the GDP).
On the whole, however, the last decade has witnessed a significant decline of urban investiment
and urban services, the burden of which has been increasingly placed on mnmicipalities. Since
the late 1970s, the government has embarked on an active policy of decentralization. By 1991,
there were 135 fully autonomous commnes, with 6.2 million residents. While the communes
have developed on their own more local revenues than other local communities, the intricate
financial relations between the central government and the municipalities have been undermined
by the distress of public finances.
5.    The urban sector faces three major challenges, which have been exacerbated by the
economic recession: (a) the emergence of widespread urban poverty which has increased since



2                                                    Cdte divoire Municipal Support Projct
1985 at almost twice the national rate. Access to basic services has declined throughout the
country, but within the cities, the poorest population has been affected the most; (b)
eiivironmental degradation, compounded by the increasing number of human settlements in
environmentally fragile areas; and (c) capacity building, both in terms of human resources and
capabilities to design and program demand-driven local investrments and in terms of mobilization
of local resources.
6.    Project Objectives. In line with the CAS objectives, the proposed project would: (a)
improve welfare in urban areas by increasing private sector activity and incomes and improving
urban services; (b) address incomes and living conditions of low-income groups in particular by
extending them employment opportunities and improving their access to basic services; (c)
improve the ability of the national and local governments to sustain urban services by establishing
decentralized financing and managing systems; and (d) contribute to sustained development
through improvement and protection of the urban envirouament.
7.    Project Description. The following two components would support the objectives
discussed above:
Component A: Priority Urban Works (US$41.7 M, 85 percent of base costs)
This component would involve capital improvements, including priority works for small
municipalities, service improvements in low-income urban areas, and loans to
municipalities for revenue-earing investments. Specific subcomponents include:
(i)    Minimum infrastrucue for small muncipaities. This subcomponent would
provide basic social or economic infrastructure to municipalities that now have
limited local resources and access to government grants. The beneficiaries and
the types of investment will be deternined according to the eligibility criteria of
the Comit6 de Coordination et de Gestion du Programme d'Appui a la Conduite
d'Op6rations Municipales (CCG-PACOM), with special focus on labor-intensive
techniques and participation of beneficiaries.
(ii)   Squatter setlement pilot operations. Four operations (Bardo settlement in San
Pedro, Banco in Bouak6, and Grand campement and PK18 in Abidjan) would
improve the conditions in the poorest and most densely populated squatter
settlements in C6te d'Ivoire and test the project's implementation procedures
before a larger rehabilitation program is launched (see below).
(iii)   Low-income areas rehabiiation program.  Squatter settlements would be
rehabilitated in project municipalities. Drainage and potable water along primary
access roads would be financed as well as small-scale community infrastructure
(such as, public latrines, small market areas, and public gardens) provided that
the municipality involves the population in identifing the rehabilitation and
resettlement program and produces, with the assistance of the MACOM, an
Environmental Impact Study for each proposal.
(iv)   Revenue-earning investments. A Municipal Credit Fund (FPCL) was established
under the Municipal Development Project (MDP) to provide long-tenn loans to
municipalities for income-generating investments and other economically and



Cdte d'holre Municipal Support Project                                         3
socially justifiable investments. FPCL will continue to fund these investments
according to specific eligibility criteria.
Component B: Municipl Capacity Building (US$7 M, 15 percent of base costs)
This component would provide for: (a) training to help municipalities design and
implement investments; (b) support to the Mission d'Appui i la Conduite d'Op6rations
Municipales (MACOM), which would be responsible for helping municipalities to plan
and implement investnents; (c) enhanced local resource mobilization through the
financing of cadasters in 18 secondary cities; and (d) provision of small loans to
microenterprises that would be managed by local NGOs. Specific subcomponents would
include:
(i)    lraing. Local consultant services, vehicles, and equipment would be provided
to an existing unit responsible for training municipal officials. The goal is to
develop managerial, financial, and technical capabilities, thus enabling officials
to propose and supervise investments.
(ii)   Settng up the MACOM. The MACOM is located in the DCGTx (Direction et
Controle des Grands Travaux), an agency under the Prime Minister's office. It
would help municipalities to implement component A and contract studies under
component B.
(iii)   Local resource mobiliation. This subcomponent would improve the ability of
local authorities to generate municipal resources. Resource generation would be
achieved through actions to increase the yield from two transferred state taxes:
the land property tax and the professional tax. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the government will submit, no later han April 1998, for the
mid-tenn review, an action plan with a timetable, designed to streamline the
allocation of resources between the State and the municipalities (para. 23a).
(iv)   Support to the informnd sector. Under the Third Urban Project (Ln 2189-VC),
about 400 small loans totalling US$0.6 M (CFAF 158 M) were granted to the
informal sector in Abidjan to strengthen the ability of local NGOs to help
develop nicroenterprises in low-income areas. Under the proposed credit, this
activity would be expanded to interior cities and local NGOs would be given
more responsibility for managing loans.
8.    Project Financing and Cost recovery. The proposed IDA credit of US$40 million will
finance 82 percent of project costs net of taxes and duties (US$48.7 million). Project costs
consist of about US$19 million of foreign costs and US$29.7 million of local costs.
Beneficiaries, municipalities, and government contnbutions amount to US$8.7 million.
Municipalities will contribute 10 percent of all investment costs. Under the Low-Income Areas
Rehabilitation Program, the government will contribute an additional 10 percent. Beneficiaries
will contrbute directly by financing community-based participation programs (an average of 10
percent of construction costs). Local counterpart funding for revenue earning investment financed
dtrough loans granted by the FPCL will amount to 10 percent of the investment cost.
9.    Eighty-six percent of project costs will be recovered through local and central taxation.
Revenue-earning investment costs will be recovered through tariffs and fees. Recurrent costs,



4                                                   Cd:. dhvoire Municipal Support Proect
such as door-to-door solid waste collection, will be recovered from beneficiaries. Cost recovery
procedures were agreed upon during negotiations and included in the Project Implementation
Manual (para. 23b).
10.   Project Implementation.  The overall project will be supervised by the Comit6
Interminist6riel de Gestion du Programme d'Appui A la Conduite d'Op6rations Municipales
(CCG-PACOM). The CCG-PACOM includes representatives of the main ministries involved in
local government management (Interior; Economy, Finance, and Planning; Construction and
Urbanism; Equipment and Transport; Health and Social Affairs) and at least three mayors (to
ensure that approval of subprojects will be as transparent as possible). Representatives from the
MACOM and Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) and other actors in the urban sector
(NGOs, water and electricity companies) may be invited to participate in the aspects of CCG-
PACOM's activities that concern them. Three special accounts will be established: one for the
municipalities, one for the FPCL, and one for the MACOM.
11.   Component A: Priority Urban Works. The CCG-PACOM will be aided in its efforts
by a Technical Secretariat, or th- Mission d'Appui A la Conduite d'Operations Municipales
(MACOM). The MACOM will hai. dle the project's day-to-day managemnent. It will be in charge
of centralizing information on municipality investments and supervising consultants and consulting
firms. The MACOM will help municipalities to identify, design, and justify actions to be carried
out under the project. It will ensure that studies necessary to prepare municipal proposals will
be contracted out to private consulting firms according to the guidelines of the Project
Implementation Manual, that eligibility criteria for subprojects are carefully taken into account,
and that procurement procedures will be implemented by the municipalities accordine to the
Project Implementation Manual (para. 231). The establishment of the MACOM with adequate
qualified staff was confirmed by the govermment prior to negotiations (para. 22a).
12.   Once a subproject has been approved by the CCG-PACOM, a subsidiary agreement, the
so-called Convention d'OpErations d'ht6r6t Collectif (COIC), will be signed between the Ministry
of Interior, on behalf of the govermnent, and each participating municipality. This contract will
spell out the rights and obligations of each party including the role of each in subproject
implementation (para. 23h). The MACOM and the municipalities will be mainly responsible for
project implementation. The municipalities, supported by the MACOM, will handle work
oversight and procurement and contract management, while CAA will disburse project funds.
13.   Revenue-earning investments will be funded and implemented by the Municipal Credit
Fund (FPCL). It is guided and supervised by a loan committee under the authority of the
General Manager of the CAA that includes representatives from the Ministry of Interior, the
Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning, and the General Manager of DCGTx. The
committee monitors FPCL's performance, determines the eligibility of the borrowing
municipalities, approves all loan operations, and stipulates the conditions for executing the project
for which the loan has been granted. The Loan Committee is responsible for periodically
adjusting general loan conditions such as maturity, interest rate, and grace period, based on (a)
the financial situation of the FPCL; (b) the government's decentalization policy; and (c) the
government's credit policy (para. 25b).
14.   Component B: Munipal C city Building. This component will be implemented,
under the supervision of the CCG-PACOM, by a United Nations Development Program-
International Labor Orgaiization (UNDP-ILO) unit regardig training, and by the Direction
G6n6rale du Plan of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning, regarding the support to



COre d'voiro Municipal Support Projocr                                          5
the informal sector. This has successfully been done under the MDP for training and under the
Third Urban Project for the informal sector.
15.   Project Sustainability.  The project will support decentralized administration and
increased accountability in local government, leading to improved urban services as well as
improved planning and maintenance of infrastructure. Sustainability of local investments financed
under the project will be enhanced by improved local taxes collection procedures, improved
fur.ding arrangements with the central government (para. 7Biii), and improved administrative
system. The project will also include training for local officials who will be responsible for
implementing and maintaining the local investments (para. 7Bi).
16.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Approved in 1989, the
Municipal Development Project (MDP, Loan 3127-IVC), disbursed less than 65 percent of its
amount (US$45 M out of US$66 M) before closing on December 31, 1994. It was rated as a
"problem project" for the last three years. At the end of 1993, the government proposed to
restructure the project and extend the closing date. A review was completed in April 1994,
vhich concluded that the MDP should be closed on December 31, 1994, and a new, refocussed
project would be prepared, the design of which would incorporate the lessons leamned from the
MDP.
17.   The main causes of the MDP's failure, identified during the project's completion review
carried out in December 1994, were: (a) inadequate involvement of elected officials and
beneficiaries; (b) improper processing of procurement and disbursement documents; and (c) faulty
design and implementation of small-scale municipal works by a government agency that could
have been better carried out by private local small enterprises. Conflicts between DCGTx and
the central administration, in addition to delays in procurement (more than 12 months on
average), prevented the MDP from building local capacity or implementing institutional reforms.
Lastly, the municipalities, whose budgets were limited by the state, were unable to mobilize
counterpart funds on time. Given these conditions, the MDP was mainly a supply-driven,
centrally-managed project, funding large investments with inadequate regard to local needs.
18.   The new project will overcome this difficulty. It will give as much responsibility as
possible to the municipalities to establish priorities and specifications to meet their needs. (a)
Design and implementation will be carried out with the assistance of the MACOM but under the
supervision of the municipal councils; it would be a demand-driven program allowing the
municipalities to identify and propose investments that meet eligibility criteria, including, among
other things, using labor-intensive techniques and giving priority to investments mitigating social
or environmental impacts. Each investment program being supported by individual agreements
(Convention d'Op6rations d'lnteret Collectif) should spell out central and local government
responsibilities.  (b) To give more autonomy to the municipalities and to accelerate
implementation, the government recently (Arret6 Ministeriel dated December 26, 1994)
authorized municipalities to procure works and services for contracts costing less than CFAF 60
million (US$120,000) without the approval of Direction des Marches Publics (DMP). This
simplified and accelerated procurement procedure will be supervised by the MACOM. Draft
standard bidding documents were reviewed during negotiations. (c) Another breakthrough is the
capacity that the government will give to the municipalities to keep their investment budget either
in a CAA account or in a commercial bank (para. 23d). This measure will allow municipalities
to mobilize counterpart funds up front once their proposal has been agreed upon by the
CCG-PACOM.

19.   An Urban Sector Strategy Review was carried out during 1993 and 1994. The product
of this two-year process departed from the World Bank's conventionai, in-house approach to
strategy formulation. Successes and shortcomings of decentralization were reviewed by working
groups that included mayors as well as central and local administrators. The broad aim of the
process was to involve the government in the strategy formulation and the subsequent
internalization of the strategy's recommendations and action plan. The successful involvement
of stakeholders allowed for data and information gathering that led to detailed recommendations
for the proposed project's objectives.
20.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project complements Bank and
govermnent efforts for overall economic, social, and financial recovery in Cote d'Ivoire. The
project reflects the main priorities of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (para. 4), by: (a)
deepening the reform of public finances through its support to improved cost recovery of urban
services and mobilization of local resources; (b) strengthening institutional capacity through its
support to the decentralization process; (c) promoting environmental awareness; and (d)
promoting the development of small-scale private contractors.  Moreover, as the first
infrastructure project since the devaluation, the proposed project will help mitigate the impact of
the devaluation on the poorest segments of the urban population. During the CAS discussion in
June 1994, concern was expressed about the deterioration of social indicators and the rise in
poverty levels in recent years. Reducing poverty will remain a serious challenge to the
government. To counter real wage declines and rising unemployment in urban areas, the
government wants to provide more resources to municipalities to finance labor-intensive public
works and rehabilitation programs that will generate employment and the project would be
instrumental in promoting this approach.
21.   The Bank has been supporting the decentralization policy process for more than 10 years.
Bank-financed projects proved that urban development must be conceived in a decentralized
context and should take advantage of conmmunities' priorities, organizational abilities, skills, and
willingness to pay; local governments' understanding of local issues and ability to mobilize local
support and resources; technical agencies competencies and managerial skills; and the central
government's financial backing and oversight abilities. With the proposed project, especially
through its contract management arrangements and the involvement of stakeholders, the Bank will
help participating municipalities to use critical tools to manage their own development.
22.   Agreed Actions. Prior to negotiations the government:
(a)    confirmed its agreement on the role and responsibilities of the CCG-PACOM and
of the MACOM and on the composition of the CCG-PACOM (paras. 10 and 11);
and
(b)   sent to IDA the legal document (Arret6 Ministeriel signed by the Minister of
Finance) organizing the delegation of procurement to municipalities for works
which amount to less than CFA 60 M (para. 18).
23.   During negotiations, confirmation and agreement was obtained from the govermnent:
(a)   to submit, no later than April 30, 1998, to the Association, for its review and
comments an action plan describing a program of measures and action, with a
timetable, designed to streamline the allocation of resources between the
Borrower and the municipalities (para. 7.Biii);

preparation and monitoring of project implementation plans, and a format for
quarterly progress reports. Quarterly reports will includie a list of performance
indicators (including a procurement review) to be monitored during implemen-
tation and will be transmitted by the executing agenciezz at the latest one month
after the end of each quarter;
(1)    on a draft Project Implementation Manual (outlining the procurement,
disbursement, subprojects and subloans eligibility criteria, ERR methodology and
approval procedures and other implementation arrangements), and standard
bidding documents (para. 11); and
(m)   on the content of the environmental impact studies, resettlement plans,
beneficiary consultation procedures which will support municipal proposals to be
examined by the CCG-PACOM. This agreement will be reflected in the Project
Implementation Manual (paras. 28 and 29).
24.   Before Board Presentation, the government transmitted to the Association a letter stating
its decentralization and urban policies.
25.   Conditions for Credit Effectiveness are as follows:



8                                                      COto d'ivo/ro Municipal Support Pro/oct
(a)   the Borrower has submitted draft standard bidding documents for the
procurement or goods and works, satisfactory to IDA;
(b)   the FPCL Steering Loan Committee has issu':d the Guidelines on project cycle
and operating procedures under terms and provisions satisfactory to the
Association (para. 13);
(c)    adoption of the Project Implementation Manual satisfactory to IDA (para. 1 1):
and
(d)    establishment of procedures of accounting and consolidation of the MACOM and
CAA financial accounts, satisfactory to IDA.
26.   Poverty category. At least 40 percent of project financing would be disbursed to local
SMEs and wage-arners Assuming that at least 30 percent of the funds for local contracts will
go to unskilled construction labor, more than US$9 M would benefit the poorest urban workers
almost immediately. The project shouid create 2.3 million work-days, 90 percent of which are
for unskilled jobs. Environmental sanitation improvements resulting from project drainage and
maintenance works would benefit about 800,000 mostly poor urban residents.
27.   Environmental impact. Potential environmental problems associated with the project
concern waste disposal and collection, rehabilitation of drains, and maintenance of existing
sanitary facilities. Provision of basic infrastructure in poor neighborhoods may also require some
resettlement. To avoid such problems, safeguards are built into the eligibility criteria for
municipal subprojects. In addition, the project will introduce systematic analyses of infrastructure
investments by the MACOM. The institutional strengthening components for the municipalities
will help them to develop their capacity to undertake environmental screening, impact
assessments, and resettlement plans. These are part of the documentation required by the CCG-
PACOM, prior to die approval of municipal investments.
28.   The Environmental Impact Assessments will be further reviewed and approved by the
MACOM, in close collaboration with the Agence pour l'Amelioration de l'Environnement, which
is the national agency responsible for all environmental issues. Furthermore, the MACOM would
include in its project preparation guidelines a manual defining environmental precautions and
mitigation measures to be taken when executing subprojects (para. 23m).
29.   Participatory approach. Municipalities will be involved in the design, preparation, and
implementation of subprojects. Beneficiary populations in low-income areas will be consulted
before any decision is made with regard to the rehabilitation of their neighborhood. Evidence
of this consultation, suitable to the Association, will be a condition for subproject eligibility.
NGOs will assist the microenterprises in the infornal sector to identify their needs and implement
the loans that they will have been granted (para. 23m).
30.   Project Benefits.  By strengthening the local government and improving basic
infrastructure and services, the project will strengthen the urban economy, improve the living
conditions of the urban poor, and alleviate urban environmental problems. The project will have
a significant physical, economic, and social impact on most Ivorian municipalities and their
surrounding rural areas. Properly planned improvements of infrastructure and environmental
systems (such as roads, drainage, sanitation, and markets) will provide a better environment for
the growth of productive activities and, hence, the municipal revenue base.

31.   Project Risks. They include the possibility of inadequate project preparation capacity
at the local level resulting in slow implementation or low quality subprojects and political
pressures undermining the project's objectives and criteria introduced in the Project
Implementation Manual. The first risk is addressed by assuring the MACOM's assistance to
municipalities. The second risk is addressed by the provision that CCG-PACOM will exclusively
approve local investment subprojects complying with eligibility criteria set forth in the Project
Implementation Manual. In addition, motivated decisions of CCG-PACOM will be published in
the Mayors' Gazette (para. 23g).
32.   Improving local services and municipal management nationwide is an ambitious
undertakdng that will require a sustained effort. Thus the project involves a limited number of
agencies, the most important, the MACOM, being responsible for building the municipal capacity
and reporting directly to the Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Interior.
The Committee will be guided by a set of eligibility criteria and Committee decisions will be
published through the Union of Mayors of Cote d'lvoire to make the process fully transparent.
With respect to procurement delays, the performance indicators create incentives, which, through
a progressive sanctions system, will encourage continuous adaptation of project implementation.
33.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply withthe Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend at the Executive Directors approve it.
