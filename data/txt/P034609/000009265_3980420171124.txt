Country: The Forner Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia                                Project Title: Second Private Sector Development Project
Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The Project is a follow-up to the Private Sector Development Project (PSD 1). Its principal objectives are to: (a) promote growth
of the private sector and create conditions for an effective supply response from viable private enterprises and farmers; (b) facilitate
the transformation of the banking sector and its integration into international financial markets; and (c) stimulate competition in the
credit market. At the level of individual banks, the Project aims to provide hands-on assistance for institutional strengthening and the
adoption of safe and sound banking practices.
..... ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The Project comprises a single component, that is, a credit line totaling DEM 45 million to be intermediated by a number of
participating financial intermediaries (PFI). The PFIs would be expected to meet qualification criteria including capital adequacy and
solid financial condition and to apply lending policies and procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank, when appraising
subprojects of final beneficiaries. Six PFIs have been already qualified under the PSD I and an additional three banks are expected to
be able to meet the qualification criteria in the near future. The subloans under the credit line will be extended for investment and
working capital finance of eligible private enterprises for eligible subprojects.

3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits
The Project is expected to contribute to reversing the country's economic decline and to increasing the private sector share in the
economy, thereby facilitating the country's transition to a market economy. It will:
* Improve access to investment and working capital finance for the private sector;
* Investrnents fmanced by the Project would increase earnings and profitability of private enterprises and yield positive effects
regarding their employment and income generation capacity;
* Through the demonstration effects, the Project will stimulate more open access to the credit market for the private sector.
The Project will further contribute to the strengthening of the banking sector in a number of aspects. It will:
*   Promote competition in the credit markets through encouraging participation of small, new, financially-viable private banks;
*   Improve banks' asset/liabilities portfolio management and the capacity to identify, assess, price and manage banking risks
through direct consultation with senior management in the process of banks appraisal and by technical assistance associated with
the Project. This will improve safety and soundness of the banking system;
*   Improve banks' lending policies, clients and projects appraisal procedures and practices, and loan supervision and administration.
PFIs are expected to follow the Bank's rigorous subproject appraisal and supervision requirements, with analytical tools and
hands-on training provided by the Bank. This is expected to yield positive demonstration effects, as the banks typically apply the
same policies and techniques to their entire lending portfolio; and
*   Assist in strengthening the on-site supervision capacity of the National Bank of Macedonia (NBM) by including NBM
supervisors in the banks appraisal process.
Target Population
*   For the final beneficiaries - private enterprises engaged in any productive economic activity;
*   For participating financial intermediaries - small, new, financially-viable private banks.

provided that they meet the qualification criteria. The qualification criteria, which are identical to those under the PSD 1, include:
(a) satisfactory financial position, acceptable risk profile and capital adequacy meeting international standards, as evidenced by
external audits performed by auditors satisfactory to the Bank; (b) full compliance with NBM prudential regulations and other
applicable legislation; (c) satisfactory financial policies and operating procedures, especially concerning loan classification and
provisioning and project appraisal, and satisfactory technical capacity to identify, appraise and supervise utilization of Bank funds;
(d) adequate profitability and satisfactory operational performnance, especially concerning past-due and non-performing loans and a
collection ratio for the total loan portfolio of minimum 85 percent; and (e) proper governance, management information systems and
internal audits. Interested banks with good quality management, which fail to meet the qualification criteria, are given intensive
coaching by the Bank and the necessary technical assistance until they are able to qualify.
The PFIs' responsibilities include: (a) promotion and building of the project pipeline; (b) appraisal of subprojects and final
beneficiaries; (c) subloan administration; (d) subproject performance supervision; and (e) periodic reporting to the apex unit and the
Bank. The PFIs are required to establish a technical unit, specialized in long-term project lending and properly staffed. Such a unit
will appraise and supervise all subprojects financed by a PFI. The appraisals are to be cleared by the respective PFI's Credit
Committee. A PFI is also expected to introduce appropriate internal audits and controls. Six PFIs have already qualified for
participation under the PSD I and they will continue as intermediaries under the Project, including Komercijalna Banka - Skopje,
Tutunska Banka - Skopje, Rado Banka - Skopje, Stopanska Banka - Bitola, Ohridska Banka - Ohrid and Makedonska Banka - Skopje.
Another three PFIs are likely to be qualified in the near future.
Project coordination and oversight:
Financing will be provided through an apex arrangement to allow open access of new PFIs. The apex functions include:
(a) qualification and accreditation of the PFIs; (b) refinancing of PFI loans to final beneficiaries; (c) monitoring of the use of Bank
funds: (d) administration of the disbursements and collection (repayments) of funds advanced to PFIs; (e) monitoring of PFIs to
ensure their continued qualifications; and (f) reporting to the Bank on all aspects of Project implementation.
PFI Accreditation. Initially, the Bank will retain the responsibility for qualification and accreditation of the PFIs and for periodic
evaluation of their eligibility. This function will be discharged in close cooperation with the NBM. In particular, in accordance with
agreed criteria, the Bank Supervision Department of the NBM will screen financial institutions which have applied to participate in
intermediation of the Bank funds and propose to the Bank financial institutions which are deemed capable to qualify. As a part of the
normal supervision process, the NBM will continue to monitor soundness of PFIs including their capacity to appraise subprojects,
inform the Bank of any deterioration of their financial and operating conditions, and ensure that the PFI subject their financial
statements to external auditing on a regular basis. If a PFI, due to the deterioration of its financial condition, ceases to meet the
qualification criteria, it will be disqualified. The decision on the PFI disqualification will be made by the Bank, upon appraisal of its
financial condition. The cooperation with the NBM Supervision Department during implementation of the PSD I has been excellent.
Credit Line Administration. The apex responsibility for the credit line implementation includes: (a) providing subsidiary
finance to PFls; (b) monitoring the use of Bank funds, including procurement and disbursement; (c) collection from PFIs;
(d) repayment to the Bank; and (e) reporting on the use of project funds and other matters related to implementation of the Project.
A unit having specific responsibility to administer the Bank loan funds (called Project Implementation Unit) has been established in
the International Department of the NBM and staffed with experienced, adequately-trained individuals. The unit has effectively
discharged its functional responsibilities under the PSD I and will continue its function under the Project.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
The apex unit will submit semi-annual reports on commitments, disbursements, collections and arrears under the Project to the
Bank. In addition, the PFIs will maintain proper accounts for subloans including supporting procurement and disbursement
documents, which would be audited annually by external auditors, acceptable to the Bank. Since most subloans would be disbursed
on the basis of SOEs, the regular annual audit will include a special opinion on the adequacy of SOE procedures. Audit reports
should be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the close of a financial year. These audits should include a certification
that the apex and the PFI are in compliance with the financial covenants agreed under the Project. The same arrangements have been
successfully used under the PSD 1.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
The ultimate responsibility for monitoring and evaluation will remain with the Bank, including:
*   PFI appraisal and qualification, and monitoring that the PFIs continue to meet the qualification criteria at all times;
*  A priori evaluation and clearance of PFIs' appraisals of eligibility and creditworthiness of fmal beneficiaries for subprojects above
the free limit, and on a sampling basis during normal supervision missions for the subprojects below the free limit;
*   A priori evaluation and clearance of PFIs' appraisals of subproject eligibility and subproject economic financial analysis for all
subprojects above the free limit, and on a sampling basis during normal supervision missions for subprojects below the free limit;
* Monitoring and a priori clearance of all procurements under the Bank's international competitive bidding procedure;
* Monitoring and a priori clearance of minimum three procurements for each PFI under the international shopping procedure; and
* Supervision of all other procurement on a sampling basis during normal supervision missions.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the Project:   Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: May 16, 1995
The new Country Assistance Strategy for FY99-01 for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is currently under preparation.
The financial and private sector development is considered to be one of the two major thrusts of the new CAS. This Project supports
the following objectives:
* Remove remaining impediments to the development of efficient and competitive banking markets. Improve market transparency.
* Improve safety and soundness of financial intermedieries and markets. Improve governance of deposit taking institutions.
* Improve access to financial markets and the quality of services to the private sector.
The specific objectives supported by the Project are summarized in Annex 1. They are identical to the objectives supported under
the PSD 1.
6.Main sector issues and Governmet tstrategy:----- ------------------------...............................
Banking Sector Issues:
The main issues for the banking sector are:
* Less than competitive financial markets, which are dominated by "old" formerly socially-owned banks;
* Continued problems with Stopanska Banka, the country's largest bank;
* Lack of institutional capacity in the banking sector, especially concerning new banks established after independence;
* Development of efficient and competent banking supervision; and
* Difficulties in access to finance for the private sector enterprises.
Government Strategy:
The Government is addressing the banking sector reform on a number of parallel tracks, and the Bank's assistance has been of
major importance. The banking sector reforms initiated under the FESAC were followed by the PSD I, aiming to solidify the
transformation of the banking sector on a bank-by-bank basis through helping to build the banks' institutional capacity. The Project
will continue with support initiated under the PSD 1. The FESAL/C II, which will address the remaining policy issues in the financial
sector and assist in the development of the insurance sector and capital markets, is currently under preparation. In addition, the
country has an active IMF program and a plethora of bilateral and multilateral donors are providing technical assistance.
......................................................................................I.................. ...............................................
7. Main sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The Project addresses all main issues in the banking sector, except the problem of financial condition and governance of Stopanska
Banka. The Government intends to bring a private, foreign investor into Stopanska Banka with Bank's assistance. The negotiations
with an Austrian bank (a strategic investor) and two international financial institutions are in the critical stage.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection;
The credit line under the PSD I was successful and has been implemented in a record time. The PSD I implementation
performance is summarized in Annex 6. The participating banks have greatly benefited from technical assistance provided in the
context of PSD 1. The Government had originally requested a much higher amount for the PSD 1, but the Bank did not agree. Instead
the Bank agreed to promptly propose a follow-up operation as soon as the PSD I had been committed, which was recorded in the
Minutes of Negotiations and reported to the Board in the Memorandum of the President and to which the Board agreed on May 16,
1996. The Government's request for a follow-up operation was forwarded to the Bank as soon as the target agreed under the PSD I
for the follow-up operation was met. The Project aims to replenish the funds, which were very quickly utilized under the PSD 1, with
some minor adjustments in the design of the credit line.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in tie project design:
The PSD I has been successfully implemented. The evaluation of the PSD I implementation performance is summarized in
Annex 6. As a follow-up, the PSD II will have the same design, except for the following modifications:
*   The subloans under the PSD I have had an upper limit of DEM 800,000, unless the Bank otherwise agrees. The upper limit
under the PSD II has been raised to DEM 2.25 million to better correspond to the actual demand of private clients. There will be
no lower limit for subloans;
*   A component of DEM 4 million was pre-allocated for lending to individual farmers under the PSD I, but the PFIs were hesitant
to lend to farmers due to the very high risk and the unresolved issues concerning credit collateral. This component of PSD I has
not been efficiently used. The PSD II will not have any particular amount pre-allocated for any particular type of customers. The
PFIs will be able to use funds without limitations for any viable project of the private sector for which they are willing to take the
credit risk;
*   The issues which have precluded efficient utilization of the private farmer finance component under the PSD I are being
addressed by a number of other actions and projects. The development of better risk management tools under the planned
Financial Infrastructure Development Project will include modern collateral registers of pledged fixed assets and of movable
property and a risk reference register. Reform of the judiciary system, with a new Law on Executive Procedures, is being
addressed under the Bank's SAL.
ai~    .......................................................I..........................................................I..................................................................................................................
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership;
* All banks in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have applied for participation under the PSD I, and six have managed
to meet the qualification criteria so far. After the PSD I became effective, it took about two months to complete the apex and
PFIs training. The PFIs started to receive subloan applications in early March 1997 and committed the available PSD I funds by
early May 1997;
* There has been broad and very active participation of all stakeholders and the PSD II was prepared in a record setting time;

Country: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia                        Project Title: Second Private Sector Development Project
*   In anticipation of the PSD II, the PFIs have already accepted the subproject applications totaling about DEM 20 million, which
are currently under appraisal. At negotiations, the Borrower has requested that a retroactive financing be available to cover the
financing shortfall between the PSD I and the PSD II.

12. Value added of Bank support:
* For the moment, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia does not have access to international financial markets. A
successful FESAC followed by two Bank's credit lines effectively signals to the international financial community that the
banking sector reform is on a good track and that there are banks capable of meeting the qualification criteria for participation
under the Bank-financed credit lines. International bankers are aware that the banks participating in the Project are under
continuous scrutiny and are provided with technical assistance, if and when necessary, and this usually opens the doors for
additional external finance, or at least improves the terms of correspondence relationships with foreign banks;
* The private sector is crowded out of the domestic credit markets and the terms of financing, even if available, are unsatisfactory
to the private sector. By providing finance with medium to long-term maturities, the Project effectively addresses the critical
financing needs which impair the supply response of the private sector in manufacturing, services and agriculture;
*   The Project provides an opportunity to continue to assist the banks, through training and hands-on consulting, to improve their
lending, risk-management, supervision and loan administration practices. This is especially important for the new, smaller
private banks which normally do not have access to high quality technical assistance.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 7)
13. Economic Assessment             Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=N/A; ERR 15% or higher for each subproject
Economic assessment will be performed on a subproject-by-subproject basis, as part of the appraisal of eligibility of individual
subprojects. Subprojects eligible for PSD II finance must have a minimum economic rate of return of 15 percent.
Fiscal impact
The Project will have a positive fiscal impact due to the increased profitability and output of final beneficiaries after the subprojects
are implemented and the increased profitability of banks as a result of participation in the Project.
14. Financial Assessment                          FRR=  15% or higher for each subproject
Financial assessment will be performed on a subproject-by-subproject basis as part of the appraisal of eligibility of individual
borrowers and subprojects. Subprojects eligible for PSD II finance must have a minimum financial rate of return of 15 percent.
Sensitivity analysis is performed for each subproject, including sensitivity to exchange rate devaluation, to price decreases in the
expected product/services market and to increase in operating cost. For the worse case scenario, whereby the combined negative
impact of changes in the three price categories subject to sensitivity analysis adds to 25 (say, simultaneous devaluation of 10 percent,
production cost increase by 10 percent and output price decrease by 5 percent), the subproject's financial and economic rates of return
are expected to stay over 10 percent. Financial assessment also includes appraisal of creditworthiness of final beneficiaries and of
their capacity to bear the currency and the interest rate risks.
.B  Y ........................................................................................................................................................I..................................................... .......................................
15. Technical Assessment:
Technical assessment will be performed on a subproject-by-subproject basis. The assessment will be based on feasibility studies
performed or verified by reputable consulting companies for all subprojects where the PSD II financing requirements exceed DEM
150,000.
i institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies:
The Project is to be executed by qualified banks which are in a stable financial condition and have an adequate institutional
capacity. The participating banks are thoroughly appraised before being qualified for participation. Their qualification is then
reconfirmed each year, based on their financial and project implementation performance. The appraisal of each bank includes
assessment of its capital adequacy, profitability, risk profile, management quality and institutional capacity.

Not applicable.
18. Environmental Assessment:              Environmental Category               B
In accordance with OD4.01 the Project is classified in the category B. Each subproject requires an environmental clearance by
competent authorities. For subprojects with environmental concerns, an environmental review/analysis is required before the
financing is approved, including the development of mitigation plans. An environmental review manual has been developed under the
PSD I and will continue to be effectively used by the participating banks.

20. Sustainability:
The implementation results are expected to be sustainable:
*   The implementation of PSD I and PSD II will allow the Bank to remain actively involved in building the institutional capacity of
major banks in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for a period of about seven years;
*   Discussions in the process of PFIs appraisal and annual performance reviews is an opportunity for the Bank to provide direct,
systematic and specific inputs to senior managements to develop business strategies, identify risks and operational issues and
design measures to address the issues;
*   Direct technical assistance, including analytical tools and training, is systematically provided to all PFIs to improve policies,
procedures and practices for asset management, project appraisal and supervision, and for loan administration.

TIHE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
SECOND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Appraisal Document
Detailed Project Description
The Project would provide investment and working capital loans to private enterprises and farmers, who
are not able to utilize their development potential due to the lack of medium to long-term foreign exchange
financing in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The finance is targeted to the most viable private
enterprises aiming to improve their profitability and export capacity and to increase their output, earnings and
employment potential. Availability of investment finance is also expected to attract foreign investors. There is
evidence that many of them might be willing to commit equity capital, but are discouraged by the lack of finance
for the post-privatization restructuring.
The design of the Project is the same as the Private Investment Finance Component of the Private Sector
Development Project (PSD I). Subloans of up to DEM2.25 million would be made with 1-10 years maturity and
up to three years grace period. The Bank may approve larger subloan amounts if justified on a project-by-project
basis. Access to finance would be open to viable private enterprises, including agricultural enterprises and
farmers, which are capable of bearing the foreign exchange risk. Eligibility of enterprises and subprojects would
be determined based upon:
a)     financial viability of a subproject, with the expected financial rate of return of minimum 15
percent. The economic viability will be checked for all subprojects affected by significant price
or tariff distortions and should be minimum 15 percent;
b)     satisfactory financial condition of the prospective borrower and capacity to bear the foreign
exchange risk;
c)     presentation of a satisfactory feasibility study, a business plan and a financing plan for
components of subprojects which are not covered under the PFI subloan, including adequate
assurances from cofmanciers or a proof that the enterprise has enough own funds to be able to
implement the subproject; and
d)     clearance by competent authorities concerning environmental aspects.
The subloans will be denominated in Deutsche Marks (DEM). Interest rates would be variable, based on
the Bank's lending rate plus a 100 basis points spread to cover administrative expenses and the PFI related credit
risk of the Government, plus a market-based PFI spread. Proceeds of the subloans would be used to fund capital
investments, including permanent working capital needs. For the private enterprises in the manufacturing sector,
the subprojects will typically aim to improve quality, packaging or to address other product deficiencies; to
improve production cost structure; to address production bottlenecks; or, when having a reasonable prospect to
increase exports, to increase capacity to produce exportable products. For the tourism and services sector, the
subprojects will typically aim to jmprove quality, value-added, or cost structure of services; to address bottlenecks
in service delivery; or to increase the capacity to provide the foreign exchange earning services. For the farmers,
the subprojects would typically aim to imnprove the farming capacity and/or technology and/or farm yields; to
diversify into animal husbandry; or to develop the downstream agro-processing capacity.

Lending Arrangements will be the same as under the PSD I and include: a) a Loan Agreement between
the Bank and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; b) Subsidiary Financing Agreements between National
Bank of Macedonia (NBM) and the PFIs; and c) Subloan Agreements between NBM and the PFIs, back-to-back
to Subloan Agreements between the PFIs and the final beneficiaries. The Subsidiary Financing Agreement
includes: a) acceptance of financing conditions by a PFI; b) commitment to follow the subprojects appraisal
procedures and eligibility criteria agreed with the Bank; c)agreement to establish or strengthen a technical
appraisal unit; d) agreement to establish a Credit Committee; e) agreement to undertake external audits and to
implement auditor's recommendations; and f) agreement to provide periodic reports on the portfolio financed from
Bank funds. Subsidiary Financing Agreements have already been signed with six banks under the PSD I,
including Makedonska, Rado, Tutunska and Komercijalna from Skopje, Stopanska from Bitola and Ohridska from
Ohrid. These Subsidiary Financing Agreements will be amended for the PFIs to operate as intermediaries under
the PSD II Project. Subloan Agreements refer to particular subprojects and are signed once a subproject has been
cleared for Bank finance.
The NBM's subsidiary finance to PFIs ("subsidiary loans") will be extended on a first-come-first-served
basis and back-to-back to the PFI's subloans to final beneficiaries, with identical amounts, maturities and
repayment schedules. The PFIs will onlend the funds to eligible enterprises for eligible projects. The PFIs will
assume the related credit risk. The beneficiaries will assume the foreign exchange risk and the interest rate risk.
Subsidiary and subloans terms and spreads will be reviewed by the Bank from time to time.
Repayments. Repayments by the PFIs to the NBM will match the repayment schedules of the final
borrowers. Should the final borrower prepay all or part of the subloan prior to maturity, the PFI would be
required to immediately prepay its subsidiary loan to the NBM. In case of arrears in principal or interest
repayment on any due date from a final borrower, the PFI will nevertheless be liable for the payment to NBM.
The NBM will establish a rollover fund with resources generated by repayments of all subloans under the project.
Resources from the rollover fund will be available to finance additional subprojects, which meet the same
eligibility criteria, or to service the Bank loan.
Free Limit. Initially, a free limit for both types of finance will not be established. The Bank will
continue to review subloans proposed by each PFI until a PFI's appraisal capacity is deemed satisfactory. At this
time, a free limit for the particular PFI will be established. This free limit will be PFI specific and may be
adjusted from time to time.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement will be performed by final beneficiaries. For items which cost less than DEM 150,000
equivalent, procurement will follow normal commercial practices satisfactory to the Bank'/I. The aggregate
amount of such procurements will not exceed DEM 10 million equivalent. Items which cost DEM 150,000 to
DEM 1.5 million equivalent would be procured through international shopping on the basis of at least three
competitive quotations obtained from suppliers in two eligible countries. The aggregate amount of such
procurements will not exceed DEM 30 million equivalent. For items which cost more than DEM 1.5 million
equivalent, international competitive bidding would be followed. For proprietary items, direct contracting will be
used. The smaller contracts will be reviewed on a sampling basis during regular supervision missions.
Prior review by the Bank will be required for all contracts under the international competitive bidding
procedure, that is above DEM 1.5 million, for the first three procurements of each PFI, and for proprietary items
using direct contracting.

competitive manner and make their selection based on predefined selection criteria. Such criteria is either the lowest price or
some combination of technical score and price offered.

Disbursement
Disbursements will cover: (a) 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures (cif) for directly imported
goods, including expenditures related to purchase of goods concerning intellectual property rights; and (b) 80
percent of locally produced goods, as well as for other items procured locally.
Due to the great number of small disbursements expected under the project, disbursements under DEM I
million per item would be made against a certified statement of expenditures (SOE), for which appropriate
documentation would be retained by the PFIs and implementing agencies. Disbursements above DEM 1 million
per item would be made on the basis of full documentation. The Bank's reimbursement would be limited to
expenditures made by a subborrower not more than 180 days prior to the Bank's receipt of the request for
reimbursement.
Special Account. Since the project would involve the financing of many small items, a special account
would be created in a mutually agreed bank to facilitate disbursement. Most expenditures under the project
(which are approved by the PFIs and subsequently authorized by the Bank) would be met out of the funds in the
special account. When appropriate, special commitments or direct payment to foreign suppliers may also be used.
The Bank would disburse an initial amount of DEM 4 million into the special account upon effectiveness of the
proposed Loan and would periodically replenish the account on the basis of reimbursement requests. The
authorized allocation would be DEM 4 million. The minimum application size for direct payments and Special
Commitments will be DEM 400,000.
The authorized allocation could be requested in full upon loan effectiveness because the Project is a
follow-up operation to the PSD I with the same apex and six participating banks, which are already well
acquainted with Bank disbursement procedures, and therefore there is no reason to have a lower initial deposit
requirement in the Legal Agreement. The demand for Bank finance has been very high and PFIs have already
received applications for subprojects amounting to additional DEM20 million, which are being appraised. This is
expected to result in an immediate need for high disbursements as soon as the proposed Loan becomes effective.
Retroactive Finance will be available for up to DEM 4 million. Providing that the procurement of
goods subject to retroactive financing has followed the agreed Bank procurement procedures, the retroactive
financing would apply to payments on contracts effected on or after May 1, 1997.

SECOND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Appraisal Document
Implementation Performance of the Private Sector Development Project
The Private Sector Development Project (PSD I) comprised a DEM 14 million credit line component for
investments and working capital finance of private sector enterprises and a DEM 4 million credit line component for
investments of individual private farmers. The PSD I was expected to be implemented in about two and half years. The
pilot was expected to indicate: a) if there are banks which are able to meet the rather strict PSD I participation criteria
and are the banks wiling and able to intermediate Bank funds. Are the banks efficient in resource allocation; b) is there
a viable private sector demand, and what exactly is the nature of such demand. Are the banks willing to take the credit
risk of lending to the private sector, under what terms and conditions and for what price; and c) is there a viable
farmers' demand for which the banks are willing to take the credit risk. Is the currency risk acceptable to farmers.
At negotiations, the Bank agreed to seek a Board approval, on the no-objection basis, for a follow-up operation
as soon as DEM 15 million from the PSD I funds have been committed. This was announced to the Board. The PSD
I implementation has been very fast. The PSD I loan was declared effective on December 20, 1996. The intense
training of the apex unit in the National Bank of Macedonia (NBM) and of the participating financial intermediaries
(PFI) took place in January and February 1997. The PFIs started to receive subloan applications in early March 1997.
The DEM 15 million has been committed by early May 1997. Following is the evaluation of the PSD I implementation
and the lessons learned from the PSD I project.
ParticiRating Financial Internediaries (PFD
The PSD I generated a very strong interest and about 12 private banks, accounting for some 95 percent of the
total credit market in Macedonia, applied for participation. In cooperation with NBM, the Bank appraised all applicants
including their financial position and capital adequacy, risk profile, funding structure, quality of credit portfolio, lending
policies and procedures, internal controls, corporate governance quality, management information systems and
institutional development levels. Five banks managed to meet the PSD I participation criteria as of end-1996, including
Komercijalna, Tutunska, Rado and Makedonska Banka from Skopje and Stopanska Banka from Bitola. In May 1997, all
PFIs managed to confirm their qualification. Their risk weighted capital adequacy averages about 25 percent,
profitability has further improved in the course of 1996, and 1997 promises to be a very successful year. Ohridska
Banka, a new private bank from Ohrid, received the PFI status.
Implementation of the PSD Private Sector Comgonent
The implementation of the private sector component has been fast and efficient. There is a high and viable
demand for investment funds, which is typically accompanied by incremental working capital fnance requests. About
22 private sector subprojects have been presented by the PFIs, of which the first 18 were approved. The commitments
for the 18 subprojects exhausted the funds available under the PSD private sector component. The summary of
subprojects cleared by the Bank is presented in the Attachment to this Annex. The excess demand is very strong. PFIs
are receiving further applications and the subprojects are being reviewed by the PFIs.
The resource allocation by the PFIs for the 18 subprojects is deemed efficient. The subprojects have robust
financial rates of return ranging from 25 to 40 percent, and economic rates of return of over 25 percent. They involve

Annex 6
Page 2 of 3
enterprises in nine cities, i.e., practically all larger urban centers in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and
concern eight industrial and services subsectors. The subprojects include two new factories and a new business hotel
in Skopje which would, by conservative estimates, employ some 250 people. They are to be built by trading companies
with an import substitution goal. Another 12 subprojects are export oriented and aim to address problems which have
impeded competitiveness of otherwise exportable products of country's industries. The demonstration effects will be felt
in practically all industrial centers of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and all major productive sectors of the
economy.
The PFIs' subloans have been extended with matunties of 4-7 years, with an average of about 6 years. The
limit of maximum DEM 800,000 per subloan under the PSD I turned out to be too small. The private sector entities,
who are an acceptable credit risk for the PFIs, are typically medium size private enterprises with export orientation or
foreign-trade companies wishing to diversify into manufacturing or foreign exchange earning services.  A typical
subloan requested by such clients averaged DEM 1.5 - 2 million. The maximum subloan limit under the PSD II is,
therefore, increased to DEM 2.25 million.
Private Farmer Finance Component
There were eight subloans submitted for Bank clearance under this component, although 42 applications have
been filed with the PFIs. The mission assessed the reasons for the hesitance of PFIs to engage in private farmer finance.
The bottom line is that the farmers, for the time being, present an unacceptable credit risk for the PFIs. This is because:
-      Credit risk assessment is very difficult. Farmers do not have balance sheets and income statements.
Assets are difficult to evaluate. Markets for agricultural products are volatile with frequent and
significant price fluctuations, therefore the income of farmers is hard to predict;
-      PFIs are concerned about the announced change of Government agricultural policies, as the impact
of these policies is hard to evaluate;
-      Farmers do not have a prior relationship with a bank, for example to open a gyro account or use
bank's financial services, and such a relationship is normally a prerequisite for a bank to feel
comfortable to extend loans;
-      The collateral offered by farmers has dubious value. Land does not have proper land records, it is
hard to sell in rural areas and the prices are volatile. Buildings have no building or usage permits,
they have often not been registered, they are hard to sell in rural areas, and the market is volatile.
Movable collateral is not acceptable, since there is currently no way to register a pledge on movable
property; and
-      Credit insurance is theoretically available, but it is very expensive and the insurance companies are
hesitant to sell the insurance due to the collateral problems.
Since the PSD I private farmer component was not utilized as effectively as the private sector finance
component, the PSD II does not have any pre-allocations for the farmers. The PFIs would be able to extend
the PSD II subloans for any viable private economic activity for which they are willing to take the credit risk.
Parallel Initiatives
The problem of less then adequate access to finance for the farners and small, new private sector
entities would be addressed through a parallel set of actions aiming to help overcome the credit risk related



- 19 -
Annex 6
Page 3 of 3
concerns, which are the case in point. The following measures, which would effectively help to address this
issue, have been identified:
-      Legal framework concerning the right of creditors to collect collateral and the ease by which
the collection can be executed needs to be substantially improved;
-      The quality of information on pledges and mortgages for fixed capital and movable
properties needs to be substantially improved;
-      Banks needs better tools to help them assess the credit risk for farmers and other clients who
do not have prior relationships with the banking system;
-      Some mechanism to insure, at least in part, the credit risk exposure to farmers and private
enterprises which are less then two years in operation would stimulate the banks to lend to
such clients.
The necessary improvements in the legal framework are already on the SAL agenda. The problems
concerning the quality of information would be effectively addressed by a program to develop an integrated
system of national registers in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including a movable property
register and a credit risk reference register.
Concerning a mechanism to help shoulder the credit risk, the Government contemplates establishment
of a Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) which would extend credit guarantees to farmers and very small private
sector entities. Such a CGF would guarantee small loans, for example, up to 65 percent of the loan principal
for the mnaximum of DEM 50,000 and a maturity of up to five years. The banks would be expected to take the
risk for the remaining 35 percent of the loan principal and for the interest. This would keep the banks
interested to appraise a loan with due diligence and to carefully supervise the loan.
The CGF should be administered by a financial institution selected on a competitive basis. Once
established, it will be self-financed. The CGF should have the right to appraise the loan for which the
guarantee is being sought, and to refuse the guarantee. The clients would pay a guarantee fee, which would be
used to cover the cost of CGF administration. The CGF would be capitalized by a number of bilateral donors
and possibly by a small contribution from banks wishing to have the right to use its guarantees for their loans.
