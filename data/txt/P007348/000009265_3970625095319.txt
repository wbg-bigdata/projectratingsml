AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Credit 628-HO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.         This completion report covers a credit project, for which
Credit 628-HO was approved in May, 1976, in the sum of US$14 million.
The Closing Date was June 30, 1983, but disbursements were authorized through
February 2, 1984. An amount of US$24,689 was cancelled on February 2, 1984.
2.         The report was prepared by the Latin American and the Caribbean
Regional Office on the basis of the country visits in January and February,
1984, and a completion report prepared by the Project Unit of the Honduran
Central Bank, delivered to the Bank on August 13, 1984.
3.         Other sources of information for the completion report were:  the
Appraisal Report No. 1044a-H0 dated May 6, 1976; the Credit Agreement No.
628-HO dated July 2, 1976; the Project Completion Report No. 4250 of the
Honduran Second Livestock Development Project (Credit 434-HO), dated December
30, 1982; supervision reports; correspondence with Borrower and internal Bank
memoranda as contained in relevant Bank files; and discussions with Bank
staff associated with the project. The project was not selected for audit by
OED.
4.         A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on April 23,
1985 for comments. Comments received appear as Attachment 1.

HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The general objectives of the project were to:  (a) expand the area
under food crops and livestock production; (b) increase export earnings and
import substitution; (c) increase farm and agroindustrial employment
opportunities; (d) maintain the momentum of the agrarian reform. In order to
achieve these objectives the project provided credit to finance the develop-
ment of livestock, crops, agroindustries and to purchase heavy machinery, as
well as technical assistance to support selected agricultural technical
institutions for the improvement of services to land reform and other
beneficiaries.
2.         The main objectives of the project were generally met:  (a) for
livestock, new pastures were established in 12,341 ha and an additional 8,078
ha of pastures were improved (para. 3.04); for crops, 4,400 ha of land were
cleared (para. 3.09); (b) regarding export earnings and import substitution,
the project helped to increment the annual production of meat and milk by
1,170 m ton and 7,545 m ton respectively (para. 3.05) and an incremental
production of 18,000 m ton of sugar was achieved (para. 3.13); (c) as regards
the farm employment, it is estimated that the project may have generated
about 600 additional jobs for permanent laborers and about 3,000 additional
jobs for temporary laborers only in the cattle dual-purpose and sugarcane
farms (para. 4.04); and (d) the project maintained the momentum of the
agrarian reform financing 32 agrarian reform cooperatives with a total of 860
members (Table 3.1).
3.        Because the initial period of project implementation (1976 to 1979) was
a time of economic growth and attractive rising prices and export opportunities,
the bulk of US$6.3 million for general credit activities was disbursed during that
period. However, the slow implementation and disbursement of the technical
services component resulted in three extensions of the project Closing Date, the
latest to June 30, 1983, or two years beyond the originally scheduled Closing Date
(June 15, 1981).
4.        The execution of the credit component was carried out, in general terms,
as anticipated at appraisal (para. 3.02). At the end of 1979 all funds originally
allocated to credit had been totally committed, except for those funds earmarked
for the Isleta Banana Cooperative (para. 3.14). Later, in 1982, these funds were
reallocated to the general credit category.
5.        The progress in the execution of the technical services component in
three of the beneficiary institutions: Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN),
National Agrarian Institute (INA), and Honduran Banana Corporation (COHBANA),
was exceedingly slow and project funds were fully disbursed at the end of 1983
only, after seven years of project implementation. However, the Project Unit and
EAP were the exception: their assigned project funds were utilized on schedule
(para. 3.16 and 3.17).



6.        A number of technical studies were carried out with mixed results by the
beneficiary institutions under the technical assistance component. Three
institutions (MRN, INA and COHBANA) did not fully profit from the financial help
that they received. Five major regional studies were carried out by MRN with
project funds, out of which only three appeared to be of interest to the
Government (para. 3.18 to 3.24).
7.        The farm model-specific estimates of financial and economic rates of
return at completion under the credit component were comparable to the appraisal
estimates. The FRR and ERR for the typical dual-purpose (dairy/beef) farm
fluctuated between 23Z-28Z and 24Z-26X, respectively, as compared to appraisal
estimates of 152 and 35%. The FRR of a typical sugarcane farm was estimated to be
about 23%, and the ERR to be above 50% (para. 4.01 to 4.03).
8.        The project was very successful in attracting all ten private banks of
Honduras, in addition to the National Bank of Agricultural Development (BANADESA),
to participate in project implementation. The performance of these banks was
satisfactory, except with regard to Loan recovery. The 1979 and 1980 weighted
average recovery rate for principal was 73%, but it deteriorated to about 61% for
1983 (para. 5.05).
9.        A lesson learned from this project is that the implementation of the
non-credit components is very difficult. It took much more time than anticipated
at appraisal due mainly to the fact that four different agencies were involved
(para. 3.17), and some of them with objectives not directly related to the credit
conponent. In future operation, to the extent feasible, these components should
be linked to the credit component and be implemented by the agency coordinating
the credit component itself (para. 7.02).
10.       The major institutional achievements that resulted from this project are
the following:
a) the strengthening of the Central Bank's Project Unit through the
expansion of its technical staff and improvement of its operational procedures
(para. 5.03);
b) the organization of an M&E section within the Project Unit with
specialized staff at the regional level and a coordinator at Tegucigalpa
(para. 3.35); and
c) the improvement of accounting, auditing and the measurement of the
arrears situation of the participating intermediaries (para. 3.36).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In the early 1970s the economy was in a state of recession, with
the agricultural sector growing slowly. GDP per capita was about US$340,
with 60Z of the rural population receiving annual incomes of less than
US$100. Some of the main factors for the slow growth of the agricultural
sector were hurricane damage to banana plantations in 1969, 1973, 1974 and
1975 (Fifi); dtoughts in 1972 and 1975; a war with El Salvador in 1969;
virtual withdrawal from the Central American Common Market in 1971 causing a
slump in trade; restrictions on beef exports to the USA and reduced world
beef prices after 1973; and the sharp increase, starting in 1973 of prices
paid for oil and other imported goods.
1.02      In December 1972, to address rural poverty and to create more
stable political conditions for the improvement of the agricultural sector,
the Government started to implement the agrarian reform. A more
comprehensive agrarian reform law was promulgated in January 1975 and aimed
at improving land utilization by transferring poorly used land held by large
landowners to landless rural families. The Bank supported this Government
effort.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A.  Identification/Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      In October 1975, the Central Bank, on behalf of the Government of
Honduras, submitted a loan application to IDA for assistance to finance a
project which would provide (a) agricultural and livestock credit to farmers
and (b) technical assistance to some institutions of the agricultural
sector. The project was prepared jointly by the Central Bank's Agricultural
Credit Project Unit (UPCA) and personnel of other Honduran institutions
closely connected with the agricultural sector. The proposed project was
appraised by an IDA mission which visited Honduras in October/November 197T.
B. Negotiations and Board Approval
2.02      Negotiations for the Agricultural Credit Project took place in
Washington in April 1976 with representatives of the Government, the Central
Bank of Hooduras and IDA. On May 18, 1976, the Credit was approved by the
Board. The Board was concerned that: (a) the small-scale farmer would have
a minor role in the project; (b) sufficient safeguards had not been built in
to ensure the full participation of the beneficiaries of the agrarian reform;
and (c) the Bank's lending program for Honduras did not focus on supporting
the poorest 40% of the Honduran population.

C. Objectives and Description
2.U3      The primary objectives of the project were to:
(a) expand the area under food crops and livestock production;
(b) increase export earnings and import substitution;
(c) increase farm and agroindustrial employment opportunities; and
(d) maintain the momentum of the agrarian reform.
2.04      In order to achieve these objectives the project was designed to
provide:  (a) credit for the development of livestock, crops, agroindustries
and for purchase of heavy agricultural machinery; and (b) technical services
to support selected agricultural technical institutions. The primary
executing agency was UPCA which was responsible for the credit activities of
the First Livestock Credit Development Project (Credit 179-HO) and the Second
Livestock Development Project (Credit 434-HO). The technical assistance
component was implemented by each beneficiary institution under separate
agreements with the Central Bank.
2.05      The two previous livestock projects (para. 2.04) provided credit
for livestock only, and their beneficiaries were medium- and large-scale
farmers. However, in the second project funds amounting to US$1.0 million
were reallocated to finance banana rehabilitation.  The Agricultural Credit
Project, on the other hand, included credit for crops, which was expected
would mainly benefit agrarian reform groups. The technical services
component in the latter project also emphasized assistance to agrarian reform
beneficiaries.
D. Project Cost and Financing
2.06      Total project cost was estimated at US$20.0 million, of which IDA
was to contribute approximately 70% (US$14.0 million) to cover the foreign
exchange component (US$12.0 million) and some local currency costs (US$2.0
million equivalent). The financial intermediaries were to contribute 15%
(US$3.0 million), the Central Bank 5% (US$1.0 million), and farmers the
remaining 10% (US$2.0 million).
2.07      At completion, in current prices, total project cost (US$20.5
million) was 102% of appraisal estimate. With respect to project financing,
IDA participation at appraisal was 70%; actual figures show 68%, while the
actual participation of the Central Bank increased eight percentage points
because the technical services cost was higher than anticipated at appraisal,
as outlined in table 2.1. The Central Bank, as was agreed, provided the
necessary working capital, complementary to the medium- and long-term
investments. Short-term subloans amounted to US$3.1 million at constant
prices.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The Credit became effective oi December 10, 1976.  Project
implementation followed, and the first IDA supervision mission took place in
July 1976. The SAR assumed a five-year implementation period, and the
project was expected to be completed by June 15, 1981. However, the project
was fully completed after seven years of implementation (June 30, 1983).
Table 3.1 shows total project costs by component.
A. Project Components
(i) Agricultural Credit
3.02      Three hundred and fifty-eight subloans were approved against the
proceeds of the Agricultural Credit Project. This result exceeded by 12Z the
number of subloans that were estimated at appraisal. However, 1,186 families
(69% of appraisal estimate) benefitted. The shortfall in the actual number
of beneficiary families relative to appraisal assumptions was mainly due to
the fact that the Isleta subloan never materialized (para. 3.14).
3.03      The analysis of the impact of the project was based on a fairly
representative survey of 36 dual-purpose (dairy/beef) farms and 15 rainfed
sugarcane farms conducted by UPCA in 1982. UPCA followed the evaluation
method of comparing situations before and after the project. The first field
survey was carried out in 1979, the year that the M&E section in UPCA was
organized (para. 3.34). The analysis and evaluation procedure was geared
primarily toward identifying three farm models:  two different representative
dual-purpose farms (:innex 1 presents UPCA's findings) and one typical
sugarcane farm in the south (Annex 2 presents the financial and economic
analysis of sugarcane investments). The credit components are discussed in
detail below:
Livestock Subloans
3.04      Two hundred and fifty subloans were approved for livestock
development, 98% of the appraisal estimate. The average size of farm
financed was four times larger than anticipated at appraisal, thus mainly
medium-- and large-scale farmers, and to a lesser extent cooperatives,
profited from these operations. The proceeds of the credit component made
the following physical investments possible for livestock development:
(a) establishment of 12,341 ha of new pastures and the improvement of an
additional 8,078 ha; (b) installation of 1,722 km of new fencing and repair
of 1,008 km of existing fences; (c) construction of 201 corrals for
stock-handling purposes; (d) purchase of 91 pure bred females, 4,270
commercial standard females and 444 bulls for improvement of the breeding
herd; and (e) investments for pig development; and (f) well drilling,
drinking troughs and forage equipment.

3.05      Dual-Purpose Farms.  One hundred and seventy-eight subloans for
dairy/beef were approved, 83% of the appraisal estimate. An area of
31,000 ha was covered by this activity, four times larger than anticipated at
appraisal. These operations were designed to represent the first steps
towards increasing productivity and profit per hectare through the use of
improved pastures and subdivisions. Although extensive techniqdes still
prevail, some progress in productivity was made. The quality and management
of cattle improved. The production of milk per head increased by 17% in
three years (a little lower than the appraisal estimate of 2OZ), and total
annual incremental production of meat and milk has reached 1,170 m ton and
7,545 m ton (94% and 96% of appraisal estimates respectively). UPCA analysed
the results and impact of dual-purpose farms, as summarized in Annex 1.
3.06      Fattening Farms.  Thirty-six subloans for fattening were approved,
90% of the appraisal estimate. An area of 8,500 ha was covered by this
component, three times more than estimated at appraisal. It was assumed that
under the project cattle fattening would be integrated with cropping
enterprises and would center on grazing in unfertilized pastures with
supplementary feeding of cattle with minerals, urea and molasses. These
operations have contributed to an annual incremental production of about
600 m tons of meat, 86% of appraisal estimates and were successfully carried
out by progressive medium- and large-scale farmers.
3.07      Other Livestock Farms.  Thirty-six subloans not anticipated at
appraisal for dairy, breeding/fattening and pig farms were approved. An area
of 7,800 ha was covered by these farms. At appraisal it was foreseen that,
as the demand for agricultural land for cropping increased as a result of the
agrarian reform, there would be geographic shifts-breeding/fattening
activities would be confined to the drier and/or hilly remote areas.
Dairies would be concentrated around main population centers. To some
extent, the project helped to initiate a re-structuring of the industry into
specialized beef cattle and dairy farms. Fresh milk is now available in the
most important cities of the country.
Crop Subloans
3.08      Ninety-three subloans were approved for crop development, an
increase of 80% over the appraisal estimate. Thirty-one agrarian reform
cooperatives received subloans under the project, and some of the crop farms
financed were small.   Twenty-eight percent of the farms had less than 20 ha,
and were located in the Atlantic zone and in the south of the country (San
Pedro Sula and Choluteca) where UPCA has regional offices.
3.09      The proceeds of the credit component made the following physical
investments possible for crop development: (a) land clearing of 4,400 ha;
(b) land preparation of 3,753 ha; (c) purchases of 24 tractors, 8 bulldozers,
116 spraying machines and 4 harvesting combines; and (d) construction of
7 storage buildings and 4 sheds.
3.10      B-nana Farms.  No subloans were granted for the development of
banana farmt even though it was planned at appraisal that at full
development tnere would be an annual incremental production of about 85,000
m tons. During project implementation, small independent farm beneficiaries
of the agrarian reform were not interested in becoming cooperative members
because they would have had to give up their laud in order to join.



- 7 -
3.11      Rice Farms.  Eleven subloans were approved for rice development,
55Z of the appraisal estimate. The objective in this type of lending was to
increase rice production for the domestic market. The incremental production
of rice expected at full development would reach 4,000 m tons, 57% of
appraisal estimates.
3.12      Other Crops.  Six subloans were granted for other crops, such as
fruits and vegetables, 50Z of the appraisal estimate. The area covered
(300 ha) and the average amount per subloan were the same as estimated at
appraisal. In terms of subloans targets, results are satisfactory.
3.13      Sugarcane.  Seventy-six subloans, covering about 3,000 ha, were
approved for sugarcane investments. Of these, 21 were granted to
cooperatives. Surveyed farms indicated that the project has contributed to
an annual incremental production of about 200,000 m ton of cane, equivalent
to about 18,000 m ton of sugar.
3.14      Isleta Banana Plantation.  At appraisal it was estimated that it
would cost US$2.3 million to rehabilitate 2,000 ha of the Isleta Plantation.
A US$1.0 million subloan had been granted under the previous Credit (Credit
434-HO). A new subloan of US$800,000 was included in this credit at
appraisal, of which IDA was to finance 100%. The Honduran Banana Corporation
(COHBANA) decided in 1981 that Isleta could not cover its debt service
payments on previous subloans because of lack of competent management in the
cooperative and an increase in administration expenses. IDA suggested an
external audit of Isleta's 1981 accounts; however, Isleta's officials did not
permit the audit because there was an internal struggle among its members.
In addition, in early 1981, as a result of a strike and social and political
disturbances, the cooperative suffered a loss of US$1.7 million, as
estimated by COHBANA. In light of this, IDA saw no point in granting funds
to Isleta under the project. The Government then requested a reallocation of
the Isleta funds, which was approved on February 1, 1982. In this
reallocation, 25% of these funds were reallocated to credit and 75% to
technical services. This took place after five years of project execution
when the project Closing Date had already been postponed to March 31, 1982.
The Closing Date was subsequently further extended to June 30, 1983.
Agroindustries and Heavy Machinery Subloans
3.15      Six subloans were approved for agroindustrial development ard nine
for heavy machinery. The subloans target was accomplished. The project
helped to establish two successful milk collection centers and one oil
extractor plant in La Ceiba and some local private heavy machinery
contractors in the north of the country.
(ii) Technical Services Component
3.16      The technical services component was implemented during a period
characterized by a great deal of political instability among public sector
institutions. This instability was caused mainly by frequent changes of high
level officials, which affected the continuity of the implementation of this
component. About US$6.3 million of IDA funds were allocated to UPCA and four
institutions of the agricultural sector (MRN; INA; COHBANA; and the Pan
American Agricultural School, EAP) to strengthen their research, extension
and training programs.

3.17      Technical assistance agreements between the four beneficiary
institutions and the Central Bank were signed between November 1977 and
March 1978. By the end of 1980 only 60X of project funds had been utilized.
Funds were finally disbursed in February 1984, six years after signing the
agreements. The Project Unit and EAP utilized their funds on schedule, while
the delay of MRN, INA and COHBANA in spending their funds can be attributed
to: (a) frequent staff changes; (b) inadequate support to the project from
high level officials of these participating agencies; (c) complicated and
bureaucratic administrative procedures; and (d) long and delayed procurement
processes. Table 3.2 shows project activities under the technical services
component.
Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN)
3.18      IICA Technical Assistance to MRN.  An agreement between MRN and the
Inter-American Institute for Agricultural Cooperation (IICA) helped to
restructure the research extension and training programs of MRN. Under the
agreement:    11 different IICA consultants advised MRN (144.5 staff-months);
61 technical documents were published; 58 young professionals ulere trained in
service; 149 professionals were sent abroad to participate ir. study tours,
seminars, symposia; and 20 permanent local staff, who still work in the MRN,
were trained. Some operational problems were present during the execution
of the agreement. As a result, there was a confrontation which led to the
annulment of the contract in December 1980 and the signing of a new contract
in July 1981. IICA's coordinator in Honduras attempted to exercise control
over the consultants' work program, a task that more properly belonged to the
MRN coordinator. The new contract clearly stated that the consultants
report to MRN, and that the role of the IICA coordinator was merely one of
liaison with IICA headquarters. A new team of consultants took over the work
that was begun by the former team, and permanent staff of MRN were assigned
as working counterparts. The technical assistance to MRN provided by IICA at
the time was successful, the research and extension services were
restructured and its technical staff trained. The contract between MRN and
IICA was extended in mid-1982 to enable IICA to complete its consultative
work.
3.19      Seed Laboratory.  The building and equipping of the seed laboratory
helped MRN to establish an efficient system of production, multiplication and
certification of seeds. The seeds expert, who was part of the MRN/IICA
agreement, assisted in beginning work at the seeds laboratory and
participated in the preparation of a new seed law that was enacted in July
1980. However, the MRN has not yet promoted or established conditions and
incentives to encourage the participation of the private sector to develop
the seed industry.
3.20      Ulua River Flood Control Study.  A feasibility study was carried
out by Wilfredo Sierra Pineda, a local consultant firm, for flood protection
and drainage of about 2,000 ha, the area where former banana plantations were
to be rehabilitated. This study was presented on schedule; the Project Unit
and IDA thought that the report was satisfactory. It was intended to benefit
two groups of peasants, who would be organized into banana producers'
cooperatives, which were not formed (para. 3.10).
3.21      A Reconnaissance Study of the Sugar Industry.  This study was
awarded to Booker Agriculture International Limited, a London firm, and has



- 10 -
been successfully completed. Although the consultants' mission was in
Honduras for only a short period, their report, in the opinion of UPCA and
IDA, was a good one. However, despite the fact that the Ministry asked for
the study to be undertaken, IDA has noL received comments from either the
Ministry or the sugar industry subsector. Further, no use has been made of
the study to date.
3.22      Survey of Underground Water in Choluteca Valley.  This study was
carried out by Nippon Koei, a Japanese consulting firm. The findings of the
investigations of the consultants were disappointing because large-scale
groundwater exploitation was shown not to be feasible. The amount and the
quality of groundwater found was not as expected (only 2,000 ha could be
irrigated with groundwater). However, the study was considered valuable
because new sources of irrigation water must now be identified.
3.23      Honduran Livestock, Diagnosis and Perspective.  This study was
awarded to LATINOCONSULT, an Argentinean consulting firm. MRN, UPCA and IDA
consider that this is a very important study. The Government has received
the final report on October 1984 and is in the process of reviewing it.
Following the review, the report will be made available to the Bank for
discussion of its recommendations.
3.24      Hydraulic Master Plan for the Aguan Valley.  This study, which was
considered to be very important by the Honduran Government, was carried out
by Sir William Halcrow and Partners, a London firm, under the supervision of
UNDP, the executing Agency. The study was totally financed with proceeds of
the first and second Agricultural Credit Projects: US$400,000 from Credit
628-HO and US$1.0 million from Credit 1005-HO/Loan 1833-HO. The Bank was
involved in this study from its inception and was willing to participate
provided that the study would be undertaken by a firm of consultants
recruited internationally. Previously, the Bank had partially financed the
first contract between the Government and UNDP for the development of the
Aguan Valley (with proceeds of Loan 1576-HO, the Guayape Project) that had
yielded very meager results. A Bank staff member participated in the
supervision of the hydrology work. The Bank recently received a copy of the
final report. As a result of the study, the Government asked the same
consulting firm to prepare the feasibility study for the first stage of a
project in the Aguan Valley (Chapagua Project) which comprises about
30,000 ha and was selected as first priority in the Master Plan. This
feasibility study, not financed by the Bank, was completed in December 1984.
National Agrarian Institute (INA)
3.25      IICA Technical Assistance to INA.  Through the agreemert with IICA,
INA hired four consultants for 56 staff-months, and 31 technical documents on
cooperatives were prepared, out of which 24 were concerned with INA's
agrarian reform projects. There is no evidence that this technical
assistance benefited INA, and it remains to be seen if the documents will be
used by the Government.
3.26      Machinery and Equipment.  The heavy agricultural machinery and
equipment INA acquired under the project were initially poorly utilized and
very badly maintained according to a field survey conducted by UPCA at the
end of 1980. As explained in para. 3.27, INA later reorganized the operation
of its machinery and equipment. The machinery was mainly utilized by the
cooperatives that were the beneficiaries of the agrarian reform.



- 11 -
3.27      Machinery Workshop.  IDA agreed to the building of a new and
centralized workshop located in the field to repair INA's heavy machinery on
condition that INA (a) completely reorganize the management of its servicing
and repairing; and (b) all the machinery acquired under the project would be
in operation by September 1982. INA complied with r'.ese conditions, and the
workshop was constructed and finished by the end of 1983. It is located near
Sdn Pedro Sula and is fully operational. Currently, the British Government
is providing technical assistance to INA for the administration and
management of the workshop.
3.28      Training of Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries.  The training of
beneficiaries of INA's agrarian reform and the acquisition of audio-visual
equipment was carried out mainly in agrarian reform cooperatives. At
appraisal it had been planned that courses were to be organized for
cooperative leaders, that they would center on management themes, cost
accounting and finances, and that INA would give priority to second tier
cooperatives. Instead, massive courses were given without clear goals. In
general, courses were of poor quality, and without follow-up.
Honduran Banana Corporation (COHBANA)
3.29      The quality of the technical assistance provided by COHEBANA to
Isleta was satisfactory. However, the COHBANA/Isleta relationship was not
always cordial during the execution of the project and this relationship
broke down in April 1983. While Isleta received technical assistance from
COHBANA, the cooperative's field production was good. As was explained above
(para. 3.14), subloans to Isleta were not granted under the project. Project
funds were spent to finance (a) consultant salaries; (b) training of
COHBANA's technical staff; (c) training of Isleta's members; and
(d) acquisition of vehicles and office furniture and equipment.
Panamerican Agricultural School (EAP)
3.30      The technical assistance provided to EAP was valuable and well
executed because it was provided when most needed and EAP made good use of
the project funds. The project financed: (a) salaries for 15 teaching staff
specialized in different fields of the agricultural sciences, from 1978 to
1982; (b) acquisition of equipment for processing of agricultural products;
and (c) construction of a new animal science building. The faculty financed
under the project were subsequently incorporated to the permanent pay roll of
EAP.
The Central Bank's Project Unit (UPCA)
3.31      From 1978 to 1981, UPCA's staff increased from 37 to 70 of which 10
were Agricultural Technicians, 34 Agronomists of the financial
intermediaries, 6 Consultants, 5 Managers (UPCA's Director and 4 Regional
Chiefs) and the remaining (15) administrative and support staff.  UPCA's new
staff and the acquisition of vehicles and equipment with proceeds of the
project had a positive impact, increasing the volume of credit operations.
3.32      Under Credit 434-HO, an agreement between the Central Bank and the
Tropical Agriculture Research and Training Center (CATIE) provided for
technical assistance to UPCA. A second stage of the agreement, covering



- 12 -
March 1979 to March 1981, was financed under this project. According to
CATIE's final report, the following activities were completed:
(a) preparation of a report on a socio-economic and productive diagnostic of
62 cattle farms of the South Littoral (Choluteca and Valle), and 30 cattle
farms in the North-East (Olanchito); (b) technical assistance and training on
a Eotal of 139 farms, with a total area of 18,000 ha and 27,000 head of
cattle (these figures included farms assisted during the first stage of the
agreement and were financed under Credit 434-HO; (c) training of four local
counterpart technical staff, 119 technicians from the participating financial
intermediaries and institutions of the agricultural sector, and 105
independent cattle farmers; (d) the publication of 30 cattle bulletins, 13
press articles and 14 technical publications. Progress was satisfactory in
the assisted farms, a great deal of new technology was incorporated, improved
pastures were utilized and cattle management improved. Finally, the most
important result was that an efficient methodology of transfer of technology
was developed at field level, which was utilized later on as a reference
framework for an operational agreement between UPCA and the Ministry of
Natural Resources.
B. Disbursements
3.33      Total disbursements amounted to US$14.0 million.  The rate of loan
disbursements indicates that up to the end of FY79, or after two years of
implementation, total disbursements were US$6.0 million, or 59% of the
appraisal estimate. However, five more fiscal years were needed to disburse
the remaining funds. The causes of the slow pace of project disbursements
can be placed in two main categories: (a) the intended subloan to Isleta of
US$0.8 million that did not materialize (para. 3.14); and (b) problems
related to implementation of the technical services component (para. 3.17).
C. Procurement
3.34      Procurement carried out by UPCA was satisfactory.  Procurement
carried out by the other institutions for the technical services component
took more time than anticipated (para. 3.17). At appraisal it was envisaged
that the farm development sublending program would: (a) be widely
distributed geographically; and (b) finance a wide variety of farm plans,
thus capital items would be purchased from local agents who adequately
represent suppliers. Whenever possible bid packages for such items would be
grouped for not less than the equivalent of USS35,000. The various inputs
utilized in the credit and technical assistance components were purchased
through existing market channels in Honduras. For the purchase of machinery,
equipment and vehicles under the category of technical services, estimated to
cost the equivalent of US$75,000 or more, LCB or ICB were carried out in
accordance with IDA regulations.
D. Reporting and Auditing
3.35      Project reporting and auditing were generally satisfactory.  In
1979 UPCA organized a section specializing in monitoring and evaluation,
which greatly improved the evaluation of credit and related activities. UPCA
is in the process of acquiring its own computer (which will be connected to
the Cer,tral Bank's unit) to store the field data collected. So far, its
monitoring and evaluation section consists of five specialized staff at the



- 13 -
regional level and a coordinator at headquarters. This section monitors
sub-borrower's physical and financial performance after loan disbursements
and prepares the UPCA's quarterly and annual reports on implementation
progress and has also been responsible for the successful preparation of the
project completion reports for this project and Credit 434-HO.
3.36      The Central Bank maintained the project account and the
participating financial intermediaries each maintained separate project
accounts. Auditing matters improved consistently over those of previous
projects as a result of Bank collaboration with the auditor of the
Superintendencia Bancaria. Other auditing achievements were as follows:
(a) All participating banks' audited financial statements used
forms recommended by the Bank which were designed to allow
comparability among participating banks through the use of the
same classifications of assets, liabilities and income and
expenditures categories that were included in their
audited financial statements;
(b) The financial statements included valuable audited data on
loan recovery by relating the amount collected each year to
the total value of the arrears at the beginning of the year
plus the amount that fell due during the year;
(c) All audited financial statements were submitted to the Bank by
April 30, four months after the end of the fiscal year, au
stipulated in the Loan Agreement; and
(d) The auditor, through a continuous dialogue with the Bank and
training to the staff of financial intermediaries improved
audit performance significantly.
E. Compliance With Covenants
3.37      Compliance with covenants was generally satisfactory.
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
4.01      The rates of return were obtained from a sample of independent
farms that were evaluated in 1982; however, no estimates have been made for
the project as a whole. The analysis gives a general idea of project
profitability, exclusively under the credit component. It was not feasible
to quantify specific benefits for the technical assistance component. The
results show that it is possible to reach acceptable levels of profitability
with the type of on-farm investments financed under the project.
4.02      The financial rate of return for the typical dual-purpose farm in
the North zone has been estimated at 28%, and for the Central zone at 24%.
The estimated economic rates of return for the same North zone and Central
zone dual-purpose farms were 26% and 24%, respectively, as compared with the
appraisal estimate of 35%.



- 14 -
4.03      The financial rate of return of a typical sugarcane farm of the
South has been estimated to be about 23%, and the economic rate of return to
be about 50%. The discrepancy between the two rates is mainly due to
differences in output (sugarcane) prices used in the financial and economic
analyses. For the latter, export parity prices were used, and early in the
benefit stream those prices were much higher than the actual dverage price
received by project farmers (Annex 2). Although sugarcane production was not
anticipated at the time of the appraisal, the evaluation shows that a
considerable increase in production was achieved.
4.04      As regards the degree of increased farm employment opportunities,
UPCA estimates that the project may have generated about 600 additional jobs
for permanent laborers and about 3,000 additional jobs for temporary laborers
in the cattle dual-purpose and sugarcane farms only.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
5.01      According to project design, UPCA was to be responsible for
coordinating the execution of the credit component. MRN, INA, COHBANA, and
EAP, on the other hand, were to be responsible for executing the non-credit
components. UPCA was also to be responsible for monitoring and evaluation of
the entire project, and was to assist the other implementing agencies to the
extent feasible to ensure achievement of project goals. The organization of
the project was to be rounded out by the continued operation of the Project
Commission, which had been established in connection with the implementation
of the first livestock project. The Commission was to be composed of
representatives from all the implementing agencies, participating financial
intermediaries, the National Cattlemen's Association and farmers'
organizations, with the representative of the Central Bank as its Chairman
and the UPCA's Director as its Executive Secretary. It was to have ultimate
responsibility for coordinating project implementation and setting project
policies. Thus, in theory, if problems developed in the implementation of
any of the non-credit components, UPCA's Director would bring the
difficulties to the attention of the Project Commission, where a full
discussion would take place. The resulting recommended actions would be
co-mminicated to the management of the project executing agencies concerned
for their follow-up.
5.02      Although theoretically correct, the above organizational
arrangements did not function well in practice. Numerous problems arose in
the implementation of the non-credit components (para. 3.17); nevertheless,
the Project Commission was of very limited usefulness in assisting in their
resolution. The Commission met infrequently, and representation of the
executing agencies (except for the Central Bank) was usually vested in
relatively low-ranking staff, which greatly complicated the task of arriving
at practical solutions acceptable to the senior managers of the agencies
concerned.  These difficulties were compounded by frequent rotation of those
managers and the general administrative weakness of the agencies charged with
implementing the non-credit components.



- 15 -
Personnel and Training
5.03      At the beginning of 1977, UPCA already had three regional offices
(Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba). By late 1977, the fourth
regional office (at Choluteca) was added, and a staff of 37 was in place, 20
of whom were assigned by the participating financial intermediaries. AL the
end of 1981, the staff had grown to 70, 34 of whom were technicians of the
financial intermediaries. These technicians develop investment plans for
subloans to be granted by their respective financial intermediaries, and were
trained in service at UPCA.
5.04      Training of technical personnel was a continuing activity within
UPCA over the period 1977-83. Priority was given for those courses, whether
national or international, which offered the training prospects most likely
to benefit the unit directly. Twenty-two courses with a total of 68
participants were carried out from 1977 to 1980.
Financial Intermediaries
5.05      The project was very successful in attracting private banks, in
addition to BANADESA, to participate in project implementation. Eventually
all of the ten banks in Honduras took part in implementing the project. This
wide participation was obtained, most likely, because lending interest rates,
spreads and rediscounting margins were well adjusted to address both project
and financial intermediaries' needs. The performance of the financial
intermediaries was satisfactory, except with regard to Loan recovery. The
1979 and 1980 weighted average recovery rate for principal was 73Z, but it
deteriorated to about 61% for 1983. As a condition of effectiveness of the
Third Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2284-HO) BANADESA prepared a plan to
improve the combined Loan recovery rate for all of its subloans rediscounted
under Bank-financed projects. In the last two years, however, the combined
rate of Loan recovery in BANADESA's Bank-financed operations, has remained
approximately constant at about 60% as indicated in Annex 3.
VI. ROLE OF TRE BANK
6.01      The role played by IDA throughout the execution of this project
appears to have been satisfactory. Relations among IDA, Government and UPCA
personnel -were cordial at all times, and the Bank acted supportively and
flexibly in solving operational problems as they arose. The appraisal was
ambitious in project scope as regards the technical services component which
involved four institutions with many problems (paras. 3.16 and 5.01). This
made the implementation period longer than anticipated.
VII. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONS
Lessons Learned
7.01      The changes introduced in this project toward assistiig the
beneficiaries of the agrarian reform are, to a great extent, inlications of
the lessons learned throughout the implementation of the two previous
projects (para. 2.05).



- 16 -
7.02      As in many countries, multiple-component projects requiring
implementation by several Government agencies are difficult to coordinate in
Honduras (paras. 5.01 and 5.02). Thus, it would appear that a project having
credit as its core activity should include non-credit components orly to the
extent that they are essential to achieve the objectives pursued through the
provision of credit. Moreover, to the extent possible, these components
should be implemented by the agency coordinating the credit component
itself. Although this lesson was not taken into account in the follow-up
project fLoan 1833/Credit 1005-HO), it was incorporated in the design of the
subsequent project (Loan 2284-H0).
Conclusions
7.03      The main objectives of the project were generally met.  The
financial and economic impact of the credit component was satisfactory and a
considerable increment in production was achieved. With regard to the
Board's concern (para. 2.02), the project contributed, to some extent, to:
(a) including small-scale farmers; and (b) ensuring the participation of the
agrarian reform beneficiaries in crop production activities.
7.04      As regards the degree of institution building, every entity
involved in the project performed satisfactorily, except INA, which took too
long to spend its committed project funds. However, general objectives were
met. The Project Unit, again, in the persons of the Director and his staff,
gave proof of commendable technical capacity and ability in the management of
credit proceeds. In fact, the overall success of this Agricultural Credit
Project resulted in the approval, in 1980 and 1983, of two new credit
projects.
7.05      One major achievement was also the decisive participation by the
private banking system in the channeling of subloan funds to the direct
beneficiaries of the project.
7.06      Through consistent effort, UPCA, the ten participating financial
intermediaries and the auditor, with Bank assistance, have improved
significantly the auditing and accounting standards and obtained an accurate
method of measuring the arrears situation. Honduras has suffered from a
shortage of skilled auditors and the participation of ten financial
intermediaries also has added to the difficulties that were associated with
achieving the upgrading of the accounting system. However, close supervision
of these matters, as well as technical assistance provided by IDA, have
proved to be very helpful in shaping up accounting and auditing standards,
procedures and presentation.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
The Dual-Purpose Farm
1.        The evaluation of project investments in dual-purpose farms was
carried out by means of a random sample of participating farms undertaken
three years after the initial investments. The analysis and evaluation of
dual-purpose farms were geared primarily towards identifying two different
representative dual-purpose farms (dairy/beef), one in the Atlantic Zone to
serve as a model for such farms financed in the northeastern and northwestern
zones, and another in the Central Zone to serve as a model dual-purpose farm
for the rest of the country. Table 1 shows figures of various indicators of
the farm model constructed at appraisal compared with figures of the north
and central zone farm models at the time of the evaluation.
Production Capacity
2.        The average size of the dual-purpose farm financed is much larger
than anticipated at appraisal, and the survey showed that farm size in the
Central Zone is larger than that in the North. This can be attributed to
different topographic and land tenure conditions of each zone. Furthermore,
there are specific inter-regional differences regarding climate and soil
types. The percentage of increase in improved pasture development and herd
size was less than had been anticipated at appraisal. The pasture/total area
and improved pastures/total area ratios are 0.79 and D.70, respectively, for
a typical farm of the North, and 0.81 and 0.78 for a typical farm of the
Central Zoue. The assumptions at appraisal anticipated that the whole area
would be covered by improved pastures.
Coefficients of Productivity
3.        In comparing the dual-purpose farms, it was found that the
coefficients of productivity of the typical North Zone farm were better than
the Central Zone farm. This seems to be explained by better weather
conditions and soils, since, in the North Zone, there is more grazing land
available and more evenly distributed rainfall. However, progress with
regard to birth rates and the milk production coefficients during the
three-year period under consideration was better in the typical Central Zone
farm than in the typical North Zone farm. Compared with appraisal estimates,
both farms were far short from the targeted increase in the birth rate, and
it is not expected that this target will be achieved at full development
(five to six years after the initial investments). Regarding the milk
production coefficient, on the other hand, the measured results exceeded
appraisal expectations.

Income-generating Capacity
4.        Comparing income-generating capacity before project implementation
with that at the time of the field survey, the relative increases at the time
of the field survey fluctuated between 45Z and 70X for gross income and
between 35% and 80% for net income. It is estimated that at full development
these variables could reach the levels projected at appraisal. As in the
two previous livestock projects, dual-purpose farming was the preferred
system of livestock operation in Honduras, because of the type and quality of
their animals, and because farmers perceive such a system as a means of
assuring a regular income from the sale of milk.
Incremental Production
5.        As a group, the 178 dual-purpose farms financed under the project
will probably produce annually an additional 1,170 m ton of meat and
7,545 m ton of milk at full development, as may be seen from the following
figures:

HONDURAS
AGRICULTlJRAL CREDIT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Financial and Economic Analysis of Sugarcane Investments
1.        The present Annex summarizes the assumptions adopted in the
financial and economic analysis of the project's sugarcane investment model,
which was constructed for Project Completion report purposes (no sugarcane
model had been included in the SAR).
Economic Analysis
2.        Since Honduras is a net exporter of sugar, and since the project's
annual sugar incremental production (about 18,000 t/year) did not exceed
exports in any of the years in which sugarcane investments, undertaken lnder
the project, contributed to total sugarcane productionl/, farmgate-level
export parity prices were used to calculate the economic value of sugarcane
production for the calculation of the model's economic rate of return (ERR)
3.        The bulk (about 90%) of the sugarcane hectares financed under the
project was planted in 1978 and 1979. Sugarc-.ne planted in 1978 generated
its output in the five-year period 1979-83, while 1979 plantings did so in
the 1980-84 period. For the years, 1979, 1980 and 1981, all Honduran sugar
exports were to the United States. Hence, U.S. (Honduras FOB) prices were
used to compute the project's farmgate sugarcane export parity prices for
those years. Starting in 1982, however, total exports exceeded exports
to the U.S. by amounts larger than the project's annual incremental
production. Hence, for 1982, 1983 and 1984, free-market (non-preferential)
Honduras FOB prices were used to compute the project's farmgate sugarcane
export parity prices. Such prices fluctuated markedly during the period of
analysis--from a high of about 58 L/t in 1981, to a low of about 5 L/t in
1984.
4.        On the cost side, average conversion factors of 0.91 for operating
expenses, and of 0.98 for investment expenses, were used in order to express
the model's costs in terms of border prices. Based on experience before the
project, it was also assumed that the best alternative use of the land was
the production of cotton, implying an opportunity cost of the land of about
L 300/ha/year (or L 4,500/farm/year). Cane yields were assumed to reach a
maximum of 80 t/ha in the fourth year after planting. The technical
conversion factor sugar/sugarcane was assumed to be about 8%.
5.        The resulting estimated ERR is high (50%) mainly because the timing
of the investments (para. 3 above) was appropriate. At present and
anticipated (in the next few years) prices for Honduras's sugar exports at
the margin, sugarcane investments would not be economically viable.
1/ The sugarcane investment cycle in Honduras is five years (i.e., new
plantings have been carried out every five years).

Page 2 of 2
Financial Analysis
6.        The model's estimated financial rate of return (23%) is lower than
the estimated ERR mainly because of differences in output prices used in the
financial and economic analysis. Output prices used in the financial
analysis were the actual average sugarcane prices received by the project's
beneficiaries who planted sugarcane. For 1980, this price was very close to
the estimated farmgate export parity price (para. 3 above). However, as the
latter more than doubled in 1981, following a large increase in U.S. import
prices, the price received by project farmers remained approximately
constant. A similar situation prevailed when sugarcane export parity prices
declined sharply, starting in 1982. As world sugar prices declined from
their high 1980-81 levels, Honduran farmers producing sugarcane were
cushioned- by Government-imposed restrictions in sugar imports.

2.        As shown above, BANADESA was the most active financial
intermediary, in number and amount of subloans, and it concentrated on the
granting of small subloans. This behavior followed the tendency of BANADESA
in the previous project, as well as in the two subsequent credit projects.ln
order of importance, Banco Sogerin, Banco Continental, Banco del Comercio,
Banco de Occidente, and Banco Atlantida played significant roles in the
implementation of the Agricultural Credit Project.
3.        In percentage terms, the number of applications examined (650) and
for which studies were then approved represented 92% of the total submitted
(707), while 842 of all studies approved by the Project Unit led to formal
financial agreements. However, inadequate mortgage collateral and problems
of land tenure continued to be the major reasons why applications with
approved studies were rejected.

ANNEX 3

4.        The financial statements of participating banks have included
information on arrears since 1979. The commercial risk was borne solely by
the participating financial intermediaries. The 1979 and 1980 weighted
average recovery rate for principal as of the end of December was 73Z, but it
deteriorated to about 61% for 1983.1/ BANADESA, the National Development
Bank, obtained a slightly lower rate of recovery when compared with
commercial banks during this period. The worsening of the rate of recovery
in recent years is very likely the result of the economic difficulties the
country was facing. The rate of recovery among the participating banks
ranged from 35% to 100% reflecting, presumably, a large variety of attitudes
towards supervision, checking on investment plans and collection efforts
among the participating banks.
5.        As a condition of effectiveness of the Third Agriculture Cred.t
Project (Loan 2284-HO), BANADESA prepared a plan to improve the combined Loan
recovery rate for all of its subloans rediscounted under Bank-financed
Projects. As another condition of effectiveness, BANADESA established a
Coordination Unit for operations financed by the Bank, and redefined the
terms of reference of loan officers; these efforts are expected to assist in
carrying out the Loan recovery plan. BANADESA's management has also recently
introduced new guidelines to stress the importance of Loan recovery. In
spite of these efforts, however, the combined rate of Loan recovery in
BANADESA's Bank-financed operations, measured on an annual basis, has
remained approximately constant at about 60% for the last two years.
6.        Recent supervision missions have stressed the importance of Loan
recovery in discussions with UPCA staff, who in the past had assumed that
subloan collection was the exclusive responsibility of the participating
banks. This attitude has now changed, and the analysis of Loan recovery
trends and patterns has become an integral part of UPCA's staff annual work
plan.
1/ These figures represent the lower limit of recoveries, since principal and
interest payments fall due at the end of June and December. If recovery
rates were measured in between these months, they would be higher than
indicated by these figures.

Mr. Yukinori Watanabe
Director, Operations Evaluation Department
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
REF: Project Completion Report CR-628-HO (Preliminary Version)
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
The reason for our delay in replying to your letter of April 23 was
that the preliminary version of your Project Completion Report CR-628-HO was
sent to us in incomplete form, and we took more time while awaiting the
information needed for our analysis. We are very sorry for the delay.
We have found noteworthy differences between the project results
indicated in our report of August 13, 1984 and the results shown in the
preliminary version that you recently sent us. In particular, we refer to:
number of farms financed, average amount per subloan by activity financed,
average investment cost per activity financed, and total project costs by
source of financing. For further information please compare Tables 6 and 7 of
our report with Tables 2.1 and 3.1 of the report prepared by the World Bank
Projects Department.
It is true that the estimate of the original project cost made no
provision for any transfer of Central Bank funds within the credit component.
Nonetheless, the participacion of this institution was decisive in 1979 and
1980 when IDA funds were not available, since the subloan had not yet been
reassigned to Instetu nor had the Second Agricultural Credit Project come into
effect.
Similarly, the cost of technical services was increased appreciably
by the participation of otheg sector institutions (including the Central
Bank), as noted in our report. Because these costs are implicit in the
execution of that component, we believe that they should be included.

Project Completion Report
CR-628-HO (Preliminary Version)
There is no doubt that the Bank's report was limited to describing
the results achieved under agreements for the exclusive utilization of IDA
funds primarily for implementation of the credit component of the project. It
is our understanding that in the absence of external funds and with a constant
demand for credit, any utilization of domestic funds following the same
rediscount procedures and loan conditions as those stipulated for the project
concerned should be considered as costs chargeable to that project.
We feel that the exclusion of this additional contribution of
domestic funds for the execution of the First Agricultural Credit Project
(CR-628-HO) was bound to cause an understatement of the actual results
obtained. We believe that attention should be called to the additional effort
the borrowing country has made in its contribution to agricultural development
through the reference project.
Hoping that you will take the foregoing into consideration, I remain
Sincerely yours,
isi Mario Nufio Gamero
Director
Comment on Letter by Projects Deparment
Latin America and the Caribbean Region
As mentioned in Mr. Nufio Gamero's letter, the Project Completion
Report has necessarily been confined to achievements and actions taken under credit
628-Ho. Mr. Nufio Gamero correctly points out that when looked at in the wider
context of what has been achieved through additional Government inputs over and
above those included in the project, that the impact has been even greater. This
is important to note, although such an analysis was beyond the scope of the PCR.
