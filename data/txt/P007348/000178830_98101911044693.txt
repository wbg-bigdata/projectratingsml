HONDURAS
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSJIONS
i.        Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America and
heavily dependent on agriculture to sustain its economy. The population
is largely rural and engaged in low-productivity, traditional agriculture.
Poverty, unemployment and illiteracy are fundamental problems which have re-
sulted in recent years in rural unrest in the forms of illegal land invasions
and pressure on the Government to implement its agrarian reform program.
While GDP per capita is about US$340, distribution is highly skewed, with 60%
of the rural population receiving annual incomes of less than US$100. Since
1969, the economy has been in a state of recession, with agriculture growing
slowly. Relative improvements during the 1969-75 period in banana, coffee,
forestry and beef production were offset by unstable world prices for export-
able products and then virtually nullified by natural disasters and world
inflation. To reactivate growth of the sector and redress problems of skewed
income, land distribution and unemployment, the Government has embarked on an
active program of agrarian reform and institution building to carry it out.
The program aims to increase the volume of agricultural credit to agriculture
in general and land reform beneficiaries in particular, improve extension
services, marketing facilities and develop rural infrastructure and social
services.
ii.       The proposed project would assist the Government to achieve some
of its objectives by financing the provision of medium- and long-term credit
for the development of livestock, annual and perennial crop production, small-
scale agro-industries, contractors' machinery for farm development and the de-
velopment of institutions to improve technical, research and training services.
The institutional and technical services aspect is important enough to involve
about 30% of the total costs of the proposed project and would include the
recruitment of specialists in all aspects of banana production; rice and oil
crops research; seed production and certification, formation of campesino
groups and their basic training; short-course instructors in agricultural
production, agro-industries and farm management; and financing of consulting
firms to conduct studies leading to further agrarian reform settlement and
integrated rural development. The proposed project is in accordance with
Government long-term plans for agricultural growth and income distribution.
Apart from the financing by IDA of 70% (US$14 million) of the total project
costs (US$20 million), the participating banks would finance US$3 million
(15%); the Central bank, US$1 million (5%); and the sub-borrowers, US$2 mil-
lion (10%) of the total.
iii.      The project would be administered by the Central Bank (CB) through
a Project Credit Unit (PCU) acting under the overall policy guidance of a
Project Commission (PC) representing the main participating institutions and
farmer beneficiaries. Farm credit operations would be handled by participating
banks through Project Administration Agreements with CB, which would stipulate



- ii -
lending and rediscount terms and other operational norms. All subloans would
be made on the basis of sound farm plans previously approved by the staff of
the PCU. For non-lending (grant) components of the project such as for the
provision of technical services, equipment for institutions, and studies, all
proposals, including contracts, would be approved by the PC and submitted
through the CB for IDA approval.
iv.       Previous agricultural projects financed by IDA were for livestock
development only. Credit 197-HO for US$2.6 million became effective in
January 1970 and was successfully completed in January 1975 about one year
ahead of the closing date. IDA Credit 434-HO for US$6.6 million continued
the development of the livestock industry, which commenced under the First
Project. As of March 31, 1976, about 61% of the proceeds of the credit had
been committed due to a slowdown in demand brought about by uncertainties over
the implications of agrarian reform and land invasions. In order to meet an
emergency situation that had developed in the banana producing sub-sector, the
Government requested a reallocation of US$1 million out of the uncommitted
proceeds to finance the rehabilitation of 2,000 ha of hurricane-damaged banana
lands now settled by agrarian reform beneficiaries as an Associative Company
called Isleta. This was approved by IDA on March 10, 1976. Once this subloan
is effective commitments would amount to 75%. Apart from the slowdown in
demand, performance under Credit 434-HO has been satisfactory and full commit-
ment is now expected by the end of September 1976. Organization and manage-
ment of both projects through the CB and PCU has been good and it is therefore
proposed to maintain the structure, with appropriate strengthening for this
project. The proposed project will ultimately benefit from and be complemented
by the First Education Project of January 1974 for US$6.0 million of which
US$1.5 was allocated for agricultural education.
v.        Interest rates to sub-borrowers would be 11% per annum and lending
terms would vary from 7 to 12 years, including 2 to 5 years of grace. Inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) for on-farm investment items, machinery
contractors and for the small-scale agro-industries would not be feasible.
However, ICB would be appropriate for the purchase of vehicles, machinery
and equipment to be financed under the project for CB, the Ministry of
National Resources, the National Agrarian Institute and the Pan American
Agricultural School.
vi.       The proposed project would make a significant contribution to agri-
cultural production, small farmer incomes, and employment. Direct bene-
ficiaries would be about 2,900 adults representing about 17,000 people.
Off-farm activities in agro-industry and support services would directly
employ an additional 100 adult persons representing 600 people. There would
be considerable, but unquantifiable, benefits in professional employment,
future agrarian reform land settlement and institutional strengthening. The
project would help relieve the considerable social tensions that exist in
Honduras. At full development, there would be an annual incremental produc-
tion of about 83,000 m tons of bananas, 7,000 m tons of paddy rice, 700 m tons
of beef and almost 8,000 m tons of milk, all of which would find ready export
or domestic markets.



- iii -
vii.      Estimated internal financial returns range from 15% to 27% and the
overall economic rate of return is estimated to be 41%.
viii.     During negotiations, appropriate assurances were obtained that
provide a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$14 million for 50 years,
including 10 years of grace. The borrower would be the Republic of Honduras
and the Government would assume the foreign exchange risk.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Honduras has requested an IDA Credit of US$14
million to help finance a continuation of its livestock development program,
initiated under the First and Second Livestock Development Projects, as well
as to strengthen annual and perennial crop production, develop small agro-
industrial enterprises and farm development contractor services, and improve
technical services to land reform beneficiaries.
1.02      Bank Group lending to the agricultural production sector so far has
been for livestock development only. The First Livestock Development Project
(Credit) 179-HO) for US$2.6 million became effective in October 1970 and was
completed in January 1975, while the Second Livestock Development Project
(Credit 434-HO) for US$6.6 million became effective in January 1974, and as of
March 31, 1976, was 61% committed.  Full commitment is now expected by the
end of September 1976. Performance under these projects has been generally
satisfactory.
1.03      The proposed Agricultural Credit Project (Project) was prepared by
the Project Credit Unit of the Central Bank (CB) which coordinated the work of
technicians of the CB, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN), the National
Agrarian Institute (INA), the National Development Bank (NDB) and the National
Planning Council (CONSUPLAN). Assistance was also provided by the Bank.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Honduras, with an area of about 115,000 km2 (see Map IBRD 11910),
has a population of about 2.9 million (July 1975) growing at the high annual
rate of about 3.0%. Although there is an overall population-to-land ratio of
only 24 persons per sq km, there is a marked concentration in the western half
of the country. The present land resource base is narrow due to a lack of
road communications and other infrastructure, especially in the eastern part
of the country. Unemployment is about 10% overall an adult illiteracy about
50%. Per capita income was about US$340 in 1975. Income distribution is
highly skewed, and it is estimated that about 60% of the rural population have
annual incomes of less than US$100. For the 1971-72 period, about 45% of
families in Honduras, mainly engaged in agricultural activities, received only
8.8% of the total incomes, with an annual average per capita of only about
US$60, including the imputed value of farm produce consumed on the farm.



- 2 -
2.02      The economy of Honduras is heavily dependent on the export of
agricultural products, especially bananas. Diversification of production
has been only modest, and processing of primary commodities is limited.
Known mineral deposits are on a small scale, but timber resources, includ-
ing extensive natural pine forests, offer room for development and there
is also considerable potential for agricultural settlement and develop-
ment in areas not now served by basic infrastructure.
2.03      Since 1969, growth of the agricultural sector has been slow.  Some
of the main factors have been hurricane damage to banana plantations in 1969
and again in 1973 and 1974; droughts in 1972 and 1975; a war with El Salvador
in 1969; virtual withdrawal from the Central American Common Market in 1971
causing a slump in trade; restrictions in beef exports to the USA and reduced
world beef prices since 1973; and the sharp increase since 1973 of prices paid
for oil and other imported goods on which Honduras relies to maintain even a
basic modern economy. Foreign currency reserves are at a precarious level and
preliminary estimates indicate that the GDP for 1975 will result in a negative
growth of 3.5% per capita compared with 1974.
B. The Agricultural Sector
Performance
2.04      The agricultural sector contributed an average 37% of GDP forma-
tion in the period 1970-74. In 1974 it accounted for 36% of GDP and almost
80% of total exports (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2). Bananas are predominant.
Historically, production and exports have been dominated by two foreign
companies, one of whom (Standard Fruit) relinquished its holdings in the Aguan
Valley in 1975 following severe damage from Hurricane Fifi. Bananas occupy
about 0.3% of the land area, and of the total area of 38,000 ha, only 22,000
ha are plantations dedicated to production for export. In the period 1972-74,
bananas provided about 35% of total export earnings and about 44% of exports
of agricultural origin. However, production and exports of bananas fell by
about 200,000 m tons between 1973 and 1974. Exports for 1975 were estimated to
have dropped to about 480,000 m tons as compared with a 1970-72 average of
about 925,000 m tons, because of hurricane damage.
2.05      Following bananas, coffee, timber and meat contributed about 16%,
14% and over 7% respectively, to total exports over the 1972-74 period. All
other agricultural production, including sugar, cotton, grains and tobacco
together represented about 7% of exports. Importantly, beef exports rose
from about US$19 million in 1970 to a peak of about US$44 million in 1973
but declined to a little over US$33 million in 1974. Domestic milk pro-
duction increased from about 150 million liters in 1970 to an estimated
196 million liters in 1974, and imports of milk and milk products declined
commensurately, from 33 million liters to about 25 million liters



equivalent. There is good potential for even further expanding milk pro-
duction, thereby lessening the drain on foreign exchange resources, and
the same could be said for rice. To realize such increases however would
require substantial credit and technical inputs.
2.06      Growth and performance of the agricultural sector apart from bananas
have not been great, and the relative improvements which have taken place in
coffee, forestry and beef production have been offset by unstable world prices
for exportable products and virtually nullified by natural disasters and world
inflation. In order to reactivate growth of the sector and also to redress
problems of skewed income distribution, unemployment and lack of opportunities
for the rural population to better its lot, the current Government has, by
Decree No. 170 of December 30, 1974, actively initiated agrarian reform which
previously had existed in name only. The Government also aims to increase the
volume of agricultural credit, improve extension services to farmers and land
reform beneficiaries, improve marketing facilities and generally develop rural
infrastructure and social services for the rural population.
Land Distribution, Farm Size and Agrarian Reform
2.07      Census figures for 1965 (now being updated) indicate that there
are about 180,000 farmers occupying about 2.4 million ha, or a national
average of about 13.5 ha per farm (Annex 1, Table 6). Land is very un-
evenly distributed, with 68% of farms being below 7 ha (average 2.5 ha)
and occupying only 12% of total farm land. Farms over 350 ha number about
7,000 (about 0.4% of total farms) but occupy about 28% of the farmed land.
Many of the small crop farms are on marginal land or in marginal areas ill
served by roads, markets or other facilities, while, conversely, many of the
larger farms dedicated to livestock production are on land where intensive
cropping could be practiced. With the promulgation and active implementa-
tion of Agrarian Law No. 170, however, the census figures, whether those of
1965 or updated, will have less and less meaning as older forms of land owner-
ship, occupancy and use, whether through title, lease, squatting, invasion or
grant, are replaced by those envisaged under the Law. The system of land
titles is disorderly, with a variety of tenure superimposed on the Spanish
private (sitio) and public (ejido) land grant systems. Many titles are
insecure and unsuitable as credit guarantee and in most cases properties
are undervalued for minimization of tax payments.
2.08      Honduras had no effective policy of land tenure reform until Decree
No. 8 of December 1972 and Law 170 were promulgated. Previous to, and even
after, the passing of this legislation the rural climate was one of uneasy
association between private landholders, small farmers and landless rural
laborers, with widespread unrest, land seizure and outbreaks of violence.
This unrest was mainly due to low rural living standards, a rapidly growing
population and general land hunger, with great difficulties of access to land.
The role of the National Agrarian Institute (INA), in implementing Law 170, is
one of great importance, with the Chief of State presently acting as its
Director. Agrarian reform now is an integral part of development strategy,
and to fulfill its function, INA is strongly supported by USAID, FAO and IDB,



- 4 -
for the purposes of strengthening its institutional and operating capacity.
The general aim of INA is to develop group rather than individual farming,
eliminating excessively small farms and regrouping them into viable units,
but, at the same time, allowing efficiently run private, commercial size farms
to operate. The view held by INA is that land is a common national resource
which people must use and maintain in an efficient way. It is not to be a
base for privilege or used as a freely marketable commodity. Annex 1 contains
further details of Law 170, and Tables 9 and 10 provide data on progress
achieved and future plans for settlement. While the agrarian reform movement
in Honduras is now a serious attempt to implement distribution of land, INA
will require a great deal of outside technical and financial assistance to
meet its 1976-79 target of settling about 62,000 families on 310,360 ha of
land in new settlements, even though it has settled 29,580 familes on about
123,600 ha during the past few years, mainly under Decree No. 8.
Supporting Services
2.09      The departments in Government dealing with agriculture are not well
developed and still suffer from a lack of professional staff, poor long-range
planning and a shortage of funds. Salaries are poor, so that "moonlighting"
and a high turnover of staff are permanent features. Extension services to
farmers are provided by Desarrollo Rural (DESARRURAL), a semi-autonomous agency
with MRN. The agency is short of staff, and is primarily committed to attempt
to service the needs of small farmers and the reformed sector. It works in
close cooperation with NDB and INA and is thus one of the most overworked
public agencies. Agricultural research facilities are almost non-existent
and require considerable strengthening. Government services are complemented
by technical advice supplied by commercial suppliers (veterinary products,
fertilizers, pesticides) and by some credit institutions, notably NDB and CB.
The foreign banana companies conduct research but there is limited dissemina-
tion of their results. Introduction of new seeds varieties and work on crops
which could be introduced to Honduras is negligible.
C. Banking and Agricultural Credit
General
2.10      Honduras has a well developed banking system, consisting of a
national Central Bank (CB), a Government-sponsored and owned National Devel-
opment Bank (NDB) and 10 private commercial banks (Annex 2). The CB follows
conservative monetary policies and operates effectively, with the result
that no banks have failed even though NDB has sustained substantial losses.
The commercial banks are soundly run. Several are wholly or in part owned
by overseas interests. Bank loans are made predominantly from deposits,
since rediscounting facilities and foreign commercial lines of credit are
restricted by CB for reasons of inflation control. The great majority of
loans made by commercial banks and nearly half of those made by NDB are short



term. The banks pay 5% to 6% interest on time deposits and the interest rate
has recently been raised to 11% for agricultural, industrial, and export loans,
except for special projects such as the IDA-financed First and Second Livestock
Development Projects for which the interest rate is 9%. There is no long-term
money market in Honduras. The Government and international finance institu-
tions are practically the only sources of long-term loan funds, which are in
short supply. Responses to inflation are not generally through manipulation
of interest rates but rather through administrative measures such as modify-
ing legal reserve requirements, limiting rediscount facilities and taxing the
import of non-essential items.
2.11      Up to the end of 1973, most medium to large commercial farms ob-
tained credit from overseas or from private banks or used their own resources,
while smaller farmers were usually clients of the NDB. Agrarian Reform
beneficiaries--cooperatives and associative enterprises--are almost entirely
dependent on the NDB for both long- and short-term credit and they will re-
ceive priority treatment. The agrarian program has and will continue to place
great pressure on NDB and increase greatly the need of resources for financing
the sector. The private producing sector will also require greater financing
in order to develop its farm holdings of allowable size (Annex 1, Table 8) to
the levels of efficiency Law 170 requires and thus avoid the risk of expro-
priation. By policy definition, these producers will have recourse almost
exclusively to the private banks for farm development. Such is the current
uncertainty of private banks over guarantees, that they are reluctant to lend
for long-term investment for farm development except against guarantees other
than rural land. In the case of default of an existing client who has offered
land as a guarantee, the banks are also concerned that INA would be the only
purchaser and would pay in long-term, low-interest earning agrarian bonds,
which would effectively reduce their liquidity. Additionally, in the case of
farmers who have declared a low cadastral value for tax purposes (para 2.07),
which would be the price paid by INA, banks are also concerned that even the
nominal value of the bonds would not necessarily cover outstanding debts. The
CB and the association of private banks are working together to try to find a
solution to these and other problems. All banks would need to increase their
staff for analyzing credit applications and providing technical assistance so
that good farm plans can be carried out effectively. The increase in staff
would be marginal and related to the expansion of portfolios under the project
but this staff increase would constitute the best guarantee against risk by
screening out bad prospects.
2.12      The main channels of institutional lending are the NDB and the
commercial banks. At the end of 1974, total loans to the agricultural sector
amounted to about US$88 million, or about 31% of all lending. Total credit
volume increased by US$23 million between 1972 and 1974. During 1974, credit
to the agricultural sector continued to grow, increasing in lending volume
for cropping by 28.6% (US$9 million), as compared with the year before.
Livestock credits grew at a lesser rate but were nevertheless about US$4 mil-
lion greater than the volume for 1973. Many farmers take advantage of the



- 6 -
considerable, but unquantified volume of noninstitutional credit available to
them, usually from suppliers or money lenders, to avoid mortgaging land and
to keep from having to submit to the procedures generally adopted by banks for
the granting of credit.
The National Development Bank (NDB)
2.13      The NDB was established in 1950 as an autonomous Government agency
to finance a wide range of agricultural development schemes. In addition to
agricultural lending, the bank is also engaged in lending to commerce, in-
dustry and in a range of non-banking activities such as operating the Govern-
ment's grain marketing program and running a number of farm supply stores.
As of December 31, 1974, NDB loans to agriculture totalled about US$48 mil-
lion, which represents about 55% of all lending to agriculture in Honduras
(Annex 2, Table 1).
2.14      The NDB operated at a loss for the past six years, aggregate
losses between 1972 and 1974 being US$4 million. When the First Livestock
Development Project was appraised, it was decided that NDB should not parti-
cipate, largely because its administration was weak, its technicians over-
extended, and its debt collection poor. Since then, however, NDB's perform-
ance has improved and detailed studies by both USAID and IDB have commented
favorably on its revamped administration and supporting technical services.
IDB uses NDB as the lending agency for an agricultural loan of US$9 million
granted in 1972 of which US$6 million was to be devoted to livestock devel-
opment and which also provides for organization and management assistance
to NDB and imposes conditions of loan disbursement which require a financial
restructuring of the bank. At the end of December 1974, NDB had a total
portfolio of about US$57 million, of which US$13.2, or 23%, was in arrears.
Of this amount, 64% involved NDB's own funds and 34% those of USAID and
IDB loans. In addition to the overdue loans, others of about US$8 million
were refinanced which would bring the value of actual overdues to about
US$21.2 million, or 37% of total credit portfolio. This situation does
not indicate sound management and it is evident that NDB must clean up its
portfolio and replenish its capital to fulfill its role in agrarian reform.
Under a recently appointed new president (January 1976), the NDB is seeking
to improve its performance.
2.15      NDB was approved, in principle as a participating bank during nego-
tiations of the Second Livestock Project, subject only to the signing of a
standard Project Administration Agreement, approved by IDA and common to all
participating banks. Decree No. 152 of November 11, 1974 modified long-term
lending rules to allow NDB to participate. IDA did not undertake a specific
review of organization and operations other than that undertaken at appraisal.
After one year of project operations, NDB, as of December 31, 1975 had granted
15 sub-loans out of a total of 162 farm loans for a value of about US$350,000
or about 8% of the total lending volume. As a late starter, and being only
one out of eight participating banks, the NDB has performed reasonably well,
especially in recent months, during which loan processing has speeded up and
prospects for further improvement are good. Five qualified technicians have



been recruited for farm plan analysis, supervision and debt recovery.  T-L--der
the proposed project, NDB technical staff would be increased to about 15
qualified people, all of whom would be assisted by the PCU/CB. With this
increase in permanent staff and the support that would be provided by the
PCU, we would expect NDB to perform adequately for the purposes of the pro-
posed project. IDA efforts to improve performance of NDB through the project
would help to reinforce USAID and IDB technical assistance grants to Honduras
for the improvement of essential institutions, including IDB.
D. Performance Under Previous Agricultural Projects
First Livestock Development Project (197-HO)
2.16      IDA Credit 179-HO for US$2.6 million, which became effective in
October 1970, was fully committed by April 1973 and was totally disbursed
in January 1975, almost a year before the closing date of December 31, 1975.
Medium- and long-term loans were made to farmers to develop beef and dairying,
provide working capital for cattle fattening, and supply technical assistance.
Implementation and execution of the Project were satisfactory and Project
objectives were generally achieved (Annex 3).
Second Livestock Development Project (434-HO)
2.17      The Second Livestock Development Project (IDA Credit of US$6.6
million) continued development of the livestock industry, which commenced
under the First Project. This Project became effective in January 1974 and
was successfully initiated, but, principally due to uncertainties resulting
from the application of agrarian reform as well as a decline in market demand
for beef, it is now running behind schedule. At March 31, 1976, 173 farm sub-
loans had been made as compared with about 400 estimated at appraisal. At
that date, about US$4.0 million, or 61% of the credit had been committed, with
prospects of committing about 85% by June 30, 1976. About 40 sub-loan appli-
cations were under study at the end of March, three of which were from land
reform cooperatives. Commitments began to increase in late 1975 and early
1976, as by then, the law and most of the supporting decrees had been adopted,
and the guidelines for implementing the land reform program had been issued.
Also on March 10, 1976, IDA, at the request of the Government, approved the
use of US$1 million of the uncommitted balance of the Second Livestock Project
funds to finance the emergency rehabilitation of 2,000 ha of banana lands
damaged by Hurricane Fifi in September 1974 and now settled by agrarian reform
beneficiaries, organized into a campesinos associative enterprise known as
Isleta (paras 3.01 and 3.12).   With this reallocation, the contininuing
approval of sub-loans and the approval of a sub-loan to build a new abattoir
at Tegucigalpa, which is expected in May, there are now prospects of full com-
mitment by the end of September 1976.



- 8 -
2.18      A contract has been signed with an international research and train-
ing center (CATIE) to provide specialists to strengthen technical services to
Project beneficiaries. This contract is aimed at assisting livestock pro-
ducers to increase productivity and achieve standards set down by Agrarian
Reform Law 170 (Annex 1, para 17).
2.19      It is now apparent that sectoral priorities have been revised, to
emphasize agrarian reform, and while livestock production activities are
still important to diversify exports and for import substitution, development
of the sub-sector is not now so high a priority as was previously the case.
Additionally, if the institutions such as MRN and INA are to contribute more
to the success of future projects, they will need assistance to strengthen
their technical capacity (Annex 8 and paras 3.18 and 3.19). The proposed
Project has been diversified to include cropping activities and technical
services to remedy basic institutional deficiencies under previous projects
and to take into consideration the Government's new emphasis on agrarian
reform.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
3.01      The Project would help finance continuation of Honduras' livestock
development program and in addition would provide funds for investments in
annual and perennial crop production; development of small agro-industrial
enterprises; provision of farm development contractor services; and improve-
ment of technical services to land reform and other beneficiaries. It would
finance the recruitment of specialists to assist in strengthening applied
research and extension through the Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN), form-
ing small farmers' group or cooperatives through INA, and performing studies
for future agrarian reform projects by consulting firms acceptable to IDA.
Additional temporary staff and equipment for the Pan-American Agricultural
School (PAS) would be financed to provide training to beneficiaries, and
Honduran technicians at an advanced level. Another important aspect of the
Project would be the financing of the second stage of rehabilitation of the
2,000 ha of bananas devastated by Hurricane Fifi in 1974 and subsequently
abandoned by a foreign-owned company and transferred to INA for agrarian
reform settlement. Initial rehabilitation was financed with US$1 million from
the proceeds of the Second Livestock Project (para 2.17).
3.02      The objectives of the Project are primarily to:
(a) expand the area under food crops and livestock production to
provide more adequate nutrition for the rapidly increasing
domestic population;
(b) increase production from grazing lands;



-9-
(c) continue to improve the agricultural sector's contribution
to export earnings and import substitution;
(d) increase employment opportunities on farms and in industries
associated with the transformation of agricultural products;
(e) improve family incomes; and
(f) support selected institutions for further planning and
development of the sector and maintain the momentum of
agrarian reform.
3.03      Since the passage of Law 170, banks are reluctant to accept rural
land as collateral for long-term loans. In the case of default of an exist-
ing client who has offered land as a guarantee, the banks are concerned that
INA would be the only purchaser, and would pay in long-term, low-interest
earning agrarian bonds which would effectively reduce their liquidity. In
order to provide the guarantees necessary to protect PBs so that they will
participate in the project, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the Government will maintain the liquidity of PBs which acquire agrarian
reform bonds as a result of expropriation of a subborrower's land. Implemen-
tation of such a guarantee system is a condition of effectiveness. The proj-
ect would be administered and managed by the CB through its Project Credit
Unit (PCU) already established to execute the First and Second Livestock Proj-
ects. Sub-loans for farm production, agro-industries and contractors' equip-
ment would be approved by PCU on the basis of technically and financially
sound investment plans submitted to it by participating banks or other finan-
cial institutions working under its direction. A Project Commission (PC),
established under Decree No. 865 of December 18, 1969 would continue to hold
supervisory and policy-making authority for Project operations. The borrower
would be the Republic of Honduras.
3.04      The main components of the proposed lending program and technical
services would be as follows:

B. Detailed Project Features
3.05      The Project would be country-wide (Map IBRD 11910).  Cropping would
tend to be concentrated in the Atlantic (northern) zone of Honduras and in
the Pacific (southern) zone where there are possibilities of irrigation, while
livestock activities would generally be developed or shifted to the more mar-
ginal Central (mountainous) zone of the country except where they are asso-
ciated with cropping activities for utilizing by-products or for intensive
fattening or milk production operations to serve dense populated areas. Infra-
structural constraints such as lack of roads, housing, and schools would limit
the impact of the Project to those areas that are already reasonably serviced
with such facilities.
3.06      Among other things, the Project proposes to finance on-farm invest-
ment on about 215 beef/dairy farm units of about 40 ha; 40 beef fattening
units of about 50 ha; 20 individual banana farm units of about 40 ha; 20 irri-
gated rice farm units of about 50 ha each and also combinations of the above
and other crops, such corn and beans, based on actual demand and supported
by farm plan analysis, supervised by the Project Credit Unit (PCU) of the
Central Bank (CB). The number of units for different products represent the
best estimate of the likely distribution of credit; however, because the
agrarian reform has been so recently initiated, it is difficult to predict
the specific type or source of demand for farm credit that may develop. Under
these circumstances, the project has been designed to be flexible enough to
respond to demand for financing for different products and combinations of
products from both agrarian reform settlements and private farmers investing
to improve their incomes and also to comply with the efficiency requirements
of the agrarian reform law. It is expected that the addition of financing
for crops, which was not included in the earlier livestock credits will enable
this project to meet some of the needs of the expanding agrarian reform sector
for mixed livestock/crop development. The size of the units for each product
was selected for modeling purposes only; they are not intended to restrict
the size of the farm operations financed, which may range from a 50 ha or
larger private livestock or crop farm to agrarian reform settlements of any
size or multiples of units.
Livestock Farm Development
3.07      Dairy/Beef Farms (Annex 4, Tables 1 to 4).  Subloans would finance
about 215 farm units of an average size of about 40 ha each on which beef
and milk production are combined. To meet certain efficiency standards as
required under Law 170 (Annex 1), farm plans would concentrate on pasture
development (12% of sub-project cost), perimeter and internal fencing (15%),
stock watering facilities (10%), buildings and equipment (8%), and breeding
cattle purchase (55%). Average on-farm investments, including the purchase
of cattle, would be about US$17,000. The program for this development
activity would require the purchase of about 6,500 breeding females, which
are readily available. Up to about 400 families, or 2,400 people, would
be involved.



- 12 -
3.08      Beef Fattening Unit (Annex 4, Tables 5 to 7).  About 40 small,
specialized fattening operations of 50 ha each would receive subloans under
the Project. Fattening would be based on improved pasture for grazing;
permanent greed forage crops; supplements of minerals, urea and molasses;
and crop residues when available. The beef fattening operation would com-
plement farm cropping activities and would provide about 160 families with
additional employment. Long-term investments per farm would amount to about
US$7,000, of which 44% would be for improved pasture development, 16% for
fencing, 32% for cattle water supplies and about 8% for yards and spraying
equipment. All cattle for fattening would be purchased with working capital
supplied by participating banks. Average fattening period would be less
than one year and the availability of steers would not be a constraint.
Crop Farm Development
3.09      Banana Farms (Annex 5, Tables I to 3).  The project would include
about 20 units of 40 ha each, developed on already existing farm lands or
cooperatives in the Atlantic Zone. Average long-term investment costs would
be about US$48,000 per farm, with about 52% going for tractors, trailers and
irrigation equipment; 19% for land clearing, roads, bridges and canal con-
struction and rehabilitation; 15% for planting material and about 14% for
building and miscellaneous items such as tools. Each unit would support
about 10 families, comprising about 1,200 persons for the 20 farms.
3.10      Rice Farms (Annex 5, Tables 4 to 6).  About 20 irrigated rice farms
of 50 ha each would be developed. Since double cropping is necessary, mech-
anization would be required to ensure quality and timeliness of cultivation
and to overcome seasonal labor constraints. Average on-farm investment
would be about US$67,500 of which about 43% would be for tractors and culti-
vation, seeding, and irrigation equipment. About 45% would be invested in
design, land clearing and leveling, and in the provision of an appropriate
irrigation supply point. The remaining 12% of investment would be in basic
buildings for storage of rice, equipment, seed and fertilizers. In total
about 200 families would benefit.
3.11      Other Crop Farms.  Farms growing a wide variety of other crops,
both annual and perennial, and horticultural farms would also be eligible
for financing under the Project. Individual sub-projects would be subject
to feasibility studies approved by the PCU.
3.12      Isleta Banana Plantation (Annex 6, Tables 1 to 4).  Of the US$2.3
million cost of rehabilitating the 2,000 ha now being farmed and also to pro-
vide the necessary technical assistance, US$1.0 million is being made avail-
able from the Second Livestock Credit (434-HO) as approved by the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. The balance of US$1.3 million (US$0.7 million
for investment and US$0.6 million for technical assistance), would be financed
under this Credit. As in the case of the financing under the 434-HO, 100 per-
cent of the cost, net of local taxes, of irrigation system rehabilitation and
expansion, farm and transport equipment, a packing shed, other equipment and
facilities would be covered, as well as the balance of the technical assistance.
The undertaking requires the recruiLment by COHBANA, of specialists in banana
production management; irrigation rehabilitation, maintenance and water control;



- 13 -
and pest and disease control. COHBANA would supervise the subproject and
would submit, on behalf of Isleta, detailed work plans for each stage of
rehabilitation, including evidence of availability of labor, capital equip-
ment and supplies of planting material, fertilizers and pesticides to CB.
Initially, 684 families (or 4,000 individuals) would be involved and benefit
from the sub-project but the rehabilitation and operation of the entire 2,000
ha of the plantation would require more labor. The number of Isleta families
would therefore be increased to about 1,400, for an overall population of
about 8,400 persons.
Agro-industries
3.13      The Project would finance the construction of two rice mills (Annex
7, Tables 1 to 3), one in the Pacific zone (Choluteca/Valle) and the other
in the Atlantic zone (Cortes, Yoro, Atlantida) where most rice is grown. Each
mill, with a capacity of about 3,200 m tons, would cost about US$80,000, of
which about 50% would be in machinery, 30% in buildings/storage, 8% in vehicles
and the balance in miscellaneous items such as office equipment. Working capi-
tal would initially amount to about US$70,000 a year, including the purchase
of paddy rice, and would be provided by the participating banks. About 12
people would be employed at each of the two mills, representing an additional
24 jobs, and supporting about 145 family members. These enterprises would be
run either privately or on a cooperative basis.
3.14      The Project would finance other agro-industrial enterprises subject
to demand and appropriate feasibility studies which would include ecological
considerations. Many areas have an unrealized dairy production potential
because of poor infrastructure for marketing of fresh milk. This situation
could be remedied by the construction of relatively small processing plants
for the production of cheese and possibly butter. The total investment cost
of a plant with, say, a daily capacity of 5,000 liters would be about
US$140,000. Each plant would employ about eight adults and, while this is
not high, the plants would assist regional livestock development in areas
not suitable for more intensive agricultural activities.
3.15      Similarly, the Project could finance agro-industrial plants for the
processing of bacon, hams, sausages, broiler slaughter and packaging, and egg
packing plants. Feed mills of small capacity could also be financed in con-
junction with grain and livestock production, thus integrating on-farm with
off-farm activities and providing more employment as well as strengthening
the financial base of producer cooperatives. Capital investment per plant
would be about US$140,000 per operation.

3.16      The Project would provide credit to two contractors for the purchase
of one well drilling rig each, together with ancillary equipment, and to four
contractors for the purchase of heavy equipment for land clearing and develop-
ment to support Project on-farm activities. Drilling rigs, each costing about
US$220,000, would be self-contained mobile units, one for the Atlantic zone



- 14 -
and another for the Pacific. Sub-borrowers would be selected on the basis
of their previous experience in operating this type of equipment. Short-term
working capital would be provided by the participating banks. Each rig
would employ about five persons, supporting families totaling about 30 people.
Contractors purchasing heavy equipment could be either individuals or coop-
eratives. The units would consist of crawler type or heavy (75 hp and above)
tractors, blades, scoops, ploughs, trucks, welding equipment and spares,
amounting to about US$110,000 per unit. Short-term working capital would
be provided by PBs for the first year of operation. Each unit would employ
about four persons.
Technical Services, Training and Studies
3.17      The Project would continue to partially finance the PCU in CB,
the total cost of which during the five-year investment phase would amount
to about US$1.2 million (Annex 8, Table 1). About 75% of this would be for
salaries and wages, to be financed by CB. About 2% for vehicles and Project
equipment, and the balance for PCU overseas training and travel would be
financed by the Credit. Internationally recruited specialists to assist
the PCU in the execution of specific aspects of the Project such as monitoring
and evaluation would also be financed if such expertise were determined
necessary by CB in consultation with IDA.
3.18      To strengthen the activities and staffing of the MRN (Annex 8,
Table 2), the Project would finance the services for three years of five in-
ternationally recruited specialists--two in the fields of applied research in
rice and annual oil crops, two in production extension techniques and training,
and one in crop seeds production, certification and multiplication. The Proj-
ect would also finance a supplement to the local salaries of two counterparts
for each specialist. The Government has agreed during negotiations, to
gradually assume this supplement over five years as part of its normal budget
and thereafter maintain the salary levels. Total cost is estimated to be
about US$1.6 million, which includes vehicles, overseas training of local
counterparts, equipment and material for field work and on-farm training
activities and supplementary salaries. Additionally, the Project would
finance through COHBANA, the provision of technical specialists in banana
plantation management, production, disease and pest control, and irrigation
and flood control for the Isleta banana plantation (Annex 8, Table 3). Total
cost would be about US$770,000 over a five-year period, including salaries,
internal travel and the purchase of vehicles, of which about US$570,000 would
be financed under the Project. The Project would also provide US$600,000 to
finance qualified consulting firms to undertake regional studies leading to
future integrated rural development/settlement projects. The Government has
already identified 5 such priority areas (Annex 8, para 10). During nego-
tiations, the Government agreed that final selection of the areas, consul-
tants, together with terms of reference would be approved by IDA prior to the
awarding of contracts.



- 15 -
3.19      As USAID, FAO and IDB are deeply committed to the institutional
strengthening and provision of technical assistance to INA, the Project pro-
poses to strengthen INA especially in relation to Project activities
(Annex 8, Table 4). About US$1.9 million over five years would be provided.
This would finance visual aid teaching equipment--US$50,000; a central and
mobile repairshop for the Aguan Valley and other agrarian reform areas--
US$400,000; pick-ups for field workers and heavy equipment, including dump
trucks, excavators and crawler tractors for infrastructural and development
work involved in the extension of new settlements--US$1.2 million. Also,
US$250,000 would finance internationally recruited specialists in rural ad-
ministration, campesino training, business organization and project management.
3.20      The Project would provide about US$500,000 to strengthen the teach-
ing staff of the PAS at Zamorano (Annex 8, Table 5) over the five years of
implementation in entomology, soil science, production coordination on small
farms, food processing, tropical rural development, agri-business, animal
husbandry and agricultural economics. About US$310,000 would be used for
staff salaries at PAS normal rates; US$160,000 for equipment and expansion of
short-course facilities; and about US$30,000 for staff post-graduate training
in aspects directly related to the development of their training functions for
Project purposes. The average cost per man-year of all consultants to be
employed in connection with the Project is about US$30,000 for management and
technical assistance to the Isleta subproject and about US$50,000 to support
the applied research and extension project of MRN.
C. Cost Estimates
3.21      The total cost of the Project is estimated to be US$20 million, of
which about US$12 million, or 60% represents foreign exchange requirements.
Costs were estimated at end of year 1975 prices and include 5% of base costs
for physical contingencies in the lending program. Price contingencies for
machinery and equipment were applied on undisbursed balances for the years
1976 through 1980 on the basis of 9% in 1976, 8% in 1977-79 and 7% in 1980.
No significant civil works are involved. Cost estimates, based on calcula-
tions derived from the models and tables, are summarized as follows:

3.23      The Project would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$14 million, or
70% of total Project cost, which would cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost of about US$12 million, plus the equivalent of US$2 million in local costs.
Participating banks/financial institutions (PBs) would contribute US$3 million,
or 15% of Project cost; CB would directly finance US$1.0 million representing
5% of total cost; and the balance of US$2 million, or an overall average 10%
of Project cost, would be supplied by sub-borrowers. Livestock and crop
farmers, whether individuals or groups formed under the agrarian reform, would
contribute at least 10% of the cost of investment in their sub-projects, but
in the case of the rehabilitation of the Isleta settlement, the participants
would not be required to contribute to the capital development cost. Sub-
borrowers for well drilling equipment and heavy earth moving equipment would
finance 20% of the cost of purchase of such equipment and spares. Technical
services and studies would be largely (84%) financed by IDA and the CB would
contribute the other 16% for meeting some of the costs of the PCU. Assurances
that these cost sharing proposals would be followed were obtained during nego-
tiations, and also that PBs would provide short-term loans and working capital
to cover the needs of beneficiaries and that CB would provide PBs with redis-
count facilities for both long- and short-term loans as outlined in paragraphs
3.31 to 3.34. The borrower would be the Republic of Honduras, which would
bear the foreign exchange risk and would on-lend to CB at 2% for 18 years.
Project cash flows to CB and PBs are shown in Annexes 9 and 10.



- 18 -
E. Procurement
3.24      Bearing in mind that the farm development sublending program would
be spread over 3 years, for investment over 5 years, would be widely distri-
buted geographically, and would finance a wide variety of farm plans and
thus items to be procured, bulk purchasing would not be feasible. Capital
items would therefore be purchased from local agents who adequately repre-
sent suppliers. Competition is good and spare parts and service facilities
are sufficient. The same situation prevails in the case of the agro-
industries component of the Project. Sub-borrowers under the Project for
heavy machinery would also have their own preferences regarding standardiza-
tion and equipment, so that these purchases would also be made through commer-
cial suppliers which are adequately represented in Honduras.
3.25      For the equipment of Isleta and the equipping of INA for machinery
and equipment and the purchase of vehicles under the category of technical
services (Annex 8, Tables 1 to 4, and Annex 8, Tables 1 to 5), the CB would
issue instructions to bulk items for international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with IDA guidelines.
F. Disbursement
3.26      Project funds would be disbursed over a period of five years as
follows:
(a)  70% of amounts disbursed for sub-loans related to livestock
and crop farms and agro-industries;
(b)  100% of amounts disbursed for rehabilitation and investment
sub-loans for Isleta;
(c)  100% of the cost of training and technical services; and
(d)  100% of the foreign cost of directly imported equipment for
INA, PCU and MRN or 85% of their local cost representing the
estimated foreign exchange component.
(e)  95% of incremental salaries of MNR counterpart personnel during
the first two years and 66% and 33% respectively in the third
and fourth years of project implementation.
Documentation supporting disbursements against sub-loans would not be submitted
to IDA, but would be retained by CB for periodic inspection by IDA during the
course of Project supervision missions. Disbursements of amounts for sub-
loans for Isleta would not commence until (a) COHBANA has recruited technical
experts in banana plantation management including marketing, banana production;



- 19 -
irrigation and pest and disease control; and (b) marketing agreements satis-
factory to the Bank be concluded with a fruit exporter for the sale of ac-
ceptable inspected fruit. Estimated disbursements details are shown in
Annex 11. Any surplus funds under the Credit would be cancelled.
G. Organization and Management
Administration
3.27      The CB would administer the Project.  Coordination, supervisory
and policy authority would remain with the Project Commission, which was
established by decree to supervise the First and Second Livestock Development
Projects. Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations. The
present Commission is composed of representatives from various Government
agencies, participating banks and the National Cattlemen's Association. The
Government is represented by CB (Chairman), MRN, Ministry of Economic Affairs
and Commerce, INA, Superior Planning Council (CONSUPLAN), and the NDB. The
Project Director acts as executive secretary to the Commission and prepares
agenda and records the minutes of meetings. Under the proposed Project, mem-
bership would also include a representative of COHBANA and one representative
of the campesino organizations in Honduras. Assurances on the composition of
the Commission were obtained at negotiations.
3.28      The Project would be managed and executed by the PCU of CB (Annex 8,
para 2), headed by a Project Director approved by IDA, supported by an ade-
quate technical and administrative staff and logistic facilities during the
life of the Project (Annex 8, Table 1). An assurance on this was obtained
at negotiations. The staff serving the Second Livestock Development Project
would be enlarged to give better geographical coverage and to diversify exper-
tise to include cropping as well as livestock activities. Initially, the
number of assistants would be increased from four to eight, one of whom should
be an agricultural economist who would organize and be responsible for data
retrieval and evaluation (monitoring) during the life of the Project (dis-
bursement plus subloan recovery phases). Project headquarters would remain
at Tegucigalpa, and, in addition to the two offices now operating at San
Pedro Sula and La Ceiba, both in the Atlantic zone, two new offices would
be opened to handle the increased volume of lending. Additional staff would
be recruited and the new offices opened at the recommendation of the Project
Director and approval of the Project Commission.
3.29      The Project Director would analyze and approve on technical, financ-
ial, and economic grounds all subloan applications for on-farm lending, agro-
industries, and financing of heavy machinery. In addition, he would advise
the PC, CB and the specific institutions involved on the financing of invest-
ments. Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.



- 20 -
Participating Banks including NDB
3.30      All banks and financial institutions would be eligible to partici-
pate, subject to a favorable report by the Superintendency of Banks, approval
by CB and the signing of Project Administration Agreements, satisfactory to
IDA, which would specify operational, lending, accounting and other norms and
procedures outlined in paragraph 3.34. Participating banks would also employ
a number of qualified technicians, sufficiently dispersed and with logistic
and administrative support, which, in the judgment of the Project Director,
would be adequate to achieve Project objectives. NDB would employ additional
technicians specifically expert in handling loans to small farmers and to
cooperatives or other groups formed under the Agrarian Reform Law. The
Project Director would review, from time to time, the technical staffing
status of PBs in relation to their capacity to analyze, approve and supervise
subloans, considering the number of subloans involved and their geographic
distribution. He would then advise CB and the Project Commission of recommen-
dations for additional staffing or for suspension of Project Administration
Agreements. Under the Second Livestock Project, PBs employ 12 technicians of
which 5 are in the NDB. The proposed Project would require an additional 15
technicians of which about 10 would be employed by NDB. Staff increases would
be in relation to portfolio expansion under the Project. The additional cost
would be covered by the margin of 5%.
H. Lending Operations
3.31      The PBs would make subloans under all sublending categories at 11%
annual interest rate. They would be able to rediscount with CB for 70% of
certified advances made for approved sub-projects at a rediscount rate of
6%. For subloans advances made to Isleta, the NDB would be permitted to
rediscount 100% with CB at 6%. The 5% spread to PBs is the minimum required
to cover costs of technical services and bad debt risks. The proposed inte-
rest rate of 11% to all sub-borrowers, which is in line with rates now gene-
rally being applied within Honduras for production purposes, would represent
a real interest of 3%, assuming a continuation of the 1975 inflation rate of
8% over the 5-year investment phase of the project. The interest rate of 11%
be applied to subloans was agreed to at negotiations, and will be incorporated
in Project Administration Agreements (para 3.34).
3.32      The following terms would apply to sublending under the Project:

Incremental working capital for annual recurring costs will be provided at
11% per annum by participating banks from their own resources. This obliga-
tion would form part of the Project Administration Agreement (para 3.34).
3.33      The proposed 11% interest rate to sub-borrowers and the rediscount
rate of 6% with CB would give participating banks a margin of 5%, which is
1% more than they were allowed under the First and Second Livestock Projects.
This proposed increase of 1% would cover the additional costs PBs would incur
for enlarged technical staffs to perform careful subloan analysis, creditwor-
thiness studies and proper supervision to reduce risk and cover bad debts.
The Project would not differentiate in lending terms between individual small
farms, agrarian reform cooperatives, or commercial producers, as all are
equal in the eyes of Agrarian Reform Law 170, nor would it set a maximum
aggregate subloan size, because of the range of farm sizes likely to be
involved. Sub-loans of US$100,000 or less would require only the approval of
the Project Director or his delegated representatives. However, subloans for
more than that figure and all those for agro-industries would require IDA
approval. Payments to institutions for the purchase of equipment, technical
services and studies would be made in the form of contracts between CB and the
institutions concerned on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. Assurances
on subloan approval procedures were obtained at negotiations.
3.34      Project Administration Agreements between CB and PBs would:
(a) oblige PBs to make subloans only on the basis of farm plans
which are technically, financially and economically sound;



- 22 -
(b) incorporate rediscount and sublending terms and
interest rates;
(c) provide that PBs would repay CB following the same repay-
ment schedule provided by the PB to the sub-borrower;
(d) provide for the employment of acceptable technical staff
by the PBs as recommended by the Project Director and
approved by the Project Commission;
(e) oblige PBs to provide complementary short-term loans to
finance working capital requirements of the sub-borrower
as recommended by the Project Director when he approves
detailed sub-projects for financing; and
(f) cover the obligation of CB to provide an adequate guarantee
for PB subloans.
Disbursements against sub-loans other than for Isleta would not be made until
the applicable Project Administration Contract between the CP and the PB is
executed. For the Isleta sub-project, disbursements would not be made until
the overall Isleta development plan is approved by IDA, the Project Adminis-
tration contract between the CB, the NDB and COHBANA is executed, and the
conditions for effectiveness of the amendment to the Second Livestock Project
(i.e., the contracting of technical specialists and the conclusion of a market-
ing agreement for Isleta bananas) are fulfilled. Disbursements for the tech-
nical assistance programs would not be made until applicable technical assis-
tance contracts between the CB and the executing agency are signed. Agreement
on the above was obtained at negotiations.
I. Accounts and Auditing
3.35      Under the First and Second Livestock Development Projects the Super-
intendency of Banks, which is an independent authority, has audited Project
accounts in the CB and PBs. Its performance has been generally satisfactory.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the CB and PBs would estab-
lish and maintain readily identifiable separate accounts for Project activ-
ities, that these accounts would be audited annually by the Superintendency
of Banks or independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, and that the audited
reports would be submitted to IDA not later than four months after the close
of each fiscal year (para 6.01, h).

IV. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND MARKETING, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production
4.01      Incremental annual production by farmers benefitting from the
Project would be substantial, as shown below. The figures are derived from
illustrative models only and thus the range of products analyzed is also
limited.

the reasonable application of well known local production and management
techniques, the use of irrigation for cropping and improved nutrition through
better grazing of beef/dairy animals. Production parameters which have been
used in model building are conservative and reflect what is already being
done, and which could be achieved by Project beneficiaries.
Markets and Marketing
4.03      Project production of rice and milk are import substitutions and
thus would not face demand or marketing constraints. Difficulties in export-
ing beef would remain as long as world oversupply, resulting in depressed
prices, exists. Incremental beef production from the Project could be absorbed
by domestic rising consumption due to population growth, at least until world
beef export markets improve. The case of markets for, and marketing of,
export quality bananas, would rest on (a) the use of the services of the
foreign fruit companies, or (b) the direct intervention of the Government
through COHBANA. Although strong markets for Honduran bananas exist in the
USA, western Europe, and Japan, the market is volatile and the marketing
process complex. For the moment at least, the Government would rely heavily
on the services of the foreign exporting companies in order to maintain an
effective marketing system. The agro-industrial component of the Project
would contribute to the value added to production, but as this component is
modest and the degree of transformation is limited, the greatest benefit
would be in additional employment and income stabilization to producers and
rural workers.

Prices
4.04      Even with some market restrictions, prices should be adequate to
guarantee financial success and provide incentives to produce. For milk and
domestically consumed beef, prices received will depend largely on the degree
of Government intervention to restrict retail prices. Decree 91 of November
1973 empowers the Directorate of Internal Commerce of the Ministry of Finance
to control prices to avoid inflation and to curtail market monopolies and
speculation. It also empowers NDB to act as the main purchaser and market-
ing agency for basic grains. Commodities subject to this Decree include rice,
meat and milk. IDA would maintain a dialogue with the Government over pricing
policies.
4.05      Prices paid to farmers for beef cattle have been for several years
well below the level of prices paid in neighboring Central American countries.
In 1975, prices received by Honduran farmers were only 60% of those enjoyed
by producers in other Central American countries except Nicaragua, where prices
were about the same as in Honduras. While prices for export beef have risen
somewhat, from US$0.61 per kg of frozen boneless beef in 1970, to US$0.63 in
1974, the rate of increase has dropped since 1973, creating a cost/price
squeeze for producers. As the outlook for future beef export is one of only
moderate optimism and producers are reluctant to invest heavily in purely beef
breeding operations, these will not be financed. Project emphasis will be on
the more profitable enterprises of milk/beef production and fattening.
4.06      Prices received by banana growers will depend on the skill of COHBANA
in negotiating prices with the foreign exporting companies or bilateral con-
tracts with major banana importing countries.

The table indicates the significant financial benefits that may be derived
from the progressive intensification of agricultural production giving least
benefits to livestock producers and most to enterprises in agro-industries.
The objectives in raising net family incomes would not be realized without
the simultaneous input of technical services and improved seeds and the ready
availability of recurring inputs such as fertilizers and working capital. The
Project provides for these but the ultimate success of the Project would
depend on the dedication of all of the institutions that would be involved in
its execution.



- 26 -
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Project would assist the Government of Hunduras in its simul-
taneous efforts to return to and pass the levels of production achieved
before the hurricane of 1974 and the drought of 1975; to feed a growing
population; and to implement its social programs of land reform and income
distribution.  The Project would help to ease foreign exchange constraints
which now limit many development projects in Honduras.  The Project also
focuses on products which have a direct export and foreign exchange earning
potential such as bananas and beef and import substitution products includ-
ing rice and milk.
5.02      Under the assumptions made in Annex 12, the economic rates of return
for the different components were found to be 35%, 40%, 24%, 50%, 39% and 50%
for the dairy-beef, beef fattening, bananas, rice, Isleta rehabilitation and
rice mills models respectively. The total investment costs for each one of
these components were respectively, L 8.1 million, L 0.5 million, L 2.8 mil-
lion, L 1.9 million, L 3.0 million and L 0.3 million. The weighted average
rate of return for the components indicated above which accounts for 63% 1/
of total project baseline costs was calculated to be 41%. The aggregate rate
of return excludes the following components, for which no rate of return could
be estimated because of the predominance of non-quantifiable effects; MRN--
technical assistance, INA--technical assistance and training, and PAS--training
components. The sensitivity analysis (Annex 12) indicates that the overall
rate of return would decrease from 41% to 31% with a drop of 10% in revenues.
The greatest effect of this change, however, would occur in the rice farm
models but not to such degree as to justify exclusion of this operation.
5.03      The annual farmgate value of incremental production of bananas,
rice, beef and milk would be about US$4.5 million per year at full develop-
ment (1975 farmgate prices), which would represent annual foreign exchange
earnings or savings of about US$9.6 million if all incremental production
were exported or imports reduced commensurately (including value added in
processing, packaging and transportation).
5.04      The Project would provide additional on-farm employment (either as
cooperative members or wage earners), to about 2,900 adults, representing
about 17,000 people. Off-farm employment in agro-industries or support ser-
vices would directly employ an additional 100 adults, representing 600 people.
There would be considerable, but unquantifiable benefits in professional
employment and developmental impact in the provision of funds for regional
studies for agrarian reform settlement, research and investigation, support
of INA, and the strengthening of the Project Credit Unit of the Central Bank.
The successful implementation of the Project would also strengthen the insti-
tutional capability of BNF and help relieve the considerable socio-political
1/   Including the Isleta Technical Assistance component (L 1.54 million)
and the Central Bank Project Unit costs (L 2.4 million).



- 27 -
tensions which exist within the country. Project financing of the agricul-
tural School at Zamorano would help to provide better training of the 40
Honduran students who enter the school each year, and in addition provide
residential, practical short courses to about 150 campesino leaders per
annum. The multiplier effect of this training would be significant and
extend beyond the life of the Project.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Assurances have been obtained from the Government that:
(a) it would cause the MRN to assign two counterpart personnel
for each of the consultants in applied research, extension
and training and in crop seeds production, agree to the
salary supplement proposed for such counterparts and pay all
salary costs for such personnel within five years (para 3.18);
(b) it would establish priorities for regional studies and obtain
IDA approval on the areas to be studied and terms of reference
for such studies prior to awarding any contracts (para 3.18);
(c) it would agree to cost sharing arrangements proposed in
paragraphs 3.22 and 3.23; that PBs would provide short-term
loans and working capital to beneficiaries; and that CB would
provide appropriate rediscount facilities (para 3.23);
(d) CB would administer the Project under the supervisory and
policy authority of a Project Commission (PC) (para 3.27);
(e) the Project would be executed by the PCU of CB, headed by a
Project Director acceptable to IDA, with adequate staffing
and logistic support (para 3.28);
(f) the Project Director would analyze and approve all subloans
and also advise PC on financing of investments (para 3.29);
(g) subloans for more than US$100,000 and for agro-industries would
be made with IDA approval, and grants to institutions for the
purchase of equipment, technical services, and studies would be
made in the form of contracts between CB and the institution
concerned on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (para 3.33);
and



- 28 -
(h) CB and PBs would establish and maintain separate accounts for
Project activities, these accounts would be audited annually
by independent auditors, and audited reports would be submitted
to IDA not later than four months after the close of each fiscal
year (para 3.35).
6.02      It would be a condition of effectiveness that the Government will
establish a system to maintain the liquidity of PBs which acquire agrarian
reform bonds as a result of expropriation of a subborrower's land (paras 2.11
and 3.03).
6.03      It would be a condition that disbursement against subloans would
not be made until the applicable Project Administration Agreement between the
CB and PB is executed. For the Isleta sub-project, disbursements would not
be made until the Isleta development plan is approved by IDA and the Project
Administration contract between CB, NDB and COHBANA is executed. Disburse-
ments for the technical assistance programs would not be made until applicable
Technical Assistance contracts between the CB and the executing agency are
signed (para 3.34).
6.04      With the indicated assurances, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$14 million for 50 years, including a
ten-year grace period.

HONDURAS
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agriculture in the National Economy
1.        Agriculture is the most important economic sector in Honduras
(Table 1).  Its contribution to GDP averaged 37% of the total 1/ in the
period 1970-74. However, at the same time, the sector's rate of growth
was about 2.5% per year while total GDP grew at 2.6%, indicating a rela-
tive stagnation and lack of dynamism compared to the performance of the
total economy.
2.        Economic growth in Honduras depends to a large extent on the per-
formance and development of agricultural exports, both aspects adversely
affected in September 1974 by Hurricane Fifi, which damaged approximately 1
million ha of crops in the departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Yoro and Colon,
the most productive areas in the country. This damage resulted in a 2.8%
reduction of the sector's GDP in 1974 as compared with that in 1973. The
reduction of the volume of the main export commodities and the low prices
obtained in the world market, together with the increase of price of import
commodities, has resulted in a stagnation of the total GNP at the 1973 level.
Furthermore, preliminary estimates of the Honduras Government indicate that
the GNP for 1975 will be still lower, resulting in a negative real rate of
growth of GNP per capita of 6.6% for the year due not only to the impossibil-
ity of repairing all of the hurricane damage and reaching the levels of pro-
duction existing prior to 1974, but also to the shortage of rainfall during
the first half of 1975 which seriously affected the yields of basic food
crops.
3.        Total agricultural exports for the 1972-74 period annually aver-
aged L 397 million, accounting for about 80% of total exports. The four
major agricultural export commodities--bananas, coffee, beef and lumber--
for the same period came to L 362 million annually, representing 91% of
total agricultural exports (Table 2).
4.        The total value of most of the main export commodities fell off
during 1974, with bananas hitting the 1970 level. However, bananas seem
to be a special case, since the Government considers that, in addition to
the decrease of production due to Hurricane Fifi, there has also been a
reduction in the activities of the banana companies due to dissension
over the banana tax recently imposed by the Government.
1/   At factor cost, 1966 lempiras.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.        During the 1970-75 period, the production of the main crops has
been practically static (Table 3). Total value added (in constant terms) in
agriculture increased from L 429 million (1970) to only L 489 million in 1973,
and then it decreased to L 476 million in 1974 (Table 4). Poultry production
and basic food crops, such as corn and beans, have been stagnant or they
decreased in absolute terms. This performance clearly indicates that in the
case of basic food crops and livestock exports, commercial opportunities and
natural events have probably influenced agricultural development more than
Government policies for the sector. These events have led to a deterioration
of terms of trade resulting in a current account deficit of about L 180
million for 1974 (for imports, see Table 3).
6.        Population grew at a rate of 3.5% per annum for the 1970-75 period,
reaching a total of about 2,980,000 by June of 1974 (Table 5). Of the total
population, 72% was living in rural areas in 1973, with an annual rate of
growth for the 1970-73 period of only 2.9%, while the comparable rate for
urban population was 5% per annum. For 1973, total economically active
population was estimated to be 830,000, of which 540,000 (65% of the total)
was engaged in the agricultural sector. Projecting the data shown above, it
is estimated that, as of June 1975, the total rural population was about
2,110,900 of which about 570,000 were employed or economically active in
agriculture.
7.        Average per capita income for the country approximated US$340 in
.1971 but it is estimated that about 60% of the rural population have an
annual per capita income of less than US$100. About half of this group
live on less than US$60 per year. For the 1970-72 period, about 45% of
the families in Honduras, which include most of the rural population living
on agricultural activities, received only 8.8% of total income and the aver-
age cash and subsistence income per capita of this group was L 120 (US$60) per
year.
8.        Although the average output per worker has been increasing, the
output of rural workers declined in recent years. There is no indication that
this trend is changing. Rural wages have remained stationary and agricultural
production has not been able to generate additional employment in the rural
sector.
9.        Under-employment in the rural sector is large but not quantified.
Employment in agriculture is closely geared to rainfall and is highly seasonal,
with labor shortages and upward wage pressures during the harvest periods on
basic food crops, cotton and coffee. Agricultural wages actually paid fluctuate
from L 1.5 to L 3 per day (US$0.75 to US$1.5), increasing at harvest time from
L 4 to L 5 per day although the banana companies pay from L 5 to L 6 daily
throughout the year to maintain a constant labor force.
10.       Wage legislation in effect stipulates that the minimum agricultural
wage is L 2.00 per day and that it should be increased to L 2.50 per day after
two years from the date in which the law was published. In addition to



ANNEX 1
Page 3
standard wages, the employer has to pay 5% over the minimum salary for social
security, thus increasing the total cost of labor to L 2.10 per day. The
employee and the Government each contribute with an additional 2.5% of basic
wage to the Social Security Fund, giving a net to the employee of L 1.95 per
day of which up to 30% per day may be claimed in kind (food, housing, and the
like) by the worker. According to Decree No. 121 of April 20, 1974, the total
minimum wage cost to the employer would be L 2.62 and the net income in cash
or kind to the employee, L 2.43 per day.
B.  Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform
Tenure Distribution of Land
11.       Honduras has a disorderly system of land titles, with a variety
of systems of tenure superimposed on the traditional Spanish private (sitio)
and public (ejido) land grant systems. Units of measurement have changed
over the years, enclosure has been haphazard rather than planned, and many
property boundaries bear little relation to their original title deeds.
Superimposed on this is a variety of systems of sub-tenancy, widespread
squatting, and various forms of share cropping. Deed registration is often
regarded as an unnecessary formality and there is no up-to-date cadasral land
register. Consequently, many land titles are easily challenged in a court of
law.
12.       In addition, the distribution of land is skewed.  Reliablq figures
are not available but the most recent census in 1965 1/ states that there are
a total of 178,361 farms occupying a total of 2.5 million ha of lan4. Nearly
70% of these farms (120,000) are said to be less than 7 ha in size (average
2.5 ha) yet they occupy less than 15% of the total farmed land. At the other
end of the scale, some 660 large farms, which represent less than 0.5% of the
total number of farms, occupy about 27% of the total farmed land (Table 6).
13.       There are three main types of tenure (Table 7).  National lands
belong to the state, although a high proportion of the land so classified
is held by private individuals, including de facto occupiers, lessees, and
concessionaires. Ejidal lands belong to the municipalities and arise from
the Central Government's long-established practice of granting land to new
towns for the use of the town residents. As with national lands, the
ejidal lands are now held mainly by private individuals under de facto
or lease arrangements. This category includes much of the nation's most
1/   The 1974 census is now being processed.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
valuable agricultural land. The third type is private lands. However, pro-
perty registration practices and agrarian legislation have not produced a
clear definition of private property. There is no precise information
available on the amounts of national, ejidal or private lands.
14.       The sub-leasing of national and ejidal land is a common practice.
Lessees and sub-lessees pay a fee for the use of the land, or, instead of
paying a fee, are allowed to take a subsistence crop in return for clear-
ing, after which the area is sown to pasture. Squatters occupy private,
national, or ejidal lands without legal right. Some 30,000 families are
probably under this precarious tenancy form, mainly on national lands. It
is estimated that rather more than 50% of the land in agricultural use is
under some type of absentee ownership. It should also be noted that a large
percentage of the small farms are located in marginal areas, especially
in the mountainous Central Zone. Most of these farms are on either "rented"
private lands or on a mixture of leased or squatter-occupied ejidal or na-
tional lands, with many being operated under other forms of secondary tenancy.
Conversely, many of the larger farms are frequently located on the better land
and are used for extensive ranching operations although they have the poten-
tial for much more intensive systems of both crop and livestock production.
Land invasions have occurred with every increasing frequency during the last
decade and a main issue for the Government was to forestall violent confronta-
tion with the peasantry and to accelerate policies leading to agrarian reform.
Land Reform Legislation
15.       Since agrarian reform was a major issue, it has received consi-
derable attention. On December 27, 1972 the new Government issued Decree
No. 8, which was intended to provide short-term solutions to the land problem
and to provide a breathing space for drawing up a longer plan for national
agrarian reform. Decree 8 was superseded by Decree Law No. 170 on December
30, 1974 promulgating a new Agrarian Reform Law in a climate of widespread
rural unrest, characterized by seizures of land by campesinos and spasmodic
outbreaks of violence. This unrest reflected extremely low living levels, a
rapidly growing population, and difficulties in getting access to land.
16.       Decree Law No. 170 makes the Agrarian Reform Institute (INA),
established in 1961, responsible for carrying out the reform and gives
the Director of INA cabinet status, being now directly responsible to
the Head of State, thus involving him more personally in the reforms.
The new law deals with the entire array of issues in an effective way and
provides an adequate legal basis for making land available to the rural



ANNEX 1
Page 5
poor as well as activating the on-going commercial farm sectors. Legal
procedures and rules for its implementation are now being developed. 1/
17.       Provisions.  The Law states that agrarian reform is an integral
part of the national development strategy and that it is intended to pro-
mote social justice and increase production and productivity. Allowable
maximums on farm size (Table 8) range from 100 ha in irrigation districts
to 2,000 ha in the Department of Gracias a Dios. No person (individually
or as a shareholder in a corporation) may hold in one or more farms a total
of more than the indicated maximums.   However, areas less than the indicated
maximums are also subject to expropriation if (a) within six months of the
date of the Law the land is not operated directly by the owner; (b) within
three years (January 1978) the farms is not efficiently exploited; or (c) the
land is in excessively fragmented units. Lands which are totally unexploited
are subject to immediate expropriation. At the end of three years, owners of
partially or inefficiently exploited lands may retain at least 50 ha, or
double the amount of the efficiently exploited area, whichever is larger, up
to a maximum imposed for each region. Land carrying two head of cattle per ha
is considered to be effectively worked in the better regions; the criterion
for the poorer regions is 0.67 head per ha. For permanent crops, 90% of the
cultivable area must be used, and for annual crops, one crop a year must be
produced, if long cycle, and two crops a year if short cycle.
18.       Small farms (less than 5 ha) can also be taken over for redistri-
bution after consolidation into larger units. Land in asentamientos under
Decree 8 are automatically expropriated. Land in bananas, sugarcane, African
palm, coffee, pineapple, citrus and tobacco are not expropriable as long as
efficient exploitation is maintained. With Government approval, land in
excess of the above-mentioned maximums can be held if needed to support a
specific production unit requiring investment of at least L 750,000. All
state and municipal lands are subject to immediate expropriation, with the
exception that persons having worked such land for 10 years in accordance
with the outlined intensity standards may retain up to 200 ha.
1/   As of October 1975, the supporting legislation in force for carrying
out the reform was: Resolution No. 346 (August 5, 1975), which re-
gulates the valuation of productive improvements, buildings and per-
manent crops; Resolution No. 347 (August 18, 1975), which regulates
the expropriation procedures; Decree No. 263 (September 10, 1975),
which regulates the application of Article 39 of the Law (permits
the legal ownership of farms of larger size than the limits set by
the Law); and Decree Law No. 253 (September 15, 1975), which eli-
minates all concessions given to the Tela Railroad Company (United
Brands) and to the Standard Fruit Company.

19.       Areas with the better infrastructure (roads, irrigation, and the
like) will receive priority attention. Expropriated land will be priced at
the average value declared by the owner for real estate tax purposes during
the three years just prior to expropriation. The value of improvements will
be determined by INA and payments will be in cash and transferable bonds.
Class A bonds, amortizable over 15 years, will carry a 6% interest rate;
Class B bonds, 20 years, 4%; and Class C bonds, 25 years, 2%. Improvements
will be paid for in cash (up to 10% of value, up to a maximum of L 20,000)
and the remainder in Class A bonds (if the total is less than L 5,000, pay-
ment will be in cash). Farms well exploited but in excess of the legal
limits are to be paid in cash (up to 10% of value, with a maximum of L 10,000)
and the remainder in Class B bonds. Idle land is to be paid for in Class C
bonds. Bonds may be used by the recipients to finance up to 50% of Govern-
ment-approved industrial projects.
20.       Persons working land under any form of rental, and the landless,
have priority in land distribution programs. Provisional titles will be
given and these will create eligiblity for public credit. Payment for the
land at INA valuation, will be made over a 20-year period, including two
years of grace. Definitive titles will be given on completion of payment.
Provision is made for distribution to family units and cooperative and associ-
ative farms, although the latter two are given priority. Family units of
not less than 5 ha or not more than 10 ha are authorized, if irrigated;
equivalent areas (in an income-earning sense) are authorized for non-irrigated
areas. In general the Agrarian Reform law reflects the basic technical
economic, social and political realities in Honduras. It is intended to
promote a change in land tenure that will result in an expanded agricultural
production and higher incomes for the rural poor and promote forms of rural
cooperatives, combining efficient work and economies of scale, and the settle-
ment of the maximum number of families on land and the promotion of workers'
participation in management. The agrarian reform is the single most important
issue facing the Government of Honduras and it has been given the first
priority in the Honduras 1974-78 Development Plan. However, difficulties are
many and large amounts of resources will be needed to ensure the success of
the program. The authorities are only beginning to become aware of the
problem of providing the variety of farm services required for agricultural
development, such as credit, extension, education and technical assistance in
the area of production, marketing and cooperative management. There is
in Honduras a great shortage of well qualified technicians, which may itself
become the most formidable obstacle to a successful agrarian reform program.
21.       Agrarian Reform Institute (INA).  The Law gives responsibility to
INA for the formation and promotion of campesino associative enterprises
(Empresas Asociativas de Campesinos, EAC). Each enterprise must have a
minimum of five members and is required to utilize mainly family labor. A
statute (Estatuto de las Empresas Associativas de Campesinos) governing this



ANNEX 1
Page 7
new legal form of agricultural enterprise is being prepared. INA will have
extensive participation in planning, organizing, and auditing these new
cooperatives. In addition to the EAC, cooperatives governed by existing
cooperative laws may also be beneficiaries of land transfer.
22.       INA is required to implement the reform in accordance with the
national development plan and a National Agrarian Council is set up to
advise the Chief of State. The Council is made up of three lawyers, two
representatives of the commercial farmer organizations, two representatives
of the campesino organizations, and a professional agronomist; none may be
public employees or key members of political parties. The President and
Secretary of the Council are appointed by the Government. INA is managed
by an Executive Director, who is not a member of the National Agrarian
Council, but may attend by invitation. In addition to advising INA, the
Council will receive and rule on complaints which grow out of INA resolu-
tions, working in accordance with the Code of Administrative Procedures.
The judgments of the Council may be appealed to the Supreme Court. The
law does not mention colonization but it gives INA control over public and
private water resources in cases relevant to implementation of agrarian reform.
Forestry lands continue to be under the jurisdiction of the Honduras Forestry
Corporation (COHDEFOR) established in February 1973.
23.       Up to 1973, INA was financed from:  Government appropriations, in-
come derived from the sale or lease of national land held by INA, loans provided
by international agencies, and donations in both cash and services. The
new Law does not provide for direct Government financing of INA, except for
budgetary allowances, through the Central Bank, to service the Agrarian Reform
Bonds.
24.       Accomplishments.  In its 14 years of existence, INA has been respon-
sible for settlements involving 119 cooperatives and 623 associative enter-
prises, with a total of 123,000 ha and benefiting 29,580 families (Table 9).
In addition, INA's program for the years 1976-79 calls for settling an addi-
tional 61,860 families on about 310,000 ha (Table 10), bringing its total (as
of October 1975) to 434,000 ha and benefiting 91,400 families (approximately
548,000 persons), with an average of about 4.7 ha per family. The program
prepared by INA estimated an average size of holding per family to be 5 ha for
the years 1976-79.

C. Production, Marketing and Prices
25.       Farm products are marketed almost entirely through private channels,
both for export and domestic consumption. Government activities in pricing
and marketing are increasing but so far there is little evidence of their im-
pact. For export products, mainly bananas, beef, coffee, and cotton, there
exist well organized and relatively efficient marketing systems. Bananas are
handled by the fruit companies, coffee and cotton by the producer coopera-
tives, and beef by the packing plants licensed for export sales. Producers
have at hand a considerable amount of domestic and international price in-
formation, and a small number of intermediaries participate in collection,
processing and distribution. Although there may be a large number of pro-
ducers, the central processing facilities and export arrangements contribute
to marketing efficiency.
26.       In contrast, basic grains and other major food products which move
mainly in the domestic market go through many channels, and a large (but un-
known) number of agents participate in collection and wholesale distribution.
The itinerant trucker is the principal link between the farmer or local
buyer, the main urban consumption centers and their retail markets, and the
grain buying stations of the National Development Bank (NDB) (Table 11).
The trucker may operate independently or act as agent for a wholesaler.
The producer typically sells to either a trucker-buyer who purchases at the
farm or a nearby road or to a wholesaler in the nearest town. Only a few
producers sell grain directly to NDB or directly in the local market.
27.       The number of stages and ownership transfers in the movement to
market may be large, particularly in those areas remote from the principal
buying stations of the NDB or the main consumption centers of Tegucigalpa
and San Pedro Sula. NDB storage capacity and locations of the buying
stations are given in Table 12.
28.       The principal public institution which markets farm products and
inputs is the NDB. In addition to its credit activities, the NDB sells
inputs and buys basic grains (maize, rice, beans and sorghum). The Input
Sales Section supplies inputs to all types of farmers, particularly those
receiving agricultural credit from the NDB, and has been operating since
the 1950s. The Cereals Division is responsible for the grain buying,
storage and sales programs as established by the Basic Grains Commission.
29.       The Basic Grains Commission is made up of the President of NDB, the
Minister of Economy, the Minister of Natural Resources, and two representa-
tives of the private sector. The Commission receives technical advice from
the Central Bank, the National Agrarian Reform Institute and the Superior
Council of Economic Planning, as well as the Federacion Nacional de Agricul-
tores y Ganaderos de Honduras.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
30.       The Commission directs the implementation of the price stabiliza-
tion program for basic grains. It sets the minimum prices to be paid at the
buying stations of the NDB, the maximum selling price of NDB sales to whole-
salers and retailers, and the NDB transportation charges. The Commission
has the final say on the imports and exports of basic grains through its
approval of import and export requests made by private traders.
31.       The objective of basic grains price policy is intra-year stabiliza-
tion in the interest of both producer and consumer. Production costs, world
prices and Central America's support price levels are taken into considera-
tion when determining the level of the support price for corn, beans, rice
and sorghum in Honduras (Table 13).
32.       In addition to the Basic Grains Commission, the Government inter-
venes in pricing through the Directorate of Internal Commerce of the Ministry
of Economy. This office was set up by Decree 91 of November 1973 and is con-
cerned with ensuring that prices of basic foods do not rise as a result of
excessive market influence (monopoly power) or speculative hoarding. The
Directorate has a limited number of inspectors who check on the prices of
a few basic commodities. The agricultural products subject to Decree 91
are sugar, basic grains, milk, eggs, coffee and meat. For the latter,
however, price controls have not been implemented.
33.       Decree 91 gave the NDB interim authority to make direct sales
(Table 14) through existing retail outlets of basic consumption items,
including grains. The Decree requires national distributors to sell to
the NDB at mutually agreed prices and in quantities sufficient to ensure
adequate domestic supplies. The Decree also permits the Government to
fix the amount (as a percent of sales) of export commodities which must be
reserved for the national market.
34.       The main reason for Decree 91 was the inflation which began to
develop during 1971 and thereafter accelerated, strongly affecting the
price of food, as shown below:
Consumer Price Index 1969-74

Decree 91 authorizes the Ministry of Economy to temporarily exempt from
import duties those products that are in short supply. This was done in
December 1973 and again in 1974 after Hurricane Fifi. Although mention is
made in Decree 91 of maintaining prices which will provide sufficient incen-
tive to producers, it is apparent that the concern is with the consumer.

D. The Livestock Sub-sector
35.       The cattle industry in Honduras has been increasingly important in
recent years and the potential for development is as yet unused. Official
preliminary figures from the 1974 Agricultural and Livestock census indicate
a national herd of 1.7 million (Table 15) although the actual figure could be
as much as 2 million. Cattle are widely distributed throughout the country,
with about 44% of the total herd in the Atlantic Region, 42% in the Central,
and the remainder in the Pacific (Table 16). The 1965 census lists
58% of all cattle on farms of less than 65 ha; 22% on medium size farms (65
to 320 ha), and 20% on farms over 30 ha.
36.       Most of the cattle are of native or Criollo type and, though often
small and stunted by poor nutrition, they are capable of greater productivity
than currently achieved. In recent years there has been a sizeable intro-
duction of improved breeds such as the Brahman, S. Gertrudis and Charolais
for beef while Brown Swiss and Holstein are preferred for dairy. Purebred
bulls and semen are becoming available, but productivity standards are very
poor, with an estimated average production of about 25 kg of carcass weight
per animal/year.
37.       It is impossible to separate beef from milk production since most
of the livestock activity is dual purpose and most of the milk produced in
the country comes from predominantly beef-type animals that are milked once
a day. There is very little specialized dairy farming and the national
daily average production of milk is about 1.5 to 3.5 liters, depending on
the quality of the breeding stock. However, poor nutrition has more effect
on productivity than the herd genetic potential.
38.       Beef production has increased steadily from 19,000 tons in 1965
(Table 15) to 41,000 tons in 1971. The observed growth of beef production
during the period is uneven since the rate of extraction depends more on the
world market and short-run policy considerations than on herd growth or im-
provements in productivity. During the 1965-74 period, exports of meat in-
creased from 8,000 tons (1965) to a maximum of 28,000 tons (carcass weight)
in 1973. Total domestic consumption increased during the same period by
only 3,000 tons, changing the relationship of export-internal consumption
from 40%/60% in 1965 to 70Z/30% in 1974. It is estimated that domestic con-
sumption is probably higher than the official figure due to the clandestine
slaughtering.
39.       Most of the beef produced is exported as boneless to the United
States, a market which is open because Honduras is free of foot and mouth
disease. Honduras began exporting processed beef in limited quantities
to the US in 1958, and quantities remained low until 1968 due to the lack
of slaughter capacity. In 1968, the US Congress imposed a voluntary quota
system for all countries exporting fresh beef to the US. Quotas were based on
past deliveries and currently available supplies. Countries with excess beef



ANNEX 1
Page 11
could sell, out of quota, processed beef products prepared for direct sale to
retail outlets or for further processing into packaged foods by industrialy -
users.
40.       In 1968 the law allowed Honduras a quota of 6,400 tons (boneless beef)
and by 1972 it had risen to 7,700 tons (11,200 tons of carcass weight).  How-
ever the system was suspended, and Honduras' total exports rose to 26,000 tons
in 1972 and 28,000 tons in 1973. In 1975, the US quota system was again en-
forced allowing a total market of 15,800 tons (23,000 tons of carcass), of which
9,500 tons had been exported by August.
41.       As a result of this large growth in the export market for fresh beef,
seven modern export-oriented slaughterhouses, with a kill and boning capacity
of 444,000 head per year, were constructed in Honduras. Three of the plants,
Alus, Corsa, and Del Norte, are located in the cattle-rich northern part of
the country, and two more, IGHSA and Carnilandia, are in the south. The plant
capacity and percentage of utilization are shown below.

42.       The export slaughter plants must meet the US sanitary standards,
and, for this reason, they are modern, efficient, and well designed units,
complete with boning rooms, refrigerated beef coolers, and freezer storage.
Each plant has a veterinary meat inspector and several assistants available
to inspect the live animals, beef carcasses and by-products, and the boned
meat to ensure that only wholesome meat products leave the plant. The
plants appear to be well run and have aggressive management.
43.       Since the packers are the main outlet for beef cattle, there are no
cattle markets in the accepted sense in Honduras. Animals are bought by the
packers through cemmission agents and are trucked direct from farm to packing-
house. The packers also tend to dominate the market in feeder cattle. They



ANNEX 1
Page 12
purchase stock from farmers in the breeding areas and transport them to
farmers in the fattening areas for finishing. Various arrangements are
made, ranging from outright cattle purchase and subsequent resale to agree-
ments involving no change in ownership of the cattle and a division of pro-
fits between the feeders and the packers. It is estimated that the majority
of cattle purchased for fattening are financed by the packers, in one form
or another.
44.       The domestic meat market is at present mainly supplied with culled
female cattle, collected by local butchers and their agents and killed in the
local municipal slaughterhouses, or elsewhere illegally. Regulations limit
the slaughter of females by the packers to 10% of their total throughput,
and this has the effect of ensuring a source of animals to the domestic
market. As a result, the majority (above 75%) of animals killed in the
municipalities are females. The domestic market is also supplied by the
export packers who are required to sell at least 10% of their production in
the domestic market. In addition most of the offal produced by the packers
is sold to the local market.
45.       Up to 1963 beef cattle exports to Guatemala and El Salvador were
very important, but regulations prohibiting live cattle exports were initiated
in 1963 and, in 1973 even more severe rules were enforced which closed com-
pletely the frontier to live cattle trade. It appears that these regulations
were a result of pressures put on the Government by meat packers. Because all
packing plants operate at levels below full capacity, they compete with one
another for the supply of cattle, but this competition has not increased
prices to producers to any marked extent, giving rise to the feeling that
packers are engaged in price fixing.
46.       Despite the financial strength of packers or their hold on farmers,
a small, clandestine, export trade of live animals continues, and producers
on the Nicaragua and Guatemala borders receive attractive prices from foreign
buyers. This limited trade, however, does not affect domestic prices, which
are the lowest in Central America (Table 17) and in the 1972-75 period, have
gone up very little and are quite modest compared with the average price
received for Honduras beef exports (Table 18).
47.       There is no Government price policy on cattle, and the meat packers
are left to set whatever price is necessary to obtain their supply. Honduras
producers received as an average for an 800-pound steer (363 kg) L 0.64
(US$0.32) per kilogram in 1974 and 1975, while prices in the rest of Central
America ranged upward to a high of L 1.10 per kg in Panama. For the current
year, producers able to sell cattle outside of Honduras have been receiving,
as an average, a price differential of L 0.12 to L 0.15 per kg compared to
the price obtained in the local market.
48.       Dairy production has risen at a more modest rate, from 138 million
liters in 1965 to 196 million in 1974 (Table 15). Milk output has not been



ANNEX 1
Page 13
to keep up with rising demand, and imports of milk increased correspondingly
from 14 to 25 million liters of fluid milk equivalent (1,400 to 2,500 metric
tons of dry powder milk) in the 1965-74 period. Milk production figures,
however, have to be viewed with extreme caution since at best 8% to 10% of
total reported milk production goes to processing plants in Honduras, with
the rest being consumed on the farm or sold directly to consumers as fluid
crude milk or in the form of homemade cheese and butter. Furthermore, an
analysis of the official production data shows that the milk production grew
at an average rate of 2% and 1% per year, respectively, for the period 1965-70
and 1971-74, but at a rate of 22% for 1970/71. Given the low price of milk
vis-a-vis the alternative prospects of beef exports and the dual-purpose
nature of the herd, it is not surprising that milk production decreased some-
what in the period 1971-74, but it is very difficult to explain the sudden
increase reported for the year 1970/71.
49.       Most of the milk produced in Honduras is transformed into sub-
products at the farm level or sold fresh within the area in which they are
produced. Only a small fraction of the total production goes to the six
dairy processing plants (two in Tegucigalpa, two in San Pedro Sula and two at
La Ceiba). Total processing capacity is about 45 million liters, which
represents only 23% of total 1974 reported production; plant capacity varies
from a maximum of 40,000 liters per day (two plants) to a minimum of 2,000
liters per day. Plant utilization is rather low and, on the average, it is
estimated that 35% of total plant capacity is being utilized.
50.       Consumption of fluid milk is estimated to be 25% of total reported
production. Very few cities in the country consume pasteurized milk, and
about 60% of total consumption is made up of non-pasteurized milk sold most
of the time directly from producers to consumers. Furthermore, since there
is a very limited capacity for handling and storing milk products, most of
the consumption is localized in the larger urban centers and in the pro-
duction areas.
51.       Producers are paid according to milk quality and butterfat content.
A sampling of three plants indicates that the average price per liter re-
ceived by farmers in 1975 at the plant level was L 0.32, L 0.30, and L 0.25
in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba, respectively. On the other
hand, the price to consumers was L 0.60 per liter and it is under Govern-
ment price control schemes. Most of the milk imports are in the form of
whole dry powdered milk. Reported average CIF prices paid for milk imports
were L 0.26 per liter (US$0.13) and the import volume is not regulated by
the Government.
52.       The small increases observed in milk production seem to be due to
the low prices paid to farmers for fluid milk up to mid-year 1974 (L 0.10 per
liter), together with the fact that the price of imported (CIF) processed milk
is lower than the price paid to producers for fluid milk. Given the price
relationship, the best alternative for those plants that are in a position to
reconstitute milk is to use imported milk rather than purchase locally produced
fluid milk--a situation that does not coincide with the Government's desire to
increase domestic production.

E. The Crop Sub-sector
53.       The project would, in principle, finance most of the crops grown in
the country, provided that operations are viable. This section, however,
deals only with bananas and rice, which are of major interest to the Project.
Bananas
54.       Banana is the most important export crop, accounting for 35% of
total export earnings in the country (para 3). The area planted with bananas
is about 38,000 ha (Table 19), but only 21,500 ha are used by export-oriented
plantations with good standards of productivity. The rest of the banana area
(16,500 ha) is used generally for domestic consumption, which averages 40% of
total production (Table 20).
55.       The production of bananas for export purposes is completely dominated
by two foreign companies--Tela Railroad Company (United Brands) and the Stand-
ard Fruit Company, which owns and operates 13,700 ha (64%) of the total area
of commercial banana. The rest is formed by private individuals that produce
under medium-term contracts to the two firms, and are dependent on them in
matters related to technical assistance, some production credit and market
services. The situation has changed somewhat recently and it is expected that
the Government will play a more active role in the future, implementing some
production and marketing policies for the banana sector. All the concessions
that the banana companies had and which gave them a special legal and economic
status were eliminated in September of 1975. 1/ In addition, the Government
created 2/ the Corporacion Hondurena del Banano (COHBANA) for the purpose of
dealing with all matters related to Government services and policies concern-
ing the banana sector. It is also authorized to take an active part in pro-
duction and marketing of bananas.
56.       Under the agrarian reform law, lands planted with bananas or other
permanent crops are not subject to expropriation and it is expected that the
foreign companies will continue to operate in Honduras. However, a workable
arrangement has to be implemented protecting both the interests of the com-
panies and those of the Government (COHBANA) in regard to marketing by in-
dependent producers and agrarian reform beneficiaries. Production and exports
of bananas decreased by about 200,000 metric tons between the years 1973 and
1974 (Table 20), and it is difficult to know how much of the losses are due to
Hurricane Fifi and how much to the problems between the banana companies and
the Government (para 4).
1/   Decree Law No. 253.
2/   October 25, 1975.



ANNEX 1
Page 15
57.       Under current market arrangements, individual producers sell the
bananas to export packing sheds. Prices paid to farmers varies from L 1.72
per box (L 94.5 ton) to L 1.0 per box (L 55.0 ton), depending on the grade
of the product. It is estimated, based on the actual contracts between
producers and the banana companies, that the average negotiated price
for all bananas bought and exported is about L 1.85 per box. This figure is
only a general point of reference, however, since the price varies, depending
on the grade of the banana produced and on the particular supply and demand
situation of the banana company to whom the producer is selling. Thus, the
percentage of rejects may go up and down, depending on the company's banana
harvest.
58.       Prices (FOB) received for Honduras banana exports have shown a
sustained upward trend for the last five years (Table 21), increasing from
L 192 per ton in 1970 to L 248 per ton in 1974, with an average price for the
period of L 214 per ton (L 3.89 per box). Practically all the bananas
Honduras exports go to the US market. The local market is supplied both
by the non-commercial production and by rejects from the export market.
Rice
59.       Rice is the third (after corn and beans) most important food crop of
low income farmers and it is basic in the urban diet. Any shortfall in output
leads to immediate shortages which then effect diet and real income through
higher prices. The total estimated requirements (for human, animal, industrial
and seed) suggest that Honduras will need to increase rice production from the
estimated 15,000 tons achieved in 1974 to 30,000 tons in 1980 to meet total
internal demand (Table 20).
60.       The area used and total production figures for rice, as for most
basic food crops, vary considerably from year to year. Most rice production is
rainfed, thus any change in the usual rainfall pattern affects total produc-
tion profoundly, both in terms of yield per ha and the area harvested.
61.       Rice is produced in the Northern Coast and North Central areas
in Atlantida (13% of national output), Colon (6%), Cortes (12%), and Yoro
(7%), and there is important production in Olancho (10%). However, Honduras
has an overall deficit in rice, and imports are made both by the Government,
through the NDB and by private traders, with the previous approval of the
Basic Grains Committee (para 30). In 1975, due to the hurricane and the
shortage of rainfall during the first half of 1975, imports increased to
an all-time high. By September, NDB had imported 22,000 tons (Table 13)
which is three times the reported annual imports for 1970-74.

62.       The proportion of production sold, varies considerably from region
to region. For the nation as a whole, it is estimated that approximately
60% of the rice crop is marketed. NDB annual purchases in the local market
averaged 21% of total production (Table 13) for the 1971 to 1974 period.
Prices received by farmers, aside of the support price paid by NDB, are not
well known and reportedly are substantially lower than those paid by that
Government agency.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Banking System and Agricultural Credit
Introduction
1.        Both private and state banks play an important role in providing
credit to the agricultural sector. In 1974, credit for agricultural activities
amounted to 31% of all lending, while, in descending order of importance,
industry received 21%, housing 15%, and services 9%, with consumer and other
loans together accounting for 5% of total credits granted. During 1974 the
agricultural/livestock sector continued officially to have "most favored"
credit status with an increase of 28.6% in lending volume of crops for about
L 18.5 million as compared with the year before. Livestock credits grew at a
lesser rate but were nevertheless about L 7.7 million greater than the volume
for 1973. Loans and discounts of commercial banks during 1974 represented
73.1% of the whole banking system and passed the L 44 million of 1973; develop-
ment banks in 1974 raised their lending by L 18.9 million or an increase of
18.8% over 1973 with a credit volume in 1974 of 21.3% of the total. In addition,
special savings institutions provided 5.6% of the 1974 volume of credit, an
increase of L 6.9 million over their operation in 1973 (Table 1).
Central Bank of Honduras (CB)
2.        The Central Bank of Honduras (CB), heads the banking system.  CB
was established by the National Congress in February 1950 and has head-
quarters in Tegucigalpa, a branch office in San Pedro Sula, and eight agency
offices throughout Honduras. It is governed by a Board of Directors composed
of the president of the bank, appointed by the President of the Republic;
the Minister of Finance and Public Credit, an ex-officio member; a repre-
sentative from NDB; a representative from the private commercial banks;
and a representative from the private sector. Each member has an alternate.
3.        The President of the bank, in office for a seven-year term that
may be extended, proposes to the Board of Directors the measures and resolu-
tions necessary to execute bank policies and informs it of issues most re-
levant to the operation of the bank. He also performs the legal representation,
together with or apart from the management, and directs the relations of the
bank and Board with public authorities, with the banking system, and with
various international organizations where it represents the Government.
4.        The manager of the bank is in charge of its direct administration
and day-to-day operations. He is appointed by the Board, being responsible
to it as well as to the President, and is assisted by several department
managers, who, upon his recommendation, are appointed by the Board. An



ANNEX 2
Page 2
internal auditor, also appointed by the Board, for five-year terms, is
responsible for the inspection and continuous audit of accounts. An
external auditor, appointed by the President of the Republic and admin-
istratively reponsible to the Minister of Economic and Finance and Public
Credit, annually audits the departments of the bank for legal and financial
compliance with the national banking laws and regulations. The Super-
intendent of Banks, appointed by the Board and administratively responsible
to the manager of the bank, is responsible for examining the operations of
all private banks, finance companies, and Government banks (See Chart 1).
5.        The CB acts as banker, fiscal agent, and economic and financial
adviser to the Government, to its Ministries and Departments, and to
official and semi-official entities. Its purpose is to promote monetary,
credit and exchange conditions favorable to the development of the national
economy. CB grants rediscounts at 100% against appropriate documentation
at 5% per annum; for production marketing, 7%, and for specific operations
(liquidity), 10% per annum. It establishes the interest rate structure for
all bank deposits and loans, as well as the reserve requirements against
deposits. For normal (non-specific) commercial bank loans up to an amount of
US$1,250, interest rates are from 13.5% to 16% per annum, and for credits
for production, the interest rate was fixed at 11% from September 16, 1974.
Current interest rates paid on savings and time deposits are from 6% to 9.5%
per annum. Reserve requirements for current accounts, savings and time
deposits are 25% of value consisting of 18% in paper and 7% in cash for local
moneys, or 30% in the case of foreign exchange transactions. The bank may
also establish limits on advances, lines of credit in foreign currency, and
rediscount facilities to private banks. CB may borrow from international
lending institutions and, as fiscal agent for the Government, can also act,
as Administering Agency for the proposed project - a role it successfully
played for the First and Second Livestock Development Projects.
6.        CB allocates its net earnings to its capital and to a Securities
Fund. None of its earnings, therefore, flow into the National Income and
Expenditure Budget. Even though there was strong pressure on international
monetary reserves, due partly to increased petroleum prices and damage
caused by Hurricane Fifi in September 1974, CB operations in 1974 were at
a higher level than those in 1973. Net reserves rose in 1974 by L 2.6
million as compared with 1973, from about L 92 million to over L 94 million.
Net financing to the public sector by CB rose from L 73.8 million in 1973
to about L 91 million in 1974, compensating for the increase in public sector
deposits from L 39.8 million in 1973 to L 56.7 in 1974. In addition, during
1974, the CB made available to the banking system L 81.9 million in credits,
or a 33% rise from the L 54.5 million granted in 1973. During the same
period, bank deposits with CB dropped 13% from L 26.7 million to L 23.2
million (Table 2).

8.        The Banco Atlantida, on December 31, 1974, held about 30% of all
deposits and 20% of the portfolio of the total banking system. Within the
commercial banking sector, it held 33% of deposits and 28% of the credit
volume, followed in importance by BANCAHSA with 16% of deposits and 15% of
loans (Table 3).
9.        The loan portfolio of the banking system is more or less constant
in its proportion of short- medium- and long-term loans except for an in-
crease in long-term loans granted by participating banks involved in the
Livestock Projects since 1971 (Table 4). Generally, banks have become
cautious in granting long-term agricultural/livestock loans because of
uncertainties involved in the implementation of Agrarian Reform Law No. 170.
These uncertainties revolve around the validity of using a first mortgage
on land as a guarantee and the likelihood, in the case of the default of
sub-borrowers, of INA repaying outstanding debts in long-term bonds bearing
low interest. Participating banks are disposed to continue to lend for
long-term development if the Government/Central Bank can resolve the
1/   Participating banks with First and Second Livestock Development Projects.

problems of guarantees and/or the convertibility of bonds so that the banks
can fulfill their cash repayment obligations to the Central Bank. The
private participating banks which have a well developed system of branches
throughout the country (Table 5) have lent great support to the execution
of the previous livestock projects and require only a return of confidence
to continue in this role. They have specialized credit and technical staff
which would be strengthened for the execution of the current proposed
Project.
National Development Bank (NDB)
10.       Functions.  NDB is the major development bank in the country, with
its head office in Tegucigalpa and 22 branch offices in all the important
cities and towns. It was founded in 1950 and has since been the main source
of institutional lending to agriculture. By the end of 1974, it had financed
about 55% of total loans to the agricultural sector. The major part of this
lending is medium and long term (about US$37.2 million) but it has also
extended about US$11.1 million of short-term loans to the sector. NDB's
activities are not restricted to agriculture. It has an industrial loan
portfolio of about US$7.5 million and is involved in extensive non-banking
activities such as operating the Government's grain marketing and storage
program and running a series of farm supply stores, and, by means of its
Development Department, an active technical assistance and promotion pro-
gram in both agriculture and industry. NDB also operates as a commercial
bank insofar as it solicits deposits (about US$14 million) from private
and public institutions and makes commercial loans. Since the promulgation
of Agrarian Reform Law No. 170, the NDB has the additional responsibility
of financing the "reformed" sector.
11.       Administration.  NDB is governed by a Board of Directors, composed
of a President (appointed by the President of the Republic for five year
periods, two Government Ministers, one representative of the private banking
sector, and five representatives of the business community, all of whom have
an alternate (Chart 2).
12.       Resources and Financial Structure.  In December 31, 1974, the
summarized consolidated balance sheet showed total assets of US$103.4 million
(Table 6). Its main liabilities were owned capital of US$22.8 million, long-
term loans (mainly from IDB and USAID) of US$17.2 million, rediscounts from
the Central Bank of US$15.8 million, time deposits and short-term borrowings
of US$6.5 million, and demand deposits of US$14.5 million. Its main assets
were loans due, US$57.2 million; fixed assets, US$9.5 million; investments
in various enterprises, US$4.4 million; and cash and holdings in the Central
Bank, US$2.5 million. According to these figures, the overall debt/equity
ratio is 2.4:1 and its term debt/equity ratio, 0.8:1. This seems a satis-
factory situation, resulting largely from the fact that the Government's
contribution to NDB's share capital has more than offset its balance sheet
losses.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
13.       Financial Results.  NDB has operated at a loss for several years.
In the three years 1972-74 annual losses have increased from US$1.2 million
to US$1.4 million and now total about US$4 million. The losses incurred
were in the Credit Department of NDB, not in the Development Department.
Reserves of US$4.5 million are sufficient, considering the number of loans
in arrears. Table 7 presents a summarized profit and loss statement for
1972-74.
14.       Use of Resources.  NDB's prime function is to make small agricul-
tural loans. In 1974, it approved 19,491 loans distributed as follows:

Total                           19,491    100.0        40,171       100.0
Loans were given for a wide variety of enterprises and many farmers had
several. Some 90% of all loans were for US$2,500 or less but these repre-
sented only about 25% of the total value of agricultural lending.
15.       In 1974 NDB approved, overall, 49,800 loans amounting to US$57.0 mil-
lion. Details are as follows:

16.       Lending Policies and Procures.  At present, loans may be approved
in accordance with the following schedule:

17.       For working capital loans, the normal collateral is the pledge of
the crop itself. Investment loans for terms of four to seven years are
secured by chattel mortgages covering crops and investments. The amount
of the loan may not exceed 80% of the value of the guarantee. Mortage loans
are granted for a period of five to 25 years for on-farm investment, land
purchase, and the construction of houses. The amount may not exceed 60%
of the value of property pledged.
18.       Portfolio Weakness.  The NDB has a total portfolio of about US$57
million equivalent, of which US$13.2 million, or 23% of the portfolio, is in
arrears. Details of overdue loans by sources of financing are shown below:

1/   Note that IBRD funds are not involved.
19.       Loan recovery of NDB's own funds is the most critical aspect.
Overdue loans financed from NDB sources represent 64% of the value of all
outstanding debts due or about 15% of the total portfolio. In addition to
the US$13.2 million of loans overdue on December 31, 1974, other overdue
loans to the value of about US$8.1 million were refinanced, which added to
the value of actual overdues, amounts to US$21.3 million, or 37% of the total
credit portfolio. This situation does not indicate sound financial management
and it is evident that NDB must clean up its portfolio and replenish its
capital, especially to fulfill its role in agrarian reform.
20.       There are a variety of reasons for a poor loan repayment record,
including the following:
(a) Certain crops such as coffee and rice have not been
profitable to farmers, due to poor yields and lack of
good marketing facilities;
(b) For many commodity loans, the harvest has been the sole
collateral and poor harvests have led to poor loan
repayments;
(c) Poor credit control within NDB;



ANNEX 2
Page 8
(d)  Inadequate legal procedures within NDB for loan collection;
(d) Pressure by Government agencies to engage in marginal
enterprises;
(f) Lack of flexibility in loan repayment schedules; and
(g) Lack of a penalty interest rate for loans in arrears.
21.       Since its inception, NDB has been required by the Government,
sometimes against its better judgment, to engage in activities that would
not generally be considered suitable for a development bank. This is partly
because there have been no other agencies that could undertake such functions.
Examples are grain marketing, retail store management, and the operation of
dairies and coffee processing plants. Management has not been and is not now
equipped to run such operations.
22.       In recent years, NDB has repeatedly attempted to reorganize itself,
but reforms have been piecemeal rather than comprehensive and have, on occa-
sions, either complicated issues or led to duplication of effort. One major
reform -- the partial computerization of records and bookkeeping -- has been
introduced. NDB is now in the process of being further reorganized as a
result of studies and advice from IDB and USAID. Results to date are not
encouraging.
23.       The Accounting Division within the NDB is responsible for maintain-
ing all accounting records and ensuring that they are kept up to date.
Separate records are kept for the Credit and Operations Department and for
the Development Department. The internal auditor of the NDB is appointed
by the Board of Directors and aided by a total of 16 auditors. External
auditing is carried out by the Superintendent of Banks in accordance with
the banking laws of Honduras. So far NDB has not kept separate accounts
for subloans-made with Second Livestock Project funds, but this situation
has been drawn to the attention of NDB and is being remedied.
24.       Participation in Second Livestock Project.  When the First Livestock
Project was appraised in January 1969, it was decided that the NDB should not
participate, largely because its administration was weak, its technicians
fully extended, and its debt collection poor. Because of favorable comments
in 1973 by USAID and IDB experts on the improved performance of NDB, it was
concluded that NDB participation in the Second Livestock Project was desirable.
Although the Second Project became effective in January 18, 1974 and the NDB
was authorized to become a participating bank by Decree No. 152 of November
11, 1973, it did not begin to operate actively until 1975. By November 1975,
the NDB had approved only nine out of the total of 144 subloans made under the
Second Project (6.3%) for a value of about US$205,000, or 5.6% of the total



ANNEX 2
Page 9
value of loans granted (Table 8). While NDB has about 37 other subloans under
consideration, its operational processes are so slow that it has not lived up
to the expectations expressed at appraisal of the Second Project, nor has it
catered to the needs of small farmers, as its average subloan size has been
almost US$23,000.
25.       Participation in Agricultural Credit Project.  Regardless of the
financial, operational, and administrative weaknesses of the NDB, its parti-
cipation in the Agricultural Credit Project would be vital in extending
credit to the small farmer and cooperative enterprises established under
Agrarian Reform Law No. 170. The Project is designed to grant loans to all
types of farmers who now are obliged to operate under the Law, both in terms
of farm sizes (type of enterprise and regional land use zoning) and certain
levels of production efficiency. While no legally constituted producer is
excluded as a likely borrower under the Project, the main thrust of the lend-
ing component is towards small farmers, whether operating on a individual
basis or collectively, who are beneficiaries of agrarian reform. The impor-
tance of the NDB is further accentuated by the present mood of uncertainty in
the private banking sector over the form and security of guarantees normally
required as collateral against long-term lending for agricultural and live-
stock development.
26.       To comply with its future development obligations, the NDB needs
to build up its technical staff for subloan request analysis and also review
its position on guarantees and accelerate its processing of loans so that they
are granted on a timely basis. As for a period of time the legal status of
land ownership (i.e. titles) will sometimes be in doubt, the whole collateral
situation might have to be modified whereby NDB would accept provisional
titles or the guarantee of INA or the Government rather than first mortgages
on land and/or chattel mortgages. The best form of guarantee, however, would
still be sound sub-projects adequately analyzed and supervised by competent
technicians. In view of the continued support of USAID and IDB in strenthen-
ing NDB, it is proposed that for Project purposes, IDA maintan a close liaison
with these organizations and not insist on additional reasons.
Consolidated Loans Approved by Participating Banks under the First and
Second Livestock Projects
27.       Subloans under the First Livestock Project were approved by six
participating banks, of which the Banco de Ahorro Honduras with 18%; and
BANCAHSA with 18% for a total involvement of 17% of loan funds amounting to a
total of about US$313 million, with the rest being shared by the other three
participating banks (Annex 3).
28.       Under the Second Livestock Project, the three major banks mentioned
above approved 57% (about US$2.35 million) of the total amount of about US$4.1
million approved by October 31, 1975, bringing the total value of lending by
all participating banks at that date to US$7.4 million as shown below (Table
8).

29.       Participating banks have treated the subloans under the Livestock
Projects as part of their normal operations rather than maintain accounts on
a separate basis by which each could be identified individually. It is thus
difficult at the moment to itemize the accounts, interest and principal re-
covery and costs associated with the lending operations under the Projects.
The Central Bank has been so informed and the situation is being rectified.
General Financial Status of Banks
30.       During the years 1970-74 inclusive, the commercial banks operated
at a profit, but NDB has suffered losses in each of these five years and the
Bank of America also had losses in 1973. Details are given in Table 9.

AGRICUTRAL CREDIT PROJECT
Performance Under Previous Agricultural Projects
First Livestock Development Project (Credit 179-HO)
1.        Credit 179-HO (US$2.6 million) was the first credit made by the
Bank group to Honduras in the agricultural sector to provide long-term
loans to ranchers on terms and conditions appropriate for ranch development.
The participating banks (PBs) made sizeable contributions to the Project in
the form of capital for on-ranch investments and operating capital and also
provided technical and administrative services. Operations were country-wide
but concentrated in the Atlantic Coast. The Project became effective in
October,1970.
2.        The Borrower was the Republic of Honduras and the program was
carried out by the Central Bank (CB), which channeled funds to ranchers
through six participating commercial banks. CB established a Livestock
Project Account to administer and disburse the proceeds of the Credit
Project operations which were conducted under the direction and supervision
of a Project Commission and a Project Director (PD), appointed with IDA
approval. Technical staff from the PBs were seconded to work under the
Project Director. Subloans to ranchers under the Project lending program
were made by PBs only after the PD had approved the respective ranch devel-
opment plans.
3.        The objective of the Project was to assist Honduras in pursuing
its national agriculture policy for raising the country's low level of
beef consumption (3.7 kg per capita in 1967) and help to diversify its
agriculture. To accomplish this, the Project aimed to develop about 135
beef ranches and dairy farms, which would increase national livestock
production by about 15%.
4.        The Project had a significant impact on livestock production,
but it is difficult to determine precisely how much credit can go to the
Project exclusively. Herd expansion, greater milk production, higher
per capita beef consumption, and increased exports were also influenced
by such factors as changes in purchasing power, price policies, and
liberalization of US beef import quotas (most of the beef is exported to the
US). The following table shows the increases recorded over the past five
years.

78 subloans were actually made, representing only about 58% of the
participation expected. However, the total area and the number of cattle
involved under the Project were greater than planned at appraisal. On the
other hand, the number of hectares put into new pasture was only 50% of that
expected, which indicates that the 78 ranches financed by the Project were
exploited in a more extensive way than was planned at appraisal. A survey
of 23 ranches, or 30% of the Project population, showed that average yearly
beef production per farm increased 100%, compared with production before the
Project, and milk was about 43% higher, as shown in the table below:

Apart from the generalized data shown above, it is difficult to draw
inferences on the results of the First Livestock Project.
Second Livestock Development Project (Credit 434-HO)
6.        This Project, for a total value of US$11 million, was financed
by an IDA Credit of US$6.6 million and supports an extension of the First
Project and part of the borrower's program for livestock development. It
consists of credit for livestock farmers, the rebuilding or upgrading of
municipal slaughterhouses and provision of technical services and training.
The Project is administered by the Central Bank and executed by a Project
Unit. Funds are channeled through participating banks who employ techni-
cians for farm planning.
7.        The Project, was successfully initiated in January 1974, but slowed
down in 1975 due to uncertainties over the application and implications of the
Agrarian Reform Law. These uncertainties have now largely been removed.
8.        The IDA Credit was 61% committed as of March 31, 1976.  Details are
shown below:

In addition to the above project activity, IDA, on March 10, 1976 approved
the use of US$1 million of the uncommitted balance for the emergency finan-
cing of 2000 ha of banana lands now settled by agrarian reform beneficiaries.
Once the Amending Agreement to the Livestock Development Credit Agreement is
ratified by the Borrower, commitment will rise to 75% of the Credit funds.
The CB is at the point of reaching agreement with the Municipality of
Tegucigalpa for the construction of a new abattoir at a cost of from
US$600,000 to US$750,000. Overall there are prospects of an 85% commitment
by June 30, 1976 and full commitment by the end of September 1976.

12.       At 1975 prices, average subloan size was about US$25,600 as compared
with appraisal estimates of about US$20,500.  Although the average subloan
sizes are adjusted by the general inflation rate as measured by the consumer
index, the actual inflation of on-farm investments was considerably higher
from appraisal to 1975. The major discrepancy is to be found in the failure
to commit the US$500,000 allocated under the credit to small farmers under
Category I of the Project. However, even if these funds were totally commit-
ted for small farmers, their weighted influence would not reduce the size of
actual subloans to any great extent.
13.       As the first subloans were made only about 18 months ago, it is
too soon to make a valid estimate of results obtained from the execution
of farm plans and the provision of technical assistance, but there is no
reason to expect less from the Second Project than the First, provided
sufficient financial incentives exist.

HONDURAS
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Livestock Models
1.        In Honduras, the production of beef and milk from dual-purpose
herds is normal. Calves are separated from the mothers overnight and cows
are milked each morning only. Depending on the distance of the farm from
population centers, milk is either sold fresh or made into butter or cheese.
Calves are sold at about nine months of age -- surplus heifers for breeding
and the males for fattening or slaughter.
2.        Government livestock policy, which for the present is ill-defined,
has aimed at:
(a) disease control - concentrating on brucellosis and T.B.;
(b) gradual grading-up of native cattle through the use of
better quality bulls; and
(c) improvement of nutrition levels through improved pastures and
the use of crop residues and improvement of management
standards.
3.        As standards of management improve and infrastructure develops,
it can be expected that there will be a re-structuring of the industry
into specialized beef cattle breeding, beef cattle fattening, and dairying.
As the demand for agricultural land for cropping increases, particularly
under the pressure of agrarian reform, there will be geographic shifts--
cattle breeding will be pushed out to the drier and/or hilly, more remote
areas; cattle fattening will be integrated with cropping; and dairying for
fresh milk will tend to be concentrated on the fringes of the main popu-
lation centers.
4.        Under the Project, funds would be available for any beef produc-
tion and/or dairying sub-project that is economically sound, with the em-
phasis, where possible, placed on cooperative enterprises. Individual lend-
ing programs, particularly to large cooperatives, could involve funding a
variety of integrated crop and livestock enterprises.
5.        From a range of possible cattle enterprises, two are presented;
(a) Dairy/Beef Farm (Tables 1 to 4)



ANNEX 4
Page 2
This model represents the first steps towards increasing
productivity and profit per hectare by the use of improved
pastures and subdivisions. The enterprise would be conducted
on land not generally suited to agriculture, with no irri-
gation potential, but with opportunity for pasture improvement.
Cows would be milked once a day. All milk would be sold fresh,
with none retained for cheese or butter manufacture. Surplus
calves would be sold at about nine months of age - heifers as
potential breeders and steers (or bull calves) at about 115 to
125 kg liveweight, either for slaughter or fattening. The
model provides sub-loan funds of US$15,570 to be used for pasture
improvement and renovation, fencing, provision of stock water
supplies and livestock purchases. These funds, together with
of US$1,000 of working capital in the second year, would make it
possible to raise the carrying capacity from 0.65 to 2.00 AU/ha,
and would lift the operating net income per hectare from L 377
to L 2,872 within five years, assuming a grace period of five
years. The estimated internal financial return is 15%.
(b) Beef Fattening Unit (Tables 5 to 7)
6.        Under the Project, cattle fattening would tend to be associated
with cropping enterprises. In the Atlantic zone crops are likely to be
rice, bananas or sugarcane and in the Pacific zone, maize and sorghum.
In the model, the fattening program would center on grazing unfertilized
improved or renovated pastures with supplementary feeding of cattle with
minerals, urea and molasses during the dry season and minerals and molasses
during the wet season. Crop residues would be used as available.
7.        Long-term subloan funds of US$6,350 are provided, mainly for
pasture improvement and renovation, fencing, and for the provision of
stock water supplies. This would enable the net operating income per
hectare to rise from L 353 to L 1,463 within four years, assuming a
three-year capital grace period. The estimated internal financial return
would be 20%.

HONDURAS
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Crop Models
Banana Farm, 40 ha 1/
1.        It is proposed to develop about of 20 banana farm units, of 40 ha
each which would be oriented towards local cooperatives, already established
in the Atlantic zone. Some of these farms have a certain infrastructure,
especially irrigation and roads. Productivity from these farms is at present
limited by low plant population per ha, inadequate fertilization, irrigation,
prevention of diseases and control of insects. The Project would finance re-
planting, for optimum population; equipment for irrigation; fertilizers,
disease and weed control. Technicians from the Project Unit, CORBANA, NDB,
and from private banks would provide technical assistance to farmers. Short-
term credit would be provided by participating banks to cover working capital
needs for operation expenses.
2.        Average banana production per ha at full development would be
2,125 boxes (18.2 kg/box), or 38,675 kg/ha. Twenty-two percent of this would
be second class bananas which would be used as feed for livestock and swine.
3.        Production per farm would stabilize in the fourth year, reaching
a maximum of 92,000 boxes per farm. The product will be marketed according to
policies established by the National Banana Corporation, with the cooperation
of the international fruit companies that traditionally market the fruit.
4.        The average investment would be US$48,000 of which the producer would
finance 10%. Production and costs were derived by averaging those from the
Standard Fruit Company, La Ceiba, Empresas Asociadas-Colon, Bananeras Indepen-
dientes - San Pedro Sula and Cooperatives.
5.        The subloan period will be seven years which includes two years grace.
The internal financial return was estimated at 24%. (Tables 1, 2 and 3).
1/   Bases for banana yield assumptions:  Among Latin America countries
Honduras, has the highest technology for banana production. Skilled
technicians give assistance to private independent banana producers.
Average yields per ha in 10 United Brands' banana farms in Honduras
(18,557 ha) from 1965 to 1974 were 47.0 m tons/ha. Honduras, national
average banana yields from 21,200 ha ave 33.3 m tons/ha (including
farmers with no technical assistance-credit). Guatemala has average
banana yields from 4,300 ha of 39.9 m tons/ha, including farmers with
no technical assistance or credit. Costa Rica has a national average
yield from 18,400 ha, of 45.0 m tons/ha including farmers with no
technical assistance-credit. Central America has an average banana
yield (43,900 ha) 39.1 m tons/ha.

Irrigated Rice Farm, 50 ha 1/
6.        The objective in this type of lending would be to increase production
for the domestic market. This would be accomplished by cropping twice a year,
applying new technology through technical assistance to farmers and enlarging
the area under rice. Mechanization is proposed for better land preparation,
seeding, hauling and drying paddy rice. Machinery would be used in place of
hand labor and use of animals, because the need for preparing land under
proper weather conditions, and immediately after harvesting to ensure double
cropping. Mechanical drying would allow grain conditioning through the year.
Costs and the labor constraints of cropping twice a year would dictate direct
seeding rather than the traditional transplanting method.
7.        The Project considers the establishment of about 20 production
units of 50 ha each, or a total of 1,000 ha. These farms would be developed
in the Pacific and Atlantic zones where conditions in these areas are
favorable to the crop.
8.        The average investment would be US$67,500.  Long-term loans will
have a nine-year amortization period, including a three-year grace period.
Short-term credit would be provided by PBs to cover working capital needs.
Financing would be preferentially for cooperatives of small farmers.
9.        These farms would stabilize at their maximum production in the
fourth year with a production of 477.3 m tons per year (two cycles). In
total the 20 farms woulds produce annually approximately 10,000 m tons of
paddy rice - 5,000 m tons of milled rice. The estimated financial rate of
return is 21% (Tables 4, 5 and 6).
May 4, 1976
1/   Bases for rice yields assumptions:  Honduras, national average rice yields
(25,000 ha) 1.4 m tons/ha, without technical assistance. Farmers with
technical assistance get yields of 5 m tons/ha (per crop). In Nicaragua,
national average rice yields (32,000 ha) are 3 m tons/ha, per crop without
technical assistance. In El Salvador, national average rice yields
(10,700 ha) are 3.5 m tons/ha, per crop without technical assistance.
CIAT figures in its "Proposals for Increasing Rice Production In the
Humid Tropics of the Americas" P. Jennings, 1975, assumes a "minimum
yield of 3.5 m tons/ha per crop (25% moisture content)". The Chinese
mission (in Honduras) Report (September 20, 1975) estimates average rice
yields 5.0 m tons/ha per crop for small farmers with technical assistance.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Banana Plantation Rehabilitation (Isleta)
1.        In view of the importance of commercial banana production to the
economy, financing would be made available to rehabilitate 2,000 ha of hur-
ricane-damaged bananas - mainly for export, over two to three years, accord-
ing to a final plan to be approved by IDA. Total costs for investment, reha-
bilitation and technical services was estimated to be about US$2.3 million
of which about US$1.5 million was for investment in and rehabilitation of
damage to the plantation and its installations caused by Hurricane Fifi
(Tables 1 to 4). Technical services required were estimated to be about
US$800,000 (Annex 7, Table 3). Working capital of about US$1.2 million would
be supplied by the National Development Bank for three years, including a
grace period of one year. The medium-term investment loan would be 100%
financed by IDA and on terms for up to seven years, including a grace period
of two years. The internal financial return is estimated to be about 18%.
2.        Financing of the Isleta sub-project is as follows:

The financing of US$1.0 million from the proceeds of the Second Livestock Project
(434-HO) was approved by the Executive Directors on March 10, 1976.
3.        Model data were derived from pre-feasibility studies (November 1975)
developed by banana production experts from Standard Fruit Company, the NDB and
INA and are based on conservative cost and yield estimates. COHBANA, which is
supplying technical support to Isleta has already contracted the services of
specialists in commercial production, pest control, irrigation and marketing who
are working on the plantation.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agro-Industry and Machinery
Rice Mills
1.        There are 16 rice mills in Honduras, providing total milling
capacity of about 76 m tons of paddy rice per day, or 15,200 m tons paddy
per year. Considering Government plans for increased national production and
the additional production of the 20 rice farms to be financed under the pro-
posed Project, this capacity will not be sufficient from 1976 onwards.
2.        The Project would therefore finance the installation of two rice
mills, one in the Pacific zone and the other in the Atlantic zone. Each
would reach full capacity in the fifth year of operation (3,200 m tons of
paddy rice each), thus increasing total national capacity to 21,600 m tons
per year. Mill location would be such that the irrigated rice farms financed
by the Project would be served. The mills would begin operation during the
second or third year of the overall Project.
3.        The plants would operate on a year-round basis, as Project farms
would supply paddy rice fairly regularly, thus avoiding stoppages and lay-off
periods and reducing the need for large storage facilities. Such enterprises
would be suitable for small farmer cooperatives engaged in rice production
since they would thus add stability to production activities. An average
investment per mill would be US$80,000. Long-term loans would finance 80%
of that investment, with a three-year grace period and a total of nine years
for amortization. The internal financial return is about 27% (Tables 1 through
3).
Other Agro-industries
4.        Many areas have unrealized potential for dairying because the road
system is such that rapid transport of fresh milk to the few large milk
processing plants is impossible. This situation could be offset in part by
building relatively small milk processing plants for cheese and butter
manufacture. The total investment cost of a plant with a daily capacity of
5,000 liters would be about US$137,500. Internal financial return would be
about 25%.
5.        There is potential also for developing modern piggeries based on
feeding reject bananas as the main energy source. At least two piggeries
of this type are already in operation. A guaranteed supply of about 20,000
pigs a year would support a commercial sausage and ham manufacturing plant.
The capital investment for such a plant would be about US$140,000 and it would



ANNEX 7
Page 2
have a net annual operating income of about US$90,000. Other industries
could also be financed if studies proved them to be profitable ventures.
Well Drilling Equipment
6.        Water for agricultural purposes is obtained mainly from rainfall
and in recent years, Honduras has suffered periodic droughts that have
had a severe impact on the economic development of the country. For this
reason, the provision of water is vital. There are now only nine well
drilling rigs in Honduras, four of which are located in Tegucigalpa and
three in San Pedro Sula. This means that farmers in Honduras may count
on the services of only two well drilling rigs. Loans for drilling
equipment would help meet the water needs of farmers as well as provide
for general home requirements.
7.        Drilling would be financed primarily as a supporting service to
the livestock and agricultural farms developed within the Project. Contrac-
tors receiving financing for drilling equipment would be approved by the
Project Credit Unit.   A headquarters for the equipment should be located in
both the northern and southern zones, and the area served should be large.
8.        Average investment cost per rig is US$220,000, and it is proposed
to finance two such units. Some 80% of cost would be financed through
seven-year long-term loans. Working capital would be supplied during the
first year by the participating bank. The internal financial return would
be about 25%.
Heavy Farm Equipment
9.        In Honduras, there is only one organized enterprise that rents
tractors to farmers and its business is mainly with those clearing land for
sugarcane. Since many farmers to be financed under the Project would need
heavy equipment to increase the areas they wish to put into production, the
provision of such equipment would be vital. Heavy equipment should be
concentrated in irrigated areas since farmers cropping only once a year
cannot generally afford the cost of renting heavy farm equipment to clear
land. For a smooth and profitable operation, the managers of the units
would need to be experienced in maintenance, repairs and handling of the
equipment and in keeping stocks of spare parts. Contractors requesting
financing for heavy farm equipment would be selected for their experience.
10.       Two units would be financed, each comprising one D-6 or equivalent;
one-disc plow and one two-ton double transmission pick-up truck plus mis-
cellaneous spares. These units would be placed in the Pacific and Atlantic



ANNEX 7
Page 3
zones where most of the crop and livestock sub-borrowers would be located.
The average investment per unit would be US$110,000. About 80% would be
financed through a long-term loan payable in eight years. Short-term
loans for working capital would be financed the first year. Estimated
internal financial return is about 25%.

HONDURAS
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Technical Assistance
1.        The productivity of many Honduran farms is low and often barely at
subsistence levels, both in the case of individually owned farms and campesino
cooperatives. One of the biggest obstacles to improving this situation is the
inadequacy of the available technical services - both research and exten-
sion -- and the lack of certified seed. There is an acute shortage of well
trained technicians, and the present research and extension programs are
inadequate and badly organized. Although this Project is not primarily
concerned with institution building, 32% of the funds ($6.4 million) would
go for technical assistance, aimed primarily at helping institutions in fields
that are directly concerned with the various components of the lending pro-
gram. The costs and benefits to this Project are high, but the proposed
input would also have future benefits to the sector which would extend beyond
the life of the Project.
Project Credit Unit of Central Bank (Table 1)
2.        This Unit has been responsible for the overall technical supervision
of the First and Second Livestock Projects and would continue to function
similarly for the proposed project. Project headquarters would remain at
Tegucigalpa, but two new offices would be opened to handle the increased volume
of lending. An agricultural economist and an agronomist would be recruited
for the headquarters at Tegucigalpa. This staff would have responsibilities
for supervision of the ongoing projects; implementation of the proposed proj-
ect; project audit and future project preparation. Additional staff would be
recruited, and new offices opened at the recommendation of the Project Director
and with the approval of the Project Commission.
3.        The cost of the Unit is estimated at US$1.2 million, of which
US$1 million would be supplied by the Central Bank. The technicians employed
by the participating banks to assist farmers in the preparation and implemen-
tation of development plans answer administratively to such banks, although
they work under the technical supervision of the Project Credit Unit. As in
previous projects, a Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be signed between the CB
and the PBs describing the relationships between, and responsibilities of,
these organizations. Under the proposed Project, the National Development
Bank would increase its technical staff by 10 to a total of 15 and the other
PBs collectively by four to a total of 12. This staff would be financed by
the interest margin between on-lending at 11% and the rediscount rate of
6%, less the CB obligation of 2% to the Borrower.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN)(Table 2)
4.        The Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN), which is responsible for
agricultural research and extension within Honduras, will be strengthened by
the appointment of the following experts, each for a period of five years:
(a) A rice researcher (stationed at Choluteca, Pacific zone);
(b) An annual oil crops research (stationed at Guaymas, Atlantic zone);
(c) Two production extensionists (one in the Atlantic
zone and the other in the Pacific zone); and
(d) One seed production and certification specialist (stationed
at Choluteca).
5.        These experts would be recruited through an international research
and training institution to be agreed upon with IDA. The terms of reference
for this institution, which would be under contract to CB, would be subject
to IDA's approval as would selection of experts. Each expert would have two
counterparts who would receive one year of training at an appropriate inter-
national research and training center, in addition to local training.
6.        MRN technical staff has had a high turnover rate due to the low
salaries paid. Therefore, since it is highly desirable that the MRN retain
the services of the counterparts allotted to each expert, funds would be pro-
vided under the Project to supplement their regular MRN salaries. The MRN
would pay an increasing proportion of this supplement each year until it
was paying 100% by the beginning of year 5. Costs for experts and budget
support are estimated to be US$1.6 million.
Isleta Project (Table 3)
7.        The productivity of the Isleta banana plantation is low due to the
destruction of certain vital engineering works by Hurricane Fifi; a lack of
technical and managerial knowledge on the part of the new owners; and by budget-
ary deficiencies. The following experts would, therefore, be recruited, each
for a period of five years, to assist with rehabilitation works:
(a) a Project Manager,
(b) a banana production specialist,
(c) a banana sanitation specialist, and
(d) an irrigation and flood control specialist.
8.        These experts would be recruited by the CB and seconded to COHBANA
to work on the Isleta project. Terms of reference and contracts for the
experts would be approved by IDA. The Project Manager would be responsible



ANNEX 8
Page 3
for the overall technical coordination of the project and marketing, but not
for the profitability and achievement of social goals of the Project. Costs
are estimated to be about US$770,000 over a five-year period.
Agrarian Reform Institute - INA (Table 4)
9.        The Project proposes to strengthen INA so that it can help to
continue the agrarian reform movement and meet Project objectives in forming
campesinos groups, carry out studies for the settlement of new areas, and
provide access to new areas and training for campesinos. To do this,
about US$1.9 million is provided in the Project. All purchases of equip-
ment would be subject to approval by CB and all contracts for specialist
and consulting firm studies would be let with the approval of CB and IDA.
Studies
10.       The amount allocated for "studies" is US$400,000. It is of interest
to IDA that studies carried out under the Project lead to the preparation of
specific rural development/credit projects that would be eligible for future
Bank/IDA assistance. So far IDA has received requests for assistance to
conduct studies and project preparation as follows:
(a) Choluteca irrigation - 18,500 ha;
(b) Integrated development of Nacaome;
(c) Aquifers of Alianza;
(d) Rural develoment of Comayagua - 7,000 ha; and
(e) Integrated development of the Aguan Valley,
Guaymas, La Masica and Rio Guineo.
Pan-American Agricultural School (Table 5)
11.       The Pan-American Agricultural School at Zamorano, Honduras, has
trained approximately 1,500 students representing most of the countries
in Latin America since 1946. The school forms a significant part of the
entire region's tertiary education system in agriculture and is unique in
that:
(a) It is apolitical;
(b) It is internationally funded; and
(c) It has maintained consistently high standards of teaching
and its facilities are excellent.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
12.       Some US$0.5 million would be provided in the proposed Project to
supplement the regular undergraduate courses and to further develop short-
course work. Funds would be provided mainly for temporary staff salaries,
equipment and construction. The short-course work would be aimed at a wide
cross-section of those involved directly or indirectly in agricultural pro-
duction, marketing and agro-industries, e.g., individual farmers, campesino
leaders, Government extension officers, and bankers. The short courses
would range from general ones in agricultural production, marketing and
agro-industries to specific technical courses in these fields.

ANNEX 12

HONDURAS
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return of the project was calculated on the
basis of the models and tables shown in Annexes 4 to 8. Key assumptions
and adjustments were as follows:
(a) Investment and operating costs were calculated in November
1975 lempiras. Relative costs and prices were assumed to
remain unchanged, i.e., any changes in rates of inflation,
either external or internal, would be self-compensating.
(b) Output prices utilized are farmgate prices. Incremental
beef and banana production would be for export and produc-
tions of milk and rice would supply the expanding domestic
market.
(i)  For bananas and beef, two of the main export crops
of Honduras, world prices were utilized following
the projections of the Bank's Economic Analysis and
Projections Department (EAPD). CIF prices were
corrected to FOB and farmgate or first point of
sale prices. Since the US is the main market for
Honduras' beef, prices used reflect the US, rather
than the London market, as indicated in the EAPD
projections. In the determination of future price
trends, it was assumed that world prices would
prevail.
(ii)  For milk and rice, internal prices were utilized.
Milk is in short supply and Honduras has been import-
ing it on a regular basis. Project output would
partially replace milk imports and produce savings of
foreign exchange; however, internal prices were util-
ized since they were found to be equal to the imported
milk prices and also because of difficulties in adjust-
ing international prices to subsidies on the world
market. Rice is currently being imported but this is
considered to be a temporary situation resulting from
the decrease in production caused by the hurricane in
1974 and the drought in the first semester of 1975.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(c) A project life of 20 years was used in the economic analysis
for all the components, with the exception of the rice mills,
where a 10-year period was considered more appropriate.
(d) In the dairy/beef model, incremental herd values were
credited to the benefits at the end of the life of the
project.
(e) Administrative and training costs related to the CB's Project
Unit (Annex 8, Table 1) were charged to the total project
cost.
(f) The cost of technical assistance to Isleta (Annex 8, Table 3)
was charged as an operational cost to the Isleta component
since it was assumed that such assistance would have to be
continued on a regular basis after the initial five-year
period financed under the project.
(g) No shadow rate of exchange was utilized since the general
Government economic and foreign trade policy, open economy,
very low tariffs, absence of subsidies, and quantitative
export controls are expected to continue into the future.
(h)  Financial wages paid to unskilled labor have been taken to be
equal to the shadow wage rate of labor as the best estimate.
The information available indicates that there is a real
shortage of labor during harvest months, creating upward
wage pressures at the farm level (Annex 1, para 9). Since
taxes and tariffs are transfer payments, the benefits and
costs were adjusted to compensate for them.
2.        The economic rates of return for individual models and for the
total project, together with the sensitivity analysis, are shown below:
