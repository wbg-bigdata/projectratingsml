MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNMATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IWA TO THE EXECUTIE DIRtECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR AN RGENCY DROUGHT RECOVERY AND MITIGATION PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed credit to the Republic of Zimbabwe for SDR 109.5 million, the equivalent of US$150
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance an Emergency
Drought Recovery and Mitigation Project.
2.           Zimbabwe and the zest of Southern Africa are currently suffering from their most
severe drought in this century. The drought comes after a decade of below-average rainfall,
rendering the population and the economy particularly susceptible to its devastation. Overall
agriculural production is expected to be at least 35 percent below normal in 1992. Reliable and
independent sources currently esdmate that this year's harvest of maize - the country's most
important staple food crop - will be less than a quarter of normal leve's. The sugar harvest has
been similarly affected. The cotton harvest (with implications as a source of inputs for both
textiles and vegetable oil) is anticipated to be less than half of its normal size.
3.           Because of the drought, Zimbabwe will face a food shortage of unprecedented
magnitude between the pnmary harvest of April 1992 through the secondary harvest of August
1993. The government estmates the total food shortfall to be 2.7 million tons. However,
logical and budgetary constraints may prevent Zimbabwe from Importing its full food
requirement Therefore, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization projects total food imports
of 2.3 millon tons, which will result in food imports costing approximately US$464 million in
1992 and US$253 million in 1993, inclusive of extrnal transportation.
4.           Even in the midst of its relief efforts, Zimbabwe must begin the arduous task of
recovery In agriculture and water supply. The most far-reaching implication of the drought is
its devastation of she agricultural sector. Most critically, smallholder farmers will not be able
to pln for 1993 without assistance. A lack of feedstock and water will have killed many of their
draft animals and wiUl have rendered the remainder too weak to plow. A large share of the seed
for plandng has been destroyed in the drought. Available quantities of fertilizers, crop chemicals,
and spare parts, esseal for both communal and commercW farmers, will be inadequate due to
an acute shortage of foreign exchange. In order to prevent future years of massive food deficits,
the agricultural sector must quicldy be restored to its former strength. Moreover, agriculture
must remain viable for communal farmers to prevent massive inal migration.
5.           Access to safe water-already poor in some areas - has declined in both rural
and urban areas as a result of the drought. The government has identified approximately 40
percent of the country's 16,000 rural water sources as dry or nonfunctioning, and plans to repair,
rehabilitate, or deepen them. In addition, the government plans to finance a localized water
drilling program in the most underserved areas, exploiting both privatc and public resources.
Many urban water supplies are similarly in a precarious state. At the start of the drought, the
countWs reservoirs held only an estimated 20 percent of their aggregate capacity. As a result,
the reservoirs that serve many of the cities are now nearly dry.
1



6.           The drought also aries with it numex.   undesirable secondary effects.
Rationing of electicity, caused by limited hydro-electric capa.ity, has reduced the output of
manufactring and mining firms. Much of agro-induatry has suspended operations, with
implications for urban unemployment. HIoarding, theft, and illegal exportation of food have
reportedly stripped many markets of grain and other foodstuffs. High unofficial food prices have
eroded the purchasing power of consumers and exhausted their limited savings. Shortages of
food a d water appear to have already sparked sporadic, angry protests from hungry consumers.
7.           Past experience has demonstrated that a drought will likely accelerate the secular
migration from rural to urban areas, as the rural population abandons its farmn to search for
urban employment, food, and water. Although its magnitude has not yet been determined, a
moderate migration appears to have commenced among smallholder farmers. Zimbabwean cities
already suffer from overburdened urban infrastructure - particularly in housing, water,
sanitation, and transportation. Water supply rehabilitation and increased distribution of food
relief are both needed in rural areas to prevent the social dislxcations that would result from mass
migrations. In addition, resources must be found to accommodate the additional strain of
incremental in-migration on Zimbabwe's towns and cities, which will experience problems of
homelessness, health 'azards, and transportation failures.
8.           The logistical considerations regardig port and rail ransportation present an
additional risk to the relief and recovery efforts. In theory, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
Mozambique can deploy sufficient port, rail, and trucking assets to service regional drought-
related freight needs. However, these assets will have to be employed with a degree of efficiency
and coordination never before achieved.
9.           The drought comes at a time of major economic transformation in Zimbabwe, and
has the potential to derail these reforms. In early 1991, the country embarked forcefilly on a
medium-term program of structr adjusment aimed at acceleratng economic growth, increasing
per capita income, and generating additional employment for a rapidly growing labor force. The
government accelerated its program of deficit reduction and tightened monetary policy. Direct
subsidies to parastatals were reduced and a program of civil service reform started. The
government accelerated the real exchange rate depreciation, partially liberalized the foreign
exchange system, and increased minimm tariffs. It pardally decontroUed most prices, the
trading of maize, and the transport system, and began the deregulation of small business,
liberalized labor law, and simplified investment approval procedures. It also created a Social
Development Fund to provide financial assistance to the poor. The government remains fully
commited to its program of structural adjustment, although certain targets need modification in
light of the severe negative impact of the drought on the national budget and the country's
external accounts. The Government's implementation of the adjustment program was commended
at the Consultative Group meeting in February 1992. These new targets and other details of the
next few years of the program are being worked out by the Government, the World Bank and
the IMF in the context of a PFP to support the Government's ESAF program with the IMP.
10.          The overaU economic impact of the drought is reflected in a large fal in GDP
and in large increases in the balance of payments deficit, government expenditure on relief
progms, and inflation. Real GDP is now projected to decline by about 9 percent in 1992 (with
agricultural production falling by 35 percent), before rising by 6 perceut in 1993. GDP will not
exceed its 1991 level until 1994. Shortages of basic foodstuffs (including maize, sugar, bread,
vegetable oil, and dairy products) and the high cost of importing have caused inflation to coniue
to accelerate in recent months, reaching 30 percent in the 12-month period ending February 1992.
2



Such inflationary pressures are expected to continue for the first half of 1992 and will severely
strain household budgets, particularly for low-income groups.
11.         TIe governmet has demonstraed prudent fiscal management, cutting its non-
drought expenditures below their expected level. Nevertheless, the overall budget deficit for
1991/92 is now expected to reach about 9 percent of GDP, which exceeds moderately the 8.3
percent cefling given in the Memorandum of the President for the Structural Adjustment Program
(December 1991). The government's Drought Relief and Recovery Programme will necessarily
carry over into the 1992/93 budget, rendering unreasonable the government's previous fiscal
deficit target of less than 6 percent of GDP. The government is attempting to minimize the
overall deficit with additional savings elsewhere and, if necessary, some additional revenue
measures. Ihese efforts will be detailed in the forthcoming Policy Framework Paper.
12.          Drought-induced imports, coupled with a loss of expected exports, are projected
to increase the current account deficit for 1992 to US$958 million (nearly 20 percent of GDP).
This is far higher than the US$590 million estimated at the start of 992 and creates an urgent
need for additional external financing. The reduction in expc-s and the drought-induced increase
in food imports will also spill over into 1993, causing the current account deficit to be US$717
million, or 13 percent of GDP. This external imbalance can only be returned to reasonable
magnitudes in 1994 and 1995.
13.          To date, the following sources have committed themselves to helping Zimbabwe
meet its additional, 1992 drought-related financing needs of US$400 million:l/ US$80 million
of disbursements from the (US$150 million) IDA Drought Recovery and Mitigation Credit;
US$17 million of accelerated disbursements on existing IBRD loans; and US$80 million of
additional MP ESAP resources. Tentative indications are thatthe remaining gap will be financed
by bilateral grants, concessional loans, and commercial borrowing, the composition of which will
ensure the sustainability of the resulting external payments position. The precise composition of
this finacing is sil evolving on the basis of international donor appeals.
Credit Objetive
14.          The Association's main objective in proposing this Credit is to provide the
Government of Zimbabwe with timely financial resources in support of its drought relief and
recovery program. This program will alleviate human suffering, both at present and in the
future, by restoFing and enhancing Zimbabwe's productive capacity. It wil do so by providing
agricultural iputs that are essental for the next plantng season, rehabilitating the water supply
system, providing for critical inputs for the transport of goods needed for relief and recovery,
and upgrading the public works programs through which drought relief is distributed. The
program is designed to give special consideration to the recovery needs of agricultural
smaiolders.
15.          The proposed IDA Credit would also help narrow the balance of payments gap
that wfll result from incremental imports and the collapse of food exports. ITis would lesen the
rsk that this naural disaster might derail the government's broad-based economic structural
adjustment program. Finally, the emergency Credit would assure the strengthening of short- and
tIhis figure implies a US$273 million compression of other (non-drought-related) imports.
3



log- term instittional capacity in agricuture, water, and public works, to reduce the country's
wlnerability to fitu  exeral risks and to increase food security. It does so because it requires
the gvwernmt to include a set of essental studies and technical assistance, for which bilateral
assist."ce has been arnged.
nuaLD QmEr onf nmet Prom
16.          The Governnt of Zimbabwe has responded to the crisis by declaring it a
"national disaster" and convenmg a high-level National Civil Protwcon Coordination Committee,
chaired by the Vice President. The govenmment has designed a comprehensive, US$1075 million
Drought Relief and Recovery Program for which it is seeling exten  financing.  The
government's Letter of Emergency Drought Policy (imcluded in the Technical Annex) descrbes
In deta the components of this program  ibis Letter constitutes the government's commitment
to a particular course of action in is response to the drought emergency, and forms the basis on
which the Assosiation would extend the proposed Credit.
17.         The largest component of the government's Progr   is the purcase of
2.7 mfllion tons of foodstf over the period of April 1992 through August 1993, amounng to
approximately US$454 milion.  The government's program also inludes five non-food
components, which respond to the remainder of Zimbabwe's most critical dro-ght-related needs:
(1) a US$263 million program of agricultura recovery, consisting of (a) fiancing tillage services
and the private rector distiWn of seed and crop chemicals to half of the most-affected
smallholder frws, and (b) a herd of small livestock for eligible farmers who do not require or
receive tilage srvices; (,) foreign exchange requirements fcr other agricultura consumables,
vehicles, equipment, and spares; (2) US$217 million for drought-related railway and truck
transportaion needs; (3) a US$58 million program of emergency water supply rehabilitation and
private sector water drilling; (4) US$31 million for the expanded programs of Food-for-Work,
public works, and Child Supplemental Feeding; and (5) an US$2.4 million program of additional
iosional strengthening, aimed at improving both Zimbabwe's short-term capacity to manage
the current disaster and the county's longer-tem capacity to avoid and respond to future
potentW crises.
18.         Table 1 in Schedule A summaizes the sectoral distibution of the govermment's
non-food program and its financing. The proposed Credit is equivalent to 14 percent of the total
government drought relief and recovery program (this is also equivalent to 26 percent of the
foreign excnge re iremet of the program and 58 percent of foreign exchange requirement
for the non-food program components).
19.          Fsandg from the Existing IBRD Portfolio. Additional financing is expected
to be provided by a reallocation of up to US$37 million from the existing IBRD portfolio. As
much as US$25 million of uncommitted funds from the Urban II Project can be made
immditely available to urban councils to respond to emergency water supply shortages and any
acceleration of population influx. Uncommitted funds in the Railways II Project will be
reallocated, so that up to US$5 million might be disbursed for the purchase of required
locomotive spares. Up to US$4 million of unallocated funds and US$3 million of uncommitted
funds within the Agriculural Credit and Export Promotion Project will be available to finance
private sector procurement of tractors, farm equipment, and spares.
4



20.          E     nl lndng. The Credit would also gavanize further support from
among the donor community. Ihe World Bank Group and otLer donors have coordinated closely
to mount a concerted relief and recovery response. Bilateral donors have tntatively pledged
US$60 million in grant asistnce to finan food relief imports. In addition, in parallel with the
Assocaton's Credit, approximately US$7 mfllion will support segments of the NAC's rural water
plan, and US$5 mfllion will finance measures aimed at strengthening the country's short-term
capacity to manage th curnt disaster and its longer-term capacity to avoid and respond to fAtre
potenti cses. The Government of Norway has agreed to provide cofinaing of the equivalent
of US$1 miion In support of three of these measures for nstiutonal strengthening. Efforts to
secure further concessional extnal finance are ongoing, with the Bank taking a leading role.
The Bank Group will contue to work with the government, the IMP, and donors to closely
monitor Zimbabwe's essential drought- and development- related import requirements, and to
encourage any adjustment measures that will minimize the country's need to fmance these imports
extenally.
Lessns Leaned from Peviou Bank Grou Ivlveen
21.          Desigp  of this operation has been based on experience with other drought
recovery and emergency operations. Five main lessons have been incorporated into Zimbabwe's
program: (1) that the most effective resuts are achieved when consideration is given to short-term
targets with modest objectives; (2) that high-level and broad-based government commiten to
the recovery program is essential; (3) that the World Bank Group's emergency response should
be part of a comprensive national response; (4) that assistance will be required with
implementation and to mitigate e effects of fiture crises; and (5) that the Bank Group lending
instrment should afford the govenment flexibility in responding to the crisi.
22.         In designing this Credit, the Association was cogizant that disbursement has been
a bottleneck in previous emergency operations. The inherently fluid nature of both emergency
oprations and of donor cofinancing for such operations renders it difficult and unreliable to
deflne a fixed Bank Group project. For this reason, it was determined Omathe Credit should be
in the form of a quick-disbursing leding isumnt, financing a positive list of agreed imported
goods. In addition, the government will engage a procurement specalist, contingent on donor
financing, to ensure that procurement is timely and that procedures conform to IDA standards.
23.          Although the proposed Credit is the World Bank Group's first drought recovery
operation in Zimbabwe, it draws on generd operationa; experience in the sectors imvolved, to
keep the governments program m line with other Bank Group activities and within the
implemenation caacity of -isonal instions. For instance, the agriculture component relies
on institutional strengths that have been learned and developed through years of dialogue between
the sector and the Bank. Similarly, the rural water component is generally syncronized with the
objectives of the Bank's Yellow Cover rural water sector report.
Rationale for Banlc Crupmvlvm
24.          The foremost reason for Bank Group involvement is the need to support recovery
and the alleviation of poverty and human suffeing. In addiion, the Bank Group is playing a
leading role in the government's adjustment program and needs to be certain that the drought
does not deral the adjustment program  In addition we have broad experience in the sectors most
S



affected by the drought, inluding agriculture, water, and transportation. Finally, the Bank has
played a pivotal coordinating role in helping respond to the drought, particularly concerning tie
non-food components of the government's program.
Program biplementatio
25.          Progrm Managemene. Program management will ce the responsibility of the
Ministry of Fnance, Economic Planning and Development, under the guidance of the National
Civil Protection Coordination Committee and its six sub-committees. Line ministries and
agencies will undertake the actul implementation of fte various program components, as
described in the Technical Appendix and the governlent's Letter of Emergency Drought Policy.
In addition, lending involving on-going Bank projects will be implemented by the agencies
already involved (e.g., MLARR for the agricultural spares, MLGRUD for the urban water
component, and MOTNS and NRZ for rail spares). The sustainability of the program is assured
by the government's careful reliance, to the extent possible, on established organizations and
practices.
26.          Procurement. Each executing agency has established a procurement unit to
undertake procurement activities in respect of thb drought program. Their organization, key
staff, and procedures are acceptable to the Association. In MLARR and MLMPSW, and NAC,
'the units will retain one or more on-bite Drocurement specialists with qualifications and terms of
reference acceptable to the Association. MFEPD will coordinate their activities and will provide
monthly progress reports of procurement activities to the Association.
27.          To ensure flexibility and rapid disbursement, the Credit will provide foreign
exchange for a range of imports required to implement the recovery components of the
government's emergency relief and recovery program. The proposed Credit of US$150 million
would finance 100 percent of the foreign expenditures incurred for a positive list of imports, as
specified in the Technical Annex. All procurement and disbursements for goods and services to
be financed under the proposed Credit shall be made in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
28.          Procurement for contracts for US$500,000 equivalent or more will be carried out
on the basis of simplified international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures consistent with the
Bank's Guldefinesfior Procurement of Goods and contracts will be bulked to the maximum extent
possible. Procurement for contracts of less than US$500,000 equivalent will be on the basis of
three quotations obtained from qualified suppliers in at least two countries. The positive list of
imports consists of: (a) petroleum products (not to exceed 20% of the Credit); (b) selected motor
vehicles; (c) spare parts for vehicles and agricultural equipment; (d) agricultural inputs; (e)
equipment for water works (excluding borehole drilling rigs); (t) microcomputers, software and
related equipment; and (g) construction materials. Detailed procurement procedures are set forth
in the Technical Annex and the Development Credit Agreement.
29.          Disbursements. To ensure that all funds are available when needed, a Special
Account will oe established with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, with an initial deposit of US$10
million, to be replenished on a monthly basis on the basis of documentary evidence suppled to
IDA by the Reserve Bank. Disbursements for contracts below US$500,000 would be made
against Staems of Expenditure. Up to 20 percent of the proceeds of the Credit may be
disbursed retroactively against expenditures made since April 1, 1992. Expenditures financed
retroactively must also conform to Bank procurement guidelines.
6



30.          Accounts and Audit. The sector agencies, MFEPD, and the Reserve Bank will
maintain records ankd accounts of all transactions under the Credit. Relevant documentation wil
be kept locally and for auditors. Accunting and audidng procedures of the Reserve Bank are
acceptable to the Association. All Credit accounts will be audied by independent auditors under
ternms of reference acceptable to the Association. Audited Credit accounts, including tl' a Special
Account and SOEs will be forwarded to IDA and the other donors within nine months of the end
of the fiscal year. Currently there are no overdue audit reports in Zimbabwe.
31.          The government bas agreed to underae a number of actons critical to the
implementation of its program. These are set out in its Letter of Emergency Drought Policy
(attached as part of the Tecimical Appendix). Ihe Association will undertake peric4ic reviews
of the status of these actions and of the progress of the government's program, the first of which
will take place within four months of the date of effectiveness of the Credit.
E.vi -me   AID=
32.          An adverse environmental situation already exists in the drought affected areas
of the country. The lack of rains will have serious effects on the local ecology both this year
and in the future unless preventive measures are undertaken rght away. The government's
program will help alleviate some of the problems caused to the environment by the drought.
Environmental provisions agreed under on-going projects such as the Agriculural Credit and
Exo Promotion Project for fertlizer and pesticide usage, will be followed under this Credit.
33.          A lack of access to the range of internationally-traded crop chemicals in recent
years, due to the shortage of foreign exchange, bas damaged short-term agricultural productivity.
In addition, it has resulted in a failure to rotate among different types of pesdcides and
herbicides, an environmentally unsound practice with potenially disastrous long-term
iplications. By alleviating this botdeneck, the program will encourage chemical use that is
more envi      ly sound.
34.          Ihe agricultural sector program will promote minimum tillage techniques which
reduce potenti soil erosion and promote water retention. Zimbabwe is one of the leading
nations in the use of integrated pest control, and has pioneered an environmentally-friendly
system of "pest scouting" so that chemicals are only used when required, rather than in a pre-
determ d sprayig schedule. The designated program would continue to promote these
principles.
35.          The drought has worsened over-crowding of water sources by human and
livestock populations. By increasing the nuimber of functioning water points, the government's
water supply recovery program wfll reduce over-crowding and mitigate the associated
environmental stresses. A qualified hydrogeologist has confirmed that the planned development
of new water sources in underserved areas will have no appreciable imract on the aquifer.
Environmental sments will be made of all proposals for urban water supply rehabilitation.
36.          The urban in-migration contingency plan, by helping to prevent the establishment
of squatter setements, should limit the stress placed on the local natr environment and on
7



water and sanitation infrastructure. By planning ahead for an appropriate settlement scheme of
displaced persons, the contingency plan would minimize the stripping of local vegetation for
construction of sub-standard shelters and would ensure proper sanitadon facilities and controlled
discharge.
37.          Finally, the public works programs lessen incentives for environmentally
destrueive income-generating activities, such as the collection and sale of firewood. These
programs include manv projects, such as re-afforestation and land grading, that prevent soil
erosion or have other environmental merits.
Progrm Risks and Benefits
38.          Rapid implemenation of the food, agriculture, transportation, and water
components of the government's program is critical to averting famine and to avoiding mass
migration and its attendant social dislocations. The main risk for this Credit wiil be the
government's ability to implement its brought Relief and Recovery Ptogramme in a tiumely
fashion. Although administratively stronger than many other countries in Africa, Zimbabwe stiU
faies limitations ir, its ability to implement and coordinate an effort of this magnitude. The
relatively early, sustained itervention of the World Bank Group and other donors has played an
important role in overcoming this problem. To ease implementation, the program has been made
administratively as simple as possible and will make maximal use of existing institutions. In
additon, other donors will be supplying technical assistance to key implemenation agencies.
39.          A second risk relates to the reliance of the country on outside ports for its access
to the sea. With the whole region suffering from drought, road and rail transport infrastructure
will be severely tested. However, a umber of donors are providing technical assistance to the
Port Authorities and Railways and are setting up a coordination unit to make the most effective
use of the infrastructure that is available.
40.          A third risk is that urban constituencies, being more visible to policy-makers, will
receive a dispropordonate share of the program's benefits. The possibility of an inadequate
government response to the relatively greater rural needs is addressed by the government's
explicit commitment to fully fund the Food-for-Work program of nral public works. It is also
expressed in the government's strong rural water rehabilitation program component.
41.          Finally, Zimbabwe faces the risk that it will be unable to meet its extrnal
obligations. Although this risk cannot be entirely alleviated, the substan   incremental assistance
that has been pledged by donors makes it less likely that the drought will fotce the government
into a paymens crisis.
