REPORT AND RECCMEWDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO  E EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MATRIANIA
FOR A LIES TOC1K PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and reconmendation on a proposed
credit to the Islamic Republic of MIauritania for the equivalent of
US$4.15 million on stendard IDA terms to help finance a project for
LIvestock Development.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.     In 1960, prior to the independence of Mauritania, the Bank made
a loan of $66 million to Soci6t6 des Mines de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFIRMA)
a private mining company, to help finance the development of an iron ore
mine and associated railway and port installations. 'ltle loan is guaranteed
by the Republic of France as well as by MauriLania. The principal share-
holders of MIFMA also guaranteed indirectly the service of the company's
debt. The mine came into production in the md.-1960's with an initial
capacity of 4 million tons of iron ore a year, v}hch has now been in-
creased to about 9 million tons a year. The Bank loan will be fully
amortized in 1975.
3.     Since independence, the Association has provided two credits for
the transport sector.  The $6.7 million credit of 19614 (No. 69-MAU) was
for a road construction project in which Fonds 1;uropgen de Ddveloppement
(FED) also participated. The original project is Row completed. However,
the Association has agreed that savings of $0.1 million under the credit
be used for a minor extension of the project, which is expected to be
ao4pleted by the end of 1971. The $2.5 million credit of 1969 (No.159-MAU)
was made to assist in financing a tour-year maintenance program. The
execution of these projects has been fairly satisfactory, in spite of
the shortage of skilled personnel and the resulting heavy reliance on
foreign consultants. The 1964 road construction was delayed due to
unforeseen technical difficulties and subsequent claims on the contrac-
tor. These claims have now been settled.
4.     The proposed credit, which would be the first Bank Group assist-
ance to the agricultural sector in Mauritania, would be the only oper-
ation to be presented to the Executive Directors during the current
fiscal year. Project preparation is underway in various fields and two
credits for port and agricultural development projects may be ready for
consideration in FY 1973.
5.     IPG has participated in one project, a $20 million investment
in Socidt4 Mini4re de Mauritanie (SOMINA), a compa4r operating a copper
mine, made in 1968. The project was completed in early 1971.

PART II - vTE ECO!0MY
6.     A report on "The Current Eccnomic Situation and Prospects of
Mauritaniat' (AW-27a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
August 27, 1971 (R 71-214). A Country Data Sheet is attached at Annex
2.
7.     Mauritania is a predominantly desert country where crop pro-
duction is limited to a narrow semi-arid belt along the southern
border, comprising not more than 15 percent of the country's total
surface. Over two-thirds of the population, mostly Moors with an Arab-
Berber background, is engaged in nomadic livestock herding, while less
than a quarter, predominantly of Negro origin, are sedentary subsistence
farmers living along the borders of the Senegal River. Urban population,
active in the modern sector of the economy (iron ore and copper mining,
fish processing, and public administration) accounts for some 10 percent
of the total, but is expanding at a rate of over 8 percent per year.
Despite tensions between the two segnents of population in the past the
country has renained stable.
8.     Mauritania represents an extreme case of a dual economy. Mining
has remained a foreign-owned enclave industry with transfers abroad
accounting for over half of total value added, limited employment, and
only minor effects on the rest of the economy. During the '960's,
the modern sector, largely consisting of mining, grew by over 14 percent
annually, a sharp contrast to the 2.6 percent growth in the traditional
sector, which was hardly in excess of population growth. Thus, the
standard of living of the bulk of Mauritania's population has scarcely
improved.
9.     Looking ahead, there are three areas in which Mauritania can
develop its economic potential: mining, fishing and livestock. Mining
is likely to remain an ilVortant source of tax revenues which will help
to finance Mauritania's development in other sectors. After 1972, when
copper production will reach rated capacity mining outpllt is likely to
expand at a much slower pace than in the past, which gives increasing
importance to the rapid development of other sectors.
l0.     There are rich fishing grounde along the Mauritanian coast,
rut organizational and financial difficulties in the 1960's seriously
retarded the development of the industry. More recently, as a result
of private initiatives, fishing activities have expanded rapidly to
the point where inadequate port capacity has become a serious limitation.
A study to improve the port of Nouadhibou is presently underway and the
Government intends to present the project for IDA financing. Its rapid
implementation is of high priority.
11.     Livestock offers the best possibilities to improve the standard
of living of the pcpulation. Over two-thirds of inhabitants depend



- 3 -
directly on this sector, which, however, provides only one-third of
GNP. Fbr climatic, as well as economic and social reasons, a radical
charnge from traditional nomddic herding to a ranching type development
is not presently feasible. However, there is scope for gradually
improving and modernizing existing techniques, which are well adapted
to the extremely difficult climatic situation. Hitherto, there has
been an almost complete lack of government support for the livestock
sector. The rehabilitation of firebreaks and wells complemented by
an improvement and expansion of veterinary and extension services and
construction of additional wellsM, is thus the first priority in any
livestock development program.
12.     Implementation of such a livestock development program will
require a considerable increase in current budgetary allocations.
While this is consistent with the expected capacity of Government
finances, it will necessarily demand a substantial increase in the
relative share of public outlays for livestock. Fiscal developments
over the last 5 years were marked by rapidly rising current revenues
(about 9 percent p.a.), of wdhich about one fourth have been derived
from the mining sector, and by an even higher growth of current
expenditures.  While savings, with the exception of 1969, remained
positive, they were insufficient to meet the growing needs of expanding
publi.c investments.  This resulted in a draw-down of treasury reserves.
The Government is now actively studying ways and means to increase
current revenues.  As the present relatively low level of ta.ation
suggests (13 percent of GDP), it should be possible to increase govern-
ment revenues, provided there is improved tax administration and revi-
sion of the tax structure. The Government is considering possible
technical assistance from bilateral or international aid agencies, e.g.
the UNDP or IMF.
13.     More serious than the overall situation of public finances is
the allocation of current expenditures. The continuous and sharp in-
crease in salary outlays and in expenditures for security and social
services, to the detriment of maintenance, the purchase of equipment
and outlays in the rural sector, had serious repercussions on past
e^-onomic development. Between 1960 and 1970 current expenditures for
maintenance have sharply declined in real terms, and those for pur-
chases of equipment and supplies have stagnated, while salary payments
have expanded at a rate of abaut 10 percent per year. The growing
imbalance between the increasing number of civil servants and the
supply of equipment has increasingly hampered satisfactory operation
of government departments. Operations of rural services (veterinary
services, extension serxices, etc) were seriously handicapped and
insufficient allocations for maintenance resulted in gradual dete-
rioration of wells and firebreaks.
14.     The Government has given priority to the development of the
rural sector in its 1970-73 Development Plan, which envisages both
substantially increased investments and current outlays for the



- 4 -
agricultural and livestock services.  With better tax administration,
a stabilization of defense expenditures following the recent recon-
ciliation with Morocco, and a rationalization of the overly expensive
education system, it should be possible for Mauritania to raise the
necessary resources to complement available external aid.
15.     Since the bulk of past foreign aid received by Mauritania was
in grant form, foreign public debt is still very low (debt service
payments amounted to ,3 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1969),
though it has been rapidly growing over the past three years. Moreover,
rising copper exports will substantially improve Xauritania's foreign
trade balance so that the servicing of external debt is not expected
to create balance of petnents problems over the coming 5-6 years.
However, even under the most optimistic assumptions concerning tax-
ation and OWP growth, Mauritania will have great difficulties in
generating the savings required to eustain developmental investment
and service external debt. Under these circumstances, foreign aid
donors should provide assistance on the most concessionary terms
possible.
16.     Even if foreign lending is entirely on concessional terms,
the contribution of budgetary savings to the financing of public
investments will remain limited. 'Under the most favorable assu=ntions
concerning GDP growrth and additional saving efforts, such contribution
is unlikely to exceed on average 15 percent over the next few years.
Accordingly, external lenders should be prepared to finance a substan-
tial proportion of project costas, often including local expenditures.
PART III - M   PROJECT
17.    The Project would provide watering facilities and their
matntenence, animal health control measures and fire protection works
in an area of about 55,000 sq.knas in the sou-th-western part of
Mauritania, wThere about half of the population and 40 percent of the
livestock are located. The project would be implemented over a four-
year period by the Ministries of Rural Development and of Equipment
under the overall supervision of the iMnistry of Planning. The Govern-
ment is seeking assistance from RED for.a parallel project in areas
not covered by the proposed IDA project.  An ongoing project, assisted
by FAG for the strengthening of the hydrological services and training
of well maintenance teams, is complementary to both projects.
18.    The Project would comprise :
(a) The reconstruction and/or repair of approximately
300 pastoral wells; establishing of three well
maintenance teams; exploratory drilling for water
at 10 sites in part of the Project area where
information on groundwater supply is inadequate and
construction of up to 15 new wenls, contingent on
the results of the exploratory drilling.



(b) Strengthening arn equipping the Livestock
Service of the Ministry of Planning and Rural
Development to enable it to carry on a campaign
to vaccinate animals in the Project area against
the important endemic diseases and treat them
against Internal and external parasites,
(c) The provision of equipment for regular maintenance
of approximately 6,,500 km. of firebreaks
within the ProJect area.
A Credit and Project Summary is at Annex 3.
19.     The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$6.0
million equivalent, of which US$3.7 million are the investment costs
and US$2*3 million certain recurrent costs. These costs are treated
as part of the project cost because the rehabilitation of wells and
firebreaks and upgrading veterinary services will require a large and
immediate increase in current expenditures, The proposed IDA credit
of US$4.15 million equivalent would finance 69 percent of project costas
the remainder being financed by the Government. It would be disbursed
against 100 percent of the foreign exchange component9 amounting to
US$3.0 million equivalent for contracting services, consultants.
imported equipment, and an average of 50 percent of the project
recurrent costs over the four year period, amounting to about US$115
million equivalent. To ensure that the Government takes steps in
good time to be in a position to provide on a continuing basis the
livestock services required after the end of the project period, the
contribution from the IDA credit to recurrent costs would decline
progressively from 80 percent in the first year to 20 percent in the
fourth year.
20.     The project would be administered by the Hinistry of Rural
Development. The Livestock Service and the Service for 'dater and
Forests are within the Ministry of Rural Development. The Department
of Infrastructure and the Hydrological Service within the Ministry
of Equipment would be concerned with some aspects of the Project.
21.     A Project Coordinating Commission would be appointed, before
effectiveness, to advise the Minister for Rural Development on certain
aspects of the wells and firebreaks components of the Project. It
would advise the Minister on terms and conditions of engagement of the
wells consultants, on selection of the wells to be repaired or re-
constructed, on the bidding documents and on the award of tenders.
22.     The Director of Livestock would be the executive officer of
the Project Coordinating Conmission. Other members would be repre-
sentatives of (a) the Minister for Planning (as Chairman), (b) the
Service for Waters and Forests, (c) the Hydrological Service of the
Ministry of Equipment, (d) the Department of Infrastructure, and
(e) the Director of the Budget,



- 6 -
23.     Consultants would be employed to assist the Government in
drawing up specifications and bidding documents for the work and well
repair and reconstruction and to supervise such work. The main part
of the well repair and reconstruction portion of the project would be
carried out by contracts to be set in accordance with the Guidelines
for Procurement. However, up to 15 percent of well repair work may be
carried out by "force account",* One veterinary officer would be employed
specifically for the execution of the animal health component of the
project.
24.     Assurances have been obtained that the Government will continue
to maintain the well and firebreaks and the animal health services after
the four-year disbursement phase.
25.     It is estimated that production of meat and milk from the
Ilvestock herds in the project area would be increased by about 30 per-
cent through reduction in cattle mortality and in the loss of pastures
by fire. Conversely, livestock herds and output would fall substantially
below present levels if action along the lines proposed in the project
were not taken. The rate of the return of the project to the economy
is estimated at 19 percent.
PAI?K IV - LiGAL INS TRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
26.     The draft Development Credit Agreement bettTeen the Islamic
Republic of Mauritania and the Association, the Report of the Commit-
tee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Appointment of the Project Coordinating Commission with composition and
terms of reference satisfactory to the Association would be a condition
of effectiveness of the credit.
27.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V  - REOONlllNDATION
28.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

PART II  -   THE ECONOMY
6.     A report on "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects of
Mburitania" (AW-27a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
August 27, 1971 (R 71-214). A Country Data Sheet is attached at Annex
2.
7.     Mauritania is a predominantly desert country where crop pro-
duction is limited to a narrow semi-arid belt along the southern
border, comprising not more than 15 percent of the country's total
surface. Over two-thirds of the population, mostly Moors with an Arab-
Berber background, is engaged in nomadic livestock herding, while less
than a quarter, predominantly of Negro origin, are sedentary subsistence
farmers living along the borders of the Senegal River. Urban population,
active in the modern sector of the economy (iron ore and copper mining,
fish processing, and public administration) accounts for some 10 percent
of the total, but is expanding at a rate of over 8 percent per year.
Despite tensions between the two segments of population in the past the
country has remained stable.
8.     Mauritania represents an extreme case of a dual economy. Mining
has remained a foreign-owned enclave industry with transfers abroad
accounting for over half of total value added, limited employment, and
only minor effects on the rest of the economy. During the 1960's,
the modern sector, largely consisting of mining, grew by over 14 percent
annually, & sharp contrast to the 2.6 percent growth in the traditional
sector, which was hardly in excess of population growth.  Thus, the
standard of living of the bulk of Mauritania's population has scarcely
improved.
9.     Looking ahead, there are three areas in which Hauritania can
develop its economic potential: mining, fishing and livestock. Mining
is likely to remain an important source of tax revenues which will help
to finance Mauritania's development in other sectors. After 1972, when
copper production will reach rated capacity mining output is likely to
expand at a much slower pace than in the past, which gives increasing
importance to the rapid development of other sectors.
10.     There are rich fishing grounds along the Mauritanian coast,
but organizational and financial difficulties in the 1960's seriously
retarded the development of the industry.  More recently, as a result
of private initiatives, fishing activities have expanded rapidly to
the point where inadequate port capacity has become a serious limitation.
A study to improve the port of Nouadhibou is presently underway and the
Government intends to present the project for IDA financing. Its rapid
implementation is of high priority.
11.     Livestock offers the best possibilities to improve the standard
of living of the population. Over two-thirds of inhabitants depend

Procurement Arrangements:
Contracts for well construction would be subject to
international competitive bidding except a maximum of
15 percent of well repair and reconstruction works,
which upon recommendation by consultants, may be
carried out by the Borrower. Vehicles, various items
of plant and machinery for the well maintenance teams
would be procured by international competitive bidding.

health component of the Project would not justify
international competition.
Construction Period: 1972-76

The Credit would be disbursed against the foreign exchange
component of expenditures on employment of consultants,
contractors and purchase of equipment and against 80 per-
cent of operating costs of the project in year 1, 60 per-
cent of such costs in year 2, 40 percent in year 3 and 20
percent in year 4.
Consultants:
The Borrower would be assisted in the wells component of
the project by consultants to conduct detailed surveys,
prepare bidding documents, evaluate bids received and
supervise the execution. The consultants would further
make recomnendations regarding the extent to which the
Borrower should employ contractors for the repair and
reconstruction of wells.
