                         This ISR records the findings of an Implementation Mission carried out in February 2013 with the overall objective to (i) review progress on agreed actions; and (ii) assess the status
                         of project implementation in light of the current closing date of June 30, 2013.

                         Over the past six months project implementation has been further advanced. Disbursement has also risen to 73%. On the other hand, delays in procurement and contract
                         management in the Water Resource and Irrigation sub-components have negatively affected start-up of some activities. Nevertheless, Progress toward the PDO is good. A number
                         of targets are on track to be reached or have already been reached (see results framework). Water use charges are increasingly being collected. Forests are increasingly being

                         managed according to approved management plans. Community groups such as farmers and forest dwelling vulnerable and marginalized groups are increasingly working closely
                         with relevant institutions to sustainably use and conserve water and forest resources, which are closely linked in Kenya. The rehabilitation of the Mwea irrigation scheme is
                         progressing well and will be completed on time, while the Lower Nzoia irrigation scheme designs have been finalized and the construction will be financed under the new IDA-
                         financed Water Security and Climate Risk Project instead of NRMP as originally planned, since the NRMP will close on June 30, 2013. Communities in Upper Tana are implementing
                         226 community driven micro-projects, and similarly in the forest areas receiving project support, the Vulnerable and Marginalized Group Plans developed and driven by forest
                         communities are under implementation. These and other intermediate results demonstrate relatively good progress in recent months. However, in the days before the mission, a
                         request for inspection was received by the Bank and Bank management has responded to the request.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the approaching Project Closing Date of June 30, 2013, it was agreed that over the remaining months the Implementing Agencies focus their efforts on:

                         (i) speeding up and finalizing ongoing procurements and paying close attention to contract management to avoid any outstanding activities by June 30, 2013;

                         (ii) providing a final list of activities and amounts -- in addition to the Lower Nzoia irrigation scheme civil works (now to be financed under the WSCRP) -- where the absorption of IDA
                         funds is unlikely and cancellation of such funds can be requested; and
                         (iii) continuing to follow up on issues related to vulnerable and marginalized communities in forested project areas, including: (a) the continued implementation of Vulnerable and
                         Marginalized Group Plans, and (b) following through on the November 2012 establishment and first meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Task Force on land tenure and legacy related
                         issues.
                         (iv) mobilizing teams to draw out lessons from NRMP for the Implementation Completion Report and next-generation sector activities.
