EM4PESAS ELECTRICAS ASOCIADAS (LIU LIGHT)
PERU
SUMMARY
i.        Empresas Electricas Asociadas - Lima Light and Power Company
(Lima Light), a privately owned electric utility company serving the greater
Lima-Callao area in Peru, has requested a loan of US$17.5 million equivalent
to finance part of the total construction cost of US$50.5 million, including
interest during construction, of the Matucana Power Project comprising the
120 T Miatucana hydroelectric plant and related transmission and distribu-
tion system expansion. The loan would be guaranteed by the Government of
Peru.
ii.       Three previous loans were made by the Bank to the Company viz:
Loan 260-PE (1960) for US$24 million for stage one of the Huinco hydroelectric
project, Loan 365-PE (1963) for US$15 million for stage two of the Huinco
hydro.electric project and Loan 464-FE (1966) for US$10 million for trans-
mission and distribution system expansion during 1966-68. The two stages
of the Huinco project were completed satisfactorily in 1966 and work under
Loan 464-PE is progressing satisfactorily and on schedule.
iii.      The Project is needed to meet forecast increases in power demand
on the Company's system during 1971-73. The demand forecast is realistic,
it is based upon a long experience of accurate forecasting, and shows that
the project would be fully utilized by 1973,
iv0       The Government has signed contracts for the construction of the
Mantaro (684 MW) hydroelectric project which is scheduled for service in
1973 at which time Lima Light would meet further increases in system demand
by purchasing power produced by this project.
v0        The Company's management and staff are competent and with the
assistance of consultants are capable of satisfactorily undertaking construc-
tion of the project.
vi,       Since 1946 Lima Light has been associated with Energia Hidro-
electrica Andina (Hidrandina) S.A., a privately owned generating company
which sells all its power under contract to Lima Light, At the Bank's
suggestion Lima Light has re-examined its relationship with Hidrandina and,
as a result, plans to acquire from Hidrandina two power plants and other
properties that are an integral part of Lima Light's system. The transfer
would take place in stages during the period 1967 through 1971, The total
purchase price is estimated at US$14-5 mlllion0
vii.      The earnings of the Company have been satisfactory and its
financial position is expected to remain sound* Power rates are based
upon the provisions of the Electric Industry Law which permits the Company
to earn a satisfactory return on its equityo



- ii -
viii;     The financing plan for the construction period of the project
is satisfactory, Nlet earnings would contribute 27$5 percent towards
financing the total requirements and sales of shares and customers'
contributions would bring the contribution from sources other than
borrowings to 65e,6 percent.
ix.       The Matucana project would represent about 49 percent of total
requirements under the financing plan, The proposed loan would finance
imported goods procured through international bidding, consulting services
and interest during construction for the project and would contribute 37
percent towards its total costs.
xO        The project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$17$5 million
equivalent with a term of 25 years including a grace period of five years.



APPRAISAL CF THE MATUCANA POWER PROJECT CTY
EMIEESAS ELECTRICAS ASOCIADAS (LIMA LIGHT)
PERU
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Matucana hydroelectric project of
Empresas Electricas Asociadas - Lima Light and Power Company (Lima Light),
which would consist of the 120 1MW Matucana hydro plant located on the
Rimac river about 80 kn from Lima (see Map 1), a double circuit 220 KV
steel tower transmission line to convey the power to the city, 220 KV
substations and associated distribution system expansion.
1.02      The estimated total cost of the project would be about US$50.5
million equivalent and the Bank has been requested to finance US$17.5 million
representing the cost of imported goods procured through international
competitive bidding, consulting services and US$1,5 million of interest
during construction.
1.03      The project has been approved by the National Planning Institute
of the Peruvian Government as being acceptable in the national development
plan. The Government of Peru will guarantee the loan.
L.04      This report is based on the findings of a mission to Peru in
March-April 1967 composed of Messrs. R,V, Sear and C. de Beaufort and upon
subsequent discussions with the negotiating team from Lima Light which
visited the Bank in August 1967.
2e THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR IN PERU
2.01      The electric power generating plants in Peru may be grouped
under the following four main categories:
Installed Capacity
in MW
(a)  Private companies serving the public            580
(b)  Captive plants in private industry and
mining                                          696
(c) Government owned autonoacus corporations         163
(d) Small goverment owned plants supplying
rural population centers (Servicios
Electricos Nacionales, SEN)                      Li
Total                                   1470



- 2 -
2.02      Lima Light and its associate Energia IHidroel6ctrica Andina S.A.
(HIDMIAMNA) combined, is the largest of the private companies and accounts
for 85% or 492 MW of the generating capacity in that category.
2.03      The Government has in the past participated in the electric sector
through its autonomous regional development corporations which have con-
structed a total of about 163 IMR of plants within their own territories.
The Government has also been constructing small plants and systems to
provide some service to the many small rural population centers scattered
throughout the country.  Servicios Electricos Nacionales (SEN), which
obtains its funds from the national budget, was formed in 1966 under the
Yinistry of Public Works to take over and operate these small plants and
systems. It has also undertaken to continue the construction of such small
rural plants for the Government and to promote a program of rural electri-
fication.  At present some 200 plants with a total capacity of only 31 MW
are operated by SEN.
2.34      In 1961 the Government formed the Mantaro Corporation (C0OM-AdN)
for the purpose of developing the N4antaro valley and in particular the
electric power potential of the Mantaro river. A contract was signed with
a consortium of European firms to construct and partially finance the
Mantaro power scheme. However, this contract was cancelled in 1966 and a
new contract signed the same year with a group of Italian firms to construct
and partially finance the first stop (68 4 .',) M the p. o,jct, at what a:e
claimed to be more advantageous conditions for Peru. See Annex 1.
2.05      This is the Government's fi:st major project in the power field
and would include about 1,000 km of 220 kv transmission lines to connect thce
MIantaro power plant with Cerro de Pasco, Lima, Ica and M,1arcona to form an
interconnected system for Central Peru.  See Hap 2.
2.06      The N;antaro project is scheduled for completion in 1973 and
although it appears technically feasible some final design details still
remain to be clarified. It would therefore be reasonable with a project
of this large size, located in a relatively inaccessible part of the high
Andes, for Lima Light to make provision for additional capacity in the
event that the project is delayed, since the power demand forecast for its
system shows that the Matucana plant would be fully loaded at about the
time I4antaro is presently scheduled to be ready for service.
2.07      Lima Light is therefore making preliminary studies of several
hydroplants which might be built should they be needed.  The oil companies
are also actively pursuing the further exploration and proving of natural
gas sources, in the Aguaytia region, which may provide an economical fuel
source for a thermal plant.  Thus, in the event of Mantaro being delayed
one of these other alternatives could be constructed, although this decisicn
need not be taken until 1968-69 when more will be known of the progress at
MMantaro and of the availability of adequate quantities of natural gas.

3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be Empresas Electricas Asociadas - Lima Light
and Power Company, a privately owned public utility corporation responsible
for supplying electric service in the Greater Lima area. Its head office
is situated in Lima, The loan would be guaranteed by the Government of
Peru as was the case in previous Bank loans to Lima Light,
3.02      The Company was originally incorporated under Peruvian laws in
1910. Lima Light's present concession was granted by the Peruvian Govern-
ment in 1956. It is valid for a period of 50 years and gives the Company
the exclusive right to generate and distribute power within the concession
area. Since 1956 the concession area, principally Greater Lima and the port
of Callao, has been increased on five occasions at the Government's request
to bring it from less than 500 kmZ to its present area of 2,850 km2.
3.03      At the end of 1966 Lima Light had outstanding SI 1 billion of
common shares and $10 million of preferred shares, Until recently the
majority of the share capital was owned by a Swiss group of public utility
holding compani-es and bauks. The sales of shares in Poru have gradually
increased Peruvian ownerphip to over 3,000 shareholders who hold about 58%
of the stock. However, the Swiss group, holding about 32% of the stock,
in effect still controls the Company, The remaining 10% of the stock is
held by other investors outside Peru.
3.04      The Bank has made three previous loans to Lima Light:
(i) Loan 260-FE (1960) for US$24 million for the first stiage of the
Huinco (120 Mr3) hydro plant and the Marcapomacocha diversion.
The project was completed satisfactorily.
(ii) Loan 365-PE (1963) for US$15 million for the second stage of the
Huinco (120 MW) hydro plant and the Marcapomacocha diversion and
distribution system expansion. The project was completed satis-
f actorily in 1966.
(iii) Loan 464-FE (1966) for US$10 million for transmission and distri-
bution system expansion during 1966-68. Satisfactory progress is
being made on this project which is on schedule and about 30 per-
cent complete.
3.05      Lima Light's performance under the three previous loan agreements
has been satisfactory.
Organization and Mangement
30o6      Lima Light's Board of Directors has 15 members, including the
General Manager and three alternate directors, A majority of the directors
reside in Lima,
3.07      The General Manager is the Chief Executive of the Company, He is
assisted by an Associate General Manager and four departmental managers
in charge of planning and new works, operations, commercial services, and
general administration and finance0  The Associate General Maunager is in
charge of the department of general relations and the Secretariat. At the



- 4 -
end of 1966, the Company had 3,176 regular employees serving 293,000
customers, giving a satisfactory average of 135 customers per employee
3.08      The Company has a satisfactory organization and its relationship
with the authorities and public is good. The top management is experienced,
and in fulfillment of the conditions agreed to under Loan 464-PE (1966),
steps are being taken, with the assistance of consultants, to improve the
efficiency of operations involved in the middle level of supervision.
Associated Companies
Hidrandina
3e09      Energia Hidroelectrica Andina (Hidrandina) S.A. with its Head
Office in Lima was established in 1946 by the Swiss holding group (paragraph
3.03) which still owns the majority of its shares, for the purpose of
financing, constructing and operating hydro-power plants, At that time
Lima Light had a closed mortgage securing its debt which prevented it from
obtaining loans in the substantial amounts required to finance the expansion
of its generating facilities,,
3.10      Hidrandina constructed two hydro plants, Moyopar.pa and Huampani
and all power generated by these plarnts is purchased by Lima Light0
3.11      During negotiations for loan 464-FE the Bank suggested that Lima
Light should re-examine its relationship with Hidrandina, in vi..w of the
fact that the latter company's power plants and other properties are an
integral part of Lima Light's system, In making this suggestion the Bank
also took into account that Hidrandina, by constructing a plant 1/ in
another concession area, was about to serve other interests in addition to
those of Lima Light, This would require arrangements for the division of
Hidrandina's expenses between two separate systems, Moreover, transfer of
the Moyopampa and Huampani plants to Lima Light, would eventually result in
an increase in the latter's net internal cash generation (paragraph 3.15)l
3.12      Towards the end of 1966 the Company submitted the following plan
to the Bank for the acquisition of Hidrandina properties:
Property to be              Proposed Date
transferred                 of Transfer
Stage 1                 Rimac River Derivation           June 30, 1967
Stage 2                 Huampani Power Plant             June 30, 1968
Stage 3                 Moyopampa Power Plant           1970 or 1971
1/ Construction started in March 1965 on a hydro plant on the Pativilca
river, about 1l0 miles north of Lima.



- 5 -
The price to be paid by the Company would be the residual book value of
the assets at the time of transfer. The total amount involved is esti-
mated at $14.5 million. The Company has confirmed that the need for funds
to assure that the Matucana Project will be carried out has priority over
its purchase of Hidrandina assets. Until all the properties are acquired
by Lima Light the new contract dated January 4, 1967 regulates Lima Light's
purchases of Hidrandina power.
3.13      The Swiss group that controls Hidrandina takes the attitude that
its properties may only be sold if they can be substituted by other investments
in electric power0 The proceeds from the sale of the Rimac River Derivation
are being used by Hidrandina to finance construction of the Pativilca plants
A payment of Si 50 million to be made in 1967 on account of the sale of the
Huampani plant will be used for the same purpose0 Further payments on account
of the Huampani plant will be made in annual installments and would probably
be invested by Hidrandina in Pativilcals distribution system, Preliminary
consideration is being given to other investment possibilities which would
permit the sale of the Moyopampa plant.
3.14      Depreciation on Hidrandina's properties, which would be acquired
by Lima Light, is now paid for by Lima Light as part of the cost of power
purchases. From the date of each transfer of properties this depreciation
will become a non-cash cost charge and be an additional source of funds
in Lima Light's cash flow. On the other hand Lima Light will have to bear
the costs of the operation and maintenance of the properties, an increase
in its cr-erhead expenditure and of dividends and debt service on new shares
and debentures placed to finance the acquisition. On balance, Lima Light's
cash flow should improve as the result of each transfer and assuming that the
additional cash flow during the acquisition period will be used to help pay
for the last two stages of the transfer of properties, the acquisition
program would be financed as follows:
Sales of preferred shares          Si 133.2 million
Sales of common shares                 63.5     I
Sales of debentures                    50.1     "
Additional cash generated under
the acquisition program during
the period 1967 through 1971        112.6     "
Limra Light's internal cash
generation                           31.6     "
Total purchase price          SZ 391.0 million
3.15      After the completion of the acquisition program, in 1971, the
anmual net increase in Lima Light's cash flow is estimated to amount to
S/ 63 million (US$203 million).



-6-
3.16      Prior to each transfer of assets, the Borrower will cbtain the
Bank's agreement with the manner in which such transfer would be financed.
The Borrower has also agreed to consult with the Bank should any problems
arise in the execution of the acquisition program. This arrangement is
satisfactory to the Bank.
Atelsa
3.17      In 1965 Atencion Electrica S.A. (ATELSA) was founded to operate
the portions of the distribution system owned by Lima Light which are
located in the more remote and ner parts of its concession area and in the
newly settled low income areas inside Lima. Atelsa has provided a means
of operating these service areas in an economical manner by using the more
rudimentary methods and facilities required in the initial development of
new areas. Lina Light would not be able to do this under its labor
agreements and other regulations. Atelsa obtains its revenues from fees
and commissions paid it by Lima Light for services rendered. The principal
shareholder in Atelsa is Latinalux (paragraph 6.21).
Existing Installations
3.18      The generating capacity of the system  was 485 Yd at the end of
1966, installed in one thermal plant (68 IV) and six hydro plants (417 W).
Of this total only about 115 IjB was installed prior to 1955; since then
370 FI has been added including 240 MZI during 1965 and 1966 in the Huinco
hydroelectric plant. See Maps 1 and 3 for plant locations.
3.19      The transmission and distribution system has been expanded
continuously to meet increased demand and to transport power from the hydro
plants to the load center in the Lima-Callao service area. This system is
in good condition and is adequate to meet present system requirements. Bank
Loan 464-PE (1966) was made to finance the transmission and distribution
system expansion for 1966-68. This work is progressing satisfactorily.
4. PaIER MARKET
4.01      The population in the Company's concession area (greater Lima
and Callao) is about 2,800,000 or 24 percent of the total population of
Peru, The area is the main administrative, commercial and industrial
center and principal power market of Peru. It contains 85 percent of the
power capacity serving the public and about 20 percent of the captive
plants, or about 42 percent of all the power capacity in the country,



4,02      The following figures for 1966 illustrate the extent of this
market:
Maximum Demand                            291 M
Annual Increase in Maximum Demand
with respect to 1965                     11.9%

4,03      The Mantaro project being built by the Government would start
to create a power market for central Peru which would include Lima Light's
present market. The Government plans to construct the first stage of Mantarc
(342 MW) for service in 1973 and, as demand develops, to install three
additional 114 ItV units to complete the project to its full capacity of
684 HW, estimated to meet market requirements for the Central region until
about 1978-80.
4.04      The immedia-te problem is to satisfy Lima Light's existing power
market until Mantaro is available. This market had an average annual
rate of growth of about 10% during the past 20 years increasing to 12%
in 1966 and 14% during the first 6 months of 1967.
4.05      The method of load forecasting used by Lima Light is based upon
a continuous review of the market trends and provides a satisfactory basi.s
to determine the generating capacity needed to meet system demand economi-
cally. See Annex 2 for further detail, Resulting from the forecast the



- 8 -
average rate of growth is about 10 percent per annum and at this rate it
is estimated the existing system generating capacity would be fully utilizcd
by 1970, A plant of about 100 NW capacity would then be required for
service in 1971, to meet forecast demand until 1973 when it too would be
fully loaded and the N4antaro project should be in operation to supply further
market needs.
h.o6      The Government proposes to complete construction of the Lima - lca
section of its 220 kV transmission system by 1968-69 and has asked Lima Light
to sell power to this transmission system until Mantaro is in service.
Initially the power demand will not be very large, about 10-20 MW, but the
Government's purpose in making power available to the Ica area is to foster
its general development and to permit the conversion of the existing
irrigation pumping load, estimated at 40 M., now served by high cost captive
diesel plants to purchasing power from the Mantaro system.   The Mantaro
project would also be available to serve the demands of mining companies in
the area.
5. THE PROJECT
5.01      The Matucana project would consist of:
(a)  an intake and sand trap on the Rimac river at Tamboraque,
(b)  a 20 km free flow tunnel 3 meters in diameter from the intake
to the forebay,
(c) a 1,700 meter long steel penstock to convey the water from the
forebay to the power station,
(d)  a power station in which two 60 M@ turbine-generator units
operating under a head of 960 meters would be installed,
(e)  an 80 kim, 220 kV double circuit steel tower transmission line
to connect the power plant to Lima,
(f)  220 kV substation expansion in Lima to receive the power from
the Matucana plant,
(g) Distribution system expansion during 1969-70.
5002      The proposed Matucana power plant and Lima Light's existing plants
are all located on the Santa Eulalia and Rimac rivers. See iHap 3e
Hzdrology
5-03      Since the water of the Rimac river has been used in the Company's
plants for over 30 years and continuous detailed records are available, the.
expected flowT can be predicted reliably.



-9-
Geology
5.04      The geological formations in which the Hatucana tunnel is to be
built are in the same general area as the existing plants. Therefore the
geology is well known and no unexpected problems are anticipated.
Characteristics
5.05      Matucana would be essentially a run of the river plant since no
storage reservoir can be built.  However, the forebay is designed to provide
30,000m3 of pondage which is sufficient to provide some peaking capacity
during the morning and evening peak hours. The plant would have a maximum
capacity of 120 M1J and a firm generation of 440 Gwh annually.
Construction
5.06      The plant would be constructed, in the same manner as the existing
plants, by using local contractors and subcontractors under the supervision
of Lima Light's consultants, Motor. Columbus, who designed the project. This
arrangement has been satisfactory in the past and is acceptable for the
proposed project, particularly since the principal item of civil works is
tunnelling in which Peruvian contractors have considerable experience. The
construction program is reasonable and provided contracts are placed as
scheduled the project should be in operation in 1971 as planned.
Procurement and Disbursement
5.07      The proposed loan would be used to finance the foreign exchange
costs of equipment, consulting services and interest during construction.
It would not finance the work carried out by local contractors. All goods
to be financed with the loan would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
normnal standards for international competitive bidding. Peruvian suppliers
may compete in that bidding, and would be allowed a 15 percent margin of
preference over the CIF landed cost (excluding customs duties), but if they
were successful Lima Light lwould use resources other than the Bank loan to
finance purchases from them. If the actual costs of the goods financed by
the loan turned out to be less than estimated, the Bank would be able to
exercise its right to cancel the undisbursed balance.
Cost Estimate
5.08      The total cost of the project, including interest during construc-
tion is estimated at S/ 1,364.4 million, US$50.5 million equivalent, of which
about US$16.0 million equivalent would be the cost of imported services and
goods procured through international bidding and US$1.5 million equivalent
of interest during construction due to the Bank.
5.09      The estimate prepared by Lima Light with the assistance of the
consultants is based upon known costs of the Hluinco plant, completed in ll9O6
adjusted for cost increases anticipated by the time the actual work is
carried out and variations in cost due to the physical differences in the
two projects.  The estimate is realistic and satisfactory.   In view of this
up to date knowledge of construction costs, the overall contingency item {f
about 10 percent which has been included in the cost estimate, is conside.Led
adequate.

50J1      The cost of the project would be US$317 per kw excluding the
transmission line and distribution works. This cost is reasonable.
Economic Justification
5.12      The possibility of using thermal alternatives, conventional
steam or gas turbine plants, to the Matucana plant were examined and
discounted cash flow comparisons of the costs made, The possible availa-
bility by 1971 of natural gas for use as the fuel for the thermal
alternatives was taken into consideration. These studies showed that the
Matucana plant is economically more advantageous than any of the thermal
alternatives at discount rates below 12%.
6. FINANCIAtL ASPECTS
Electri6 Power Legislation
6.01      The supply of electric power in Peru is regulated by the Electric
Industry Law of July 1955, which provides for periodic tariff adjustanents
aimed at producing a profit of 11-jg on the common share capital and free
reserves of large electric power companies and, by Special Resolution, of
91a on their preferred capital. Of such profit, dividends of 8k9 on
cmmaon shares, an equivalent portion credited to free reserves and
dividends of 8% on preferred shares are deductible in computing the
companiesI taxable income.
6.02      Tariffs are subject under the Law to a review every three years
but may be revised at shorter intervals at the request of the company or
the State electricity authority. Reviews are made by the National Tariff
Commission, a body of seven members appointed by the President cf Peru 'un
accordance with regulations to ensure the competence of the members and a
reasonable degree of independence of the Commission.
6003      The Law provides in the review of tariffs for the revaluation of
installations on the basis of current replacement value as determined by
technical appraisers nominated by the National Tariff Commission and the
Company. The revaluation increment relating to the Company's installations
is applied to an adjustment of the corresponding depreciation reserves in
the same proportion, to the reserve for eventual exchange losses on foreign
currency obligations, and to increase equity.
6.o4      Since the Law came into force, the Company's assets in operation
have been revalued four times; in 1956 by almost 100%, in 1959 by 27%, in
1961 by 14% and in 1965 by 8.5%. In each case the revaluation was followed
by a tariff increase; the most recent, of approximately 20%o went into effect.
in January 1966. As a result, the average revenue per kwh increased from
Si 0.601 (US mills 22.4) in 1965 to SI 0.723 (US mills 27.0) in 1966,
6.o5      The first ten years of operation within the framework of the Law
have proved that it has adequately protected the Campany under rapidly
changjng economic conditions.  During this period the Company has been



-12 -
able to attract all the funds it needed for its rapid expansione The
periodic revaluations and tariff revisions have enabled it to adjust to
rising prices and wage levels and to maintain regular dividends on a
greatly enlarged share capitalo
6.06      Because of the adequate provisions of the Law under which electric
utility tariffs are regulated in Peru, the Bank has not applied its usual
rate covenant in its loans to Lima Light. This situation is satisfactory
while the Law is not repealed, or amended in a manner detrimental to Lima
Light. During negotiations for Loan 46h-PE in 1966 and again during the
negotiations for the proposed loan, the Government agreed to inform the Bank
of any proposed changes in the Law and to give the Bank an opportunity to
comment. In order to provide additional protection for the Company and the
Bank in the event that changes are made in the Law, which would adversely
affect the Company, a provision has been incorporated in the agreement for
the present loan whereby any adverse change would be an e.ent of doi:Lalt.

6.o8      Utility Plant is stated at replacement values determined in
1965 by the National Tariff Commission with subsequent additions added
at cost.
6.09      The common share capital has risen from SI. 617.6 million to
S/. 1 billion during the last three years, representing an increase of
62%. Of this increase S/. 230.7 million was represented by sales of new
shares or conversion of preferred shares, (paragraph 6.10) while bonus
shares totalling S/. 74.0 million were issued out of the revaluation
increment for 1965 (see paragraphs 6.03 and 6.04) and S/. 77.7 million out
of earned surplus corresponding to distribution of "commercial profit".
6.10      Preferred shares are denominated in US dollars, they are
entitled to a fixed cumulative annual dividend of 8% and are convertible
at the option of the holder into common shares. They were first issued
in 1960 for a total amount of US$6 million. Since then additional
preferred shares were sold in Peru and Switzerland in two issues of
$3 million in 1962 and of $1 million in 1963.
6.11      The Exchange Equalization Reserve of S/. 211 million which has
been built up from the surplus arising from the periodic revaluations of
the Company's installations, may be used only to off-set losses from the
restatement of foreign currency liabilities at current exchange rates.
612.      Long-term debt totalled SI. 1,915 million including current
maturities of S/. 140 million. Details of the debt are given in Annex 5.
All but 11, of the debt was issued under an open-ended indenture created
in 1957 with Schroder Trust Company, New York, as trustee. This part of
the debt totalled S/. 1,697 million and is secured by a first floating
charge on all property, present and future. A second floating charge has
been granted in favor of the Republic of Peru as security for guaranteeing
Bank loans. The secured debt included five series of 15 year debentures
totalling S/. 611 million, equivalent, mainly placed with the Swiss holding
group and to a lesser extent in Peru, where they are widely distributed,
and in the United States. Each series was originally issued for US$6
million except one which amounted to Swiss Francs 25 million (US$5.8 million
equivalent). Debt service on each series is paid in equal semi-annual
instalments calculated to retire the series within a period of 15 years.
Interest rates are 7% for the Dollar and 6&;: for the Swiss Franc debentures.
6.13      Also issued under the 1957 trust indenture and included in the
secured debt were IBRD loans 260-PE, 365-PE and 464-PE, represented re-
spectively by series D, series F and series H debentures, to a total
disbursed amount of S/. 1,087 million equivalent.  Series D and series F
were for a term of 25 years and series H for 20 years, at interest rates
of 6, 5_ and 6% respectively.
6.14      The issue of additional debentures is limited, under the indenture-)
by earnings and assets tests which require that actual net income for a
recent 12 month period be at least 1505% of annual interest charges on
existing and proposed debentures and other funded debt, and that net
tangible assets at the time of a proposed issue be not less than 150,% of
debentures and other funded debt, outstanding and proposed.



- 15 -
6.15      A supplemental indenture will be issued for the purpose of
securing a new series comprising the proposed Bank loan which would rank
equally with the existing debentures as to security.
6.16      Unsecured debt totalled S/. 217 million, its largest component
consisting of two-year 6% dollar notes outstanding in the amount of
US$5.5 million. These notes were issued in 1965 and were placed in Peru,
Switzerland and the United States. They are convertible at the option
of the holder into long-term debentures to be issued during their term.
Trustees for these notes are the Banco de Credito del Peru and the
Privatbank of Zurich.
6.17      The remainder of the unsecured debt included:
(a) three 6% /7% credits from Brown Boveri and Company
totalling Sw.F2.0 million, repayable within three years
and covering the purchase of equipment,
(b) an 8% loan from the Banco Industrial, Lima, for US$600,000
repayable in 1967, and
(c) a non-interest bearing loan from the Junta Nacional de la
Vivienda. The outstanding balance of S/. 3.5 million is
repayable in instalments prior to 1972.
The two latter loans are financing properties administered by the Fund
for Third Parties Installations (paragraph 6.27).
6.18      Lima Light's negative current position was gradually reduced
from S/. 94 million at the end of 1963 to S/. 23 million at the end of
1966. In view of the availability to the Company of short-term
facilities from local and foreign banks as well as from the Swiss
holding group, a limited negative current position is not serious.
Insurance
6.19      The Company maintains adequate coverage against losses and
liability, as required under the 1957 indenture.
Auditors
6.20      The financia'L statements of Lima Light are audited by Price
Waterhouse, Peat and Co. The Company will continue to have its accounts
audited by a firm of accountants acceptable to the Bank.
Financial Services
6.21      Latinalux, a Peruvian company controlled by the Swiss holding
group, maintains a market in Peru for Lima Light's shares. Its
operations appear to have had a beneficial effect on the volume of sales
of new shares by Lima Light. Latinalux is the principal shareho'lder in
Atelsa (paragraph 3.17) and also provides advisory services of a financiaL
and legal nature to Lima Light and Hidrandina.



- 16 -
Taxes
6.22      The principal taxes affecting the Company were frozen at the
rates applicable when the Electric Industry Lawi (paragraph 6.01) became
effective.  The profits tax rates, with a maximum of 20%, will remain
unchanged during the lifetime of the concession. Legal dividends and
debenture interest are exempt from withholding taxes. Other distributions
of profit are subject to a 15>% withholding tax but in the case of a
capitalization of profits the rate is reduced to l0g.
Guarantee Commission
6.23      The Ministry of Finance charges an annual guarantee commission
of L/4% on outstanding balances of Bank loans made to the Company.
Earnings Record
6.24      The framework for tariffs set up in the Electric Industry Law
(paragraph 6.01) is intended to produce revenues which will cover all
costs and provide a fixed return on equity. During the five-year period
to December 31, 1966, for which summaries of income statements are given
in Annex 6, Lima Light succeeded in maintaining a reasonable margin of
earnings above those required for dividend payments at the legal rates.
During the five-year period interest was covered 1.7 times by gross income.
Depreciation
6.25      Depreciation is calculated on the replacement cost of assets, as
determined by the latest revaluation, at percentages based on their useful
life. Tne resulting rate of depreciation on average gross plant in
operation during 1966 was 3.6%, which is satisfactory.
Dividend Record
6.26      Dividends on preferred shares (which were issued for the first
time in 1960) have been maintained at an annual rate of 8%. On common
shares dividends have been paid since 1956 at an annual rate of 8½2%. In
addition bonus shares are distributed from time to time to incorporate
into share capital increases in surplus resulting from revaluations of
assets and retained earnings.
Funds for Public Domain Installations
6.27      The Electric Industry Law and its corresponding regulations
provide for the creation of an "Expansion Fund" and a "Third Parties Fund".
All installations financed by these funds will not be owned by the
concessionaire but will become part of the public domain.
6.28      The Expansion Fund was set up to finance the high tension distri-
bution system outside the initial zone of the concession area. It obtains
funds from contributions from customers, set by Government, and from con-
tributions by the Company. The Company's contributions may not exceed 5%
of the annual investment in the high and low-tension distribution system,
including installations financed by third parties. They have been pro-
visionally agreed with the National Tariff Commission at SI. 13 million and
S/. 15 million for the years 1967 and 1968.



- 17 -
6.29      The Third Parties Fund was created for the purpose of controlling
expenditure on the lo01 tension distribution system throughout the concession
area and is financed by customers' contributions based on various government
approved charges. The balance of funds available in the Third Parties Fund
is regulated by revisions in the charges. In addition to installations
financed by the Fund all installations handed over to the Company and
recorded by the Fund, become public domain property.
6.30      The Company is required annually to charge income with a per-
centage of the total value of public domain installations. This amount,
which is denominated depreciation, may be used only for the administration,
replacement and expansion of the public domain installations. Until 1965
the annual charge was 1% or less, but for 1966 and subsequent years the
percentage was revised to approximately 251 by agreement with the National

Financing Plan
6.31      During the construction period of the proposed project the
reservoir below the Huinco plant will be completed, final payments will
be due on the Marcapomacocha project, and the distribution system will
continue to expand. In addition two stages of the acquisition plan for
Hidrandina properties would take place during this period and result in
payments totalling S/. 225 million. Provisions for increases in Working
Capital and in the Fund for Social Law Benefits will add S/. 80 mil'ion
to the requirements which may be surimarized as follows:

The Company plans to finance these requirements in the following mamner:
Sources of funds during
the years 1967 through 1970                   (in millions of Soles)
Internal cash generation                                 2,337

Total sources                                  2,688
6.32      The GUW will consult the Bank as to any changes it proposes to
make in the Financing Plan.
6.33      Internal cash generation, net of debt service, cash dividends and
financing expenses would finance 27.5%' of the requirements. This rate is
acceptable in view of the sizable contributions from customers and the sales
of shares, iwhich irll enable the Company to finance 6/5.6% of the requirements
from sources other than borrowings.
6.3h      The Company offered US*6.3 million (S/. 170 million equivalent) ofF3%
preferred shares for subscription during April 1967. The issue was success3f^ii.
and 94.F8J was placed with existing shareholders who exercised their options.
The acquisition of the Rimac River Derivation was paid for from the proceedo
of this issue.



- 19 -
6.35      It is assumed that sales of common shares will total SI. 250
million and cover about 9% of the requirements.
6.36      Borrowings net of the repayment of a S/. 40 million bank over-
draft and the funding of S/. 251 million of two-year notes, wsould con-
tribute S/. 925 million or 34.4% of the financing. Borrowings would consist
of:
(a) $7.5 million, the undisbursed balance of Loan 464-PE,
(b) $17.5 million, the proposed Bank loan, assumed to be for a
term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years and
interest at 6%. In financing the foreign exchange costs of
the Matucana project the loan would contribute 37% towards
the total cost of the project,
(C) Sw F 25 million (us$ 5,8 million) of 7TO 15 year debentures,
to be offered to the public during the second half of 1967.
The purpose of this issue is in the first place to fund the
two-year notes outstanding in the amount of $5.5 million.
Holders of about $4 million of these notes have already
committed themselves to convert their notes into debentures,
(d) $6 million of debentures, to be offered to the public during
1969,
(e)  future financing to the extent of S/. 108 million for additic'ns
to the distribution system in 1969 and 1970,
(f) $4.3 million of two-year notes to be placed during the second
half of 1967.  The Swiss group (paragraph 3.03) is taking
more than half of these notes and has undertaken the
obligation either to extend $0.5 million of them in 1969 or
to convert them to a long-term loan. Peruvian financial
institutions are taking $2 million of the notes.
6.37      In view of the satisfactory markets existing for the Company's
shares and debentures in Peru and Switzerland and the active participation
of the Swiss holding group in financing the Company there is no reason to
doubt its ability to place these securities.
6.38      The issue mentioned in 6.36 (c) will have to be sold before the
proposed loan becomes effective. In addition the Company has confirmed
its intention of arranging the debenture issue mentioned in o.36 (d) and
the financing to the Bank's satisfaction of the 1969 and 1970 distribution
system requirements. As in the case of previous Bank loans the Company
will also undertake to offer shares for subscription if needed to carry
out and complete the project and to provide adequate working capital.
6.39      The Sources and Application of Funds Statement for the years
1967 through 1971 is shown in more detail in Akmex 7.

Future Earnings
6.40      Forecast income statements for the five years through 1971 are
showrm in Annex 6, and a surmmary Of the important financial ratios is given
in Annex 8.
6.41      Operating revenues have been calculated on the estimated increase
of sales at 14% during 1967 and at 10% per year subsequently. It has been
assumed that the tariffs will remain at their present level.
6.42      Operating expenses have been estimated by separate analysis of
the major items. An annual increase of about 15% in personnel expenses
is included, which is in line with the Company's experience in previous
years.
6.43      Although depreciation is projected at an average annual rate of
up to 5c% it is expected that the actual charges to be made would be about
4)-, which would be satisfactory.  Accordingly, the projected amounts under
this item include a margin.
6.44      Coverage of interest would be about 2.1 times in 1967 through
1970 with an improvement to 2.3 times in 1971. The rate of return on net
utility plant in operation would average about 8.9%.
Future Financial Position
6.45      The financial position of the Company is expected to remain sound.
The ratio of debt to total capitalization is expected to improve from 53%
at the end of 1967 to 48' at the end of 1971. Incurrence of excessive debt
would be prevented by the provisions of the indenture (paragraph 6.14).
The projected current position is satisfactory.
Debt Limitation Tests
6.46      Annex 8 shows that on the basis of the forecasts which include
all assumed items of new debt, the earnings and assets tests required under
the 1957 indenture will be met with adequate margins.
7. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The forecast of demand is based upon a detailed examination of
present requests for power, known increases in energy demand and complete
statistics over the past 20 years. The resulting annual average increase
of 10%dJ is reasonable and should be attained. (Paragraph 4.05).
7.02      The Matucana project would be required in 1971 to meet the
forecast increase in demand and to avoid a power shortage. (Paragraphs
4.05 and 5.12).
7.03      The cost estimates for the project are satisfactory and contingency
provisions are adequate. (Paragraph 5.09).



- 21 -
7.o4      The Company's management and staff are competent and with the
help of consultants are capable of undertaking the project satisfactorily.
(Paragraphs 3.08 and 5.06).
7.05      The financial position of the Company is sound and is expected
to remain so. The Company's perfonrance under previous Bank loans has
been satisfactory. (Paragraphs 3.05, 6.45 and 6.h6).
7.06      The financing plan for the Company's acquisition and construction
program is sound. The Company should be able to meet about 65 percent of
its cost out of sources other than borrowings (paragraph 6.33).
7.07      The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$17.5 million
equivalent including US$l.5 million for interest during construction, for a
term of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years, provided that prior
to the effectiveness of the proposed loan:
(a) A supplemental indenture be issued for the purpose of
securing a new series of debentures, comprising the proposed
loan (paragraph 6.15), and
(b)  the Borrower has sold an issue of Debentures in an aggregate
principal amount of Swiss francs 25 million (paragraph 6.38).
7.08      During the negotiations the following assurances were obtained:
(a)  The Guarantor has agreed to give satisfactory assurances
against alterations of the Electric Industry Law
(paragraph 6.06);
(b)  the Borrower will continue to use Consultants for the purposes
agreed to in Loan 464-PE (paragraph 3.08);
(c)  the Borrower agrees that the need for funds to assure that
the Matucana project will be carried out has priority over
the purchase of assets from Hidrandina (paragraph 3.12).
Prior to carrying out the remaining two stages of the
acquisition plan, the Borrower will obtain the Bank's
agreement with the manner in which each transfer of assets
will be financed. He will also consult with the Bank in case
problems arise in the execution of the plan (paragraph 3.16);
(d)  the Borrower's Financing Plan includes the issues mentioned
in paragraph 6.36. He will consult the Bank as to any changes
he proposes to make in the Financing Plan (paragraph 6.32).
(e)  prior to making additions to its transmission and distribution
system in 1969 and 1970, the Borrower will submit to the
Bank for its agreement, proposals for their financing
(paragraph 6.38).
(f)  the Borro-wer will offer shares for subscription if needed to
carrJ out and complete the project and to provide adequate
working capital (paragraph 6.38).

THE MANTARO PROJECT
Introduction
Since 1945 the Mantaro River, which is located on the eastern
slope of the Andes and forms part of the head waters of the Amazon River,
has been studied as a potential source of hydro electric energy. It was
described in the general plan of electrification for Peru in 1956 by
Electricite de France and in 1960 was featured in the Arthur D. Little
plan for national development called "Peruvia".
In 1961, by law 13769, the govecnment formed the Mantaro Corporation
(CORMNA) to undertake the development of the Mantaro valley including the
iviantaro hydroelectric project.
In 1962 the government signed a contract with a consortium of
European firms (Wimpey, Siemens, and English Electric) to construct and
partially finance the first stage of the NMantaro project. The contract
was cancelled in 1966 after prolonged attempts to renegotiate it and a
newcontract was signed the same year with a group of Italian firms (Impresit
and GIE) which has undertaken to construct the project and finance a
substantial part of the cost at, what are claimed to be, more advantageous
conditions for Peru.
The Project
The complete Mantaro scheme would be located on the double bend of
the IMiantaro aiver (see attachment 1) and would consist of:
(i)  An 80 m., high concrete dam to divert the river above the fiLst
bend.
(ii) A 19.3 km long tunnel to convey the waters to a penstock and
powerhouse located above the second bend in the river.
(iii)  Future tunnels and powerhouse in the second bend of the river.
(iv)  1,000 km. of 200 kV transmission lines to connect the Mantaro
plant with Lima, Ica and eventually Marcona. See lMap 2.
The Project to be constructed by the Italian group of companies
would consist of the civil works for stages I and II, see attachment 1, and
the installation of the first three generating units of 11 14.I each to give
an initial capacity of 342 Nl. The second group of three similar generating
units would be installed after the first three units were loaded and would
be timed to meet the demand beyond that point.
Construction of the 220 kV transmission lines between Lima and Ica
is to be started this year so as to foster the development of the Ica power
market by supplying it from Lima Light's system until Mantaro is ready. The
transmission lines from the plant to the cities of Lima and Ica are to be
ready for service when the plant is completed.



Annex 1
Progress and Construction Schedule
The workers camps, access road and the main tunnel addits have
been constructed and work started on the diversion tunnel at the dam
site. Final designs on the major components of the project are being
prepared.
The critical item is the main tunnel which is scheduled for
completion in five years. The first 114 MW generating unit is scheduled
for service at the beginning of 1972 with the 2nd and 3rd units coming
into service at about 6 months intervals to complete the first stage of
the project (342 MW) by early 1973.
The market study made by CORMAN shows that even if this
construction schedule is achieved there will be a shortage of generating
capacity before Mantaro is ready and about a 100 MW plant would have to
be constructed for service by 1971 to meet the forecast demand, princi-
pally on the Lima Light system.
The annual increment of demand in the Greater Lima area is
forecast to reach 50 to 60 MW by 1972. See Annex 2. It is estimated
that the intercoraiected system formed by the 220 kV transmission lines
connecting Lima, Ica and Mantaro would have an annual increment of
dermand of about 100 MW which would be supplied by the Mantaro plant
beg ni.ting in 1973 and which would justify the planned addition of one
114 MW unit to Mantaro each year.

LOAD FORECAST AND SYSTEM OPERATION
The Company keeps continuous records of the demand and sales for
each category of customer in the various regions of the comrpany's service
area (see attachment 1). These statistics are reviewed monthly0 In
addition a special record and analysis is made of large new installations
which are being planned or constructed in the market area. These data
enable the company to prepare a very accurate and detailed forecast of
growLth for the 2 to 3 oncoming years and a reasonable further projection
on which to plan capacity additions to the system.
The long term forecast for the Lima Light System is based upon
the performiance of tlhe past 20 years during which the average annual increase
in demand was 10%. The growth during the years prior to the passage of the
Electric Industry Law in 1956 was slow but since then the rate has been
accelerating and reached 12% in 1966. The rate of growth during the first
three months of 1967 was 14%.
The important consideration in the present case, is to show how
the various plants, both existing and planned, will operate to supply the
forecast demand of the Lima Light System. See attachment 2.
Two sets of curves have been supplied to illustrate this,
(1) that for 1972 when the Matucana plant would be in service and
(2) that for 1974 when the first stage of lIantaro (342 14W) is expected
to be completed. The upper curve in both cases is the forecast of hourly
demand on a typical working day to show the maximum peaks expected during
the day and in the evening and the lesser hourly demand for the resb of
the time. The lower curves show how the capacity of the various plants
on the system would be utilized to contribute their share towards
meeting the demand.
It will be noted that each of the plants has been arranged to
operate in a manner most suited to its characteristics in order to obtain
full use of its output and the maximum efficiency from the system. The
Huinco plant has the only important storage reservoir and consequently
is allocated the function of meeting the system peak. Both IIatucana and
Mantaro are given some lesser peaking responsibility but are principally
base load plants.  The remaining older plants are all sited below Huinco
and Matucana and have no individual storage basins, hence they must
operate as base load, run of the river plants to make full use of the
water wihich otherwise would be spilled and wasted.
It will be noted that in 1972, if I4atucana were not constructed
there would be a power shortage. With Matucana in service there is a
smalI reserve of capaci-ty. By 1973 some energy will be needed from
Hantaro and by the end of that year Matucana would be fully loaded.
Any delay in the completion of l4antaro beyond its scheduled date in
1973 would result in a power shortage.  In view of the effort to maintain
a conservative forecast of demand, it is conceivable that it may be
exceeded in which case the need for the completion of the IMantaro as
scheduled would become even more important.



i-nnex 2
Page 2
The Mantaro Project, as already described in Annex one, would
provide for an interconnected system serving all Central Peru and there-
fore, the Mantaro plant would supply a greater area than covered by the
Lima Light market. At present Lima Light supplies about 70% of the
market and the major mines about 29%. The Mantaro Corporation is
discussing with the mines the possibility of supplying their power
requirements. The remainder of the present demand is very small, but
with the availability of adequate power supplies in the region between
Ica and Lima, numerous small and existing high cost captive thermal
plants used for irrigation and small industry, estimated to total about
40 MW, are expected to convert to purchasing power from the Mantaro
systems and at the same time the overall demand is expected to increase
materially.
To foster the development of the Mantaro market in the central
region, Lima Light has been requested by the Mantaro Corporation and the
Government to cooperate by selling power to these areas through newi
transmission lines to be built by the Mantaro Corporation. These
additional loadz while initially small, strengthen the need for the
construction of the Matucana plant and eventually will create a larger
market for Mantaro power.

2..        The year 1966 was another good year for Peru. GNP at constant
prices is estim?ted to have risen by -  percent, and if the gain result-
ing from the improvement in the terms of trade is added, the increase in
real income was nearly 0  3ercent.  A feature of 1966 was the sharp rise
in coPper and fihmrneal prices which helped towards an increase of almost
15 percent in total export earnings. Taking the period since 1959, Peru's
external receipts on current account, net of profit remittances by foreign
companies, have risen by an average of 12-13 percent a year.
2.         The outlook for the immediate future is, however, less encouraging.
Copper prices have already fallen sharply, and the fishmeal industry is
caught in a squeeze between rising costs and a recession of prices from the
abnormally high levels reached in the early part of 1966. Consequently,
although the long-term export outlook looks favorable, particularly with
respect to minerals, the prospect of any significant increase in export
earnings during the next three years is distinctly uncertain.
3.         While production and exports have both risen sharply during the
past two years, internal demand - and related demand for imports - has risen
even faster. As a result, the balance of payments on current account has
moved from approximate balance in 1964 to deficits of $126 million in 1965
and $167 million in 1966 (see Table 3). Whereas merchandise export earn-
ings increased by about 15 percent between 1964 and 1966, imports rose by
nearly 40 percent. These additional imports have been mainly financed by
a sharp increase in borrowing abroad in the form of both long-term develop-
ment assistance and of medium and long-term credits from foreign banks gi1d
suppliers. Gross disbursements of foreign loans to the public sector alone
(including changes in external balances of State development banks and the
Bank of the Nation) have risen from $103 million in 1964 to $146 million in
1965 and $212 million last year. In spite of this increase in foreign bor-
rowing, the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Central Reserve Bank
declined by $22 million in 1966.
4.         The worsening of the external balance of payments has been accom-
panied by a fairly sharp increase in domestic prices. The official cost-of-
iJ/ This Memorandum was circulated to the Consultative Group for
Peru on July 5, 1967.

living index for Lima and Callao rose by 15 percent during 1965 and by
nearly 8 percent in the course of 1966. A further increase of 3 percent
took place during the first four months of 1967.
5.         Rising public expenditures, imposed on the steady growth of
private demand for consumption and investment, have been the principal
cause of the inflationary pressures to which the economy has been sub-
jected during the past two years. The Government of President Belaunde:
has firmly committed itself to improving the condition of the people, to
opening up the interior of the country and to making more land available
for cultivation through massive investments in roads (mainly in the in-
terior) and irrigation (on the coast). The costs of these programs have
in general been greatly underestimated, and expenditures have been running
well ahead of the estimates included in the annual budgets. The most pro-
nounced increases to date have been in the pay of public employees, espe-
cially teachers, and in public works, especially road construction. Con-
siderable sums have been invested by public agencies in middle class hous-
ing, and there has also been a large expansion of hospital building. The
irrigation progam has not yet got fully under way, but major new commit-
ments may be made during the next twelve months. To add to the pressure
on resources, military expenditures are being very sharply stepped up this
year after a period of about ten years during which they have risen rela-
tively little.
6.         The Peruvian Congress, which is controlled by a coalition of
parties opposed to the Government, has not been prepared to vote the taxes
needed to pay for these expenditures, and the overall fiscal deficit of
the Central Government that has to be financed from the domestic banking
system, foreign bank credits and cash credits from suppliers rose from
SI. 2.7 billion in 1965 to S/. 3.7 billion in 1966 (equivalent to 2.7 per-
cent of GNP).   Borrowing from the Central Reserve Bank alone amounted in
fiscal 1966 to over S/. 2 billion and resulted in an excessive monetary
expansion, with consequent pressures on internal prices and the balance
of payments. Borrowing abroad, which on a gross commitment basis totalled
over $300 million in 1966, included general purpose borrowing of $32.5 mil-
lion net in New York and cash credcLt of $19 million from suppliers (in
addition to equipment credits).
7.         These figures indicate a very sharp deterioration in the savings
effort of the public sector.   In 1964 public savings amounted to over S/. 2
billion and were sufficient to finance about half of public investment.
When the Consultative Group for Peru was convened a year ago, it was on
the understanding that the Peruvian Government would take steps to enewe
that over 50 percent of the public investment program was financed out of
public savings and non-inflationary domestic sources. In practice, total
public savings in 1966 appear to have been negative to the extent of nearly



S/. 0.5 billion    leaving half of the public investment program to be
financed out of net external borrowing and the other half from internal
borrowing from the banking system.
8.         As indicated in the memorandum distributed in February of this
year (PER 67-1), the fiscal situation, as reflected in the deficit in
1966 and the prospective deficit for 1967, has turned out to be much more
serious than was foreseen a year ago. This is partly because the revenues
estimates in the 1966 Budget proved overly optimistic, and partly because
the increases in expenditure on teachers' salaries greatly exceeded the
Government's expectations. Last year's experience has highlighted the
need for major improvements in Budget preparation and in control of expen-
ditures, and the International Monetary Fund is responding to a request
from the Peruvian Government to provide technical assistance in these
fields by sending a fiscal team to Lima for a period of two years from
July 1967.
The Budget and the Balance of Payments
9.         The Peruvian Government was originally planning to introduce
legislation for new taxes in time to make new tax laws effective before
the end of 1966. The Government did in fact put forward proposals for a
modest package of tax reforms last December, and a tax reform commission
was asked to report on these proposals by the end of February 1967. The
proposals were based on recommendations made by an OAS tax group and in-
cluded the introduction of a real estate tax and a tax on the net assets
of incorporated businesses. The tax commission was also asked to consider
ways of reducing the large number of tax exemptions at present in effect.
However, the discussion in the commission was protracted, and the Govern-
ment has so far failed to get the support of Congress for a tax reform.
10.        Another step taken by the Government last December, and in this
case approved by Congress, was the introduction of a freeze on the basic
salaries, supplementary remunerations and special allowances (except fam-
ily allowances) of the civilian personnel of the public administration,
including teachers. In spite of this freeze, however, public expenditures
have continued to run way ahead of-revenues, and the Finance Minister
announced in the middle of May this year that the prospective deficit in the
1967 Budget was over V/. 5 billion.
11.        Earlier, in January-February of this year, an economic mission
from the Bank visited Peru to review the latest developments and the pros-
pects for the 1967 Budget, and to establish with the Peruvian authorities
See Table 2.  The current account deficit shown in this table may be
slightly over-estimated, since information on the revenues of the irdep-
endent public sector is incomplete, and some current revenues may be in-
cluded in "capital revenues".



- 4 -
a public investment program and financing plan for 1967 and 1968. The
mission concluded that, in the short run, action to deal with the fiscal
deficit of the Central Government was of paramount importance, and that
measures were urgently required to mobilise an additional S/. 3½ billion
in 1967 and over S/. 51 billion in 1968 from increases in the revenues
and reductions in the expenditures of the Central Government. If such
measures were taken, the mission estimated that public savings would be
sufficient to finance rather over 40 percent of public investment in
1967 and close to 50 percent in 1968. Some additional general purpose
borrowing abroad might then be justified to help in covering the remain-
ing deficit.
12.        The situation was brought to a head around the middle of May by
severe pressures on the balance of payments stemming from continued deficit
financing and growing lack of confidence in the sol. On May 19 Congress
passed an emergency law authorizing the Government, among other things,
to reduce the 1967 Budget by S/. 1½ billion, to introduce changes in import
duties which were to be subsequently enacted by decree, and to reduce the
tax concessions extended under the industrial promotion laws. The law al-
so provided .for a change in the dates of the fiscal year, extending the
present year through March 1968. Decrees specifying the expenditure cuts
and a new schedule of import duties were publiched early in June. It is
too early to assess the impact of these measures, but it seems probable
that they will still leave a substantial uncovered deficit in the 1967
Budget. The expenditure cuts are not likely to be fully effective and they
will in any case be offset to some extent by additional expenditures on
military equipment not included in the 1967 Budget. The changes in import
duties, together with the curtailment of tax concessions and exemptions,
might produce extra revenues of the order of SI. 2½ billion in a full year,
but the full effect will not be felt in 1967.
13.        The action taken by Congress in mid-May put a stop to the run on
foreign exchange reserves, and in the period up to June 20 no further loss
of reserves took place. Peru's external capital position has, however,
deteriorated sharply during the past year. Medium and long-term public and
publicly-guaranteed external debt outstanding (including undisbursed commit-
ments) has risen from $580 million at the end of 1964 to $675 million at
mid-1966 and around $900 million by the end of 1966.   In addition, substan-
tial short-term borrowing has taken place this year from banks in the
United States and Canada. The gold and foreign exchange holdings of the
Central Reserve Bank declined by $45 million during the first five and a
half months of the year and on June 20 stood at $106 million.    Against this,
must be set substantial short-term liabilities incurred abroad by other
official banking institutions.
14.        Further measures are going to be required to deal with the under-
lying deficits in the Budget and the balance of payments. A draft of the
1968 Budget has to be presented to Congress by the end of August this year,



and the Government has confirmed its intention of proposing definite
action on the OAS tax reform package in time for the new laws to be
fully operative in fiscal 1968. Other measures which need to be con-
sidered in order to achieve a lasting increase in public savings in-
clude additional taxes on gasoline and diesel oil, the continued sus-
pension of the law relating to increases in teachers' salaries and
deferment of at least part of the projected increase in military out-
lays.
15.        In view of the very large commitments for external financing
already {entered into, particularly in the transport sector, there is
little scope for achieving budgetary savings from cuts in public invest-
ment.  Some marginal cuts could nevertheless be made.   The Government
should meanwhile be very cautious about entering into new project commit-
ments until the fiscal situation is greatly improved. In particular, no
start should be made for the time being with any major new highway or
irrigation projects, and the hospital building program should in any case
be reduced.
Economic Prospects
16.        Economic growth in Peru has been closely associated with the
expansion of exports, and the external balance of payments is likely to
remain the key determinant in the development of the economy over the
next 5-10 years. Peru has a considerable long-term growth potential, and
as long as the investment climate remains attractive to private capital,
there appear to be good prospects for the renewed expansion of exports in
the early 1970s based principally on likely new investments in copper and
phosphates, with some possibilities also in petroleum. Tourism is another
source of export earnings which could well be developed faster if more
hotels are built, as presently planned, and if prices can be brought down
to more reasonable levels. Export forecasts prepared by the Bank economic
mission are set out in Table 4.
17.        There are also good possibilities for economically sound import
substitution in agriculture and in certain branches of manufacturing indus-
try (e.g. fertilisers, the further processing of minerals and manufacture
of wood). Agricultural production, however, has been lagging, and it is most
important that a special effort should be made to increase production of
food by offering more attractive price incentives to the farmer, increased
use of fertiliser and improvements in marketing and credit. This will almost
certainly require a relative increase in food prices. On the industrial
side, particular care has to be taken to avoid excessive protection, and
it is highly desirable that the numerous tax concessions at present granted
to industry should be greatly reduced.



- 6 -
18.        Historically, the performance of the Peruvian economy has been
rather exceptional - a high growth rate supported by high levels of pri-
vate savings and investment and a well diversified export trade; low
consumption on the part of the majority of the population; and less infla-
tion than in many other Latin American countries. There are admittedly
factors which may lead to difficulties in future. For one thing, the
forces making for social and economic reform and for the more equal dis-
tribution of income are likely to curb somewhat the exuberance of a tra-
ditionally private enterprise economy. Moreover, there are serious short-
comings in public administration which will take time and experience to
remedy. It would be reasonable therefore to expect some slowing down in
the pace of growth; and inflation may well become more of a problem in
the future. Nevertheless, the economy remains basically sound, and although
external public debt has risen sharply during the past two years, there
remains a margin of creditworthiness for additional external borrowing even
if some of the present weaknesses in government policy persist. With bet-
ter economic management the margin would be substantial.
19.        Projections of external debt are set out in Table 5. Service on
existing external public debt rises from an estimated $89 million in 1966
to $110 million in 1968, stays at around this level through 1970 and then
declines to $54 million in 1975. During the peak years 1968-70 projected
debt service will absorb close to 13 percent of Peru's current account
earnings net of profit remittances by major foreign mining companies. If
service on private debt is added, the debt service ratio would be in the
range of 15-20 percent. This is a fairly high figure and suggests the
desirability of extended grace periods for new loans contracted in the near
future. Beyond 1970 the picture improves considerably, and given sound
economic policies and appropriate restraints on the use of suppliers' cre.'
dits and medium-term bank loans, the public sector should be able to go on
borrowing abroad at a rate of at least $L00-150 million a year without un-
duly straining its debt servicing capacity.
20.        Peru will not be able to take full advantage of the economic op-
portunities that lie ahead without a marked improvement in its recent econ-
omic policies, especially in the sphere of fiscal management. The Govern-
ment's long-term financial and economic policies should focus on the need
for mobilising larger public savings, on reshaping the tax structure so as
to increase taxation of the upper and middle income groups and on improving
the present very disorganised financial system. At the same time great im-
portance should be attached to encouraging agricultural production for the
domestic market, to exploiting all possible opportunities for export promo-
tion and to discouraging consumption of imports and the export of capital
(without, however, resorting to direct controls which would probably be
counter-productive).   These are the directions in which government policy
has to move if there is to be justification for continued support by the
Consultative Group of Peru's public development program.
