1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. THE MONGOLIAN ECONOMY
Background
1.1   Compared with many other low-income countries, Mongolia's economy is
relatively well diversified. The agricultural sector, focusing primarily on livestock,
accounts for about 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Industry accounts for
about 45 percent of GDP, including mining, processed wool, cashmere, leather, food and
construction materials. The service sector accounts for the balance, including a large
government sector, a weak banking system, and a growing wholesale and retail trading
sector.
1.2   Although Mongolia encompasses an area between Russia and China of 1.6
million square kilometers, which is about half the size of India, the country has a
population of only 2.2 million people. Almost 60 percent of the population is urban, with
over one-quarter of the people living in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Per capita GDP in
1993 is estimated at only $320, but the population is well educated, with an adult literacy
rate of 96 percent.
1.3   Although independent, Mongolia was closely allied with the former Soviet Union
during 1921-90, and isolated from the rest of the world. Mongolia was built into a
centrally-planned economy with a communist political system. Until 1990, the country
received substantial aid from the Soviet Union equivalent to 30 percent of its GDP.
Soviet aid was used to build an industrial/mineral base and the country's transportation
and energy systems. Mongolia enjoyed a "captive" market for its products in Council of
Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries.
1.4   Mongolia suffered greatly when Soviet aid stopped in 1990 and trade with the
CMEA was disrupted. Real GDP declined by 20 percent in 1990-93 and both exports
and imports fell sharply. The shock was compounded by shortages of spare parts and
machinery from the former Soviet Union, used extensively in Mongolian industries.
Inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 100 percent in 1991, and continued to rise,
reaching 331 percent in 1993. These circumstances helped precipitate political change,
and in 1992 general elections were held under a new democratic constitution.
Economic Trends and Reforms
1.5   Mongolia has implemented a series of economic reforms since 1990 aimed at
stabilizing economic performance and restructuring the economy into a market-based
system. Positive results have been achieved during the last two years. Gross domestic



- 2 -
product grew by 2.5 percent, rising to an estimated 6.3 percent in 1995. Inflation has
softened to 50 to 60 percent per year during 1994 and 1995. Shortages of goods have
subsided, and the balance of payments crisis has eased. The exchange rate has remained
relatively stable since May 1993. Compared to most Republics of the former Soviet
Union, the 1990-93 decline was less severe, and Mongolia is one of the few to have
resumed positive growth. Factors contributing to this include: (a) implementation of
tough monetary, fiscal and exchange rate measures; (b) successful privatization of
virtually all herds and small-scale enterprises; (c) timely international donor support
during the early crisis years; (d) political stability; and (e) steady Government
commitment to reforms. The Government and society at large are aware that a return to
the past is impossible and emphasize that a market-oriented economy based on
democratic principles is central to their development philosophy.
1.6   The current economic reform agenda remains broad and ambitious, including:
(a)   Continued efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability, in part through
further efforts to tighten credit expansion, reduce subsidized credit, and
implement tax reforms;
(b)   Continued efforts to reduce public expenditures and especially subsidies
for urban transport, social security, and energy;
(c)   Reform of public enterprises, expansion of the role of the private sector in
large firms, and introduction of a secondary market for company shares, in
order to increase enterprise autonomy, accountability, commercial focus
and efficiency;
(d)   Commercialization and strengthening of the banking system; and
(e)   Improvement of the operating environment for the emerging market
system through further legal and regulatory system reforms and
institutional development.
1.7   With continued implementation of the Government's stabilization and reform
program, Mongolia has good prospects for economic growth. Provided that no large
external shocks are encountered and the stable political environment is maintained, GDP
growth levels of 4 to 5 percent per year may be maintained into the next century.
B. ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE
1.8   Domestically produced coal is Mongolia's dominant fuel, accounting for
80 percent of primary commercial energy supply in 1993 (see Table 1.1). Petroleum
products imported from Russia account for about 19 percent of primary energy supply,
and imports of electricity from Russia complete the commercial energy balance.

1.9    Domestic coal production accounts for 80 percent of the country's primary energy
supply. Mongolia's cities and large towns are constructed around coal-fired combined
heat-and-power (CHP) plants, which provide electricity and district heat to urban
residents during Mongolia's very severe and long winter. Ulaanbaatar, the coldest capital
in the world, is dependent upon three such CHP plants of Russian design. The plants are
supplied by rail with lignite produced in three major open-pit mines. The CHP plants, in
turn, provide about 85 percent of the nation's electricity supply, district heat for about
one-half of the large urban population, and steam for a number of industries. Mongolia's
urban economy and population are critically dependent upon the systems.
1.10   Energy production fell sharply with the economic crisis of the early 1990s. Coal
production fell 35 percent from a peak of 8.6 million tons in 1988 to 5.5 million tons in
1993 and 1994. Electricity sales in the main system fell from 2,800 GWh in 1989 to
1,936 GWh in 1993. Energy demand fell with the decline in economic activity, but the
sharper decline in energy production resulted in chronic power outages, severe coal
shortages, and inadequate supply of home heating. Without Soviet assistance, sufficient
spare parts, or enough funds to cover regular operating costs, maintenance and repairs,
the coal-power-heat system has fallen into serious disrepair. Output in the three main
coal mines and available firm capacity in the CHP plants both fell to about 65 percent of
design levels by 1993. Performance at each part of the system is now precarious and
notoriously unreliable. Although the decline in coal and electricity production was



arrested in 1994, it has been difficult each winter to meet the minimum basic energy
needs of the urban population.
1.11  Energy production levels, and particularly the reliability of the coal-power-heat
system, must stabilize and then increase modestly to both overcome existing shortages
and provide sufficient energy for economic growth. Medium-term sector development
needs to focus on renovation and improvement of existing facilities.  Substantial
improvements in the efficiency of energy use can be achieved, with the greatest potential
for improvements existing in the electric power and district heating industries themselves.
C. ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
1.12 The Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mines (MEGM) is the government agency
responsible for policy and regulation of the energy sector. It also remains heavily
involved in the operation of many of the various energy companies, although this
relationship is being reformed (paras. 1.15-1.17). MEGM's Mining Department is
responsible for coal production, while the Energy Department is responsible for heat and
power supply. Energy companies traditionally overseen by MEGM include (a) the
Central Energy System (CES), which is the umbrella organization responsible for the
main power grid, the five major CHP plants, and the associated district heating systems;
(b) the individual coal mines; (c) the Energy Utility Organizations (EUOs), supplying
heat and electricity in areas not covered by CES; (d) the Mongolian Petroleum Company,
in charge of petroleum exploration and development; and (e) the Nuurs Company, a state-
owned enterprise, which both assists MEGM in certain regulatory matters and is involved
in coal retail sales to small consumers and supply of equipment and spare parts for the
mines. Petroleum product imports, distribution and most sales are undertaken by the Neft
Import Concern (NIC).
D. SECTOR ISSUES AND STRATEGY
1.13  Expanded investment for the rehabilitation of Mongolia's coal-power-heat system
is critically needed to improve the reliability of supply and meet the needs of the
economy and urban population.  To provide sustainable results, however, sector
development efforts must address the underlying fundamental problems in the sector,
including pressing needs to modernize obsolete technology, improve operational
management, increase efficiency and reduce costs, and put energy companies on a
reasonable financial footing. During 1990-94, the Government and international donor
community successfully focused on short-term, emergency remedies to avoid a
devastating breakdown in the system during the winter months. As detailed in IDA's
recent energy sector report (Mongolia Energy Sector Review, Report 14586 MOG, 1995),
sector development must now focus on medium-term investments, institutional reform,
restructuring of energy companies, and energy price reform.

Improving the Reliability of Energy Supply
1.14  Rehabilitation of existing coal mines, CHP plants and the district heating system
is the least-cost means over the medium term to provide primary fuel, baseload electric
power, and heating for currently connected heat consumers. Stable production of the
system will require completion of postponed basic repairs, selected improvements in
technology, improved company management, and an upgrading in manpower skills. Coal
sector needs include replacement of the obsolete rail overburden removal system at the
Baganuur mine with modem mobile equipment and investments to improve coal quality,
as well as basic repairs and equipment upgrading. Priorities in the CHP plants and
district heating systems include completion of major overhauls of boilers and auxiliary
facilities, reduction of system losses, and possible conversion of heating systems from
constant to variable flow. Renovation of the smaller, isolated electric power systems, in
addition to the main system, is also critical in some cases. Development of domestic
capacity to meet the power system's load variations and better regulate frequencies, as
opposed to the current dependence upon the interconnection with Russia in these areas,
also is a Govermment priority. In the petroleum sector, areas for focus include securing of
stable, long-term contracts for petroleum products at least cost and risk to the country,
and further exploration of domestic resources, followed by possible development.
Institutional Reform and Energy Company Restructuring
1.15  In addition to investment, sustainable gains in sector performance will require
improvements in management, operational efficiency and cost-control, through sector
reform. Under the planned economy, energy enterprises were managed and operated
essentially as subdepartments of MEGM, with insufficient accountability and incentives
for proper performance. Under the emerging market economy, efficiency improvements
can be achieved with clear separation of the roles and responsibilities of the government
and the companies, and increases in both the autonomy and accountability of the energy
companies. The Government is moving steadily in this direction, with the established
goal to transform MEGM into the policy and regulatory agency for the sector, transfer
operational management to the individual companies, and transfer ownership to the
private sector, public ownership overseen by a separate agency, or combinations of the
two. The legal underpinning for these reforms is being established through past and
proposed legislation on business entities, implementation of a new Minerals Law (that
includes coal mining), and preparation of a new Energy Law, focusing on the electricity
and heat subsectors.
1.16  During the first phase of Mongolia's privatization program, a number of small-
scale energy operations were fully privatized, including some of the smaller coal mines.
As a pilot case for large companies in the energy sector, the Baganuur Joint Stock
Company (BJSC) was restructured in June 1995 into a joint shareholding company, with
25 percent private ownership, and a new corporate governance structure (paras. 3.6-3.8).
Following on this experience, creation of additional shareholding companies is planned.



- 6 -
1.17 Virtually all energy companies urgently need to complete internal restructuring
reforms to improve efficiency. Company management must focus on improving financial
performance, improving maintenance, and increasing cost-consciousness and subunit
accountability. Internal financial management and reporting systems need to be
revamped, and, as in other Mongolian enterprises, the transition to International
Accounting Standards (IAS) must be completed.
Energy Pricing and Financial Sustainability
1.18  With the possible exception of NIC, the petroleum product supply company, the
financial position of Mongolia's main energy companies remains poor, and must be
improved for these companies to become sustainable commercial enterprises. Under the
centrally planned economy, pricing policy was geared to enable producers to meet cash
operating costs, with the Government, assisted with Soviet aid, providing capital
requirements. Reforms have now been initiated, but must be completed, to ensure
financial self-sufficiency of these companies.
1.19  The principal source of the financial problems is that revenue generated from
electricity and heat prices is too low, causing a lack of sufficient cash flow throughout the
energy system. In November 1994, the average price for electricity from CES was
increased by 28 percent to Tg 15.6 (¢3.5) per kWh, and the average heat price was
increased to Tg 30 (06.7) per square meter per month of heated space. Nevertheless, this
increase was insufficient to allow CES to recover financially, and in 1995 CES has
continued to be unable to fully meet its cash operating costs and major repair needs, let
alone make a contribution to the large investment required for renovation. Average
electricity prices, accounting for 80 percent of revenues, remain at 50 to 60 percent of
estimated long-run marginal cost (LRMC) levels, while heat prices are about 30 percent
of LRMC. CES's poor financial position has in turn helped cause cash shortages for the
coal mines, railways and petroleum suppliers, due to lack of payment for energy
deliveries. CES's accounts receivable to the coal mines and railways increased steadily
through early 1995, and only leveled off and declined during the later part of 1995,
following institution of new intercompany agreements (para. 1.22).
1.20 The Government recognizes that CES's revenues must be increased, and is
committed to improving CES's financial position through step-by-step output price
increases and implementation of programs to reduce losses and improve bill collection.
The Government is planning to increase electricity prices in 1996, beginning with an
expected increase of 15 to 20 percent. Substantial increases will be required, in both
electricity and heat prices, to fully restore CES's financial position and to ensure the
country's fiscal health.  With technical and nontechnical losses in the electricity
distribution system rising from about 290 GWh in 1993 to 445 GWh in 1994, successful
implementation of new efforts to reduce system losses could provide additional relief.
Further efforts are being made to reduce the level of accounts receivable. Although the
level of unpaid bills was not alarmingly high in October 1995, at the equivalent to



42 days of sales revenue, it has grown sharply since the 1994 price increase. Further IDA
assistance is planned in these areas (para. 1.23).
1.21  In mid-1994, coal prices were broadly sufficient to enable the main coal mines to
break even financially, and were generally close to the economic LRMC. However,
prices must be regularly adjusted to avoid erosion due to inflation and currency
devaluation. With no such adjustment during 1994 and 1995, coal prices have fallen
below economic cost and need to be increased in real terms to allow the sector to generate
enough funds for future investment (paras. 2.20-2.23). Average petroleum product prices
are tied in principle to international prices and economic cost, but there is a need to make
price adjustments less bureaucratic and more automatic.
1.22  With insufficient revenue entering the coal-power-heat system, energy companies
have become burdened with serious intercompany arrears. The situation improved
somewhat during the latter part of 1995. In the case of payments from the Ulaanbaatar
CHP plants to BJSC and Mongol Railways, for example, mutual agreements reached in
mid-1995, outlining full payments for coal deliveries and gradual payment of previously
incurred accounts payable, have been honored. The Government intends to continue its
efforts to make consumers more accountable to meet contractual obligations under the
law, and to adhere to intercompany agreements to gradually resolve the high accounts
receivable and payable built up over many months.
E. THE ROLE OF THE ASSOCIATION
1.23  In coordination with other donor agencies, and consistent with the emphasis on
removing infrastructure bottlenecks set out in the June 1995 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), the Association has developed a medium-term energy assistance program of
sector work, technical assistance and lending activities to support Mongolia's efforts to
rehabilitate and reform its energy sector. At the November 1994 international donors
meeting on Mongolia, the donor agencies and the Government agreed that investments to
stabilize energy production to meet the basic needs of the urban population and industrial
and commercial enterprises were an especially urgent priority. Accordingly, the Japanese
Government and Asian Development Bank agreed to finance rehabilitation investments in
the power and heat system, and IDA agreed to finance necessary accompanying
rehabilitation measures in the upstream coal subsector. A broad sector dialogue with the
Government and foundation for future assistance was established with completion of the
Mongolia Energy Sector Review in mid-1995. Planned IDA support during 1995-96
includes this proposed Coal Sector Project and technical assistance activities, executed
through the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), focusing on
electricity and heat price reform issues, implementation of an electric power loss
reduction program, measures to improve bill collection, and means to improve the
efficiency of operations and dispatch of the electricity and heat system. An additional
energy sector lending operation is proposed for FY98.

1.24 Lessons Learned. Prior to the Sector Review, previous IDA involvement in
Mongolia's energy sector was limited to modest emergency assistance for the coal
industry, as part of Economic Rehabilitation Credit (1991) and Economic Transition
Support Credit (1993). This assistance, coordinated closely with that of other donors,
successfully helped to avert a collapse in coal, power and heat production. However, the
experience of the emergency donor assistance efforts in the sector also showed that
support to meet urgent replacement equipment and spare parts needs, coupled with short-
term technical assistance efforts, could only at best provide a temporary stop-gap solution
to the sector's deterioration in performance. Experience has shown that sustainable
improvements in performance will require support for more concentrated, medium-term
investments in technology modernization, coupled with policy reforms and company
restructuring to provide incentives for critical improvements in productivity, maintenance
and operations management.
1.25  Experience in the only sector investment project in Mongolia approved to date,
the Transport Rehabilitation Project (1994), has shown the importance of institutional
strengthening to achieve smooth project implementation. In the proposed project, the
potential risks for project implementation of weak institutional capabilities are mitigated
substantially as only one beneficiary is involved in the investment program. The
management team of the beneficiary, BJSC, prepared the full Project Implementation
Plan, with international technical assistance and close IDA supervision.  BJSC's
management team will continue to be responsible for project implementation, utilizing
substantial project technical assistance and training where necessary.
1.26  IDA experience in coal projects in other countries has been mixed, with some
successes and some disappointing results. Where problems have developed, this has been
due to sector and institutional difficulties and the "greenfield" nature of the projects.
Although several new projects are under preparation, lending for coal production in
recent years, in the former Soviet Union or eastern Europe for example, has been
constrained by insufficient institutional reform, massive work force reduction
requirements, and large cross-subsidies in coal pricing systems. The proposed operation
is far simpler than most, focusing on the rehabilitation of one existing mining operation,
which already has an infrastructure base, trained manpower, and well-established output
marketing arrangements.  To ensure smooth project implementation, institutional
improvements at the mine and necessary changes in its operating environment have been
stressed in project preparation and are emphasized in project design and credit
conditionality.
Role of This Project
1.27  IDA's first energy operation in Mongolia, the proposed project is part of a
coordinated effort of the international donors to provide assistance, on an urgent basis, to
stabilize production and improve the reliability of Mongolia's core energy infrastructure,
required to support the country's urban economy and population. The project includes
medium-term investments to modernize mining methods and stabilize production at



- 9 -
designed levels at the Baganuur coal mine, which is the main source of primary energy
for the urban energy system. The project also supports the restructuring of one of the
largest energy companies into a commercially focused joint public/private shareholding
company. The project supports completion of the corporate restructuring of the Baganuur
Joint Stock Company, intemal reorganization of operations, conversion to international
accounting standards, and implementation of improved mechanisms to monitor
performance and improve cost control. Also, in support of the Mongolia CAS objectives
to support public enterprise reform and expansion of the role of the private sector, IDA
would provide support for the implementation of Mongolia's first pilot case in the coal-
power-heat system to transform a major enterprise into a more commercially managed,
independent and financially accountable business.
1.28  Donor Coordination.  This project is designed to complement parallel
investment projects of other donor agencies focusing primarily on the CHP plants. The
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and bilateral agencies of Japan, the United States,
Germany and Denmark, as well as IDA, have all been particularly active in Mongolia's
energy sector, and coordination of activities between these agencies has been good.
Formal coordination in the context of the annual donor Assistance Group Meetings on
Mongolia is supplemented by active informal coordination. In 1995, ADB and the
Danish Intemational Development Agency (DANIDA) began implementation of a $35
million assistance package for renovation of Ulaanbaatar's Number 3 CHP plant, and
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) approved an assistance package
of about $45 million for renovation of Ulaanbaatar's Number 4 CHP plant. The proposed
IDA coal operation would support the rehabilitation and restructuring of the upstream
component of the coal-power-heat system. The Japanese Government provided financial
assistance to Mongolia to help prepare the project, and the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, Japan, has indicated that it will provide parallel cofinancing for
project implementation.

2. THE COAL SUBSECTOR
A. BACKGROUND
Reserves
2.1    Virtually all of the coal currently mined in Mongolia is lignite, with heating
values generally of 2,700 to 4,000 kcal/kg, 18 to 35 percent moisture, and 12 to
21 percent ash. The principal exploitable lignite reserves total some 750 million tons.
Although essentially undeveloped at this time, due to very large infrastructure
requirements, large reserves of very high-quality coal (8,000 kcal/kg, 8.5 percent
moisture, 20 percent ash) also have been identified at Tavan Togoi in the Gobi Desert.
Except at Shive Ovoo coal (1.5 percent), all coals in Mongolia are low in sulfur (less than
I percent).
Production Trends
2.2    There are 16 coal mines operating in Mongolia. These include three large-scale
mines at Baganuur, Sharyn Gol and Shive Ovoo serving the main urban markets; one
medium-scale operation (0.6 million tons per year, or Mtpy) far to the east at
Aduunchuluun, and 12 small mines (less than 0.25 Mtpy), serving only local "aimag"
(provincial) markets.  All of the coal mines except one small mine are open-pit
operations.

2.3    Declines in Output. As shown in Table 2.1, total coal production fell steadily
every year during 1989-93, due primarily to steady deterioration of equipment, lack of
spare parts, and insufficient overburden removal in previous years. Production fell by



- 11 -
36 percent, before leveling off in 1994. With an original capacity of 4 Mtpy and ample
reserves for production well into the next century, the Baganuur mine is the backbone of
the sector. In 1993 and 1994, production at Baganuur had fallen to only 70 percent of
designed capacity. Production at Sharyn Gol has fallen steadily to just 1.1 million tons in
1994, compared to its designed capacity of 1.5 Mtpy. Shive Ovoo is a new mine, where
production has not yet met the capacity of 1.2 Mtpy originally planned, in part due to coal
quality problems.
2.4   Production Costs. Long-term production costs at Baganuur are estimated at
$7.10 per ton, due to the favorable mining conditions and low stripping ratios. At the
older Sharyn Gol mine, sustained future production will cost easily twice as much as at
Baganuur. With modest rehabilitation investment, Sharyn Gol could continue production
through the end of the decade at average incremental costs of about $8 to $10/ton, by
concentrating production on the most accessible deposits at low stripping ratios. By
about 2000, however, the mine will encounter stripping ratios of 6:1 or higher, and costs
that are unlikely to be sustainable. The medium-term future for Shive Ovoo remains
uncertain. With a projected long-term stripping ratio of about 3.5:1, the mine may be
able to produce at unit costs similar to those at Baganuur, but the quality of coal produced
must be greatly improved to be acceptable to consumers.
2.5   Coal Quality. The quality of the coal produced at the three major mines varies
substantially.  The mine at Baganuur produces medium-quality lignite (3,200 to
3,500 kcal/kg). Sharyn Gol produces the highest quality coal of the three (3,800 to
4,000 kcal/kg). Sharyn Gol coal is favored by a number of consumers, who would need
to make significant adjustments to use lower-quality lignites. Although Shive Ovoo was
expected to produce coal of 3,300 kcal/kg quality, this new mine has been delivering coal
of only 2,700 kcal/kg or less, with moisture contents in excess of 40 percent. Substantial
amounts of fuel oil must be added to maintain proper combustion at the CHP plants, at
unacceptable costs. Measures recommended in a recent study completed by the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to improve coal quality at Shive Ovoo include
implementation of a strict quality control program, abandonment of current practices of
shipping oxidized coal to consumers, installation of a mine dewatering system,
construction of a crushing and sizing plant, and measures to remove thin interburden
high-ash material from output. Even with these measures, however, the study concludes
that it may be necessary for consumers to install coal-drying systems, adding to their
costs. '
2.6    Trade Prospects.  Lignites such as those currently mined in Mongolia are
generally not suitable for international trade due to their low quality, and hence high
transportation cost per unit of energy. At times, small quantities of coal have been

Study of Comprehensive Coal Development and Utilization in Mongolia (Final Report Summary,
November 1995), completed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).



- 12 -
shipped to Russia or small amounts have been imported to make up for periodic
production deficiencies in Mongolia. Given their high ash and moisture content, and low
calorific value, however, the high costs of transporting Mongolian lignite to Russia or
China make exports uneconomic. On the other hand, given the low cost of production,
relatively short distances internally from mine to market, and fact that Mongolia's CHP
plants were designed to burn such low-quality coal, production of these lignites clearly
remains the least-cost source of coal supply domestically. With the possible exception of
high-quality coals for selected special applications, importation of coal for use by the
main consumers is not economically competitive (paras. 6.4-6.5).
B. COAL DEMAND
2.7   Current Coal Use. The three large coal mines provide all of the coal used by the
five CHP plants of CES, the country's main industries, and most of the small consumers
in the main urban centers (see Table 2.2). The medium and small mines provide coal for
local heat systems and other local consumers in the smaller, isolated towns. CES is by
far the largest consumer of coal, accounting for 65 percent of national coal use, and
78 percent of the output of the three mines. The largest and newest CES plant, the
Number 4 CHP plant in Ulaanbaatar, was designed to burn Baganuur coal, although plant
managers have tried, with little success, to blend some Shive Ovoo coal into the supply
mix. The older CHP plants were designed to burn the higher-quality coal from Sharyn
Gol, but with the steady downturn in Sharyn Gol's output they also have been using
Baganuur coal. As part of its rehabilitation program supported by the ADB, the Number
3 CHP plant in Ulaanbaatar is making adjustments to its boilers to allow full conversion
to Baganuur coal. Other plants may follow this course during the later 1 990s.
2.8   Key industries, which generally prefer Sharyn Gol coal, if available, account for
about 9 percent of the sales from the three mines. Small-scale users, consisting primarily
of households and commercial or public establishments not connected to the district
heating system, accounted for about 15 percent of sales.
2.9   Serious coal shortages have been experienced during recent winter seasons. Coal
stockpiles at the CHP plants have fallen to dangerously low levels each year. Coupled
with chronic problems of boiler availability at the CHP plants, insufficient supplies of
coal of acceptable quality have led to declines in heating service such that temperature
levels in many urban homes fall to unacceptably low levels in winter. In the informal
market, coal shortages have caused prices for supply outside of regular channels to rise to
some three times the actual cost of delivery.

2.10   Future Coal Demand. Levels of future coal demand in Mongolia are uncertain,
and current estimates vary widely, due to uncertainties concerning the extent of
suppressed coal demand as a result of supply shortages, and uncertainties concerning
future growth in industrial electricity and coal demand. MEGM's low-case coal demand
projections for the main mine service area show a rise to about 6.9 million tons in 2000
and 8.3 million tons in 2005. Estimates prepared for the JICA study on coal development
show an increase in demand in the same market to 6.4 to 6.8 million tons in 2000 and 7.9
to 8.6 million tons in 2005, based on the Government's projections of strong industrial
growth. Table 2.3 presents a conservative view of future supply and demand, which
assumes far lower rates of growth in industrial electricity and coal demand. In this
conservative projection, coal demand in the CES-based service area rises to only 5.8
million tons in 2000 and 6.4 million tons in 2005. The projections focus only on the
CES-based service area supplied through the three large mines, as other, isolated service
areas are supplied by local mines, with little potential for market interaction, due to
transportation constraints.
2.11   The conservative projections show the effects of a recovery in district heating
service and stabilization in electric power production in the CES system by 1997, enabled
through a combination of boiler rehabilitation measures at Ulaanbaatar CHP Plants 3 and
4, with international support, and rehabilitation of the Baganuur coal mine. Coal
consumption in CES rises to its 1990 level, but remains well under levels in the late
1980s. After 1997, CES consumption grows only modestly, as efficiency improvements
moderate demand growth stemming from economic growth.

2.12   Role of Baganuur. Baganuur is certain to remain the core mine for the economy
well into the next decade, due to its position as the nation's stable low-cost producer. Of
the three mines, Baganuur is the only mine that can guarantee a high level of output of
acceptable quality at a low cost over the long term. At Sharyn Gol, costs would increase
sharply if overburden removal were to keep pace with long-term production
requirements. At Shive Ovoo, coal quality issues must be solved at an acceptable cost for
the mine to play a significant role. In the event that these are resolved, output levels of
0.8 Mtpy can be maintained with the existing equipment, and output could be expanded
with new investment to 2.0 Mtpy.
2.13   If demand increases faster than portrayed in the conservative estimates, including,
for example, commissioning of a new mine-mouth power plant early next century, output
at Baganuur could be increased further with relative ease. Production levels of 6.0 Mtpy
could be sustained at Baganuur with further investment along the lines proposed under
the project. The incremental costs of new production also will be significantly lower than
average costs. If total demand increases slower than portrayed in Table 2.3, this would
result in lower sales from Shive Ovoo, as coal from this mine is the least preferred by
consumers.

C. COAL SUBSECTOR ISSUES AND REFORM STRATEGY2
2.14  Mine Rehabilitation and Modernization. Serious technical problems constrain
production levels and operational efficiency at all three of Mongolia's main mines. The
Government's top priority for subsector investment is to rehabilitate the Baganuur mine,
followed by investigation and implementation of measures to improve coal quality at
Shive Ovoo, and then further expansion of Shive Ovoo's output. At Baganuur and
Sharyn Gol, the Russian-designed railway overburden removal systems are obsolete. The
inflexibility of these systems restricts the entire overburden removal and coal production
system. At Baganuur, coal production cannot be significantly increased with the existing
railway system. Operating costs for the railway are too high, including high demands for
spare parts and heavy repair requirements. At Baganuur, the site conditions warrant
transition to a fully mobile truck/shovel operation, increasing output at lower unit cost.
At Sharyn Gol, however, similar large investments to rehabilitate the mine are not
considered economic, given the substantially higher stripping ratios and unit operating
costs anticipated over the longer term.
2.15  Sorting, sizing and mixing facilities at all three mines to achieve the necessary
conformity in coal quality are either totally lacking or inadequate, causing unnecessary
and unsatisfactory problems for consumers. A new coal-handling plant needs to be
constructed at Baganuur to replace the existing inadequate facilities. The existing plant at
Sharyn Gol should be modestly upgraded. At Shive Ovoo, improvement in coal quality,
including the addition of coal-handling facilities, is critical (para. 2.5).
2.16  Commercialization and Improving Efficiency.  Investments alone will not
stabilize Mongolia's coal production; subsector and mine management also must be
improved. In the past, inefficient operating practices, poor equipment productivity and
maintenance, and lack of cost control have been principal causes of the coal subsector's
poor performance. To improve efficiency, the critical areas for reform at this time
include: (a) separation of coal companies from the government; (b) development of coal
companies into commercial enterprises; and (c) development of market forces, reform of
coal prices, and creation of a stable financial operating environment for coal companies.
2.17  The Government is committed to implementation of these reforms in the coal
subsector, as part of the transition to a market economy. Although further actions are still
required, substantial progress has been made during 1994-95 to build the necessary
legislative framework. At this stage, it is important to proceed with the details of
implementation.  The Government has selected BJSC as the first pilot case for
implementing the reform of a large state-owned company in the coal-power-heat system.
iith support under the proposed project, BJSC will operate as the first independent
shareholding company in the coal subsector, designed to operate commercially under the
market system, financially self-sufficient, and separate from MEGM management.

- 16-
2.18 Redefinition of Government and Company Roles. Under the centrally-planned
economic system operated in Mongolia, MEGM has been heavily involved in the day-to-
day management of the main mines, and the responsibilities of MEGM and mine
management have been intertwined and indistinct. Lack of clear accountability has been
one of the most critical factors leading to inefficient mine management. To operate more
effectively, Mongolia's coal companies must be established as independent commercial
entities, separate from the Government, and fully accountable to their shareholders for
performance. The role of the Government in subsector policy, regulation, and public
ownership (where relevant) also must be clearly delineated. The Government has been
active on both fronts during 1994-95:
* Corporatization and Privatization. Under the Government's privatization
program, several small coal mines have been fully privatized, and among the
large ones, Baganuur has been incorporated as a joint stock company with
25 percent private ownership.  For the large mines, the significance of
participation in the Government's privatization program lies as much in the
creation of autonomous, independent companies, operating under the strictures
of the Partnership and Companies Law and legally recognized Company
Charters, as in the introduction of minority private-sector ownership.
Participation of other mines in the program is expected. One important issue
still to be resolved concerns final definition of which public agency will have
authority to act for the Government as the owner of public shares (para. 3.9).
* Regulatory Reform. The Government has set a clear overall policy direction
to cast sector ministries such as MEGM in a policy/regulatory role without
involvement in company operations and management. In the mining industry,
the new Minerals Law provides, in principle, for a workable legal framework
for mineral operations in the country. MEGM has been assigned, and is
beginning to dispatch, much of the regulatory responsibilities under the law,
with assistance in some matters, as directed by MEGM, from the Nuurs
Company (para. 3.10). However, the transition from the old system is not yet
complete. Detailed regulations and implementation measures still need to be
worked out or fine-tuned in some areas. While significant institutional
changes already have occurred in MEGM, further formal institutional changes
within the ministry will be required to fulfill its emerging new role.
2.19  Coal Company Restructuring. Especially under a regime of greater autonomy
and accountability, mine company management needs to be greatly improved to increase
efficiency. The Government's goal is to improve cost-consciousness and manage mining
companies as project-oriented businesses. Priority areas include (a) development of
corporate management capabilities, (b) restructuring and strengthening of financial
management and accounting practices, and (c) improvement in organization and practices
for supervision of mine operations. A comprehensive restructuring program at Baganuur,
supported under the proposed project, is detailed in Chapter 3.



- 17-
Coal Pricing and Increasing Subsector Financial Performance
2.20 Reform of the Pricing and Allocation System. Under the centrally planned
economy, the Government allocated the output of each mine to various consumers and
fixed all coal prices. Coal prices were last fixed in 1993, and have basically been retained
at those levels through 1995. Ex-mine prices for Baganuur's output have remained at
Tg 2,500/ton ($5.56/ton at the 1995 average exchange rate) through 1995. Ex-mine
prices for Sharyn Gol's relatively high-quality coal are substantially higher, at about
Tg 3,500/ton ($7.78/ton) in 1995. Ex-mine prices for the low-quality coal produced at
Shive Ovoo to date are low, at about Tg 2,200/ton ($4.89/ton). Prices are sufficient to
cover cash operating costs, but without adjustment to compensate for inflation and a
decline in the value of the tugrik, 1995 price levels were insufficient to fully cover
depreciation charges based on international accounting standards.
2.21  The system is being reformed to better meet the needs of the market economy and
use market forces to improve efficiency. The characteristics of Mongolia's coal market
poses some constraints on proper market competition, however. The country's small and
medium mines serve only isolated markets, due to geographic and transportation
constraints. The main market in Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan and Erdenet is dominated by CES,
which accounts for 78 percent of consumption. This market is basically served only by
the three main mines, led by Baganuur, which accounts for 80 percent of supply.
Accordingly, both CES and Baganuur have market-dominating positions.
2.22  During 1995, two reforms have been initiated, which improve upon the old
system by giving greater play to market forces:
(a)   In a reform of the allocation system, coal supply contracts between
individual mines and consumers were introduced in 1995, negotiated
directly between the parties. Within CES, each CHP plant is allowed to
enter into its own contracts. These contracts outline the responsibilities of
each party and provide for: (i) quantity, quality specification (heat, ash
and moisture content) and timing of delivery; (ii) payment terms;
(iii) penalties and premiums relating to quality, delivery and payment
terms; (iv) arbitration provisions in the event of dispute; and (v) the right
to withhold or terminate deliveries in the event of default.
(b)   Prices for the output of Sharyn Gol, Shive Ovoo and many of the smaller
mines are beginning to be allowed to float according to market forces.
This trend should be strongly encouraged, particularly to provide market
signals to producers concerning the value that consumers attach to
differences in coal quality.
2.23  Due to its dominant market position, prices for Baganuur's output will need to
continue to be regulated by the Government. With a ceiling set by the price of equivalent
imported coal, the price must be adjusted regularly to account for depreciation of the



- 18 -
tugrik and to allow BJSC to cover costs, service its debt, and generate a reasonable after
tax return on the funds employed by the company (para. 5.16).
2.24 Improving the Financial Operating Environment. Mongolia's coal companies
suffered from severe cash flow shortages during 1994 and early 1995 due to lack of full
payment for coal deliveries by the CHP plants. The situation improved in the latter half
of 1995: since July, the CES and CHP Plants 3 and 4 paid for all new coal deliveries
from Baganuur, based on a formal agreement between BJSC, CES, the CHP plants and
Mongol Railways. The Government is also stressing that coal supply contracts must be
enforced according to the law. Continued timely payment for coal deliveries is the most
important single measure needed to improve the financial performance of the coal
companies. Additional issues include the need to gradually resolve the outstanding
accounts receivable from the CHP plants, and the need to enable the companies to retain
sufficient depreciation funds, before income tax remittance, in accordance with the
international accounting standards being adopted in 1996 (paras. 5.17-5.18).

3. THE BENEFICIARY
A. INTRODUCTION
3.1   The project beneficiary is the Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC), which
operates the country's largest coal mine at Baganuur. Coal mining operations began at
Baganuur in 1978. In June 1995, BJSC, the operating company, was incorporated as a
joint stock company (paras. 3.6-3.8).
3.2   Institutional Background. The Baganuur mine is located in Baganuur District,
under the administration of Ulaanbaatar City. With Soviet assistance, the mine began to
produce substantial amounts of coal in the early 1980s. Original plans were for a 6
million tons per year (Mtpy) operation, but the capacity actually developed was closer to
4 Mtpy. Even this level was only achieved in the peak production year of 1988, when
stripping ratios were particularly low-mine production has always been hampered by
the outdated, inflexible and cumbersome railroad overburden removal system. With the
withdrawal of large-scale Soviet aid to the mine, the economic crisis of the early 1990s,
and chronic cash shortages, the mine has struggled to keep its equipment operating.
Production has fallen sharply from 3.7 to 3.8 million tons in 1989-91 to 2.8 to 2.9 million
tons in 1993-94. Production will undoubtedly fall further unless major rehabilitation
investments are made.
3.3   Until 1995, the mine was fully government owned and was basically managed as
a department of MEGM. All major decisions were referred to MEGM, and the Ministry
also was involved in many aspects of day-to-day operations. The relative responsibilities
of MEGM and mine managers remained unclear, leading to a lack of accountability in
mine management and operation. However, with the establishment of the Baganuur mine
as a shareholding company and promulgation of the Minerals Law in 1995, a foundation
now has been put in place for the development of Baganuur into an independent,
commercially-focused company, separate from MEGM management.
3.4   Mine Management and Efficiency Issues. Mine performance at Baganuur has
suffered not only because of the use of outdated technology and financial problems, but
also because of ineffective management and poor operational organization and
supervision, stemming in part from lack of accountability. The productivity of equipment
has been poor, with equipment operating only at an average of 6 hours per 12-hour shift.
This is caused by inadequate supervision at the mine and poor equipment maintenance
practices. The prevailing mine organizational structure has caused inefficiencies due to
(a) a sharing of responsibilities for mine production among separate departments, and
insufficient coordination in interdependent operational activities; (b) lack of focused
responsibility for maintenance work; and (c) an overly complex structure, with many dual



- 20 -
reporting relationships.  Operational supervision is weak and ineffective, due to
inadequate supervisor mobility, competence and compensation, and lack of adequate
performance standards. Training for staff at all levels is unstructured and insufficient.
Management of equipment maintenance is poor, including preventive and scheduled
maintenance, linkages with operations, and warehouse and inventory control. The mine
is also significantly overstaffed.
3.5    Restructuring  Initiatives.   Following  the  incorporation  of BJSC, the
Government and BJSC management have initiated a major restructuring of the Baganuur
operation, in order to establish a more autonomous and commercially-focused company,
and to improve efficiency. BJSC has launched an internal reorganization (para. 3.11), a
manpower reduction program (para. 3.12), initiatives to improve mine operational
management and supervision (para. 3.13), a major program to improve maintenance
management (para. 3.14), and a program to improve financial reporting and cost control
(paras. 3.15-3.16).  Substantial progress has already been achieved, as BJSC has
developed a separate institutional identity and a capable company management team has
been put in place. As detailed in Chapter 4, the proposed project will provide extensive
training and technical assistance to further reinforce these initiatives.
B. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BAGANUUR JOINT STOCK COMPANY
3.6    Corporatization  and Privatization  Process.   The Baganuur Joint Stock
Company (BJSC) was duly incorporated as a joint stock company on June 8, 1995, under
the Law on Business Entities. BJSC's Charter was fornally adopted in a shareholders'
meeting on March 25, 1995. At that meeting BJSC's Board of Directors was also
appointed. The Government holds 75 percent of the company shares, while private
individuals hold 25 percent. As a legal entity under this law, BJSC has all requisite
power and authority to conduct business and enter into agreements with Mongolian and
foreign legal persons within or outside Mongolia.
3.7    BJSC was selected in 1993 by Mongolia's State Privatization Commission (SPC)
as a pilot case for privatization of a large infrastructure company. Although a number of
small coal mines have been privatized, BJSC is the first large energy company to
participate in the country's privatization program. In line with the Government's Phase
One privatization program, 25 percent ownership was offered to interested Mongolian
citizens, in exchange for "blue" vouchers previously distributed to the citizenry.3
Approximately 5.2 million BJSC shares were sold to about 26,600 persons through the
Mongolian Stock Exchange. Following the initiation of Phase Two of the privatization
3 Under the Phase I program, begun in 1991, all citizens receive three "pink" vouchers to exchange for
shares in small firms, and one "blue" voucher, valued at Tg 7,000, to exchange for shares in large
companies selected by SPC for participation in the program. Individuals "purchase" shares with their
vouchers, with the assistance of brokers, through the Mongolian Stock Exchange. The Phase I
program was successfully concluded on June 30, 1995.



- 21 -
program on July 1, 1995, BJSC shares are now eligible for trading between individuals,
through the Stock Exchange.
3.8   Company Charter. BJSC's Charter is based, in principle, on the Law on
Business Entities and has been a useful starting point for the company. Following advice
from IDA, and considering needs to adapt the Charter to the requirements of the new
Partnership and Companies Law (replacing the Business Entities Law), BJSC is
completing appropriate modifications in the Charter.
3.9   Company Ownership and Governance. Currently in Mongolia, the relevant
sector ministry is responsible for representing the Government as shareholder in joint
stock companies. In BJSC's case, therefore, MEGM acts for the Government as
shareholder. The Government recognizes that this is not satisfactory under market
conditions, as such sector ministries also are responsible for the implementation of
government sector policy and regulation, and conflicts of interest must inevitably arise.
The Government is in the process of establishing a system whereby government
ownership responsibilities will be held by an agency fully independent from the sector
ministries. As this is of critical importance for the proper functioning of BJSC as a
commercial company, assurances were obtained from the Government at negotiations
that the Government will adopt a plan, by no later than December 31, 1996, satisfactory
to the Association, for the transfer of the authority to exercise all rights and the
requirement to fulfill all obligations of the Borrower in its capacity as shareholder of
BJSC from MEGM to an entity fully independent from MEGM and any other
organization, agency or individual with responsibilities for any aspect of energy or
mining sector policy or regulation.
3. 10  Government Regulation. The new Minerals Law provides the legal framework
for the conduct of minerals operations in Mongolia. Minerals are owned by the state and
the state can restrict the free sale of products on the market, oblige a mining company to
sell to the state and set minimum and maximum production levels. The law is
administered at five different levels of government. The law allows MEGM to delegate
some of its regulatory responsibilities, which it has done to the Nuurs Company (a public
enterprise). Under the Minerals Law, BJSC has obtained a mining license (30 years)
from MEGM and entered into a surface rights (30 years) and a mining lease agreement
(30 years) with the local authorities and Nuurs Company, respectively. Following an
evaluation by the Ministry of Environment, BJSC received on August 29, 1995 an
environmental permit for implementation of the proposed project.
C. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF BJSC
3.11  Company Reorganization. BJSC has developed a new institutional organization
which is being implemented in April 1996. The new structure (see Annex3.Z1) is
designed to meet the needs of the new commercial company; accommodate the shift in
mine technology and new mine development plan; and improve production efficiency and
equipment maintenance. The structure was developed with international technical



- 22 -
assistance and the collective input of key mine management personnel. Under the
direction of the company's Board of nine Directors, elected by the shareholders, BJSC's
core management team is led by the mine's Executive Director, and includes four Deputy
Directors. Several key changes from the previous structure include (a) simplification of
management organization, to include four deputy directors, as opposed to six previously;
(b) consolidation of the production function into one department, to provide for more
effective assignment of production support equipment, improve haul road construction,
and increase operating hours of key equipment; and (c) establish a stronger maintenance
function, separate from the production function and headed by a deputy director.
3.12 Manpower Reduction Program. Similar to many state-owned enterprises in the
former planned economies, the work force at BJSC is substantially larger than the
international norm. Although labor is not a large cost item for BJSC's mechanized open-
pit operation, the company has developed a program to reduce manpower to improve
efficiency. From a level of about 1,640 workers in mid-1994, staff at BJSC had been
reduced to 1,507 workers by October 1995, primarily through natural attrition and
dismissals for disciplinary reasons.  The company's program  calls for additional
reductions of about 600 staff, to a level of 907 by 2000. BJSC plans to shift employees
from less productive or redundant assignments to others where they are needed most,
given the planned mine technology change, reductions in the scope of social activities of
the company, and changed emphasis in the new organizational structure. Employees in
the former railroad and prestripping section will fall by about 278 persons. Substantial
cuts will be made in the transportation and mining equipment maintenance section,
reflecting the phasing out of obsolete equipment, revised operations and new maintenance
procedures. Management functions (e.g., corporate strategy and planning, finance,
personnel, and procurement) will be strengthened. The social support department,
overseeing a hotel, sanitarium, canteen and livestock herd, is scheduled for divestiture
and privatization in 1998. The bulk of the manpower reduction will be achieved through
natural attrition. IDA supports BJSC's program, but has insisted that maximum efforts
be made to minimize social hardship of those affected (paras. 4.33-4.34 and Annex4.11).
3.13  Mine Operational Management and Supervision.  Ineffective operational
management and supervision have led to inefficiency and low equipment and labor
productivity in the past. The concentration of all production-related activities together,
and associated management streamlining, under the new organization will help overcome
past problems. In addition, BJSC is undertaking a series of initiatives to upgrade the role
and effectiveness of mine supervisors and foremen. In 1995, the company provided
vehicles to increase supervisor mobility in the mine area, and purchased mobile
communications equipment to facilitate regular contact between mine management and
all foremen and supervisors overseeing major mine excavation and transportation
equipment. BJSC management is planning to adjust the compensation scheme for mine
personnel, to improve the stature of supervisors and foremen, and increase incentives to
pursue promotion. Plans also include a full review, and adjustment where required, of
operational and supervisory procedures and guidelines. Training and technical assistance
will be provided under the project (para. 4.13).



- 23 -
3.14  Mine Maintenance. Poor maintenance of mine equipment and facilities has been
a major cause of low equipment productivity. Fully recognizing the inadequacy of the
existing arrangements, and following a thorough review of necessary improvements, with
the assistance of international experts, BJSC will implement a full restructuring of its
maintenance and materials management system. In addition to creation of a separate
mine maintenance and materials management function under the new institutional
structure, the program includes, with support under the project (para. 4.13): (a) upgrading
of facilities with the provision of modem workshop equipment and tools and an adequate
stock of spare parts; (b) development of a maintenance planning capability, based on a
systematic approach to work identification and documentation; (c) development of a
proper maintenance scheduling system; (d) development, for the first time, of a
preventative maintenance program and agenda; (e) a complete overhaul of the materials
and spare parts management system; and (f) staff training (see Annex 4.2).
3.15  Financial Control and Accounting. Mongolia, and BJSC, have followed the old
Soviet system of financial reporting and accounting. This system comprised a rigid
reporting structure with a common code of accounts for all companies. It was designed to
report to central government on operations in terms of meeting production targets and the
recording and control of the company's assets and liabilities and provided little, if any,
management information needed to run the operation efficiently. BJSC, similar to all
Mongolian companies, manually produces financial statements quarterly and presents
these to MEGM for checking and submission to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for the
tax assessment. The Finance and Economic Division of the company (FED) has operated
until recently merely as bookkeepers, with the planning and budgetary process limited to
a one-year period and rooted solidly in the requirements of the command economy.
There exists no integrated system encompassing all the accounting functions and the
related operating systems necessary to provide management with timely, complete and
accurate financial, cost and management information.
3.16  These deficiencies are being addressed by the introduction of International
Accounting Standards (IAS), and will be further addressed through intensive training
during the project (para. 4.13), increased utilization of information technology and the
introduction of an ongoing independent annual audit. Mongolia is in the process of
converting the accounting system of all state-owned enterprises to conform with IAS
which have become mandatory for all enterprises from the beginning of 1996. This
system of reporting will comprise a revised code of accounts; a prescribed method of
asset revaluation or indexation; the adoption of accounting principles which are
substantially in line with IAS; and an amendment to the income tax act allowing the
deduction for tax purposes of the revised depreciation provisions.
3.17  Auditing Arrangements. At present, a statutory annual audit is not required in
Mongolia, and the skills do not exist locally in sufficient numbers to support such a
requirement.  BJSC's internal audit is limited to a biannual stock take. which is
undertaken purely for accounting or reporting purposes. This shortcominlg is being



- 24 -
addressed at the national level by technical assistance being provided under the
Government's Management Development Program.
3.18  To overcome these deficiencies, BJSC will arrange, under the project, for
independent joint annual audits by auditors acceptable to IDA of its accounts and provide
audit opinions within six months of its financial year-end. Auditing skills in Mongolia
are limited to the Dalai firm of accountants which, although independent, does not yet
meet the rigorous auditing standards required. As a consequence, BJSC has agreed to
appoint a joint auditor of intemational standing acceptable to IDA. The auditors will be
required to express an opinion on the adequacy of the accounting system and intemal
controls and review Statements of Expenditures and compliance with financial covenants.

4. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.1   The main objective of the proposed project is to reverse the decline in Mongolia's
coal production by increasing sustainable production levels at the Baganuur mine to
4 Mtpy. Additional, associated objectives are for BJSC (a) to develop financial self-
sufficiency, (b) to increase equipment productivity and improve efficiency, (c) to operate
as an independent commercial company, and (d) for BJSC to operate in an
environmentally acceptable manner over the long term. These objectives would be
achieved through a combination of investment in mine rehabilitation, and implementation
of management restructuring and operational reform at BJSC. The project would provide
a model for management reform of key energy sector companies.
4.2   The main focus of the mine rehabilitation is the upgrading of the mine's
technology base. The inflexible and obsolete railway system to remove overburden,
which has constrained the entire overburden removal and coal production program in
recent years, will be removed and replaced by a fleet of 85-ton dump trucks. The
availability and utilization of existing excavators (shovels and draglines) will be
improved through provision of adequate stocks of spare parts to service the excavator
fleet, improved maintenance, and improved operational management. Existing fleets of
mine support equipment will be enlarged considerably in size and in power ratings to
ensure proper in-mine support of excavators. A new coal-handling plant will be
constructed to improve coal quality.
4.3   The efficiency of the Baganuur coal mine will also be increased through
development of BJSC into an independent shareholding company with a commercial
focus and accountability to its shareholders, reorganization of the company's institutional
structure, improved mine planning, mine operational management and supervision,
maintenance and materials management, manpower reduction, and improved systems for
financial reporting and cost control. The project's training and technical assistance
components will assist BJSC to improve efficiency in these areas, and to improve
environmental management.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
4.4   The principal features of the proposed project are:
(a)   procurement and commissioning of equipment to rehabilitate the
Baganuur coal mine operation consisting of twenty 85-ton dump trucks,
ten 40-ton coal trucks, 310, 320 and 550-horsepower (hp) bulldozers, a
275 hp grader, a 9-cubic meter (mi3) front-end loader, various support



- 26 -
vehicles (tire, fuel/ lube, welding, and water spray trucks, cranes and
lowboys), explosive initiation systems, mine dewatering equipment,
workshop equipment, tools and consumables, spare parts for existing mine
equipment, and coal quality laboratory and environmental equipment, as
well as construction of a short access road and other minor civil works;
(b)   procurement and turnkey installation and commissioning of equipment for
a coal-handling plant consisting of crusher, linear stacker, underground
reclaimer and train-loader;
(c)   technical assistance to BJSC including in-country and overseas training to
(i) improve mine operations and mine supervision practices and
procedures; (ii) develop mine maintenance management and materials
management systems; (iii) upgrade financial and cost accounting/
management information (MIS) systems; and (iv) improve environmental
management capabilities.  Technical assistance will be provided to
MEGM for coal-sector strategy development.
4.5   Project Performance Monitoring. The performance of the project in meeting its
stated objectives (para. 4.1) will be closely monitored by the Government, BJSC and IDA
throughout the life of the project. In addition to progress in the regular aspects of project
implementation, such as procurement and disbursement, project performance for each key
objective will be monitored with the use of specific indicators agreed with BJSC and
presented in Annex 4.1. The project's central objective-achievement and maintenance
of coal production of 4 Mtpy at the Baganuur mine-will be monitored against agreed
annual coal production, overburden removal and coal-handling plant throughput
indicators. BJSC's success in developing financial self-sufficiency will be monitored
against a series of criteria, based on BJSC's audited annual financial statements. Specific
annual equipment productivity criteria, central to improving efficiency at BJSC, also have
been defined and agreed. Further progress in BJSC's restructuring program, and issues
relating to separation of government ownership and regulation of the company will be
regularly evaluated.   Specific criteria for assessing progress in improving the
environmental sustainability of BJSC's operation also will be regularly monitored. A
mid-term project review will be conducted in the first semester of 1998, focusing on coal
sector regulation and policy issues, as well as project implementation issues.
4.6   Location and Infrastructure. The Baganuur mine is located 125 miles east of
the capital city of Ulaanbaatar (Map IBRD 27478). The terrain surrounding the mine is
rolling countryside at an elevation of 1,250 to 1,330 meters above sea level. Apart from
short sections of hard-top road outside of Ulaanbaatar and the small town of Baganuur,
the intervening distance currently can be traversed by vehicle only over unprepared paths
across the countryside. The mine area is connected to Ulaanbaatar by rail loop and the
main rail line connecting Ulaanbaatar to the border with China, providing a route for coal
deliveries to CES and other major consumers. The climate is continental and severe, with
winter temperatures reaching minus 35 degrees centigrade. Rainfall is moderate with



- 27 -
periodic heavy showers. The mine is presently serviced with power, water supply and an
access road, and these facilities are all adequate for the coming 20-year mine
development period. The present mine townsite is large and more than adequately sized
for the present work force.
4.7   Geology, Reserves and Coal Quality.  Baganuur coal area is synclinal in
structure, with its main axis north-south stretching approximately 8 kilometers and its
minor axis east-west being approximately 4 kilometers wide. Coal seams dip toward the
central synclinal axis with seam gradients ranging up to 25 degrees. There are three main
seams of coal: Seam 3, 2.0 to 38.4 meters thickness overlying Seam 2A, 2.0 to 24.8
meters thickness, overlying Seam 2, 6.0 to 77.0 meters thickness. The interval between
the individual coal seams varies across the syncline but is typically of the order of 70
meters, consisting of sandy rock strata with permafrost near-surface rock conditions. The
coal seams are typically thin and of no commercial interest over the western section of
the syncline and typically 13 to 23 meters thickness (seams 2, 2A and 3) in the eastern
section, the location of present mining operations and those projected over the 20-year
mine rehabilitation project life.
4.8   Proven and economically recoverable reserves (thickness in excess of 3.0 meters,
heating value greater than 3,300 kcal/kg, and overburden:coal stripping ratio less than 5:1
bank cubic meters/coal) are 295 million tons coal, sufficient for a mine life in excess of
50 years. There are no major faults traversing the area, but minor faults are mapped and
are exposed in present mine areas. Coal quality is lignitic with "as received" heating
values typically in the 3,200 to 3,500 kcal/kg range, total moisture ranging from 25 to
33 percent and ash content, 10 to 12 percent. In the present mining area, the coal seams
contain thin dirt partings that cannot be separated efficiently by selective mining and are
extracted as part of the coal product.
4.9   Mine Rehabilitation Plan. The mine layout for the coming 20 years is well
conceived and provides for a consistent coal quality product by combining areas of low
and higher stripping ratio, thus avoiding short-term "high grading" of the coal areas and
preserving future mine development areas of similar economic merit (see Anneax4.2).
The mine development plan foresees continued, down-dip extraction of Seam 2 and 2A in
the Main Pit area (Mountain Section 1) and of Seam 2 at Mountain Section 2 (Main Pit).
The existing Mountain Section 3 and the extraction of Seam 3 will be captured by the
Mountain Section 2 operations starting 1999. Down-dip extraction of Seam 2 will
continue in Mountain Section 5. Mountain Sections 4 (Seam 2A) and 5 (Extension Seam
2) will be developed in later years in order to maintain a balanced stripping ratio and
uniform coal quality product. In-pit dumping will be maximized by construction of
cross-pit roads to minimize costs of hauling overburden out of the pit areas.
4.10  The mine rehabilitation program includes the following investments in improved
technology and mining equipment:



- 28 -
(a)   introduction of 85-ton haul trucks on upper overburden benches to replace
the existing inefficient rail transport system (end- 1996) and the replacement
of aging small capacity coal trucks with 40-ton coal trucks in 1998;
(b)   introduction of a fleet of 310, 320 and 550-hp bulldozers during the 1996-98
period to effectively handle overburden spoil dumps, assist dragline
operation on top of the coal seams, and to provide cleanup support to all
shovel operations on both overburden and coal benches; and
(c)   introduction of an additional grader, rubber-tired dozer and front-end loader
to ensure efficient haul road construction and maintenance and to improve
general in-pit housekeeping. The existing fleet of water tankers will be
increased to five units to ensure adequate dust suppression on haul roads and
an acceptable health environment. Miscellaneous mine vehicles (tire and
fuel/lube trucks, lowboys and cranes) will be introduced to ensure high
levels of equipment productivity through full support and servicing of
mining equipment fleets.
4.11  Additional investments include:
(a)   a major upgrading in maintenance workshop and warehouse facilities
(complemented with training and technical assistance-see para. 4.13), with
provision of modem workshop equipment and tools, and procurement of an
adequate stock of spare parts for existing Russian, Japanese, and American
equipment fleets (AnnexA a);
(b)   completion of the mine dewatering and monitoring well development
program, previously discontinued due to lack of funds;
(c)   importation of urgently needed explosive initiation system consumables
(caps, boosters and delay mechanisms) to ensure effective overburden
fragmentation, particularly blasting of permafrost areas; and
(d)   construction of a coal handling plant, on a turnkey basis to ensure a reliable
4.0 Mtpy supply of quality coal to customers. All coal will be sized at
50 mm or less to overcome historical coal handling problems by customers
(previous coal deliveries have been sized at 300 mm or less, with portions of
supply even in excess of that size).
4.12  Investments in civil works include (a) construction of a 5 km access road to haul
coal from the existing Mountain Section 5 to the new coal handling plant,
(b) modification and modernization of workshop facilities to accommodate the new
equipment fleets, particularly the 85-ton dump trucks, (c) a short rail line addition, and
(d) certain modifications to the existing coal handling facilities and heat plant.

4.13  Training and Technical Assistance. Training and technical assistance is a key
aspect of the project. Components focus on in-country training of Mongolian staff,
combined with on-site technical assistance, but overseas training and study tours to
expose Mongolian staff to international practices are also included. Components include
support for BJSC's ambitious programs to improve mine efficiency, for establishing an
environmental management function in BJSC, and for further development of the
Government's coal subsector development strategy:
(a)   Mine Operations, Supervision and Maintenance ($1 million). This
component will provide support to improve equipment and labor
productivity, equipment maintenance and availability, application of key
equipment to top priority tasks, and proper allocation of support or
ancillary equipment. The component includes training and technical
assistance to (i) improve the capacity of BJSC's corporate management to
operate in a commercial, market setting, and familiarize both executives
and middle-level managers with international mine operation and
personnel management practices; (ii) improve mine planning; (iii) adjust
mine operational procedures and practices to comply with the
technological shift and modern practices, clearly define the responsibilities
of supervisory personnel, adjust compensation schedules accordingly, and
build necessary new equipment operator skills; (iv) further develop and
implement a new system of mine maintenance and materials management;
and (v) improve mine cost engineering (see Annex 4.4).
(b)   Environmental Management ($250,000).  Training and technical
assistance will be provided for the establishment of an Environmental
Management Unit at the mine, which will implement BJSC's
environmental management program (paras. 4.28-4.32). Training for the
unit's staff will focus on: (i) environmental management, monitoring and
reclamation; (ii) spoils dump construction and stability, spoil management
and drainage; (iii) hydrogeology (groundwater and surface water modeling
and management); (iv) occupational health and safety in the mining
industry (see Annex.4.5).
(c)   Cost and Financial Accounting Systems ($750,000). The objective of
this component is to develop BJSC's accounting and financial reporting
systems to better conform with international norms and the new
requirements of the Government, and to provide BJSC management with
the information needed to improve cost control. Training and technical
assistance will include design, development and implementation of a new
management information system to meet BJSC's accounting and cost
control needs (Annx4.6).
(d)   Coal Sector Strategy ($1.1 million). Technical assistance would be
provided to MEGM for evaluation of the technical and economic prospects



- 30 -
of the Shive Ovoo and Tavan Tolgoi mines (paras. 2.2-2.5), and to assist
MEGM to define its future regulatory and policy role in the subsector. At
Shive Ovoo, additional technical investigations and analysis are necessary
to formulate a mine development plan that can provide coal of acceptable
and reliable quality at affordable cost. Special emphasis will be placed on
evaluation of the huge steam/coking coal deposit at Tavan Tolgoi in the
Gobi Desert, including further evaluation of the resource, analysis of the
feasibility work completed by Russian experts, and assessment of possible
development options and their costs and economic viability. Regulatory
and institutional reform aspects should consider corporatization and
privatization strategies for the various mines, and clear definition of
MEGM's regulatory and policy role in the emerging market economy
(Annex 4.).  At negotiations, assurances were obtained from  the
Government that it will carry out the coal sector strategy technical
assistance in accordance with Terms of Reference and an implementation
schedule acceptable to the Association, and prepare and provide to IDA
annual progress reports on the implementation of the technical assistance.
C. PROJECT COSTS
4.14  The estimated cost of the proposed project at Baganuur is $59.3 million (Tg 28.8
billion), including import duties and sales taxes, and physical and price contingencies, but
excluding incremental working capital and interest during construction (IDC). All cost
and financing estimates, including local costs (as well as projections of BJSC's financial
projections), have been calculated in US dollars, due to high and unpredictable domestic
inflation. Physical contingencies are calculated at 5 percent for local and foreign costs,
except the coal-handling plant foreign cost component, for which a 10 percent
contingency is calculated, as engineering details are still preliminary. Price escalation is
based on the phasing of commitments and projected international inflation rates of
2.4 percent per year for 1996 and thereafter. Incorporating the coal sector technical
assistance to MEGM, the total project cost is $60.4 million (Tg 29.3 billion) (Table 4.1).
4.15  Cost estimates are based on international experience in procuring similar mining
and coal-handling equipment worldwide. Civil works/infrastructure costs are formulated
by BJSC based on local conditions and experience. Training and technical assistance cost
estimates are based on experience in similar projects in Mongolia and other countries.
4.16  The total capital cost for the mine rehabilitation project, including physical
contingencies but excluding price escalation and import duties/sales taxes, is less than
$35 per ton annual incremental output, which is in line with the costs of coal mine/
handling plant rehabilitation in other developing economies. The incremental cost of
expansion beyond the scope currently envisaged in this project, to an output level of say
5.0 Mtpy of coal, would be less-perhaps only $10 to $15 per annual incremental ton,
placing the Baganuur coal mine on a firm economic footing for possible further
expansion.

D. FINANCING PLAN
4.17 The financing plan for the project is shown Table 4.2. Total financing required,
including interest during construction and incremental working capital requirements, is
$61.9 million of which $51.3 million, or 82.9 percent, constitutes the direct foreign
exchange component. The proposed IDA credit of $35.0 million represents 68 percent of
the foreign exchange component and 57 percent of the total project cost. IDA funds
would be made available to the Government of Mongolia at standard IDA terms, with 40
years' maturity and a 10-year grace period. The IDA credit would finance mining and
mine support equipment (except for coal trucks and 550-hp bulldozers), ancillary mine
equipment and vehicles, mining materials, workshop tools and equipment, spare parts
contracts, a part of the mine dewatering contract and all technical assistance and training
components. IDA fimds would be onlent by the Government to BJSC under a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government and BJSC. At negotiations, assurances were
obtainedfrom the Borrower that it would onlend IDA funds to BJSC under a subsidiary
loan agreement with terms during BJSC's transition to a commercial company as
follows: (a) BJSC would bear the foreign exchange risk; (b) the interest rate would be
4.2 percent per year; (c) the grace period would be 8 years; and (d) the repayment period



- 32 -
would be 25 years. Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement will be a condition of
credit effectiveness.

4.18   BJSC  and the Government have requested the assistance of the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan (OECF), to provide parallel cofinancing for key
items for which the available IDA and domestic funds are insufficient. These items
include foreign exchange expenditures for the coal-handling plant, ten 40-ton coal trucks
and six large (e.g., 550-hp) bulldozers required for the Baganuur mine rehabilitation.
Based on current estimates, including physical and price contingencies, this would
require financing of $15.5 million equivalent. The local financing requirement is
estimated at $11.4 million equivalent, comprised of all civil works ($1.6 million), part of
the dewatering program ($650,000), local costs for constructing the coal-handling plant
($2.2 million), all import duties and sales taxes ($5.4 million), and incremental working
capital and IDC ($1.5 million) The local contribution would be financed by BJSC
through its internal cash flow or, if necessary, with funds borrowed from the Government.
Projections of BJSC's financial position during 1996-2000 show that the company should
have the cash to provide this financing (paras. 5.13-5.15).
4.19   It is understood that the Government is likely to require financing for the coal-
handling plant, coal trucks and large bulldozers from OECF or another financing source.
OECF indicated its intent to provide parallel cofinancing for the proposed project at the
international donors' meeting on Mongolia in February 1996.
E. PROCUREMENT
4.20 Under previous IDA operations in Mongolia, procurement has been centralized
within the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and considerable experience and



- 33 -
expertise has been developed in assisting various project entities (including BJSC) to
process procurement of goods and services under IDA guidelines. Within MTI, a
procurement cell has been established, earlier assisted by an IDA-financed project
implementation and procurement advisor. This cell has been and continues to be the
focal point for IDA-financed procurement. A country procurement assessment review
has not been considered necessary to date, given the small size of the portfolio and
smooth experience with procurement work so far. BJSC has agreed that MTI will assist
with the expeditious processing of all project-related equipment and services. With
project preparation funds and IDA Technical Assistance Credit (TAC) proceeds, a
procurement advisor is being retained to assist MTI/BJSC to prepare international
competitive bidding (ICB) and other bidding documents, using IDA's Standard Bidding
Documents, and to assist in bid evaluation and the submission of bid evaluation reports,
prior to credit effectiveness.  Procurement for all IDA-financed elements will be
conducted in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits, January 1995" and revised in January 1996.
4.21  IDA proceeds will be used to procure the majority of goods to be imported, with
the exception of goods in two packages (coal-handling plant and bulldozers) scheduled
for parallel cofinancing. Packages that are clearly suitable for IDA financing (Annex4.)
have been agreed with BJSC.
4.22  Contracts for two offshore packages ($26.4 million)-mining equipment and
explosives-would be awarded following ICB procedures and will be subject to
postqualification.  In bid evaluation, Mongolian manufacturers will be allowed a
preferential margin of 15 percent of the CIF costs of competing imports, or the relevant
prevailing level of customs duties that BJSC would have to pay. The mine dewatering
contract ($1.3 million, including contingencies and taxes, of which 50 percent will be
financed by IDA and 50 percent by BJSC) will be negotiated by BJSC on a sole-source
basis with Burvodstroi, a Russian government water well construction company that
installed the original dewatering well network and that is currently installing other mine
dewatering facilities at Baganuur. Spare parts contracts with a total value of $6.3 million,
including contingencies and taxes, will be procured directly from relevant Russian,
Japanese and US companies, on a sole-source basis. Equipment items or packages of
estimated value of less than $250,000 would be procured by international shopping, up to
an aggregate value of $2.2 million, with at least three quotations from at least two
countries. Previous experience in mining projects financed by the Bank Group has shown
that international shopping for these small equipment packages (various trucks, lowboys,
cranes, laboratory equipment, hand tools, etc.) is the only procurement method that
provides quick and reasonable responses and quotations, due to the low value of the
items. All ICB packages, all procurement planned on a sole-source basis and contracts
awarded through international shopping procedures with a value of $150,000 or more will
be subject to prior review by IDA. This constitutes over 95 percent of all goods to be
financed from the proposed credit, the balance being subject to postreview by IDA. All
IDA-financed training and technical assistance services ($3.3 million, averaging $0.8
million per contract) will be procured in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of



- 34 -
consultants. For complex, time-based assignments, consultant services contracts will be
based on the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. Prior IDA
review will be required for all consultant services contracts with an estimated cost
exceeding $50,000 for individuals or $100,000 for firms. All terms of reference and
single-source selections, however, will be subject to IDA's prior review, regardless of
contract value. Details of procurement of goods and services are shown in Table 4.3 and
Annex 4.8.

credit. NIF = Not IDA Financed.
F. DISBURSEMENTS
4.23  Disbursements will be made against (a) 100 percent of the foreign cost of directly
imported goods, and 75 percent of local expenditures, and (b) 100percent of the
consultancy cost of technical assistance. Disbursements would be made on the basis of
statements of expenditures (SOEs) for actual expenditures against: (a) contracts of less



- 35 -
than $150,000 for goods, (b) consultants' contracts of less than $100,000 equivalent for
firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals, and (c) training costs. Disbursements for
all other expenditures would be supported by full documentation.  Supporting
documentation for all disbursements against SOEs would be retained by BJSC and made
available upon request for examination by IDA review missions. To facilitate timely
project implementation and disbursements, the Government would establish and operate,
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association, a Special Account with an
authorized allocation of $1.0 million.
4.24  The expected project completion date is June 30, 2001 and the loan closing date
shall be December 31, 2001. A disbursement schedule is presented as Annex 4.9.
G. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
4.25  Project Organization.  Project preparation has been completed with the
finalization of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) by BJSC management. The PIP is
available in the project file. BJSC management are familiarizing themselves with IDA
procurement procedures through interfacing with the staff of MTI and with the assistance
of an international procurement advisor. BJSC's new organization structure (para. 3.11)
streamlines the previous structure, facilitates efficient mine operations, and strengthens
maintenance, financial and environmental management functions. With the exception of
the coal sector strategy technical assistance, the details of project implementation will be
managed directly by BJSC's core company management team, which also supervised all
aspects of project preparation. The coal sector strategy technical assistance will be
implemented by MEGM (para. 4.13).
4.26  Project Status. The project has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and is
an integral part of the Government's short-term economic development plan. The PIP
prepared by BJSC, with assistance from Mongolian and international experts, has been
reviewed by IDA and found acceptable. The Environmental Analysis Report (paras.
4.28-4.32) has been reviewed by IDA and found acceptable. A General Procurement
Notice was published in March 1995. ICB documents are now under preparation and are
tentatively scheduled to be issued in May 1996. It is anticipated that ICB and most
international shopping will be completed and bid evaluation reports submitted for IDA
review before credit effectiveness, thus facilitating expeditious equipment deliveries.
Arrangements for parallel cofinancing are proceeding smoothly.
4.27 Implementation Schedule. Board presentation is scheduled for May 1996.
Credit effectiveness is anticipated in July 1996. A tentative project implementation
schedule is provided in Annex 4.10. It is anticipated that bid evaluation reports for all
major imported equipment items will be completed at or about the loan effectiveness date
such that the majority of contracts can be negotiated and signed in July 1996, with
equipment deliveries over the ensuing 3- to 6-month period. It is anticipated that
cofinancing arrangements can be finalized by October 1996, so that procurement of the
coal-handling plant and bulldozers can proceed according to the project implementation



- 36 -
schedule. No land needs to be acquired by BJSC and all necessary infrastructure is in
place. Ongoing mine development over the coming 20-year project period will not
involve the resettlement of any people. Physical project completion is expected in late-
1998/early 1999.
H. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
4.28  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the proposed project is
designated as Category B. With international and local technical assistance, BJSC
completed an Environmental Analysis Report (EAR) in June 1995, including an
Environmental Management Program (EMP) to be implemented under the project (Anne
4.1). The EAR was approved by the Ministry of Environment in August 1995. The
draft report was reviewed by IDA and found to be acceptable, provided revisions were
undertaken to incorporate data collected during the summer months. These modifications
were undertaken in October 1995, and the final EAR was issued in November 1995.
4.29  One issue identified at the outset of project preparation was the potential impact
of ongoing open-pit coal mining operations on the adjacent Baganuur Lake. The level of
the lake, located adjacent to the northwest of the mine area (Map IBRD 27479) and of
religious and historic significance to the local population, had shown signs of being
lowered. During project preparation, Mongolian and international environmental and
hydrogeological experts developed data that indicated that the lake stability was not
dependent upon groundwater replenishment and thus, the possibility of the lake being
impacted by mining and related mine dewatering was highly unlikely. Previous
fluctuations in the lake water level are attributed to seasonal flow changes in the streams
flowing into the lake. The experts have recommended a further, ongoing groundwater
monitoring program to determine any impacts on the lake stability. In the unlikely event
that some impact on the lake related to ongoing mining operations were to occur, BJSC is
committed in the agreed EMP to dedicate resources to correct the problem: studies have
indicated that water from mine dewatering and/or local rivers can de diverted into the
lake area. Public consultation with representatives of the local and regional population,
initiated during project preparation, will be continued through project implementation.
4.30 A second issue identified was that BJSC had traditionally conducted its mining
operations without reclamation and treatment of overburden spoil dumps. With the
assistance of Mongolian and international experts, the EAR and agreed EMP include a
full plan to effectively manage the reclamation of spoil dumps, including a plan to
progressively recover old spoil dump areas. Under the project, heavy earth-moving
equipment will be procured to recover topsoil and recontour all dump areas. The phased
reclamation plan will be monitored throughout project implementation.
4.31  A review of general ecological issues was undertaken and no problems identified.
Other environmental issues addressed in the EAR and for which mitigation plans are
included in the EMP include (a) mitigation of dust within the mine area; (b) health and
safety; (c) hazardous waste disposal; and (d) monitoring of environmental contamination.



- 37 -
Environmental performance monitoring criteria have been developed within the EMP and
will be monitored throughout project implementation. The EMP includes the collection
of further environmental baseline data and investigation of the hydrology as identified in
the EAR; maintenance of a register of emissions, discharges and wastes; definition of
environmental standards and quality objectives; definition of environmental control
systems; and implementation of the detailed environmental monitoring program. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained from BJSC that it will carry out the
Environmental Management Program (EMP) in a manner satisfactory to the Association.
4.32 BJSC is establishing a small Environmental Management Unit (EMU), which will
be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the EMP within BJSC, the
environmental monitoring work, and oversight of the reclamation activities (Annex 4.1 1).
Training and technical assistance support for the EMU will be provided under the project
(para. 4.13, Annex4..5).
I. SOCIAL IMPACTS OF MANPOWER REDUCTION
4.33  Recognizing that the Baganuur region provides limited employment opportunities
and that unemployment rates in the region generally are quite high, the social impact of
the planned manpower reduction (para. 3.12) has been assessed in detail (Anne4.2).
Analysis has indicated that a major proportion of the excess manpower (about 600
positions) can be reduced through natural attrition including retirements, voluntary
separation, etc. With some adjustments to the manpower reduction program to avoid
bunching of dismissals that could potentially cause hardship, the number of personnel
that will need to be dismissed involuntarily is estimated at about 150 persons over five
years, and is manageable. BJSC will work closely with local government officials and
representatives of the trade union to avoid bunching of the dismissals, and to ensure that
they are undertaken in a socially responsible manner. Review of the family and skills
background of affected staff with local government/trade union representatives also will
help avoid severe hardship. There will be no discrimination against women. There are a
number of international donor initiatives providing support for vulnerable groups,
development of small and medium enterprises, new community initiatives, and
infrastructure development. BJSC will assist, where required, local and international
agencies in the design and implementation arrangements for social support and small
business development at Baganuur. Where appropriate, BJSC also will use its inhouse
training facilities to better prepare affected workers for work opportunities outside the
direct mining community.
4.34 BJSC provided assurances at negotiations that it would implement any manpower
reduction program according to principles satisfactory to IDA. Said principles were
agreed at negotiations (AnnexA412).
J. REPORTING
4.35 BJSC will furmish IDA with annual financial reports and semiannual project
implementation progress reports. Annual financial reports will include project accounts



- 38 -
and annual financial statements in accordance with IAS, together with an independent
audit report. They should also include a rolling five-year financial plan, developed and
presented as part of BJSC's corporate development strategy (para. 5.22). Semiannual
project progress reports will include unaudited financial reports, and will state progress
on all agreed technical, enviromnental and financial performance monitoring criteria, and
the status of all project components. These reports should outline compliance with coal
supply contracts with key consumers, including coal quality requirements. The detailed
scope and content of the project progress reports will be agreed during project
negotiations. In addition, MEGM will provide IDA with annual progress reports on the
implementation of the coal sector strategy technical assistance. At negotiations, IDA
obtained assurances from the Government that it will submit a mid-project review report,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association, to IDA by April 1, 1998, review
this report with the Association by June 1, 1998, and ensure efficient completion of the
project based on the recommendations of this report and the Association's views on the
matter. IDA also obtained assurances from BJSC that it will provide biannual project
progress reports to IDA, integrating the results of agreed monitoring and evaluation
activities, and that it will ensure efficient completion of the project based on the
recommendations of these reports and the Association 's views on the matter.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. INTRODUCTION
5.1   Until March 1995, BJSC was operated and funded essentially as a branch of the
Government, under the direction of MEGM. Along with the rest of the country, the
company is making the transition from a centrally-planned, production-oriented and state-
owned enterprise to a commercial, profit-driven joint stock company. Restoring BJSC's
productive capacity and establishing it as a competitive and financially viable mining
company, independent of state budgetary support, is a central objective of this project.
BJSC will be one of the first large companies in Mongolia to make this transition, and the
first in the energy sector.
5.2   BJSC was structured to conform from its inception to the demands of the
command economy. Its accounting function was geared primarily to safeguarding the
company's assets and reporting on the achievement of predefined production targets.
Operational efficiencies, cost control and working capital management were of secondary
importance. The price of coal was regulated by government and set at a level which:
(a) covered operating costs (including a nominal provision for depreciation); and
(b) provided sufficient profits for tax payments and appropriations for the Social and
Economic Development Fund and other social activities.  Capital equipment was
acquired by MEGM and transferred to the company as it was needed. This system,
although adequate in the past, has become increasingly inappropriate with the high levels
of inflation experienced since 1990 and the rapid move toward a market economy, trade
liberalization, economic reform and corporate autonomy.
5.3   Despite an increase in the nominal coal price in 1993, BJSC ran into severe
financial difficulties resulting primarily from:  (a) insufficient investment, obsolete
technology, poor operational efficiencies and declining production; (b) decapitalization
resulting from hyperinflation and inadequate depreciation provisions; (c) excessive delay
in payments for coal deliveries to major state owned CHP plants; and (d) a real decline in
the price of coal denominated in foreign currency.
5.4  In 1994 the Government introduced far-reaching legislation that will result in the
progressive privatization of BJSC, the adoption of international accounting standards
(IAS) and the revision of depreciation provisions for tax purposes. An agreement was
reached in mid-1995 between BJSC, CHP plants 3 and 4, and Mongol Railways for both
prompt settlement of payment for new coal deliveries and gradual settlement of
outstanding accounts receivable. A more appropriate coal pricing mechanism is being
formulated and implemented in 1996. Concurrently with these reforms BJSC, in order to
become competitive and financially viable in the market economy, plans to significantly



- 40 -
improve and automate its financial management. The project provides for this through
both a major training and technical assistance (TA) component on financial management
(para. 4.13), and agreements with BJSC on financial performance targets and
implementation of a formal independent annual audit to ensure financial discipline and
control.
B. PAST AND PRESENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.5   Financial Overview.  As with other economies in transition, Mongolia has
experienced significant hyperinflation in recent years. The price index4 rose from 100 in
1990 to 1839 in 1993, an annual increase of 164 percent. The domestic currency in turn
was devalued from 40 to 412 tugrik to the US dollar over the period 1992 to 1994.
Historic accounting data are grossly distorted as a result. Comparisons between past
years are therefore of little value and the time and cost of restating the company's
accounts to eliminate these distortions prior to 1994 is not justified. Nonetheless, some
idea of BJSC's deteriorating financial position during 1992-94 can be gained if it is
assumed that BJSC's cost of sales remained constant in US dollar terms during the
period. In this event BJSC's pretax income declined from $2.6 million in 1992 to a loss
of $0.13 million in 1993 and a small profit of $0.01 million in 1994. A tax assessment of
roughly $2.0 million was made in each of these years. This weak financial position is
likely to be somewhat accentuated by the understatement of costs inherent in these
figures due to excessive inflation.
5.6   The key conceptual differences between the traditional Mongolian accounting
principles and those of IAS are (a) capital equipment, inventories and other nonmonetary
assets are not adjusted to take into account high inflation; (b) no provision is made for
bad or doubtful debts or for excess and obsolete inventories; (c) many costs associated
with the Social and Economic Fund are regarded as an appropriation of profit and not
charged to operating expenditure or allowed as a deduction and (d) depreciation of fixed
assets, although allowable for tax purposes, is predefined by government and based on
historic costs and arbitrary rates of depreciation. These factors have all contributed to an
inadequate recovery of capital, understatement of operating costs, and an overstatement
of taxable profits, and have distorted the financial position and operating results of the
company.
5.7   Operating Performance. BJSC is dependent upon coal sales to, and payment by,
the two state-owned CHP plants in Ulaanbaatar, which comprise 84 percent of its annual
sales. The Nuurs Company purchases wholesale and undertakes retail coal sales. The
remaining 71 customers are close to BJSC, and purchase coal directly from the mine on a
cash basis. Shipments of coal in 1994 were 2.76 million tons, down from 2.87 million
tons the previous year. The average coal price of $6.29 per ton was barely sufficient to

cover unit operating costs revised to conform with IAS. This price declined further in US
dollar terms to a level of $5.6 per ton in 1995.
5.8   BJSC's financial results for 1994 were adjusted and restated5 substantially in line
with IAS. The company's revised 1994 revenue and cost structure is illustrated in Table
5.1. BJSC's adjusted unit operating costs amounted to $6.16/ton, which is low by
international standards.  Stores, labor, diesel, power and depreciation amount to
70 percent of operating cost. Manpower levels are excessive given the scope of the
operation. A labor reduction program is planned, although the potential for savings is
low due to the relatively low remuneration rates. Using IAS, depreciation rose to
31 percent of costs, as opposed to 8 percent under the previous accounting system.

5.9   As shown in Table 5.2, BJSC's financial results and perfornance are reflected
quite differently using IAS. After adjustment to the previous financial reports, the
company barely broke even before tax and sustained a net after tax loss for the year
primarily arising from:

(a)    a substantial increase in the depreciation provision as a result of the
revaluation of fixed assets;
(b)   a significant understatement of operating costs owing to the valuation and
requisitioning of stores and supplies at historic values;
(c)   the devaluation of the tugrik which has a major impact on BJSC since
around 85 percent of its operating and capital costs are directly or
indirectly imported and are in foreign exchange. It is clear that after
adjusting for these distortions the coal price, in current terms, is
insufficient to cover direct operating costs and finance an appropriate
capital expenditure program without significant government support; and
(d)    a provision for income tax which was assessed on the basis of BJSC's
unadjusted results for the year. The income statement shows that despite
just breaking even, BJSC paid income taxes in 1994 amounting to $2.1
million. The net result is that BJSC made an after-tax loss of $2.1 million,
which effectively represents a reduction in BJSC's capital (net asset) base.
This was only maintained by the Government's contributing $2.8 million
in new capital equipment during the year with financing by a grant from
donors. This process of decapitalization continued in 1995.
5.10  From  the beginning of 1996 BJSC  is, together with all other Mongolian
enterprises, required by the Government to revalue its assets and convert to IAS. The
resulting higher depreciation rates will, under existing legislation, be allowed for tax
purposes, although this will be phased in over several years. These measures should,
after a settling-in period and suitable staff training, eliminate these inflationary distortions
and alleviate the financial drain experienced by BJSC.
5.11   Financial Position. The revised balance sheet outlined in Table 5.2 shows that
accounts receivables, inventory levels and fixed assets (after revaluation) comprise the
major assets of the BJSC. Difficulties with each of these asset categories have been
experienced by BJSC:
(a)    Sales receipts, amounting to around 200 days at end of 1994, have not
been collected by BJSC. Despite signed supply contracts, the CHPs were
forced to default on their obligations and have paid for about one-half of
their recent coal receipts. This has a large adverse impact on the cash flow
of BJSC. Recognizing this, the Government, in mid-1995, reduced the
payment arrears to the 1994 level and has undertaken to ensure that all



- 44 -
commercial contractual arrangements are strictly enforced and all future
deliveries are settled promptly;6
(b)   The significant level of spare parts inventory amounting to an inventory
turnover of about 420 days.  Some 40 percent of these stores were
acquired prior to 1991 and are either surplus, slow-moving or obsolete.
The lack of adequate stock and usage data and cash flow have led to a
shortage of essential inventory and increased the potential for obsolete
inventory. BJSC is addressing this problem, and further assistance is
proposed under this project (para. 4.13); and
(c)    Fixed assets are old and largely obsolete, and will need to be replaced.
Under the project about two-thirds of the existing asset base will be retired
and written off over the next five years. This will impact significantly
short- to medium-term profits and tax payments.
5.12   Although the current ratio of 2.3 is quite satisfactory, it is clear that both the level
of current assets and current liabilities are far in excess of what they should be, and result
from: (a) the excessive stores and consumables inventory levels; (b) the slow collection
of receivables; and therefore (c) the slow settlement of trade creditors. BJSC has been
drained of liquidity and the maximum balance of cash on hand of $0.2 million (Tg 84.2
million) in January 1995 is inadequate for a company of this size and must be increased
(paras. 5.15-5.18).
C. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
5.13   Financial Overview. The financial projections for BJSC for the period 1996
through 2014 were undertaken using a detailed model of the company based on agreed
financial performance targets (Table 5.4), the minimum increase in coal price to ensure a
break-even position within five years, and other assumptions contained in Annx 5.1.
The resulting income statement, funds flow and balance sheet are outlined in detail in that
Annex and summarized in Table 5.3 below.
5.14   Production is projected to increase to 3.1 million tons in 1996, 3.8 million tons in
1997, and 4.0 million tons per year thereafter. Unit cash operating costs are expected to
increase in constant terms by 12 percent over 1994 levels to an average of $4.8 per ton
during 1996-2014 ($10 per ton coal equivalent-which is relatively low in international
terms). This includes adequate provision for maintenance, improvements in coal quality
6 In May 1995, under the direction of MEGM, receivables of $4.1 million from CHP Plant 4 were
assigned to, or set off against, other government agencies to reduce the amounts owned by BJSC. In
August 1995, BJSC, CHP Plants 3 and 4, the CES and Mongol Railways reached agreement on a strict,
month-by-month coal payment plan, which has been implemented effectively through the end of 1995.

and environmental management. Annual investment costs during 1996-99 will be
financed by IDA and a cofinancier, and from BJSC's own internally generated resources.

5.15      As coal prices are gradually increased in constant US  dollar terms over the next
five years, BJSC will become financially independent with its financial position
improving from a projected loss in 1997 of $5.3 million to break even in 2000 and
thereafter gradually rising to a level of around $1.3 million as graphically depicted in
Chart 5.1 provided that all coal is promptly paid for and BJSC is allowed to write off the
increased annual depreciation allowances resulting from the formal revaluation of its
assets.
5.16   Coal Pricing. The Government has adopted a plan acceptable to IDA to regularly
increase the price of coal to enable BJSC to meet its financial covenants, generate
sufficient internal resources to meet its debt servicing obligations, and fund an
appropriate maintenance and capital equipment replacement program (ref. para. 5.21). A
price adjustment mechanism that incorporates the necessary principles is presented in
Annex 5.2. The plan calls for a gradual increase in real prices to a level of $7.50 per ton
in 2000, in 1995 constant price terms, representing a total increase in real terms of 34
percent over the 1995 average price level. In current terms, the plan provides for an



- 46 -
increase in the average level of prices to $6.20/ton in 1996, $6.80/ton in 1997, rising
further each year to $8.50/ton in 2000 (see Table 5.4). Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the plan will be implemented in accordance with its terms. Realization
of the planned average yearly price level in 1996 will require an increase in BJSC's coal
price to $6.80 during mid-year 1996. Action by the Borrower to increase the price of
BJSC 's coal to the equivalent of $6. 80 per ton (at a calorific value of 3, 360 kcal/ton), free
on rail at Baganuur, will be a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.17  Taxation. The amount of taxation paid by BJSC will be reduced significantly
with the revaluation of its existing assets, write-off of the undepreciated portion of the rail
haulage system and existing but obsolete coal-handling plant, the project's major capital
expenditure program and the resulting increase in depreciation allowances. Although
losses will not be carried forward for tax purposes, the Government has adopted a plan,
acceptable to IDA, to phase in the increased allowances over three years (ref. para. 5.21).
Under the plan, (a) all of BJSC's assets will be revalued to fair market price from
January 1, 1996 and annually thereafter as and when deemed necessary by BJSC in
accordance with IAS; and (b) all fixed assets, as revalued, will be depreciated annually
over their useful lives, and the annual depreciation provision will be deducted from
BJSC's income when calculating tax, with 50 percent of the depreciation provision
applied for tax purposes in 1996, 75 percent in 1997, and 100 percent thereafter.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the plan would be implemented in
accordance with its terms. Accordingly, BJSC's tax burden is expected to decline over
the next few years, but will resume in 2001 at an average level of approximately $1.0
million to $1.5 million annually.

5.18 Accounts Receivable and Working Capital Management. Appropriate pricing
and fiscal relief are not in themselves sufficient and BJSC has, in addition to vigorous
cost control, agreed to liquidate all excess working capital over a reasonable period of



- 47 -
time. To achieve this, BJSC will strictly enforce the terms of its existing sales contracts,
with the Government's assistance, and collect all sales proceeds within 30 days of
delivery. BJSC, with the Government's endorsement and assurances with respect to
compliance by the Government's combined heat and power plants, has adopted a plan,
acceptable to IDA, to progressively reduce the average collection period by reducing the
arrears over a five-year period from 184 days at end-1995 to 30 days (ref. paras. 5.21,
5.22; see Table 5.4). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the plan will be
implemented in accordance with its terms. With suitable training and the introduction of
an appropriate stores control and management system, inventories also will be
progressively run down or written off from a level of 418 days in 1994 to below 60 days.
5.19   Future Profitability.  With the provisions agreed with the Government and
efficiency improvements in BJSC, the company is projected to regain its financial
viability and begin to show net profits in 2001. The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio is
projected to peak at 67 percent during 1999-2001, and gradually decline thereafter.
BJSC's equity base will erode from $40.1 million to $24.5 million in 2000, but then
begin to recover. BJSC will become financially independent and will not require
concessional fimding or budgetary support. With output priced at $7.50/ton in 1995
terms, BJSC will show an average return on total capital employed of about 2.8 percent
during the first decade of the next century, which is low by international standards. As
the financial position of the energy sector in general improves, coal prices will need to be
further increased over time for BJSC to become commercially competitive with other
types of enterprises, debt worthy, and sufficiently attractive for full transfer to the private
sector.
D. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TARGETS
5.20   To ensure that prudent financial policies are implemented, the project's benefits
realized and its financial performance sustained at an acceptable level, BJSC has
undertaken to remain within the performance targets set out in Table 5.4 below.

of the end of its fiscal year;
(b)   ensure that BJSC will be able to comply with its financial performance
targets agreed with IDA by ensuring, in particular:
(i)   regular adjustments in coal prices charged by BJSC according to a
plan acceptable to the Association;
(ii)   progressive reduction in the average collection periodfor payment
for coal supplied by BJSC to the Borrower's combined heat/power
plants, according to a plan acceptable to the Association; and
(iii)    BJSC is allowed the full deduction for tax purposes of the
depreciation provisions resulting from the application of
international accounting standards, according to a timetable
agreed with the Association.
5.22  At negotiations, IDA obtained assurances from BJSC that it will:
(a)   prepare project accounts and its annualfinancial statements and, together
with an independent audit report, submit these to IDA within 6 months of
its financial year end;
(b)   revalue its assets regularly in accordance with international accounting
standards and in compliance with government regulations;
(c)   not incur any further indebtedness unless its net revenues exceed, and are
projected to continue exceeding its debt service obligations by at least 1.6
times;
(d)   maintain a ratio of debt to equity of no greater than 70 to 30;
(e)   (i) attain a profit break-even by December 31, 2000 and maintain
profitability thereafter; and (ii) take all measures in its power to ensure
that the average collection periodfor payments for coal delivered shall be
progressively reducedfrom its current level to 30 days in accordance with
a plan and timetable acceptable to the Association; and
Ci)   provide IDA, by April 30 of each year, with a rolling five-year financial
plain containing BJSC's investment program, production plan and
projectedfinancial statements, and thereafter implement this plan, taking
into account IDA 's comments.

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. OVERVIEW
6.1   The proposed project is part of a coordinated effort of the international donors to
provide assistance, on an urgent basis, to improve the reliability of energy supply for the
country's urban economy and population. The proposed investment and associated
restructuring of BJSC is the surest, and most timely and economic means available to
stabilize coal production, overcome current coal shortages, and provide additional coal to
meet gradually increasing demand. The project supports two major objectives of IDA's
Country Assistance Strategy: removal of infrastructure bottlenecks and promotion of
further enterprise reform (para. 1.23). An integral part of the energy sector strategy under
recent IDA sector work, IDA support for rehabilitation in the coal sector will enable other
international donors to focus more on the rehabilitation of the main CHP plants, which is
also urgently needed (para. 1.28).
6.2   Based perhaps in part on Mongolia's development experience in the 1980s,
MEGM has projected sharp increases in future domestic coal demand and associated
substantial coal development investment scenarios. Given that market forces are just
developing in the coal subsector, and that the economy is undergoing considerable
restructuring during this transitional period, a far more conservative view of future
demand was used to analyze the merits of the proposed project (paras. 2.10-2.11). The
investments at Baganuur are optimal under the conservative demand scenario, or even yet
lower demand assumptions (paras. 2.12-2.13). In the event of more robust demand, the
mine development program at Baganuur could efficiently and relatively easily be
adjusted to accommodate higher productions levels, at some 6 Mtpy compared with the
planned 4 Mtpy. The incremental unit costs of higher production would in fact be lower,
further improving the economics of mine operations.
B. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
6.3   A variety of alternatives to meet coal demand were analyzed, including coal
imports, development of other mines, and use of different mining technology. The
proposed rehabilitation investment at Baganuur is both the least-cost alternative, and the
most reliable means to provide the coal supplies to meet the basic needs of the urban
population and requirements for power generation and industrial fuel.
6.4   The Alternative of Coal Imports. The economic cost of coal from Baganuur is
clearly well below the cost of imported coal. With the proposed investment, and using
economic shadow prices, the average economic cost of coal produced at Baganuur over
the life of the project is estimated at about $7.70/ton ex-mine. Adding the estimated
economic costs of transport and handling, and with adjustments for the low calorific



- 50 -
value of lignite, the average economic cost of coal from Baganuur is about $18.50/ton of
6,000 kcal/kg coal equivalent (tce). The international price of coal is in excess of $30/tce,
and uncompetitive.
6.5   However, Mongolia may be able to obtain coal from low-cost producers in Russia
or China at discounted prices. In the Kuzbass Basin in Russia, where very large surplus
production capacity exists, short-run marginal production costs are estimated to be as low
as $5.35/tce, in 1995 prices. Adjusting for transportation and handling costs, however,
costs would rise to about $18.80/tce delivered in Ulaanbaatar. Even in the unlikely event
that Mongolia could obtain prices based purely on short-run costs, from the lowest-cost
producers available, with no economic rent, Baganuur's costs would remain competitive.
Prices of imports from North China, where ex-mine prices are on the order of $15 to
$17/tce of medium quality coal would be higher, even with discounts.
6.6   Other Alternatives. There is no viable domestic alternative to the investment at
Baganuur to fully overcome current coal shortages and meet demand over the short and
medium term. Opportunities to expand production at Sharyn Gol are far more limited,
and incremental production costs over a sustained period are estimated to be $12 to
$15/ton of raw coal, ex-mine, or higher. At Shive Ovoo, the priority is to raise the quality
of coal currently produced to acceptable levels, and the feasibility of substantially
increasing marketable output remains uncertain. Continued use of the current mining
technology at Baganuur severely limits output, with unit costs that compare unfavorably
with the mine development scheme proposed under the project, notwithstanding that the
costs of existing equipment are already sunk.
C. BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS
6.7   Benefit-cost analysis was completed for the proposed investment, analyzing the
incremental costs and benefits between full "with project" and "without project" cases,
and using shadow prices to reflect economic costs to the country (see Annex- 61). The
"with project" case models the economics of Baganuur's operation under the project for a
20-year period, including both initial and equipment replacement investments, and
reaching a targeted production level of 4 Mtpy in 1998. The "without project" case
models the economics of the mine's operation using existing technology, with little
investment until 2002, when significant equipment replacement costs must be incurred,
and with a production level of 2.5 Mtpy, due to the constraints posed by the existing
capability of the railway overburden removal system. The value of coal output is
conservatively estimated at just $7.80/ton, ex-mine, based on parity with coal imported
from the Kuzbass at well below international market prices.
6.8   The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project is estimated to be
24 percent, based on the incremental costs and benefits between the "with project" case
and the "without project" case. The net present value of the project is $17 million, at a
discount rate of 12 percent. Using the average projected financial price for Baganuur's
output, or $7.29/ton in 1995 prices, the EIRR of the project is estimated at 21 percent.



- 51 -
The EIRR is particularly robust because of the long-term cost advantages of the mobile
mining technology compared to the existing railway system. Unit cash operating costs
with the project are about 20 percent less than without the project. Moreover, although
relatively little investment is required until after 2000 in the "without project" case, unit
costs for equipment replacement are then relatively high.
6.9   The economics of Baganuur's future mining operation, as opposed to the
economics of just the proposed investment, are better captured by reviewing future
average production costs. Assuming a real discount rate of 12 percent per year, the
average economic cost of production is estimated at $7.70/ton. Even compared with the
estimated minimum possible import parity price of $7.80/ton, the mine would still yield a
small net present value of over the 20-year period of $3.5 million. With an import parity
price equivalent to $35/tce delivered to Ulaanbaatar, and more in line with standard
international prices, the net present value of Baganuur's operation rises to $200 million.
D. PROJECT RISKS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
6.10  The proposed project is ambitious. For the project to fully meet all of its
objectives, major changes are not only required in BJSC's operations, but also in BJSC's
financial operating environment. The principal risks identified with respect to project
implementation and financial sustainability comprise:
(a)    Risk that payments for coal to BJSC may be delayed, or that coal price or
fiscal reforms may be delayed, compromising BJSC's ability to become
financially self-sufficient;
(b)   Risk that BJSC will be unable to fully meet production and efficiency
targets, thereby compromising the project's benefits and BJSC's financial
position, due to delays in equipment delivery, lack of sufficient
management and supervision reform at BJSC, failure to implement
maintenance system improvements, or inadequate training;
(c)   Risk that BJSC will be unable to control unit operating costs due to
insufficient supervision, poor budgetary control or currency devaluations;
and
(d)   Risk that institutional weaknesses will not enable BJSC to implement the
project effectively or achieve necessary efficiency improvements.
6.11   These risks, if unmitigated, could impact the project's financial and economic
viability to the extent reflected in Table 6.1 below. The project's economic rate of return
remains strong even with substantial increases in operating costs or a reduction in the
mine's output by 10 percent over the life of the project. The financial rate of return of the
project falls to insufficient, although still positive levels, with major reductions in output
levels, failure to achieve any increase in real price levels, lack of tax policy changes, or a
major further increase in BJSC's accounts receivable.

6.12   The financial stability and solvency of BJSC as a whole is far more sensitive to
the risks identified than the investment project alone. Charts 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 provide an
assessment in nominal terms. Failure to implement agreed real price increases or tax
reforms, in particular, will place the company in an untenable situation. BJSC's equity
base could at worst be entirely eroded.

6.13   Accordingly, the project's design and its implementation plan include a strong
emphasis on measures to mitigate the risks of BJSC's financial instability or insolvency.
Well-known and tested mining technology will be employed, with a relatively simple
mine plan and substantial training and technical assistance in operations management and
supervision, to ensure that production targets can be met and that productivity gains can
be achieved. The Government is committed to implementation of the necessary price
reforms, income tax allowances in accordance with IAS, and a policy of timely payment
by consumers for coal deliveries, and IDA obtained assurances on these commitments at
negotiations (para. 5.21). Implementation of a substantial coal price increase will be a
condition of credit effectiveness. Risks will be further mitigated by intensive IDA



- 54 -
supervision, during project implementation, and the deepening dialogue with the
Government on the energy sector associated with the planned second energy lending
operation.
6.14 Risks of serious project implementation difficulties have been minimized with a
major program to continue the process of upgrading BJSC's management and project
implementation capacity initiated with BJSC's incorporation in 1995, emphasized during
project preparation, and support through further training and technical assistance under
the project.

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1   The following assurances were obtained at negotiations:
(a)   From the Borrower that it would:
(i)   adopt a plan, by no later than December 31, 1996, satisfactory to
the Association, for the transfer of the authority to exercise all
rights and the requirement to fulfill all obligations of the Borrower
in its capacity as shareholder of BJSC from MEGM to an entity
fully independent from MEGM or any other organization, agency
or individual with responsibilities for any aspect of energy or
mining sector policy or regulation (para. 3.9);
(ii)   carry out the coal sector strategy technical assistance in accordance
with Terms of Reference and an implementation schedule
acceptable to the Association, and prepare and provide to IDA
annual progress reports on the implementation of the technical
assistance (para. 4.13);
(iii)   relend a portion of the proceeds of the Credit to BJSC under a
subsidiary loan agreement with terms and conditions approved by
the Association (para. 4.17);
(iv)    submit a mid-project review report, under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Association, to IDA by April 1, 1998, review
this report with the Association by June 1, 1998 and ensure
efficient completion of the project based on the recommendations
of this report and the Association's views on the matter (para.
4.35);
(v)    ensure that BJSC will be able to comply with its financial
performance targets agreed with IDA, by ensuring, in particular,
a. regular adjustments in coal prices charged by BJSC according to

ANNEX 4.1: PROJECT PERFORMANCE MONITORING
INDICATORS
1.    The performance of the project in meeting its objectives (para. 4.5 in the main
text) will be closely monitored throughout the life of the project, based on the criteria
outlined below. These criteria assume that the proposed credit will become effective
during the summer of 1996.
Objective A: Achievement and Maintenance of Coal Production of 4 Mtpy
2.    The main objective of the proposed project is to reverse the decline in Mongolia's
coal production by increasing sustainable production levels at the Baganuur mine to
4 million tons per year (Mtpy). Performance will be monitored against the following
production objectives:
Objective                       Unit       1997  1998  1999  2000-2014
Coal production            million tons/year   3.5/a  4.0   4.0    4.0
Truck and shovel overburden   million bcm/year   9.0/a 10.0  10.0  9.6
removal
Coal handling plant throughput million tons/year  --  3.5   3.5   3.54.01k
La The production target for 1997 is 3.8 million tons of coal, with truck and shovel
overburden removal of 9.9 million bcm. Criteria here are minimum performance
levels.
lk Throughput of 4.0 million tons per year should be achieved by 2005 by the latest.
Objective B: BJSC's Financial Self-Sufficiency
3.    A key objective is for BJSC to develop a healthy financial position without
government financial support. The fundamental objective is for BJSC to (a) generate and
maintain an annual net profit, including all capital investment costs according to
International Accounting Standards (IAS) , by the year 2001 and every year thereafter,
and (b) achieve this without government subsidies or grants for either operating or
investment costs. To enable BJSC to meet these objectives, the Government has agreed
to implement the following coal price increases, and to ensure that the power industry
makes timely payments to allow the following reductions in BJSC's accounts receivable.

4.    Additional key measures include: (a) a full phase-in for income tax purposes of
depreciation provisions in line with IAS by 1998 or sooner; (b) maintenance of a debt to
equity ratio of not greater than 70 to 30; and (c) maintenance of a debt service coverage
ratio of at least 1.6.
Objective C: Increase Equipment Productivity and Improve Efficiency at BJSC
5.    Achievement of this objective will be monitored against the following
performance criteria:
(a)   Operation of shovels for 10 shifts/week, 50 weeks/year; and operating
dump trucks for 12 shifts/week, 50 weeks/year.
(b)   Increase in the effective shift operating hours to at least 7.4 in 1996; 8.3 in
1997; 9.0 in 1998; 9.5 in 1999, and 10.0 in 2000.
(c)   Maintain minimum shovel availability of at least 70 percent.
(d)   Maintain minimum shovel productivity of 492 bcm/hour for 8-10 m3 units,
and 285 bcrn/hour for 5 m3 units.
(e)   Ensure truck and auxiliary mine equipment availabilities as warranted by
suppliers under ICB procurement warranty requirements.
6.    With these and other measures, unit cash operating costs(excluding depreciation)
will gradually increase from the 1994 level of $4.30/ton to no more than $4.80/ton during
2000-04 (in 1995 prices). The higher cash operating costs result from maintenance of an
overburden removal program consistent with a stable coal production level of 4 million
tons, and improvements in coal quality and environmental management. These unit cash
operating costs represent a major reduction compared to projected costs of $6.00/ton in
the without-project case.
Objective D: BJSC Should Operate as an Independent Commercial Company
7.    BJSC has already been established as an independent shareholding company.
Further progress in the company's restructuring program will be monitored during project
implementation, including, in particular:



- 64 -                    ANNEX 4.1
(a)   Adoption by the Government of a plan, satisfactory to IDA, by
December 31, 1996, to transfer authority to act on behalf of the
government as owner of the government's shares in BJSC to an agency
fully independent from MEGM or other agencies involved in energy or
mining sector policy or regulation;
(b)   Progress in implementation of BJSC's manpower reduction program
(Annex 4.12);
(c)   Implementation  of improved  mine  operational management and
supervision, maintenance, and financial control and accounting within
BJSC, during 1997-99, assisted through relevant training and TA; and
(d)   Financial performance, as monitored under Objective B above.
Objective E: BJSC Should Operate in an Environmentally Sustainable Manner
8.    Achievement of this objective will be monitored within the framework of the
agreed Environmental Management Program (EMP) in Annex 4.11. Criteria important
for the process include (a) the establishment of a functioning Environmental Management
Unit within BJSC during 1996, and training of the Unit's staff during 1997-99;
(b) completion of the project's environmental training and TA component during
1997-99; and (c) preparation of biannual environmental monitoring reports throughout
the project implementation period. As further detailed in Annex 4.11, key criteria for
evaluation of this objective include:
(a)   Mitigation of any adverse impacts on the small lake near to the mine site,
in the unlikely event that mine operations impact the lake's water level;
(b)   Implementation of the time-bound reclamation program; and
(c)   Implementation of fugitive dust, hazardous waste management and
occupational health and safety plans in the EMP.

ANNEX 4.2: BAGANUUR COAL MINE REHABILITATION
DEVELOPMENT PLAN
9.    Central to the BJSC mine rehabilitation development plan is technological
renovation encompassing, primarily, the replacement of the traditional and historically
inefficient rail overburden removal system by large-scale (85-ton) Western dump trucks.
In addition, the mine development plan encompasses the introduction of larger-scale
auxiliary mine equipment (320-550 hp track bulldozers, 310 hp wheel bulldozers, high-
capacity 275 hp motor graders, and various ancillary equipment items (lowboys, fuel and
lubrication trucks, tire trucks, etc.). All of these physical rehabilitation steps are designed
to: (a) restore the BJSC operation to its former production rate of 4.0 million tons coal
per year on a sustainable and environmentally acceptable level; (b) enhance the efficiency
of the various mine excavation (overburden and coal) and haulage systems; and (c) secure
the delivery of a reliable fuel supply to Ulaanbaatar CHPs. A new coal-handling plant
will be designed and constructed in order to improve the reliability (size range and coal
quality) of the coal product deliveries.
10.  IBRD Drawing 27479 indicates the mine development plan over the 1995-2014,
20-year period. On the basis of international mine planning standards, end-year mine
bench locations are illustrated annually over the coming five-year period and at five-year
intervals thereafter. The mine life based on available proven reserves is considerably
beyond 2014. Although specific mine development boundaries have not been planned
beyond 2014, the mine development planning has taken into account the future coal seam
extraction to avoid short-term "high grading" of the coal deposit and to allow for the
positive economics of the BJSC operation to be maintained throughout its life cycle. As
indicated on the Drawing, attempts have been made to develop mining benches that are
more continuous than was previously the case. In earlier years, coal extraction was
undertaken in a number of discontinuous areas and as overburden removal by the rail
system lagged further behind planned levels, BJSC was forced to extract coal in the lower
stripping ratio areas to ensure that coal production was maximized to the extent possible.
Coal operations at the Pit 61 (Coal Seam #2) were discontinued in 1994. Coal extraction
in Mountain Section 3 (Reserve Pit) (Coal Seam #3) will be continued through 1999 until
taken over by the advancing benches of the main Mountain Section 2 area, which will
thereafter extract coal seams # 2a and 3 (coal seam 2 in this area is thin and of poorer
quality and will not be taken within the Mountain Section 2 coal extraction operation.
The mine development plan focuses on the orderly down-dip development of the western
and southern sections of the Main Pit (Mountain Sections 1-coal seams # 2 and 2a, and
Mountain Section 2-coal seam 2a, and 3 after 1999 and the discontinuation of Mountain
Section 3) and the further down-dip development of Mountain Section 5 (coal seam #2),



- 66 -                     ANNEX 4.2
to the south. Commencing in the year 2000, and in order to maintain a relatively constant
stripping ratio in the 3.5-4.0 range, Mountain Section 5 Extension will be developed
from Coal Seam #2 outcrop in order to connect the Main Pit (Mountain Section 2) to
Mountain Section 5 and to provide for an 8-kilometer long open-pit strike length.
Progressive development of Mountain Sections 1, 2, and 5 will continue at higher
stripping ratios in parallel to the low stripping ratio Mountain Section 5 Extension area to
maintain a balanced overall (3.5-4.0) stripping ratio and predictably uniform mine
economics. As the Mountain Section 5 Extension area progresses down-dip and into
higher stripping ratios, the northern flank of the Mountain Section 1 (Mountain Section 4)
will commence development at Coal Seam #2A outcrop, starting in 2010. Details of the
annual overburden and coal production schedules for the various mine sections are
attached to this Annex.
11.   Overburden removal will be transferred from the Main Pit rail system at the time
of delivery of the large dump truck fleet (anticipated mid- to late 1996). Thereafter,
overburden will be removed by the existing Former Soviet Union (FSU) EKG 5 and 8
cubic meters (mi3) rope crowd excavators, loading the new 85-ton dump trucks. The final
overburden bench overlying the coal seam will be removed by the existing fleet of 10-
20 m3 draglines, some of which will operate in tandem in order to provide for optimal
overburden dump placement. Coal extraction will continue to be undertaken by the
existing 5.0 m 3 rope shovels loading the existing fleet of 18-23 ton Belaz (FSU) and
Komatsu (Japan) trucks. This coal truck fleet will be replaced at the end of its useful life
(1998) with a fleet of larger (40-ton) coal dump trucks. Existing 5-8 mi3 overburden rope
shovels will be replaced progressively at the end of their useful life by more flexible 10-
11 m3 front-end loaders. The smaller (4-5 mi3) rope shovels operating in coal will be
progressively replaced by 6 m3 loaders. By 2005, all existing rope shovels will have been
retired and replaced by front-end loaders
12.   The mine development plan, minimizes the use of existing equipment by
emphasizing increased levels of the equipment productivity of the larger-size excavators.
By adopting international norms of shifts worked per year, equipment productivity and
thus effective operating hours per shift, the mine development plan will ensure enhanced
mine economics. At present the mine operates 14 rope shovels (four 8 m 3 units, five 5 m3
units, three 4.6 mi3 unit and two 4 mi3 units) and one 5.8 mi3 front-end loader. A 10 m3
shovel provided under earlier FSU assistance has never been commissioned and can be
considered as potentially unserviceable. The mine development plan (starting in 1997
following removal of the rail overburden system and its replacement with large dump
trucks) provides for the use of only four of the existing 8 m3 shovels and one 5 m unit on
overburden excavation and only three 5 m3 shovels and the 5.8 m3 loader on coal
excavation. Thus, a number of the smaller overburden and coal excavators can and will
be taken out of service and put on a care and maintenance basis such that labor and
maintenance costs can be reduced, minimizing the overall level of the coal mine
operating costs. In addition, out of the seven 10-20 m3 draglines currently in operation,
two operating in existing rail dumps will be discontinued and two of the five draglines
traditionally operating on the overburden bench overlying coal seams will become



-67 -                      ANNEX 4.2
unnecessary by 1997/98 and will be taken out of service and either sold or placed on care
and maintenance, thus further reducing the level of overall mine operating costs .
13.   Overburden excavation and coal production targets utilizing only the large-scale
main mining equipment will be achieved by a combination of (a) refocused mine
organization and management, and more effective mine operations supervision, assisted
by training and technical assistance programs; (b) increased equipment availability (a
minimum of 70 percent for shovels, and 80 percent for trucks) and thus the number of
effective operating shifts (490) per year for individual truck/shovel combinations;
(c) increase in effective operating hours per shift (from the present level of 6 hours per
12-hour operating shift up to 10 hours per shift by 2000, close to international levels);
and (d) by the procurement of larger-scale mine support equipment (bulldozers, graders
and an additional front-end loader) to improve mine bench conditions, support main
mining equipment fleets and to generally enhance in-pit housekeeping.
14.   The existing coal handling plant cannot produce a satisfactory coal product for
Ulaanbaatar CHPs. The size range of deliveries (up to 300 mm) is unmanageable and
coal quality is seriously affected by overburden (ash) contamination. In addition, the
original design does not provide for a satisfactory health and safety environment for
operating personnel and is intrinsically unsafe. The plant has experienced in the past
various internal explosions and resultant collapse. Preliminary engineering undertaken
during project preparation has identified the conceptual components of a new coal
handling plant and a new plant will be developed on a turnkey basis, following
international detailed engineering. The pant will provide for all coal to be crushed and
sized (at minus 50 mm), stored by linear stacker, recovered by an underground reclaimer
and loaded onto rail. A new rail spur will be developed from the existing line and a haul
road constructed to the plant from Mountain Section 5 area. The plant will be located
approximately in the location of the present coal-handling plant, its final location to be
optimized during detailed engineering works. The new plant will provide for a consistent
coal quality of minimum 3,500 kcal/kg (exceeding minimum 3,200 kcal/kg heat content
required by the Ulaanbaatar CHPs).

ANNEX 4.3: MINE MAINTENANCE PLAN
Background
1.    Mine maintenance (workshop) and materials (warehouse) operations at Baganuur
are not well developed. Although lack of funding has led to low levels of spare parts
stocks, the poor mine and equipment performance (utilization and availability) over
recent years has been due essentially to underdeveloped maintenance and materials
management systems. There is currently a poor maintenance organizational structure and
a low maintenance skill level at BJSC. A program containing essential elements of
preventative maintenance, planned corrective maintenance and planned equipment
replacement is absent. Although there is a form of maintenance planning, only a limited
percentage of maintenance tasks are on schedule and detailed schedules of maintenance
tasks have not been prepared, which has lead to ineffective maintenance management.
Restructuring of the whole maintenance function from an organization and direction/
control viewpoint is required including workshop reconstruction and retooling, in order to
provide adequate support to production activities and in order for BJSC to be able to
operate on a reliable coal production basis and in a financially self-sufficient manner.
Development Plan
2.    Maintenance planning is recognized as a prerequisite to efficient mining operation
and therefore a function that must be planned in consultation with production
management personnel. Such planning is recognized as a key tool in each area of the
maintenance function. As a first step toward efficient maintenance management, a
systematic approach will be developed to work identification and documentation.
Estimates will be prepared for the labor, materials and tools required to fulfill individual
work orders. A work order backlog system will be developed to identify and monitor
maintenance activities. Maintenance scheduling will be introduced in order to develop
maintenance programs that assist maintenance planning, requisitioning and future labor
requirements. This will facilitate the formulation of future maintenance requirements
including a weekly maintenance plan and arrangement of maintenance equipment, tools,
spares and labor availability. A preventative maintenance program and agenda will be
developed. Maintenance will be organized in relation to production needs and BJSC will
develop a detailed schedule of mine equipment to be maintained, a schedule of individual
maintenance tasks to be performed, a schedule of when individual tasks need to be
performed, a program to ensure that such tasks are undertaken, and documentation to
record the results and effectiveness of the maintenance function.



- 70-                     ANNEX 4.3
3.    A skills assessment of existing maintenance personnel will be undertaken; present
indications are that approximately 50 percent of maintenance staff are not adequately
experienced or trained to perform required maintenance tasks/functions. Training
programs will be developed to upgrade maintenance management and maintenance skills
encompassing areas and types of training required, training modules needed, and a
schedule for future training. Skill requirements will be identified against international
standards with skills assessed, training programs developed, reference materials prepared,
a training schedule developed, and learning path development formulated.
4.    Although materials in the mine warehouse are on a computerized data entry
system, this is simply to identify the existence and location of spares. There is no system
of minimum stock level identification and computerized reordering and requisitioning. A
complete overhaul of the materials management system is planned so that materials
availability can be efficiently managed and provide the necessary material inputs to
maintenance (workshop) management and functions.
5.    This maintenance development plan will lead by end-1998 to the development of
a well-organized and permanent BJSC system of maintenance documentation, planning,
execution and follow-up, that approaches international maintenance policies, practices
and procedures and that will permit mine equipment to reach and sustain international
levels of equipment productivity. The development and implementation of effective
maintenance and materials management systems will be created by a combination of
overseas training of key BJSC maintenance and materials management personnel as well
as by in-country assistance by international experts who will help address skills
requirements and availability, training requirements and training instruction, and effective
maintenance and materials management system development (see Annex 4.4).



- 71-                      ANNEX 4.4
ANNEX 4.4: TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN
MINE MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND OPERATIONS
Background
1.    BJSC will rehabilitate its open-pit coal operation to reach a sustainable production
level of 4 million tons coal per year and to increase the overall efficiency of the mine's
operation, thus providing a reliable and low cost coal supply for the country's combined
heat and power plants in Ulaanbaatar. Although new mining equipment will be procured
(and particularly large-scale dump trucks that will replace the existing overburden rail
haulage system) and a new coal-handling plant constructed, training is required to expose
BJSC executives and personnel to the best international coal mine management and
operations practices and procedures.
2.    BJSC has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) focusing on all aspects of
the coal mine rehabilitation and this PIP has benefited from inputs by various
international consultants including specialists from Coopers and Lybrand, Canada (mine
organization and management), Morrison Knudsen, United States (mine operations and
planning) and Performance Associates, United States. Relevant sections of these inputs
are incorporated in the PIP and provide further background to the following Scope of
Services.
Scope of Services
3.    BJSC requires training in the areas of corporate management, mine planning,
mine operations and supervision, mine maintenance and materials management, and mine
cost engineering. The most important areas are mine operations and supervision, and
maintenance and materials management. Maintenance and materials management should
account for 40 to 45 percent of the total resource inputs, mine operations and supervision
for roughly 25 percent, corporate management for about 20 percent, mine planning for 5
to 10 percent and cost engineering for about 5 percent. In each area, training should
include a well-coordinated combination of on-site advice and technical assistance from
international specialists concerning international norms, practices, and options for
improvements at Baganuur to BJSC management, on-the-job training for BJSC
personnel, and arrangements of overseas study and/or training visits for BJSC personnel.
All international and local consultants will report to BJSC management. Broad outlines
of requirements in each area are provided below. As there is considerable overlap and
need for integration in the training work in each area, implementation of the various



- 72 -                     ANNEX 4.4
training components also needs to be closely coordinated. More detailed Terms of
Reference will be issued at the outset of project implementation.
Corporate Management
4.    Although the executives of BJSC are fully committed to coal mine rehabilitation
under the developing market economy in Mongolia, training is required to assist the
executives to focus further on organizational and manpower development (including
manpower reduction), production and equipment/labor productivity, cost and other
efficiency targets and goals that need to be better established to reach, maintain and
monitor effectively improvements in company and mine performance. Of particular
importance is training of BJSC executives in operating in a market economy setting and
with financial accountability to shareholders, including the development of clear
corporate objectives and related production, financial, marketing and environmental
strategies and plans. In addition, corporate management would benefit from training in
the identification and development of job skills (experience and qualifications) definition
for mine management (superintendents, supervisors, foremen, etc.) and in the establish-
ment and enforcement of job responsibilities and accountabilities for these positions.
Training in the appropriate methods to motivate all levels of the mine work force is also
required and the company needs to develop better, journeyman-type career paths for its
personnel, particularly at the operator/maintenance personnel level. Training programs
for corporate executives down through supervisors/foremen to operators/maintenance
personnel need to be developed.
Mine Development Planning
J.    Detailed annual mine rehabilitation plans have been prepared. Training in short-
term mine planning tools and techniques (allocation and location of equipment fleets!
types and efficient allocation/utilization of auxiliary and ancillary mine equipment) is
required. Mine planning tools and techniques remain manual and a review is required of
potential computer software applications to fast-track coal reserves and coal quality
evaluations and mine plan forecasts; mine bench development; equipment productivity
forecasting and monitoring; labor requirements; and planned and actual equipment and
labor productivity. Assistance in the implementation of appropriate software packages
and training in its utilization is required.
Mine Operations and Supervision
6.    Mine operations remain characterized by relatively low levels of production and
productivity, and improved mine practices and procedures (equipment applications,
bench development techniques, loading and haulage practices and effective utilization of
auxiliary and ancillary mine equipment) need to be introduced. Mine personnel need to
be trained in improved mining practices and procedures, both generally, and specifically
in connection with the technological shift to sole reliance on trucks and shovels for
overburden removal. Training is particularly needed for superintendents, supervisors and
foremen, so that efficiency and productivity can be raised to at least the levels set out in



-73 -                      ANNEX 4.4
the project's key performance criteria (Annex 4.1). Further guidance on training of
equipment operators (particularly in relation to the large-scale mobile mining equipment
to be procured under the IDA-financed project) will be required. Methods of improving
general in-pit housekeeping should be addressed.
7.    Following review of existing documents concerning BJSC's mine plan and
initiatives to improve mine operational efficiency, and completion of a brief diagnostic
review, international specialists in mine supervision and operation should agree with
BJSC management on a comprehensive technical assistance and training work program in
the above areas. The diagnostic review should include a review of training to be provided
by equipment suppliers and recommendation of any additional operational and
maintenance training. The subsequent work program should include on-site technical
assistance and training by international experts, and training overseas for BJSC mine
management personnel, including study and discussion of all aspects of mine supervision
and operations (e.g., organization and accountability of supervisory personnel, mine
development approaches, international levels of equipment and labor productivity,
utilization of auxiliary and ancillary equipment fleets, shift scheduling and monitoring).
Mine Maintenance and Materials Management
8.    The efficiency of the BJSC coal mine operation is constrained by the lack of
effective maintenance and materials management systems. Maintenance planning and
scheduling is basically nonexistent and the important linkage between effective
maintenance and the attainment of predictable production outputs is not well appreciated
by maintenance personnel. There is no systematic approach to maintenance work
identification and documentation, and work order discipline is poor. The impact of the
above factors can be illustrated by the fact that truck breakdown maintenance frequency
has escalated progressively from 36 percent in 1993 to 60 percent in 1994. Maintenance
tools, machinery and facilities are below international standards but will be upgraded
under the IDA-financed project.
9.    BJSC is undertaking a complete overhaul of the mine's system for equipment and
facility maintenance and materials management. The company has instituted a new
organizational setup, consolidating maintenance responsibilities under one deputy
director (Annex 3.1) In the new organizational framework, workshop and warehouse
organization and management will be overhauled. BJSC requires technical advice and
guidance in the development and implementation of its new system, and extensive
training of relevant personnel. International experts are needed initially to advise BJSC
senior management on the final design and implementation plan for the revised
maintenance and materials management systems, and to assist in the completion of an
assessment of existing skills in the maintenance area and of detailed staff training
requirements. Assistance also is required in the implementation of the new program and
in completing the detailed training work identified. In addition to on-site technical
assistance and training, BJSC personnel should visit selective international mine



- 74 -                      ANNEX 4.4
maintenance facilities to familiarize themselves with international best practices and
procedures for maintenance and materials management, organization and operation.
Mine Cost Engineering
10.   Work activity documentation, analysis and monitoring at Baganuur is not well
developed as a tool for efficient mine cost engineering and significant opportunities exist
for increasing mine efficiencies and lowering unit production costs. Full and meaningful
documentation for equipment and operator activity and performance, and for all
maintenance activities, needs to be developed for the preparation and analysis of
production costs and meaningful budgets forecasts. Detailed formats for describing and
documenting daily shift responsibilities, practices, consumption and costs including
personnel assignments and responsibilities need to be developed.  Documentation
(supervisor reports, time cards and production/productivity monitors, etc.) should be
formulated so that mine cost engineering mechanisms can be developed to provide
effective feedback and corrective actions.
Budget and Timing
11.  It is anticipated that the assignment can be completed within a budget of $1
million, including the cost of specialists and their travel, subsistence and miscellaneous
costs. and including the cost of travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs of overseas
training for BJSC personnel. The latter costs should be delineated and included in the
assignment description and assignment cost estimate. Consultant proposals should not be
bound by cost estimates and proposals should be submitted on the basis of analysis of
work inputs required to complete the assignment and to address fully the Scope of
Services. It is anticipated that the assignment would commence by the end of 1996 or at
such date as the procurement to the major mine equipment items scheduled for IDA
financing is completed.

ANNEX 4.5: TRAINING FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND
SAFETY MANAGEMENT UNIT
Objectives
1.    The overall objective of this training and technical assistance is to assist BJSC to
establish an in-house capability to undertake the environmental management activities
detailed in the BJSC Environmental Management Program (EMP, see Annex 4.11), and the
Environmental Analysis Report (EAR) for this project, available in the project file.
Currently, there is no environmental management or monitoring capability in the company.
Institutional capabilities in occupational health and safety also need to be improved. As
outlined in the EMP and EAR, an Environmental Management Unit (EMU) will be
established in BJSC, led by a suitably qualified Environment and Safety Manager, and also
staffed with an Environmental Technician, an Occupational Health and Safety Engineer,
and assisted by an Environmental Engineer for Reclamation. A small laboratory also will
be established at the EMU. The purpose of the training and technical assistance is to work
together with BJSC management and this unit to design and implement the unit's detailed
work program and to provide formal and on-the-job training to the unit's staff, to enable
them to implement the EMP.
Scope of Services
2.    BJSC will recruit/assign appropriate staff for the EMU with the necessary technical
qualifications and experience to fulfill the assignments outlined in the EMP. Training
requirements will therefore be aimed at specific development of skills in environmental
management and occupational health and safety of mining operations. Training and
development requirements will be achieved by a combination of visits by foreign experts
and periods of secondment of the BJSC Environmental Unit staff to select mining
operations in industrialized countries. Periods of secondment would include specific short
course training and short study visits to the selected mining operations. The Environment
and Safety Manager, the Occupational Health and Safety Engineer and the Environmental
Engineer will each undertake a one-month secondment. In addition, international experts
will visit BJSC to provide technical assistance on-site, and to conduct intensive training at
the mine, especially after BJSC personnel have completed their secondment with overseas
counterparts. The training will cover intensive in-country work, and follow-up visits after
BJSC personnel participate in periods of secondment with their counterparts overseas.
International specialist requirements are planned at a total of 9.5 person-months, as set out
below.



- 76 -                     ANNEX 4.5
3.   Institutional strengthening, tip construction and stability, spoil management,
drainage, and reclamation. A senior international environmental specialist will assigned
to both assist in the organization and coordination of the overall effort and provide specific
assistance for the reclamation effort. The specialist will: (a) help the company select an
environmental team, especially an Environmental Safety Manager (ESM); (b) develop and
implement training programs for the mine management, environment and reclamation staff;
(c) assist the ESM to develop a detailed environmental management and monitoring plan;
(d) assist the ESM to set up, equip and run an environmental laboratory; (e) assist the
Environmental Engineer (Reclamation) to develop the detailed reclamation plan, and to
begin research into biological reclamation techniques. In addition, the specialist will:
(a) assist spoils dump construction engineers and the Environmental Engineer
(Reclamation) to develop detailed reclamation and contour plans; (b) advise on spoils dump
construction techniques; (c) advise on reclamation techniques and soil handling; (d) advise
on slope stability assessment; and (e) advise on safety inspections. The assignment should
include a total of about 5 person-months, with three visits to BJSC of 5 to 6 weeks, and
about one month for curriculum preparation for training program development.
4.    Hydrogeology (groundwater and surface water modeling and management).
An international hydrogeologist will: (a) help to develop a groundwater model of the
Baganuur Lake area in conjunction with the mine's chief geologist, and the Institute of
Water Policy and Management; (b) assist the above personnel to set up a monitoring
program and water balance studies for Baganuur Lake; (c) assist with a more detailed
assessment of the impact of mine dewatering impact on the lake; and (d) assist in
groundwater monitoring for pollution and drawdown effects on the town. The assignment
should total about 2.25 person-months, with three visits to BJSC of about three weeks each.
5.    The international hydrogeologist will bring a three-dimensional groundwater
modeling program and suitable computer, which will be retained by the mine or the
Mongolian Institute of Water Policy and Management for future use and development as
more data become available. Local consultant service requirements in connection with this
assignment total about 3 person-months per year.
6.    Occupational health and safety in the mining industry. An international mining
health and safety specialist will: (a) assist the mine Health and Safety Manager (HSM) to
fully develop and implement the health and safety plan; and (b) train the HSM, safety
inspectors, mine supervisors and workers in health and safety requirements and procedures.
The assignment is expected to total about 2.25 person-months, with two visits in BJSC of
about five weeks each.

ANNEX 4.6: COST AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
(TERMS OF REFERENCE)
Background
1.    The Government of Mongolia has applied to the International Development
Association (IDA) for a credit amounting to $35 million, $33.5 million of which is to be
onlent to the Baganuur Coal Mining Company (BJSC) to rehabilitate its open-pit mine
situated some 120 miles west of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. It is intended to
apply part of these proceeds to provide critical (technical, financial, environmental and
marketing) support to BJSC. The financial component, which is covered under these
terms-of-reference, will provide BJSC with assistance to: upgrade the company's cost and
financial accounting, and management information systems; select and implement a
simplified off-the-shelf local area network (LAN) and appropriate accounting software;
undergo training in International Accounting Standards (IAS); and prepare for its
inaugural annual financial audit.
2.    BJSC intends to rehabilitate its open-pit coal operation in order to reach again the
4 million tons coal per year mine production design capacity on a sustainable basis and to
increase the overall efficiency of the mine's operation, thus providing for a secure and
reliable and low-cost coal supply for CES Ulaanbaatar power plants. Although new
mining equipment will be procured (particularly large-scale dump trucks that will replace
the existing overburden rail haulage system) and new coal-handling plant constructed,
implementation of modem accounting systems and training is also required to enable
BJSC executives and personnel to adopt international best coal mine financial
management, cost control and management information reporting practices.
3.    BJSC has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) focusing on all aspects of
the coal mine rehabilitation. This PIP has benefited from inputs by various international
consultants including specialists from Arthur Anderson, Australia (compilation of IAS
Financial Statements as at end-1994 and review of BJSC Financial Management and
Systems), Coopers and Lybrand, Canada (mine organization and management), Morrison
Knudsen, United States (mine operations and planning) and Performnance Associates,
United States. Relevant sections of these inputs are incorporated in the PIP and provide
further background to the following Scope of Services



- 79 -                     ANNEX 4.6
Scope of Services
4.    The accounting systems at BJSC were developed by Soviet specialists and do not
follow IAS principles or formats. Consequently, income statements do not permit clear
identification of net income, funds flow and profitability. The balance sheet merely
records historic assets and liabilities which, in a hyperinflationary environment, will need
to be significantly restated. Under a recent government decree all companies in Mongolia
will be required to adopt IAS and revalue their assets as from January 1, 1996.
5.    Assistance will be provided to undertake a comprehensive analysis of capital and
operating costs and to upgrade the cost, financial and management systems, with an end-
product being the restatement of the BJSC 1997 financial statements (income statement,
balance sheet and sources and application of funds) according to IAS. These statements
should be presented in a final report that outlines the full findings of the evaluation of the
cost, financial and management systems, systems implemented and recommendation.
BJSC financial and accounting personnel should also be trained in the preparation of
financial statements consistent with IAS, and should be able to manipulate the software
packages and models acquired or developed during the assignment, for future years
financial statements.
6.    Building on previous work, the cost and financial accounting systems and
management information systems will be reviewed with BJSC management and a time-
bound action plan should at the outset of the assignment be agreed covering:
*    improvements to individual systems;
*    implementation of new off-the-shelf systems, both manual and computer,
where necessary;
*    procedural changes to data capture, cost control, recording and reporting;
and
*    control procedures and audit requirements
7.    The review of operating cost system will focus on, and deal with the provision of
simple computerized:

and
*    recording of acquisitions, disposals, maintenance of asset register, asset
revaluation and revised depreciation schedules.
9.    The review of Financial Accounting Systems and Management of CurrenLAssets
will focus on, and deal with the provision of simple computerized:
*    creditor's control, aging and payment;
*    revenue receipts, control and currency conversion procedures;
*    financial charges;
*    revaluation of assets, liabilities and accounting for nonrecurring and
extraordinary items;
*    accounting policies and the preparation of monthly and annual (audited)
financial statements;
*    accounting of work in progress, stores and product stocks; and
*    annual auditing procedures.
10.   The review of Management Accounting and Reporting will focus on the
development of unit process costs, plant efficiencies and performance parameters, and the
implementation of a simple integrated zero-based budgetary and cost control system.
Recommendations for a more comprehensive MIS for the longer-term should be
formulated.
11.   A review should be undertaken of cost and financial, and accounting personnel's
experience and qualifications and specific recommendations made for strengthening the
Cost and Financial Departments, and the further training requirements for these
personnel.

Budget and Timing
12.  It is anticipated that the assignment will involve approximately 18 person-months
of international specialist input and that it can be completed within a budget of $750,000,
including the cost of computer hardware, standard modular accounting packages; the
remuneration of specialists and their travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs; and the
cost of travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs of overseas training for BJSC
personnel if necessary. The latter costs should be delineated and included in the
assignment description and assignment cost estimate. Consultant proposals should not be
bound by these person-month or cost estimates and proposals should be submitted on the
basis of analysis of work inputs required to complete the assignment and to address fully
the Scope of Services. It is anticipated that the assignment would commence in mid- to
late 1996.

ANNEX 4.7: MINISTRY OF ENERGY, GEOLOGY AND
MINING: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT
OUTLINE
Objective
1.    The objective of the technical assistance is to assist the Ministry of Energy,
Geology and Mines (MEGM) in the development of a medium-term strategy for the
further development of the sector, and MEGM's policy and regulatory role to best foster
that development. The technical assistance will include two main aspects:
(a)   A full review of the potential contribution of the Shive Ovoo Mine and
possible development of deposits at Tavan Tolgoi, considering, in
particular the economics of future operations (or in Tavan Tolgoi's case,
the technical and economic feasibility of future operations); and
(b)   Joint review and recommendation, together with Mongolian staff, of the
best future role for MEGM as the Government's policy-making and
regulatory agency for the coal sector, and step-by-step implementation
measures to attain that role.
2.    Description of the issues and scope of investigation are outlined below.
3.    Shive Ovoo. The new Shive Ovoo mine, only in its initial mine development
phase, is producing a low coal quality product that has been found unsuitable as a fuel for
power generation without the addition of high cost mazuut fuel oil. Mining is being
undertaken in what appears to be highly oxidized outcrop coal areas with high ash
contents. In addition, the hydrogeological regime has led to high in-pit moisture
contents, thus further reducing the quality of the coal product. No meaningful coal
quality or hydrogeological investigations have been made at Shive Ovoo. MEGM is
planning to retain a local drilling company to take core and bulk samples and will retain
specialists to supervise the drill program and subsequent international coal quality
laboratory investigations; assess thoroughly coal quality and hydrogeological issues; and
identify mine dewatering options/technologies that will facilitate formulation of a mine
development plan that produces a reliable and secure low-cost coal supply of acceptable
and reliable quality.
4.    Tavan Tolgoi. A feasibility study for the huge Tavan Tolgoi steam/coking coal
area was prepared in the Russian language, by the Leningrad Institute in the early 1990s,
following extensive drilling campaigns. Indications are that the coal area could sustain a
20 million tons per year operation, part of which would be high grade steam coal (7,000-



- 83 -                    ANNEX 4.7
8,000 kcal/kg) and part of which would be what the Russian specialists refer to as very
high-grade coking coal. The coal quality test parameters in the feasibility assessment
follow former Soviet Union standards are not capable of comparison with international
measures, particularly in relation to the coking coal grades. MEGM wish to retain
specialists to supervise and interpret coal quality drill and bulk samples; to translate and
undertake a preliminary review of the Leningrad Institute feasibility study; and, on a
preinvestment basis, prepare a preliminary comment on the potential development
options and likely order of magnitude costs and economics of mine development.
Economics would be viewed against various market scenarios including thermal coal
development for domestic consumption (including mine-mouth power generation) and
export, and coking coal export or local coke manufacture for export. It is recognized that
Tavan Tolgoi development would require considerable infrastructure development, which
would not be included at this stage in the review/study program. However, a perspective
of the potential free-on-rail costs of Tavan Tolgoi coal, and its likely domestic and
international competitiveness, would benefit MEGM medium-term energy sector
planning.
5.    Regulation and Policy-making. Based on a broad, joint review of (a) MEGM's
current responsibilities and activities in coal sector regulation and policy-making; (b) the
general regulatory framework for the sector established under the Minerals Law, and
current regulations concerning sector regulations and policy-making authorities; (c) the
current and future trends in the development of the coal market in Mongolia; and
(d) corporatization and privatization prospects and plans for coal mines other than the
Baganuur mine, Mongolian government staff, local consultants and selected international
experts will complete a joint review and provide recommendations to the Government on
the following:
(a)   Necessary changes in the existing legalUregulatory framework of the
Minerals Law and wide range of regulations and government decisions
goverming the detailed aspects of the Government's regulation of the coal
sector;
(b)   Necessary institutional changes, and adjustment in the responsibilities and
scope of work of units and staff in MEGM (and other relevant agencies),
in order to best implement MEGM's functions as the regulatory and
policy-making agency for the Government in the coal sector; and
(c)   A  step-by-step implementation plan to undertake the adjustments
recommended in (a) and (b) above.

ANNEX 4.11: BJSC ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
Introduction
1.    In March 1995, BJSC and the World Bank identified a number of environmental
issues for the Project Implementation Plan, and set out the terms of reference for an
Environmental Analysis Report (EAR), which would focus on these issues. The most
important issues were considered to be the review of local hydrology and potential impacts
of mine dewatering on Baganuur Lake and the reclamation mine spoils. In addition to the
standard environmental topics, an occupational health and safety action plan is also
included. The topics covered by the report are:
(a)   Environmental setting
(b)   Policy, legal and administrative framework
(c)   Analysis of environmental issues
(i)    Review of local hydrology (especially Baganuur Lake)
(ii)    Consultation with local population
(iii)    Review of ecological impact
(iv)    Reclamation and spoils management
(v)    Fugitive dust mitigation plan
(vi)    Contamination surveys
(vii)    Hazardous waste management
(viii)    Occupational health monitoring plan
(d)   Mitigation plan
(e)   Environmental management and training
(f)    Environmental monitoring plan
The sections below describe the Environmental Management Program  (EMP) to be
implemented under the project. A one-page summary outline of BJSC s Environmental
Mitigation Plan also is provided at the end of this Annex. Further details are provided in
the EAR.
Establishment of an Environmental Management Unit (EMU)
2.    BJSC will establish in-house capability to undertake the environmental management
activities detailed herein. There currently is no environmental management or monitoring
capability within BJSC, and there is a need for improvement in the occupational health and
safety organization. Training requirements will be aimed at development of skills in
environmental and safety management of mining operations, especially skills necessary to
implement the EMP. As detailed in Annex 4.5, training and development requirements



- 88 -                     ANNEX 4.11
will be achieved through a combination of technical assistance from foreign experts and
secondment of EMU staff to international mining operations or experts.
3.    To work in the EMU, the mine will employ a suitably qualified Environment and
Safety Manager (e.g., a graduate in engineering, environmental studies, chemistry, biology
or geography with at least 10 years' relevant experience), who will report to the Chief
Technical Engineer under the Deputy Director for Operations. He will be assisted by an
Environmental Technician, to undertake sampling and analysis, and an Occupational
Health and Safety Engineer with a team of inspectors from the existing Works Safety
Department. The Environment and Safety Manager will be responsible for further fine-
tuning and implementation of the EMP for the mine. He will also be responsible for liaison
with the regional and national environmental regulation authorities. He will be required to
maintain a general awareness of environmental issues and responsibilities in the mine's
management and work force.
4.    An additional function required at the mine is an Environmental Engineer for
reclamation, reporting to the Chief Technical Engineer. This person should work with the
engineers responsible for dump construction.  The environmental engineer will be
responsible for dump surface preparation, drainage, soils and vegetation reclamation. They
will also be responsible for the research program into reclamation described in Section 7 of
the EAR.
5.    A small environmental laboratory will be set up at the mine, which will be capable
of sample preparation, simple analysis with inexpensive instruments and chemical
techniques, and dust analysis. More complex analysis of water samples will be contracted
to either the local laboratory or to a laboratory in Ulaanbaatar; soil analysis (which will
occur in larger batches) will be contracted to a specialist laboratory in Ulaanbaatar (such as
the Institute of Geography).
Impact on Baganuur Lake
6.    During public consultation meetings, the local people expressed a consensus that
Baganuur Lake is a local religious, cultural and recreational resource, and should remain
undarnaged. The potential impact on water levels in Baganuur Lake from dewatering of the
mine, especially at Mountain Section 2, was identified as a concern for evaluation in the
environmental study. If the lake were a groundwater lake, with lake levels dependent on
depth of the surficial aquifer, mine dewatering operations could severely impact lake levels
by lowering the level of the surficial aquifer to the extent that the lake would disappear.
However, the EAR concluded that the lake is not dependent entirely, or even substantially,
on the groundwater, and dewatering operations do not pose a threat to its continued
existence.
7.    BJSC's mine development plan (20 years) involves advancing the present Mountain
Section 2 pit by about 150 meters towards the lake (a distance of 1.1 kilometers from the
lake), which will be completed by 2004. From 2005 until 2014 the mine advances to the
north, away from the lake. The line of dewatering wells required for the first stage (until



- 89 -                     ANNEX 4.11
2004) was constructed recently and became operational during the summer of 1995. This
will be the closest that mining or dewatering operations come to the lake for the next 20
years.
8.    Taking into account data developed to date on the hydrology, hydrogeology, and
permafrost conditions of the area, hydrogeological analysis conducted for the EAR
concluded that the lake is not a groundwater lake, based on the following:
(a)   The groundwater level was measured in May 1995 about 9 meters below the
level of the bottom of the lake. The lake was bank full at the time this
measurement was made. In 1975, a Russian geological investigation
recorded the groundwater level at about the same level as the lake water.
(b)   A survey of water chemistry made during the environmental study indicates
composition of total dissolved solids (TDS) conductivity and specific ions to
be virtually matched in the Khujirt River upstream of the lake, in the lake,
and the Khujirt River downstream of the lake. The chemistry of the
groundwater demonstrates a TDS concentration threefold higher, with
corresponding increases in the other parameters. This indicates that water in
the lake is derived from surface water (a chemical match) and not
groundwater.
(c)   Sediments in the lake have been found to consist of interbedded clay and
sandy loam, at least 15 to 20 centimeters deep (limit of depth of sampling)
over the majority of the lake bottom, indicating that the sediments have the
ability to act as a barrier to seepage of water from the lake.
(d)   Permafrost exists in a mosaic along the north side of the lake, and is
continuous along the west side of the lake. The permafrost may also act as a
barrier to seepage of water from the lake.
9.    These indicate that the lake levels are independent of, or at most only partially
dependent on, groundwater level and are determined mainly by surface water inflows,
outflows, precipitation, evaporation and seepage through sediments. These preliminary
findings are strong indications that water levels in the lake would not be significantly
impacted by future dewatering operations of the mine over the current mine plan period of
20 years, should these operations cause groundwater levels in the area to subside.
10.   An ongoing monitoring and research program will be implemented, focusing on
detecting impacts of mining operations on groundwater and lake water levels, and
evaluating a contingency mitigation strategy. With intemational assistance, BJSC will
develop a more detailed groundwater model, including the relationship between the lake
and the groundwater, and the water balance of the lake. To enable this to be done, BJSC's
EMU will monitor hydrogeologic conditions around Mountain Section 2, Baganuur Lake
and the Khujirt River, upstream and downstream of the lake, along with rainfall and
evaporation. Sediments and strata in the base of the lake will be investigated when the



- 90 -                      ANNEX 4.11
surface of the lake is frozen and able to support a drill rig, in order to determine the ultimate
depth and composition of sediments below the lake, and seepage rate.  Permafrost
conditions will also be monitored.
11.   BJSC is committed to undertaking a mitigation program should ongoing evaluation
and monitoring indicate that water levels in Baganuur Lake have been impacted by mine
dewatering operations. Direct mitigation of impact could be achieved by directing
Mountain Section 2 dewatering discharge into the lake. The suitability of groundwater for
this purpose was also evaluated.  Current plans are to release Mountain Section 2
dewatering discharge into the Khujirt River downstream of Baganuur Lake. Extension of
the discharge pipeline to the lake would not be costly.
Reclamation
12.   Since mine operations began in 1978, pits and spoil dumps have occupied about
775.6 hectares of land. From this area only about 56,800 m3 of topsoil has been prestripped
and stockpiled, representing only about 4 percent of the total topsoil of this area. The mine
has not undertaken any reclamation of any of the spoil dumps. The spoil dump surfaces
consist of variable sandy and sandy-loam soils, with few stones or rocks. The spoil dumps
remain with steep-sided slopes (32 to 35 degrees), 30 to 40 meters high, extensively eroded
by wind and water.
13.   Future land use and selection of the afteruses takes into account factors such as
biological, climatic, soil, geological and hydrological conditions, vegetation prior to
mining, characteristics of dump materials, erosion potential, population of the area.
Reclamation will involve two basic stages:
(a)    Technical reclamation, involving filling of valleys between the tips, shaping
of slopes and covering with soil-forming materials.
(b)   Biological reclamation, involving amelioration of soils, establishment of
vegetation and five years' management to create a stable vegetation system.
14.   Over the 20-year mine plan, BJSC will progressively reclaim all spoils dumps in
accordance with a planned sequence. The reclamation plan was developed in conjunction
with the mine development plan, considering future spoil disposal by trucks. The areas to be
reclaimed, along with the timeframe, are shown on maps detailing: areas being filled; areas
where slopes are being recontoured; and areas under biological reclamnation.  These
reclamation plans, available in the project file, will be fine-tuned with ftrther technical
assistance under the project, and used to monitor reclamation progress during Bank project
supervision. Reclamation of the dumps will involve establishment of a combination of the
following three afteruses:
(a)   grassland for fodder and haymaking;
(b)   restoration of natural steppe vegetation for pasture; and



-91-                       ANNEX 4.11
(c)   planting of trees.
15.   Until 1997, when the new bulldozers are obtained, reclamation activities will be
limited to filling between the spoil dumps. Revegetation experiments will be carried out in
1996-97, and in 1997 decisions on which areas will require subsoil, topsoil, and soil
amendments will be made. After soil amendments and preparations are made as required,
revegetation (biological reclamation) can begin in 1998.
16.   In general, the following landforms will be created:
(a)   valleys between dragline dumps will be filled by truck dumping, the spoil
being consolidated to reduce settlement;
(b)   all steep slopes will be graded (by regrading, filling or cutting back) by large
dozer and scraper (or dragline in places) to a maximum slope of 20 degrees
(1:2.7);
(c)   slopes will be no longer than 20 meters, with intermediate benches for
drainage and access as required; benches will drain back at an angle of
1 degree to a ditch; and
(d)   the tops of the dump areas will be graded to I degree to 3 degrees to shed
water; ponding will be avoided.
17.   Drainage by open grassed channels will be constructed on all benches and flat areas.
Where necessary, the channels will be lined or filled with stone to reduce scour and erosion.
Drainage water will be conveyed down slopes by rock-filled, rock-lined or concrete and
rock-lined channels. Discharge of the drainage system will be to ponds off the dumps,
which will seep to groundwater. After grading, the dump surface will be treated in one of
several ways depending on the availability of soil-forming materials, in preparation for the
establishment of vegetation covers.
18.   There has been very little investigation and research of the best techniques of
vegetation establishment, fertilizer amelioration and aftercare on mine spoils in Mongolia,
and none at Baganuur. The mine will therefore set up a research program in conjunction
with technical experts from the Mongolian Institute of Geography and Institute of Botany.
Technical assistance under the project includes an international expert in mine spoil
reclamation. This research program will last for at least five years. The results of the
research will be used to develop and progressively improve the technical and biological
reclamation of the spoil dumps at Baganuur and other Mongolian mines.
Fugitive Dust Mitigation
19.   The main sources of dust from the mining operation, and the mitigation measures
that will be employed to overcome them, are summarized in the table below. Continued



- 92 -                                ANNEX 4.11
monitoring of respirable dust in the mine will check the effectiveness of the measures, and

Hazardous Waste Management
20.      The table below  summarizes the hazardous materials identified and their disposal
routes. In addition, appropriate storage facilities will be provided at the mine maintenance
depot for proper collection and storage of materials. These will be periodically inspected
and the waste streams audited by the mine's Environmental Manager.

modernization of workplace techniques, technology and tools. A fugitive dust mitigation



- 94 -                      ANNEX 4.11
plan has been prepared in conjunction with the health and safety action plan to control
fugitive dust emissions. The action plan includes installation of an exhaust fume ventilation
system in the automotive maintenance facility, and use of state of the art dust extraction and
dust suppression equipment in the new coal-handling system (to be included in the bid
specifications). The equipment to be procured under the project will have improved
operator protection from noise, shock and vibration.
24.   Personnel protective equipment. BJSC's occupational health and safety program
will provide personnel protective equipment to appropriate workers for the following
identified workplace exposures and hazards:  noise and vibration; traumatic injury;
electrocution; dust, toxic gas and smoke. This equipment includes: hard hats; respirators
appropriate for protection from dust or toxic gas; ear defenders; safety glasses; safety
harnesses; helmets with electrical field warning alarms; rubber gloves and boots. Gas
alarms (carbon monoxide, inflammable vapors) will be fitted in the maintenance shop.
25.   Training. Written materials and training will be provided on a scheduled basis,
encouraging independent study, with the incentive of "the right to work" for a year after
completion of the training.  Training courses include class work and qualification
examinations. A new occupational health program includes correspondence courses for
engineers and technicians. The training program will include a lecture series to be provided
by selected professionals to different groups of workers. A "training for trainers" course for
engineers and inspectors in methods of training and instruction includes study abroad.
Health and safety training records will be kept for all workers and staff.
26.   Designated areas and sign posting.  Areas of the mine will be designated
according to specific hazards and requirements to wear specific protective equipment.
These will include areas where the wearing of hard hats, ear defenders, dust filters, safety
harnesses or electrical field warnings will be compulsory. Such areas will be clearly sign
posted with visual symbols.
27.   Monitoring. A summary of the health and safety monitoring, the training and the
implementation of the action plan will be made available at each supervision visit by the
Bank. Monitoring of health and safety will include:
(a)    Accident records for all injuries and fatalities, including person-days lost,
causes, consequences, remedial action taken.
(b)   Records of all absence from work for industrial-related diseases, including
person-days lost, causes, consequences, remedial action taken.
(c)    Annual health screening for all workers, particularly for industrial-related
diseases (respiratory, hearing, spine/joints, sight). (There will also need to
be records for other nonindustrial health-related factors, such as smoking,
other illnesses.)

Environmental Monitoring
28.   BJSC will provide biannual summary environmental monitoring reports on the
monitoring program below to the Bank. These reports will include reference to any
deficiencies noted in dust control and reclamation progress, and details of the management
response in terms of remedial measures and their success. The reports will note samples
where enviromnental standards were exceeded and will give the remedial measures taken if
required. The full monitoring data will be appended to the reports.

ANNEX 4.12: SOCIAL IMPACT OF BJSC'S MANPOWER
REDUCTION PROGRAM
Introduction
1.    The Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) plans to reduce its work force from
1,507 workers in October 1995 to about 907 workers in 2000, to improve the efficiency
of its operation.  Even following these reductions, BJSC's work force will be
substantially higher than the international norm for similar mechanized open-pit
operations. BJSC, experts from Mongolia's Institute of Administration and Management
Development and the IDA project team reviewed the company's manpower reduction
program and assessed potential social impacts on the local community, as BJSC is the
largest employer in the area. Social hardships arising from the reduction are expected to
be manageable, particularly with the adoption of several measures by BJSC, as discussed
below.
Principles of Implementation
2.    The Baganuur Joint Stock Company will apply the following principles in
implementation of its workforce reduction program during 1996-2000. These principles
were discussed and agreed by BJSC and IDA during project negotiations.
(a)   The importance of reducing the workforce at BJSC to levels closer to
international norms is affirmed, in order to improve the efficiency of
BJSC's operations.
(b)   BJSC will rely on voluntary workforce reduction (natural attrition) to the
extent possible, thereby minimizinng involuntary dismissals.
(c)   BJSC  will minimize involuntary dismissals through retraining of
redundant staff who are suitable and willing to transfer to other posts
within the company.
(d)   BJSC will carefully assess employee skills, family circumstances and
gender mix before making involuntary dismissals.
(e)   BJSC will avoid, to the maximum extent possible, dismissals that would
lead to a high risk of family poverty.
(f)   There will be no discrimination against women in implementation of the
BJSC workforce reduction program.



- 99 -                    ANNEX 4.12
(g)   BJSC will work closely with local government agencies, including the
local labor exchange, and will seek to link dismissed workers to other
employment and social welfare programs, including programs funded by
international donors.
Background
3.    Baganuur District. Baganuur was established in 1978. Although 125 miles
from urban Ulaanbaatar, Baganuur is administered as part of Ulaanbaatar. It comprises
the mine, a town (3,200 households) and a ger village (600 households). An expanding
ger district to the north of the town has 280 households. The population is just over
17,000 and originates from all parts of Mongolia. Typical family size is four to five
persons, including three children. Land area totals 21 000 hectares. An abandoned
Soviet military base of 900 hectares lies to the north, and is home to 40 households.
4.    Mongolian-Soviet corporations established Baganuur. The plan was for Baganuur
to expand, relieving pressures on the physical and social infrastructure of Ulaanbaatar.
Soviet construction enterprises built 58 apartment blocks but work was halted in 1992.
Baganuur has a limited number of industries that service the population's needs, but the
mine is by far the largest enterprise. Table I shows the breakdown of employment for the
district. Of an estimated labor force of 8,238 in October 1995, about 46 percent are
employed in enterprises and public service. BJSC employs 1,507 persons (18 percent of
the labor force), comprised of about 380 women and 1,127 men. The next largest
employer is the state administration (1,065 workers, or 13 percent), public organizations
and service (449 persons, or 5 percent), an electrical cables communications enterprise
(244 workers) and the town's heating plant (197 workers). In addition, an estimated
2,150 persons, or 26 percent of the labor force, are employed in family undertakings,
primarily herding. Some 240 persons are employed as traders, kiosk vendors or as
various types of entrepreneurs.
5.    Unemployment, as calculated by the local labor exchange office, stands at 11.5
percent of the labor force. Of the 945 registered unemployed, 73 percent are women, 27
percent are without qualification, and 20 percent are below age 25. Including persons
considered unemployed but who are not actively searching for employment or have
otherwise not registered with the labor office, the total number of unemployed may be
over 2,000, or about 25 percent of the labor force. Since unemployment compensation
benefit is provided for a maximum of only five months, many of these jobless people,
however, undertake some form of self-employment. Apparently, 52 percent are partially
occupied in retailing to earn a living. Earnings from street trading are estimated by local
experts at Tg 19,500/month, just about enough to support a family. About 45 percent of
unemployed persons without unemployment compensation have household earnings
below Tg 6,400/month (the level of the minimum wage). There are 173 households (836
persons) with incomes below the official poverty line of Tg 200/month..

6.     Unemployment Compensation.  Currently, under the Labor Law  of 1991, a
redundant employee who is laid off by an enterprise is entitled to receive one month's
salary (average of the previous three months' earnings) as compensation for dismissal.
The enterprise must also pay the local labor exchange office a sum equivalent to three
months' earnings. The unemployed person may receive from the labor office a benefit
equal to the minimum living standard (Tg 4,200/month) for up to four months while
looking for work. At present, the local labor office provides its clients with a list of
vacant jobs and employers, but does not have capabilities to provide retraining.
7.      With  the  recent enactment of new   social safety  net reforms, however,
unemployment compensation will improve beginning in 1997. Starting January 1995,
Mongolia established a Social Fund by means of social insurance. Employers and
employees contribute to the Social Fund at 23 percent and 16 percent of earnings,
respectively. Beginning in 1997, any employee with 24 months of contributions will
receive unemployment compensation equal to 45 percent of their average salary of the
previous three months. If an unemployed person has worked 15 years, the benefit will be
71 percent of the previous salary. Salaries in Mongolia tend to be between Tg 15,000 to
Tg 30,000/month, with the average (August 1995) being Tg 24,400/month, according to
the State Statistical Office. Unemployment compensation benefit is set at a very low rate



-101-                      ANNEX 4.12
of Tg 4,200/month in towns and Tg 3,700/month in rural areas, under the government's
regulations within the terms of the Labor Law. In practice, as may have been the case in
Baganuur, the labor exchange has paid the unemployed worker a sum based upon his or
her previous salary, provided that this has been made over by the former employer. In
addition, beginning in 1997, a better-organized and funded system for vocational training
of unemployed persons is expected to be put in place.
8.    Retirement pensions. The retirement age for women is at 55 years and for men it
is 60 years. Up to 1995, retirees from state enterprises and the administration received a
pension from the state budget. Inflation has eroded the value of many pensions, despite
indexation, and thus people were reportedly living on sums between Tg 4,500 to
Tg 12,000/month. Those who had insufficient years of state service or who had not
worked in state enterprises received a minimal pension of Tg 2,600/month. In Baganuur,
around 35 percent of poor households under official definitions are old-age pensioners.
Beginning in 1998, however, improved retirement pensions will be paid out of the Social
Fund. To obtain a full pension, contributions must have been made for 20 years at 9.5
percent of earnings. The basic pension will be (from 1998) equal to 45 percent of the
average of the best five years of earnings, with an enhancement of 1.5 percent for each
year of service beyond 20 for which contributions have been made. Between 1995 and
1998 retirees obtain a pension under the terms of the Social Security Law but on the basis
of years of service only. The discrepancy between the size of pension before and after
1995 is being rectified by a phased increase in very low pensions. It is important for
employees to accumulate 20 years service for pension purposes.
BJSC's Manpower Reduction Program
9.    BJSC launched its program of work force reduction for 1995-2000 in July 1995.
The General Director announced the following:
(a)   There will be no external recruitment to vacant positions;
(b)   Anyone who wishes to leave the company may go freely;
(c)   Retraining will be provided to redundant staff who are suitable and willing
to transfer to another post within the company;
(d)   The company wishes to retrain hard working, responsible and productive
personnel adequate to the needs of a market economy;
(e)   The company will apply the provision of the Labor Law for all dismissal
cases.
10.   BJSC's plans for work force reduction between October 1995 and 2000 are
provided in Table 2. The largest cuts are in departments involved with the railway
overburden removal operation or its maintenance, due to the replacement of the rail
system by mobile equipment under the proposed project. Employees in the former



-102 -                             ANNEX 4.12
railroad and prestripping section are to be reduced by 278. Cuts will be made in the
transportation and mining equipment maintenance sections (257), reflecting the phasing
out of obsolete equipment, and adoption of revised operations and maintenance
procedures. There will be job losses also in the power supply and auxiliary equipment
sections, and smaller reductions in the production, processing and technical sections.
Management functions (corporate strategy and planning, finance, personnel,
procurement) will be strengthened. The social support department is due to be divested
under a privatization program in 1998.

11.    BJSC plans to minimize dismissals by phasing manpower reduction in line with
voluntary  worker departures.   Together with  the  Institute  of Administration  and
Management Development, the company has estimated that an average 176 staff leave the
company each year voluntarily, for military service or due to disability. In addition, there
are a limited number of retirements (10 a year), and, recently, a large number of
dismissals for disciplinary offenses (100 a year). However, there are phasing and



-103 -                        ANNEX 4.12
"bunching" difficulties. The employees who lose their jobs do so at particular points
when, for instance, the overburden rail removal system becomes obsolete at end-1996,
while the normal attrition of the work force is spread more evenly and throughout BJSC
departments. Furthermore, the suitability of employees for internal redeployment varies
and cannot in every case be solved through retraining. As a result, BJSC expects to be
forced to release about 150 employees involuntarily for economic reasons during 1995-
2000 onto the labor market, of whom 22 were dismissed in September 1995.' This can be
managed without undue social hardship.
Mitigation of Social Impacts
12.   Local development.  Local economic development will enable most of the
displaced workers to be absorbed within the local labor market. The district's economy is
expected to continue to be largely dominated by the mine, existing unemployment is
estimated at about 25 percent, and overall new employment prospects are not particularly
good. Yet, several factors point towards increased economic opportunity in the area,
primarily in services and trade. The district also is considered relatively affluent, and its
situation close to Ulaanbaatar makes it relatively attractive. Recently, as many as 1,000
new incomers per year have been reported.
13.   Baganuur is well positioned to play an increasing role as a market center. An
open market operates every Sunday, attracting buyers and sellers from eastern aimags,
and the city government has decided to organize a new, broader wholesale market. In
addition to the existing rail link, construction of a road to more conveniently link
Ulaanbaatar with Baganuur will be completed in 1997, funded in part with Japanese
Government assistance, and plans have been made to continue the highway to Choibalsan
by 2008. The city also owns several empty or unfinished buildings connected to the
energy and water/sewerage network, dating back to the previous construction venture
with the Russians, which can be adapted for use by small and medium enterprises. New
businesses are being established.  The private sector includes 20 companies, 17
partnerships and 138 sole proprietorships. About 40 percent of the private businesses are
involved in food production/distribution or retailing. The remainder of the partnerships
and sole proprietorships are mostly occupied with repairs, laundry and sewing. A
constraint in the development of small and medium enterprises, however, is a shortage of
capital for startup. In late 1995, commercial banks were charging interest rates of 6
percent per month.
After subtracting normal attrition, retirements, and disciplinary dismissals, involuntary job losses for
economic reasons total 118 over the six-year period. Of these, about 54 workers are in social support,
which will be privatized, but will remain, in principle, employed in their current capacity. On the other
hand, the bunching of layoffs, and difficulties in fully matching redundant staff to emerging vacancies
in other departments, mean that involuntary dismissals entering the labor market will be significantly
higher than total net local job loss.



-104 -                     ANNEX 4.12
14.   BJSC will continue to work together with the local government to foster small
and medium enterprise growth and other community initiatives that can provide
employment opportunity for displaced workers.  Considerable international donor
assistance is currently available to support well-organized initiatives in Mongolia, which
Baganuur can take advantage of. In addition to employment promotion and local
development initiatives fostered under the government's poverty alleviation program,
some of these activities include: (a) the European Union's (EU) TACIS program, which,
with the United Nations Development Programme, provides assistance to strengthen the
Mongolian Development Agency's technical assistance support for new small and
medium enterprises; (b) a US Revolving Fund, providing loans to small export-earning,
import-substituting or employment-generation schemes; (c) ADB's proposed credit lines
(Employment Generation II) to microenterprises in agriculture and agroindustries; and
(d) a new ADB agroprocessing, storage and distribution project, of which 50 percent
would be allocated as credits for small and medium enterprises. Additional support for
small and medium enterprises may also be provided from the European Community
Investment Partnership.
15.   BJSC and the local government are reviewing options where supplies needed by
the mine could be produced locally, including a new sewing factory (to provide overalls
for mine workers); a fast food outlet (for mine employees); a powdered milk plant (to
provide milk products during the winter); a car/vehicle maintenance depot; expansion of a
pig breeding farm; and vegetable growing (market gardening).
16.   Social Sensitivity in Dismissals. BJSC is undertaking its manpower reduction
program in a planned way for the first time and under difficult financial circumstances.
The company shows sympathy toward the social issues of future displaced workers that
are planned to be dismissed, but it also needs to strike a balance between this issue and its
goal to become a financially sustainable, commercial and market-oriented concern. To
achieve this, the company must continue, and further improve, its liaison with the labor
unemployment office, local government and trade unions. To the extent possible, BJSC
must adopt a multidimensional approach to dismissals, to take account not just its own
future needs but those of dismissed employees.  Employee skills and family
circumstances will be assessed before involuntary dismissal for economic reasons. In
some cases, BJSC may be able to better prepare some displaced workers for outside work
through retraining. Dismissals leading to a high risk of family poverty will be avoided
where possible, such as dismissal of certain disabled workers, dismissals of parents in
households lacking another wage earner, or dismissal of two breadwinners from the same
household. There will be no discrimination against women.
17.   The Baganuur labor exchange office should seek technical assistance from the
EU's TACIS project (through the Ministry of Labor) to reinforce employment services.
This project assists labor exchanges to better communicate with each other, pool
resources, and improve client training programs. BJSC's existing training center could
also provide support in a collaborative effort.



-105 -                     ANNEX 4.12
18.   Safety Net. BJSC and the district government can ensure that any displaced
workers who might, for whatever reason, continue to be unable to find employment and
fall into poverty can be assisted through the government's donor-assisted poverty
alleviation programs. The IDA and ADB-supported poverty alleviation program provides
additional employment promotion and local development support, women's development
financing, and social assistance funds, targeted at assisting the most poor. Baganuur
District is a participant in the program, eligible for support. Some support remains
available from the Red Cross and other charities. Local government programs include
grants for the very poor for heating requirements and low-interest lows for poor families
to purchase domestic animals.
Monitoring and Reporting
19.  IDA will continue to monitor the progress and social impact of BJSC's work force
reduction program through the duration of the project. In its biannual project status
reports to IDA, BJSC will include reports on (a) the status of mine employment, (b) the
details of worker dismissals (including department origin, worker social circumstances,
and type of dismissal-e.g., voluntary, retirement, disciplinary, or involuntary for
economic reasons); (c) status of coordination with the labor exchange office, trade union,
and local government; (d) status of small and medium enterprise development and other
community initiatives yielding employment growth; and (e) current circumstances of
workers involuntarily dismissed for economic reasons during 1995-2000 and remaining
in Baganuur (requiring periodic survey work).

-107 -                     ANNEX 5.1
ANNEX 5.1: ASSUMPTIONS FOR BJSC'S FINANCIAL
PROJECTIONS, 1994-2014
A. INCOME STATEMENT: TABLE 1
1.    Production. The buildup in production of salable coal is estimated to be 3.3 and
3.8 million tons in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and continuing thereafter at a rate of 4.0
million tons per year. A stripping ratio of 3.63 bcm of overburden per ton of coal has
been estimated from the regional geology and used throughout the planning horizon.
2.    Operating Costs. Variable hourly operating costs by element (labor, electricity,
spare parts, explosives, diesel fuel, etc.) were developed for each major item of
equipment. Costs for new equipment was based on operating experience in the United
States (Cost Reference Guide for Construction Equipment) and adjusted for Mongolian
conditions. Hourly operating costs for the existing Russian equipment was developed
from historical costs (1994) data collected by BJSC. A provision for the major overhauls
of new equipment was added to the unit operating costs. These together with the
operating hours required by the long-range mine plan were used to derive the detailed
total operating costs for each mine plan (i.e., the mine without the project and with the
project). Fixed costs (including administrative overheads) were estimated from historic
costs for each of the seven operating divisions of the mine. All costs were developed in
June 1995 tugriks at the average 1995 exchange rate of Tg 450 = $1. A summary of these
costs are contained in the report prepared by Morrison and Knudsen in the project file.
3.    Labor Complement. In line with the requirements of the mine plan, it was
assumed that the authorized labor strength will progressively be reduced from 1,640 in
1994 to 907 in 2000.
4.    Capital Costs. Capital costs were developed on the basis of a detailed schedule
of capital equipment requirements and a replacement program based on the estimated
useful life of each item. A depreciation schedule was developed on the basis of the
estimate of useful life and not necessarily on the rates currently proscribed by MOF.
5.    Cost Escalation. Costs were initially converted to US dollars and then increased
annually by the average MUV rate of 2.4 percent.
6.    Coal Price. Coal is sold FOB mine site (rail freight and commercial tax are,
however, paid by BJSC and then recovered from major consumers). The coal price is
administered by GOM and is based on a calorific value of 3,360 kcal/kg and on the
contractual price in US dollar terms received in 1995 of $5.60/ton. The 1995 price in
dollar terms has been progressively increased in real terms by 34 percent over the period



-108 -                     ANNEX 5.1
1996-2000 and then adjusted annually in line with international inflation at a rate of 2.4
percent a year.
7.    Taxation. A tax rate of 40 percent of profits is used after providing for the
revaluation of assets and revised depreciation schedule. The revised depreciation charge
is phased in over the period 1996-97 at the rate of 50 and 75 percent, respectively, and
thereafter is fully deductible for tax purposes. Although unredeemed losses are not
brought forward, all costs directly related to the production of mining income are
regarded as deductible for tax purposes (including those previously recognized as social
costs). A tax-deductible royalty of 3 percent has been applied.
8.    Rate of Interest. The onlending rate of interest on IDA was agreed by MOF and
BJSC. This was fixed at a commercial rate of 4.2 percent in US dollar terms with a terrn
of 25 years, including a period of grace of 8 years. OECF funds are assumed to be lent
direct to BJSC at 3.2 percent repayable over 20 years, with a grace period of 10 years.
BJSC bears the full foreign exchange risk.
9.    Interest During Construction. Since this project is an extension of an existing
and ongoing operation and is designed to improve operational efficiencies, no interest
during construction has been explicitly provided nor has it been capitalized. From the
commencement of the project, interest on outside borrowings have being expensed in the
year they that are accrued.
10.   Dividend Distribution. Since the coal price increase represents the minimum
that is required to ensure a break-even position within five years and longer-term
financial viability and self-sufficiency, no distribution of dividends has been assumed and
all surplus cash has been retained in the company and reflected under short-term
investments.
B. BALANCE SHEET: TABLE 3
11.   Restatement of Accounts.  The Mongolian accounts as at end-1994 were
adjusted for hyperinflation by an international firm of chartered accountants substantially
in accordance with International Accounting Standards and restated in US dollars. This
provided the opening balance sheet for all the projections. Their report and extensive
notes to the accounts are contained in the project file.
12.   Finished Product. Coal stocks at the mine rail head are assumed to remain
constant at two weeks of production.
13.   Stores and Supplies. Inventories of stores and supplies are assumed to decrease
progressively from 418 days to 62 days' consumption of spare parts, diesel and
explosives.



-109 -                     ANNEX 5.1
14.   Accounts Receivable.   Debtors are expected to remain current for future
deliveries of coal and are assumed to progressively reduce their arrears from 184 days in
1994 to 30 days over the period to 2000.
15.   Accounts Payable. BJSC's trade creditors are expected to remain constant at 30
days.
16.   Prepayments. It is assumed that, with IDA support, the necessity of having to
make advance payments for supplies will cease beyond 1995.
17.   Other Creditors. All amounts owing to government in respect of tax assessment
at end-1994 are settled in full in 1995 (including the set-off arranged by MOF in May
1995) and will thereafter be maintained at 30 days.
18.   Operating Cash. Operating cash at hand and in the bank is assumed to increase
from a minimal level to 30 days of the wage, heating and electricity charge.
19.   Depreciation of Obsolete Equipment and Facilities. The undepreciated value
of the rail haulage system and the existing coal-handling plant are written off against
fixed assets and expensed in 1996 and 1997 as they are decommissioned and taken out of
service.

ANNEX 5.2: BAGANUUR COAL PRICE ADJUSTMENT
MECHANISM
1.    At present the coal price in Mongolia (i.e., Tug 2,500/ton) is below both the
import price parity and the average incremental costs of coal production, and is
insufficient to enable Baganuur to cover its cost of sales, service potential borrowings and
support a minimum capital expenditure program. A price increase with regular reviews is
required under the IDA credit for Baganuur to become economically viable and
financially self sufficient. This price, although limited by the price of imported coal,
should provide for:
(a)   A base price denominated in local currency, which should be sufficient to
enable Baganuur to: (i) cover all its direct and indirect operating costs
including, depreciation on revalued assets, allowable social costs and other
costs related to the production of coal in a remote area; (ii) service its debt;
and (iii) provide for a reasonable after-tax return on the funds employed by
the company. This base price should be derived on the basis of a life-of-
mine financial projection and updated ever two to three years or as
frequently as circumstances dictate. On present indications a rational
base price for Baganuur is estimated at about $7.50 per ton, in 1995 US
dollar terms, or about 34 percent above the actual 1995 level.
(b)   A  mandatory biannual adjustment to the base price to allow  for
depreciation of the tugrik, the general level of international inflation and
the quality of coal delivered. This adjustment should therefor comprise
the following elements:  (i) since roughly 85 percent of Baganuur's
operating costs and all of its debt servicing are derived in foreign currency,
it is essential to adjust the base price to account for changes in the US
dollar exchange rate for the period under review compared to the exchange
rate at the time when the base price was determined; (ii) an internationally
recognized index reflecting the increase in the average price of Baganuur's
inputs (e.g., The Manufacturing Unit Value index published by the World
Bank)'; and (iii) the ratio of the actual calorific value of each delivery and
the base value of 3,360 kcal/kg; and
(c)   The ability of Baganuur's customer base to absorb significant price
increases. These increases may be phased in over a period to provide time
The anticipated average MUV for the period 1995 to 2010 is 2.4 percent per year.



-114-                       ANNEX 5.2
for CES to adjust to the revised price structure without undue disruption.
To achieve this, a price rebate of a maximum of 20 percent should be
applied in the first year and there after progressively reduced.
2.    In summary, a pricing formula, automatically adjusted every six months, can be
determined along the following lines:
Pricep = Base Price * (Ex Ratep /Ex RateB) * (1+infjt * (cal val/3,360) . (l+Reb)
Where Ex Ratep       = $ exchange rate in month prior to the pricing period
Ex RateB      = $ exchange rate in the base period
inf           = International inflation expressed as a percentage
t             = Time from the base period in years
cal val       = Calorific value of coal delivered
Reb           = Rebate for the relevant year expressed as a percentage.
[Example: Price1996 = 3375 * 614/450 * 1.024 *3,360 / 3,360 . 1.2 = Tg 3937/toc ($6.42/ton) ]

ANNEX 6.1: PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.    Economic analysis for the project included the preparation of a detailed mine plan
and associated costs for both the "without project" and "with project" case for the period
1995-2014 and a comparison of a variety of scenarios for the rehabilitation of BJSC and
least-cost restoration of coal production. Because of hyperinflation, costs were adjusted
in accordance with IAS 29 and thereafter estimated in US dollars in 1995 terms. All
projections were made in US dollars.
2.    All economic analysis was conducted on the basis of border prices and a discount
rate of 12 percent in real terms. Shadow prices used are as follows:
(a)   Coal. The shadow price for Baganuur's coal of $7.8/ton, ex-mine, was
based on parity with coal that could be imported from the Kuzbass coal
basin in Russia.  A minimum  import price capacity of $6.2/ton of
6,000 kcal/kg coal equivalent (tce) was estimated, based on the short-run
marginal production cost at the Kuzbass Basin, where there is a large
surplus capacity. Transport costs by rail from Kuznetsk to Ulaanbaatar
(1,300 km), coal-handling fees and adjustment for Baganuur's low
calorific value of 3,300 kcal/kg were added in.
(b)   Operating costs. With the exception of labor, power, and diesel, all costs
were shadow priced at the standard conversion factor of 0.9.
(c)   Other costs. The conversion factors used for labor, power and diesel were
1.4, 2.0 and 1.0, respectively.
3.    Incremental production of coal was estimated to increase from 1.3 million ton in
1997 to 1.5 million in 1998 and beyond.
4.    Inventory requirements were calculated on the basis of 62 days of incremental
consumption of explosives, spare parts and diesel.
5.    The incremental cost-benefit stream was derived from the difference between the
with- and without-project case, after netting out all duties and taxes, for the period 1997-
2014 and summarized in Table 1.
