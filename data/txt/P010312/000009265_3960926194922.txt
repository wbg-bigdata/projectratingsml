POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:              Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
Beneficiary:           Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
Amount:                SDR 29.2 million (US$40.5 million equivalent)
Terms:                 Standard, with 40 years maturity
Onlending Terms:       The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) would relend SDR
15.1 million (US$20.9 million) out of the proceeds of
the credit to CEB at an interest rate of ten percent
per annum, repayable over 20 years, including a
five-year grace period; the remaining SDR 14.1 million
(US$19.6 million) would be relent to CEB for financing
the distribution component of the proposed project at
an interest rate of ten percent per annum, repayable
over 25 years, including seven years of grace. The
Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk in
accordance with the provisions of the 1969 CEB Act.
Project Description:   The principal objectives of the Project are to ration-
alize the organization of power distribution in
Sri Lanka and reduce system losses in distribution
systems presently managed by licensees to economic
levels. It would also expand the transmission system
to meet projected demand at least cost and strengthen
CEB. The Project consists of a five-year time slice
of CEB's program to take over licensees' power dis-
tribution systems and rehabilitate and expand those
systems, and the development of its transmission
system. It would comprise about 230 km of 132-kV
lines, the island wide rehabilitation and extension of
low voltage distribution networks, and technical
assistance to CEB.
Risks:                 Although the proposed Project involves a major
institutional reorganization, no unusual risks are
foreseen. The major risk concerns possible delays in
the passage of the legislation enabling CEB to take
over licensees' distribution systems. This risk would
be minimized by the passage of the required legisla-
tion before credit effectiveness.

POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. ENERGY SECTOR
A.  Energy Sector Organization
1.01    Until the Government of Sri Lanka (COSL) created an Energy Coordinat-
ing Team (ECT) in the Ministry of Power  and Energy in October 1982, the lack
of effective  coordination among  the large  number of  ministries  and  line
agencies involved in  the energy sector  constrained its  development.  ECT's
primary purpose is  to coordinate the  work of  relevant ministries  and line
agencies and to prevent duplication of effort. ECT consists of three task
forces covering energy planning, energy conservation, and renewable energy,
along with their support staff. Energy policy coordination was further
strengthened  when  (a)  in   1984,  the  Ceylon   Petroleum  Corporation  (a
state-owned agency responsible for all aspects of petroleum supply, with the
exception of the retail marketing of LPG and some secondary marketing of
petroleum products through small private dealers) was transferred from the
Ministry of Industries to the Ministry of Power and Energy, thus reducing the
number of ministries involved in the energy sector; and (b) in 1983, Lanka
Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO) was set up under the Companies
Act to gradually take over some local authority distribution systems. The
organizational structure of the energy sector is shown in Annex 1.1.
1.02    The fragmentation of responsibility  for electricity supply among the
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), LECO, and 208 licensees (local authorities)
impedes the  subsector's efficient  operation  and  development.   CEB  is  a
statutory organization responsible for electricity generation and transmis-
sion throughout Sri Lanka and for distribution except in areas served by LECO
and licensees. In late 1987 CEB was directly responsible for electricity
sales to about 460,000 consumers, out of a total of about 860,00i, while LECO
supplied about 50,000 consumers in the Colombo suburban area.
1.03    GOSL  has recognized  for some  years the  need to  rationalize elec-
tricity distribution.   Many local  authorities'  distribution  systems  face
serious problems, including: (a) high system losses (average about 25%);
(b) unreliable, poor quality and deteriorating supply; (c) high accounts
payable to CEB (averaging 5.5 months' billings in 1987); (d) long delays in
connecting new consumers; and (e) shortages of competent staff. In 1980/81
GOSL deferred a proposal for CEB to take over local authority systems because
of its organizational and staffing constraints, and under the Sixth Power
Project (Credit 1048-CE) CEB agreed to seek the Bank Group's approval of any
CEB program to  take over licensees'  electricity operations.   Although LECO
has improved the quality of supply and reduced system losses and accounts



-2-
payable to CEB within its jurisdiction around and near Colombo, its rela-
tively slow take over of licensees' schemes necessitates additional astion to
address  the  shortcomings  listed   above.   In  1987   GOSL  proposed  that
approximately one-third of licensees' consumers would be taken over by CEB,
one-third by LECO and one-third would remain with licensees (those which are
efficient or unwilling  to forfeit  electricity distribution).   The proposed
Project would support CEB's take over of about 180,000 consumers now served
by licensees.
B. Energy Resources and Supply
1.04    Sri Lanka has few indigenous  energy resources.  The major indigenous
resources are hydropower and fuelwood. There are no known hydrocarbon reser-
ves, but a modest petroleum exploration program is underway. Following the
change in GOSL economic policies in 1977, imports of petroleum fuels
increased  steadily,  averaging   1.7Z  during  1977-1986.    Energy  imports
accounted for 14Z of non-petroleum export earnings in 1977 and 9Z in 1986.
1.05    The hydropower potential is  estimated to be about  2,300 MW, with an
energy potential, under average hydrological conditions, of about 6,600 GWh a
year. The major hydropower resources are concentrated in the southern half
of the  country in  basically five  river systems:   Mahaweli  Ganga,  Kelani
Canga, Kalu  Ganga, Nilwala  Ganga and  Walawe  Ganga.   The  centerpiece  of
hydropower development has been the Accelerated Mahaweli Program (AMP) which,
during  1984-86,  added  533 MW  (Victoria,   210 MW;  Kotmale,  201 MW;  and
Randenigala, 122 MW) to CEB's already installed capacity of 589 MW. The lack
of detailed knowledge of remaining hydropower potential and its development
is a major constraint. This issue is being addressed in the Master Plan
Study for the Electricity Supply of Sri Lanka under financing by the Govern-
ment of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) through the Gesellschaft fur
Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).  The  study, which  commenced in  April 1986
and is scheduled for completion in March 1989, includes the preparation of an
inventory of potential hydropower projects and a preliminary evaluation of
the 35 most promising projects. The Master Plan Study is being complemented
by a UNDP-financed, IDA executed, study of the proposed Kalu Ganga Multipur-
pose Project which is aimed at the optimal development of the land and water
(including hydroelectric) resources of the Kalu Ganga basin.
1.06    At present, about  65% of Sri Lanka's net  (of exports) energy supply
is provided  by fuelwood.   However, incremental  wood  production  from  the
natural regeneration of forests, agricultural residues and rubber replanting,
etc., is estimated to be less than half of the annual consumption of fuelwood
(about nine million tons). The balance of wood supply has come mainly from
deforestation, and the island's natural forest cover declined from about
seven million acres in 1960 to about four million acres in 1983. Deforesta-
tion will lead to an increase in the demand for commercial energy, with the
substitution of  petroleum products  for fuelwood.   This could  result in  a
substantial increase in  the fuel import  bill.  GOSL  recognizes that  a key



-3-
element in the resolution of these issues would be a large, comprehensive
reforestation program. A Forestry Master Plan was prepared by Jaakko Poyry
(Finland) in FY87 as part of the IDA-assisted Forestry I Project (Credit
1317-CE). The Plan includes a five-year forestry sector investment program,
which IDA plans to help finance in a proposed FY89 operation. Reforestation
programs, under which GOSL is planning to treble both the acreage and density
of tree planting, are being developed within the context of ongoing fuelwood
projects assisted by the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID) and Asian Development Bank (ADB). When completed, the USAID
project aims to provide 102-15% of the country's fuelwood req -irements.
Efforts to improve the fuelwood supply are being complemented by action on
the demand side to encourage the use of more fuel-efficient woodstoves. A new
woodstove has been developed under the auspices of the energy conservation
task force (para. 1.01), and GOSL is promoting its use through a demGnstra-
tion program and incentives for its purchase.
C. Energy Pricing
1.07    For social and  political reasons, energy prices  did not reflect the
economic costs of supply until 1978.   Since then, however, petroleum product
prices have been  generally set  at or  above border  price levels.   In July
1983, GOSL abolished the general subsidy on kerosene but protected the pur-
chasing power of low-income households by simultaneously increasing the value
of kerosene stamps which are provided to about half of the population. In
late 1987, petroleum product prices averaged 135% of border prices. GOSL did
not reduce retail prices following the fall in international prices in 1985
but used the opportunity to mobilize resources to reduce the budget deficit.
1.08    CEB's electricity  tariffs have been  raised several times  in recent
years, most  recently by  19% in  January  1988.   During  1980-1988  average
revenue per kWh, excluding the fuel adjustment charge, increased at an
average annual rate of about 23X, representing an average annual increase in
real terms of about 10%.   The increases in tariff  rates were accompanied by
significant changes in the tariff structure.   Thus, the 1978 tariff revision
included provision for an automatic adjustment to reflect increases in fuel
costs, and the 1980 tariff replaced the declining block tariff for domestic
consumers by an increasing block tariff, including a lifeline rate to enable
low income consumers to afford the electricity required to meet their basic
needs. In 1980 CEB agreed under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) to
carry out a tariff study based on long-run marginal cost (LRMC), implement
any agreed recommendations and update the study periodically. A study was
undertaken in 1981, and a revised tariff was introduced in June 1982. The
study was updated in 1984, and revised tariffs were introduced in March 1985.
The 1985 tariff structure included separate energy and demand charges for
hotel, industrial and general purpose consumers with contract demands exceed-
ing 50 kVA, and optional time-of-day energy rates for industrial and hotel
consumers. The average revenue per kWh, which is set to meet CEB's financial
objectives, is estimated to be about 85% of LRMC.

D. Energy Consumption
1.09    Per capita  consumption of  commercial energy  in Sri Lanka  is about
160 kilogram oil equivalent (kgoe) per annum, just over 55% of the average
for low-income countries. Total annual per capita energy consumption is
about 290 kgoe, of which about 78% is supplied by traditional energy sources
(fuelwood used mainly for cooking), about 18% by petroleum products and 4% by
hydropower. About 24% of the population has access to electricity and energy
consumption has been growing relatively quickly. Between 1975 and 1986 total
energy consumption increased at about 2.3% a year, compared to 4.1% for
commercial energy and to an annual growth rate of about 5.2% for real GDP.
The GDP commercial energy elasticity was about 0.8 during 1975-1986, the same
as the average for low income developing countries.
E. GOSL's Energy Sector Strategy
1.10    GOSL's  energy strategy  includes measures  that address  both energy
demand and supply. On the demand side, GOSL has been promoting energy con-
servation and waste reduction, and encouraging the efficient use and alloca-
tion of energy resources by relating energy prices to their economic costs of
supply. On the supply side, particular emphasis has been placed on sub-
stituting imported petroleum products with indigenous resources, principally
hydropower. Other major objectives being pursued by GOSZ in the energy
sector include:   (a) improving the  quality and  reliability of  electricity
supply and efficiency in the operation of the power system; and (b) improving
efficiency of use and increasing the availability of renewable resources to
meet the growing demand for energy in rural areas. In line with the priority
given to energy development, about 14% of the public investment program for
1987-91 was allocated to projects in the power subsector, Rs 20.6 billion out
of the total public investment budget of Rs 151.4 billion.
F. The Bank Group's Involvement in the Energy Sector
1.11    To date, the  Bank Group has  financed nine operations  in the energy
sector, all in the power subsector, through five loans and four credits. The
amount of the Bank Group funds committed through these operations totals
US$218.7 million, representing about 20% of total Bank Group resources com-
mitted to Sri Lanka up through March 1988. The Bank Group's involvement with
Sri Lanka's power subsector began in 1954 when a loan of US$19.1 million
(Loan 101-CE) was made to GOSL to help finance a 25 MW expansion of the
Aberdeen-Laksapana hydroelectric scheme. Since then, the Bank Group has
continued to be actively involved in providing the resources needed for the
subsector's development; in terms of both its capacity to meet demand at
least cost and institutional reforms. Of the nine projects, six have been
completed satisfactcrily and three (Sixth Power Project, Credit 1048-CE;
Seventh Power Project, Credit 1210-CE; and Ninth Power Project, Credit
173b-CE) are  still ongoing.   The Sixth  and  Seventh  power  projects  bave



-5-
proceeded slower than expected, mainly because of civil unrest. PCRs/PPARs
for earlier projects have cited deficiencies in CEB's utility and project
management as the  primary implementation  impediment.  More  recent projects
have focused on strengthening overall CEB management by rationalizing the
organizational structure,  improving accounting  and  financial  systems  and
procedures, and providing training.   The proposed Project  would extend this
type of support, particularly in the area of financial management.
C.  The Bank Group's Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.12    The objectives of the Bank  Group's assistance in the power subsector
have been determined in the course of  a continuing dialogue with GOSL on its
strategy for the energy sector's development. Assistance has been and is
aimed at supporting efforts to:  (a) meet the forecast demand for electricity
at least cost through the development of an appropriate mix of generating
plants and the development of efficient transmission and distribution sys-
tems; (b) assist in institution building; (c) strengthen CEB's financial
management through the provision of consulting services and itaff training;
(d) rationalize energy consumption through the reform of tariff structures
and setting tariff rates based on the costs to Sri Lanka of meeting con-
sumers' demand for electricity; and (e) increase resource mobilization in the
power subsector by setting appropriate financial objectives for CEB and
controlling accounts receivable. Although progress has been made in all of
these areas, further  improvements are necessary.   In particular, additional
efforts are needed to: (a) rationalize the institutional arrangements for
electricity distribution; (b) reduce distribution losses, especially in
licensees' distribution  systems;  (c)   reinforce  and  extend  transmission
systems to supply new consumers and improve the quality of supply; and
(d) further strengthen CEB's management and staffing through training and the
appointment of staff  experienced in water  resource planning.   The proposed
Project addresses these issues.



-6-
II. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A- Organization of CEB
2.01    CEB, the beneficiary,  is a statutory corporation  established by the
CEB Act, No. 17 of 1969 (1969 CEB Act). It is responsible for the generation
and transmission of electricity throughout Sri Lanka and for distribution
except in those areas where distribution systems are operated by licensees
(local authorities and, since 1983, LECO (para. 1.01)). CEB's management
consists of a seven-member Boart'. Its members are appointed by the Minister
of Power and Energy, may be cemoved at any time, serve three to five-year
terms and may be reappointed. The Chairman, who is appointed from among the
Board members, is responsible through the  Board for policy matters and close
liaison  with  GOSL.    The  General  Manager (GM),   CEB's  Chief  Executive
Officer (CEO), is responsible for the overall direction and control of CEB's
day-to-day business. The GM is appointed from CEB's staff on the basis of
seniority and merit. During 1982-84 there were three GMs, leading to discon-
tinuity and an increase in the Chairman's involvement in CEB's day-to-day
business. However, the situation improved with the appointment of the present
GM in 1984, who is playing an active role as the CEO.
2.02    CEB's original organizational structure was designed by Urwickt Inter-
national Ltd. (UK), management consultants, in the early 1970s under the
Fourth Power Project (Loan 636-CE). In 1981 CEB again retained the services
of these consultants under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) to:
re-examine its organizational structure, since the existing structure was
considered to be inappropriate for its enlarged size and responsibilities;
redesign CEB's accounting systems; and implement a modern system for inven-
tory control and management. Urwick recommended a decentralized organization
consisting of seven departments at CEB's headquarters, two operating regions
with several divisions under them, and a Generation Group responsible for
three complexes and a system control center. In September 1982, CEB's Board
agreed to restructure CEB in accordance with the consultants' recommenda-
tions, and implementation began in January 1984 (CEB's organization chart is
shown in Annex 2.1). Under the new organization the regions are responsible
for the extension and reinforcement of distribution systems; construction
units have been established to allow them to undertake this work. With the
reorganization CEB ceased using its own directly employed labor to undertake
major construction work; contracts for large projects are now let to outside
contractors under the supervision of CEB's headquarters.
2.03    Implementation of the new organization occurred at a slower pace than
expected, and consequently many of the new management systems were operating
only partially in late 1985. In an effort to expedite implementation, CEB
requested the consultants to prepare detailed procedures for the new
organization, provide systems training to selected staff, and prepare manuals
for systems operations for all CEB's activities. Further, CEB extended its



-7-
contract with Urwick Iaternational Ltd. (para. 2.02) and also hired a local
firm of accountants, Messrs. Macan Markar, to monitor the implementation of
the new procedures. Since iull implementation of the new organizational
structure was considered to be an important step in strengthening CEB and
enabling it to manage operations and investments efficiently, it was made a
condIcion of effectiveness of the Ninth Power Project (Credit 1736-CE).
Implementation of the new organizational structure, including distribution of
all the manuals, was completed in early 1987.
2.04    The new  organization is concerned  with improving the  efficiency of
CEB given its present functions, which include responsibility for about 75%
of total electricity sales  at the distribution level.   The remaining 25% of
sales are the responsibility of 208 licensees (local authorities) and LECO.
This fragmentation of responsibility for distribution is a major cause of
identified impediments to the efficient operation and development of the
power subsector. Under the Ninth Power Project (Credit 1736-CE), GOSL/CEB
agreed to prepare a master plan for the development of distribution systems,
including both investment requirements to rehabilitate those systems and
appropriate organizational/institutional reforms. Consultants were appointed
in October 1987 and the study is scheduled for completion by June 30, 1988.
Based on the draft recommendations of that study, and in recognition of the
serious  issues  posed  by   licensees' electricity  distribution  functions
(para. 1.03), COSL has adopted an action program to rationalize and improve
electricity distribution. The program involves the phased take over of about
two-thirds of licensees' consumers by CEB and LECO. IDA and the ADB support
this approach. The proposed Project's distribution rehabilitation component
would support CEB's phased take over of about 130 licensees' systems, while
the ADB financed LECO II Distribution Project (FY87) supports LECO's take
over of 23 licensees with about 75,000 consumers.
2.05    Although a  small number of  licensees have already  requested CEB to
take over their electricity distribution functions, the take over of licen-
sees by CEB will generally require the passage of appropriate legislation and
revoking many of the outstanding licenses for electricity distribution.
However, because electricity distribution has been specified as one of the
functions available to local authorities  under GOSL's proposed devolution of
power to provincial councils, the required legislation must be consistent
with GOSL's broader political objectives. This issue was considered by the
Cabinet, which in February 1988  ordered a draft amendment to  the CEB Act of
1969 to be prepared, to enable CEB to take over the power distribution
schemes administered by  local authorities.   The appraisal  mission reviewed
the main proposals to be incladed in the enabling legislation with COSL/CEB.
The legislation will specify the arrangements to be made for the transfer of
licensees' assets to CEB, including their valuation, compensation to be paid
to licensees, treatment of licensees' accounts payable to CEB, treatment of
licensees' staff, and the criteria to be used in selecting licensee distribu-
tion systems to be  taken over by CEB.   Since it is critical  for the timely
implementation of the proposed project, passage of the legislation would be a
condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.04(a)).



-8-
B. CEB Staffing and Training
2.06    In late  1987, CEB had  about 13,300 employees  serving about 460,000
consumers, representing a consumer/employee ratio of 35:1. Although it is
low, this ratio represents a considerable improvement over the 1975 ratio of
13:1. Further, the ratio is biased downwards since 1,030 of the staff are
employed in providing services to government departments for which CEB is
fully reimbursed.   CEB is  simultaneously overstaffed  in  some  grades  and
deficient in key personnel in many important functional areas; its staffing
policy is to limit the recruitment of new staff and to improve staff produc-
tivity through appropriate training at its new training school. IDA has
reviewed, and found to be satisfactory, CEB's planned staffing levels for the
period 1988-1990.
2.07    CEB is fully cognizant of the role  to be played by training in meet-
ing its staffing requirements, and in 1984 it established a training section
under the charge of the Chief Engineer for Education and Training. In 1983,
CEB proposed that a new training center should be constructed near Colombo
since  its  existing  training  facilities  were  inadequate.   Its  existing
residential training center at Castlereagh, about 120 km from Colombo, has a
capacity for only 40 students and is inadequate to meet CEB's existing and
projected training needs. Further, the remote location and poor access roads
of the Castlereagh center have made it difficult to retain good instructors.
In 1985 Electricite de France prepared a feasibility study for a proposed new
Technical Training Center.   IDA endorsed  the study's  recommendations after
the center's capacity was reduced from the originally recommended 1,000
trainees a year to 400. This capability is consistent with CEB's forecast
total technical staff requirement of about 10,100 in 1995. CEB is financing
the buildings for the new center from its own resources, while equipment,
estimated to cost about US$1,360,000, is being financed under the ongoing
Power VI and Power VII projects. The new center is scheduled to be opened in
October 1988.
2.08    In early 1988,  CEB had only  about 350 qualified  engineers, of whom
only about 30X had more than 5 years experience with CEB. Many engineers had
left in the early 1980s to take higher paid posts in the private sector or
overseas. The shortage of qualified engineers can, to a large extent, be
remedied through the training of its middle level technical officers (includ-
ing power station operators, substation and lines foremen, and cable
jointers). Although these staff have substantial practical experience they
have insufficient knowledge of supporting theoretical principles. This could
be rectified by suitable classroom training, including the use of power
station and substation simulators, test benches and audio-visual teaching
aids. CEB has developed with IDA a dated training program for these middle
level technical officers, including the numbers to be trained, equipment
requirements and the identification of suitable instructors.



-9-
2.09    It  is estimated  that nearly  2,200 local  authority staff  would be
affected by the proposed transfer of licensees' distribution systems to CEB
(Annex 2.2).  LECO, in  taking over such  systems, has found  that onl- about
half of the affected local authority staff were suitably qualified for
employment in a commercial electricity utility. CEB intends to employ only
those ex-licensee staff who are either suitably qualified or capable of being
trained. Based on LECO's experience the implementation cf this employment
strategy will mean that about 900 local authority staff would need to be
redeployed, given early retirement or redundancy payments. The appraisal
mission reviewed with GOSL its draft proposals for the redeployment of local
authority  staff,   including  redundancy   payments  and   their   financing
(Annex 2.2). Under the proposals, within three months of taking over a
licensee's  electricity  distribution  system,   CEB  would  determine  which
employees who had been exclusively employed in that licensee's electrical
undertakings should be offered employment by CEB. It is expected that about
60% of the affected staff will be offered such employment and that a further
8X will be offered alternative employment by the Ministry of Local Govern-
ment, Housing and Construction. About 24% of the staff would be made redun-
dant. CEB would meet the costs of the redundancy payments; Rs 20 million
have been included in the project cost estimates for this purpose. During
negotiations GOSL agreed that it would carry out, or cause to be carried
out, a program satisfactory to the Association, for the redeployment and
retirement of those licensees' staff not offered employment by CEB (para.
6.01(a)).
2.10    Many of the local authority staff to be absorbed by CEB following the
transfer of licensees' distribution systems require retraining. The preap-
praisal mission reviewed with CEB the number of ex-licensee staff requiring
retraining, the specific training requirements by discipline, level and
length of training course, and the alternative ways in which these training
requirements could be met. During negotiations CEB agreed to implement a
dated program satisfactory to the Association to retrain those staff
(para 6.03(a)).
2.11    The  economically efficient  management of  CEB's  generation  system
requires the optimal integration of the multipurpose hydro projects con-
structed under the Accelerated Mahaweli Program (Victoria, 210 MW; Kotmale,
201 MW; and Randenigala, 122 MW) into its mix of thermal and hydroelectric
operation. This requires that CEB have strong capabilities in water resour-
ces planning, including a broad knowledge of both irrigation and hydroelec-
tric systems operation. During project preparation it was found that CEB did
not have  any staff  experienced in  these areas.   During  preappraisal  CEB
agreed to rectify this situation, and on February 1, 1988 it hired the former
Deputy Director of the Irrigation Department to work in the offices of the
Assistant General Managers, Operations and Planning. His appointment repre-
sents a significant strengthening of CEB's capability in water and land
resource planning.



-10-
C. System Losses
2.12    Island-wide losses,  as a percentage  of gross generation,  are about
23%, comprising about 17% in CEB's supply system and 6% in distribution
systems operated  by licensees  and  LECO.   Gross  losses  in  CEB's  system
increased from 10.51 in 1975 to a peak of 19.6% in 1981 and then declined to
about 17%  in 1987  (Annex 2.3).  Most  of the  losses (about  six percentage
points) occur in its 33-kV subtransmission system. Non-technical losses are
low in CEB's system, being only about one percentage point. The problem of
CEB's losses  was studied  by the  UNDP/World Bank  Energy Sector  Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP) 1/, and in 1983 CEB established a Loss Reduction
Cell (LRC) to address the problem. 2/ According to both the ESMAP report and
analysis undertaken by LRC, the principal cause of the high losses is
under-investment in medium- and low-voltage distribution lines, resulting in
overloading and poor  voltage conditions, and  low power factors.   The ESMAP
report identified a number of measures to reduce technical losses. They were
included in the Ninth Power Project (Credit 1736-CE), which were expected to
reduce losses in CEB's system to about 12% by 1992.
2.13    Losses are generally  very high in the  distribution systems operated
by licensees.   In 1987  these losses  were estimated  to average  about 25Z,
comprising about 10% technical losses and 15% non-technical losses, of CEB's
bulk supply  to licensees.   As with  CEB, the  principal cause  of the  high
technical losses is under-investment in low voltage distribution lines,
resulting in over loading and poor voltage conditions. The problem of losses
in licensees'  distribution systems  in the  area  around  Colombo  is  being
addressed by LECO with the support of ADB (FY84 Secondary Towns Distribution
Project and  FY87 LECO  II Power  Distribution Project).   Although LECO  has
achieved some  success in  reducing losses  and improving  quality of  supply
within its jurisdiction, its relatively slow  take over of licensees' schemes
and their wide geographic dispersion requires additional action to be taken.
The proposed Project would support CEB's adoption of about 180,000 consumers
under the proposed reorganization program (para. 2.04) and reduce technical
losses in  those distribution  systems  through  their  rehabilitation.   The
consumers to be taken over by LECO are included in ADB's LECO II project.

j UNDP/World Bank Energy Secto- Management Assistance Program, Activity
Completion Report No. 007/83.
2/ In 1985, LRC was renamed the Distribution Development and Rehabilita-
tion Branch (DDRB).



-11-
2.14    Although  dated loss  reduction programs  have not  been  formulated,
implementation of the measures incljded in the Project is expected to reduce
system losses in taken over distribution systems from about 25Z to about 1OZ
by 1993. The takeover of licensee distribution systems is expected to sig-
nificantly reduce losses even before CEB undertakes the capital works
included in the Project. Based on LECO's experience, CEB's discipline in
commercial and operating procedures can be expected to reduce losses quickly
by five or more percentage points.
D. Existing Facilities
2.15    In  December 1987,  CEB's total  installed  generating  capacity  was
1,138 MW, comprising 868 MW hydroelectric plants (including 210 MW at Vic-
toria and 201 MW at Kotmale--the first stations commissioned under the
Accelerated Mahaweli Program) and 270 MW thermal plants (including 120 MW gas
turbines and 80 MW of diesel capacity--Annex 2.3). Total installed capacity
increased at an average annual rate of about 10% during 1975-87, from 361 MW
in 1975. During this period the hydro-thermal plant mix remained at about
82:18. The major generating stations and load centers are interconnected by
a  132-kV   transmission  grid   (1,017 km),   consisting   of   double   and
single-circuit lines,  and 126 km  of 220-kV  transmission lines.   There are
also 367 km of 66-kV transmission lines which are to be replaced largely by
132-kV connections.   The 220-kV  lines were  constructed under  the  Seventh
Power Project (Credit 1210-CE) to meet increased requirements for transmit-
ting the Mahaweli hydropower generation to the Colombo area. The transmis-
sion network is generally in good condition.
2.16    The subtransmission system  comprises about 8,500 km  of 33-kV lines,
about 2,300 km  of 11-kV  lines and  about 6,000  consumer substations.   The
physical condition of the distribution networks is generally unsatisfactory,
partly because many of the networks are overloaded as a result of the large
increase in the number of consumers in recent years and partly as a result of
poor maintenance. In a number of CEB's areas maintenance has been hindered
by shortages of skilled linesmen and other staff. The physical conidition of
CEB's distribution networks is being upgraded under the Ninth Power Project,
which also provides training for linesmen.
E. Generation Planning and Development
2.17    Generation planning for CEB's interconnected system is carried out by
its Generation and Transmission Planning Department using the computer-based
WASP-III optimization model. CEB has an annual generation expansion planning
cycle, which begins with the preparation of a load forecast by the commercial
branch in July and is followed in August/September by the preparation of the
least-cost generation expansion plan using WASP-III.  This plan is integrated
with the transmission and distribution expansion plans, and the resultant
aggregated plan is used by the Finance Department for the preparation of
CEB's  annual  financial  plan.   Details  of  the  latest  (September  1987)



-12-
least-cost generation expansion plan and forecast energy and capacity balan-
ces are given in Annexes 2.6 and 2.7.   Under the Ninth Power Project (Credit
1736-CE) CEB and GOSL agreed to update and review annually with IDA the
Board's long-term development plan; the latest expansion plan has been
reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
2.18    CEB's total installed capacity is projected to increase from 1,138 MW
in 1987 to about 1,365 MU in 1992 and about 1,605 MW in 1998, equivalent to
an annual growth  rate of 3Z.   Effective capacity  is projected  to increase
from about 931 MW in 1987 to about 1,270 MW in 1992 and about 1,430 MW in
1997. Hydropower projects under construction or firmly planned comprise: a
1x30 MW extension at Canyon to be commissioned in 1988, the commissioning of
Rantambe (49 MW)  in 1991,   and Samanalawewa  (120 MW) in  1992 (Annex 2.6).
Thermal projects comprise: rehabilitation of the Kelanitissa oil-fired plant
(50 MW) in 1991, commissioning of about 240 MW of diesel units during
1995-1998, and construction  of a large   coal-fired station, with  the first
unit (150 MW) being commissioned in 1999. Financing has been secured or is
being negotiated  for all  of these  projects,  with  the  exception  of  the
coal-fired and diesel projects,  and they should be  commissioned as planned.
Annex 2.7 shows that the  completion of this program  as planned would enable
CEB to meet its load forecast at its planned quality of service.
F. Transmission Planning and Development
2.19    Transmission  planning is  the  responsibility  of  the  Transmission
Planning branch in the Generation and Transmission Planning Department.
Planned asjor transmission works include 220-kV and 132-kV lines to connect
the projected generating facilities at Rantambe, Samanalawewa and Trincomalee
with the load centers. CEB also plans to extend and reinforce the 132-kV
transmission system, and replace overloaded power transformers with larger
ones at  132-kV substations.   The  proposed  Project  would  assist  in  the
implementation of CEB's least cost transmission expansion program.
G. Distribution Planning and Development
2.20    CEB's  planning of  subtransmission  and  distribution  projects  was
strengthened in 1985 by the establishment of the Distribution Development and
Rehabilitation Branch (DDRB) in the Transmission and Generation Project
Department. The development of both CEB's and licensees' distribution ays-
tems has not kept pace with the rapidly increasing demand; consequently
losses are excessively high, voltage drop often exceeds the original design
levels, and the number of outagc.s has increased. For CEB these issues were
addressed under the Ninth Power Project Credit 1736-CE, and the proposed
Project would address them in licensees' distribution systems.



-13-
H. Consumer Relations Unit
2.21    The organizational changes  made by CEB in  recent years have focused
on improving  the efficiency  of CEB's  internal  operation.   However,  par-
ticularly in years when CEB has had to introduce power cuts due to poor
hydrological conditions and to activate the fuel adjustment charge in the
power tariff (para. 1.08), CEB has become increasingly aware of the need to
increase consumers' understanding of the operation of its power system and
the need for tariff changes. To address this issue CEB has decided to estab-
lish a consumer relations unit to disseminate relevant information to the
public. Consulting services to define the function, staff and other require-
ments  of   the  unit,   have  been   included  in   the   proposed   Project
(para. 3.03(c)).



-14-
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Features
Project Setting
3.01    Considerable efforts  are underway to  rationalize and  improve power
distribution under the Ninth Power Project (for CEB distribution systems) and
for LECO (with ADB assistance). However, about 38X of the existing elec-
tricity consumers, who are served by licensees, are outside the scope of
those programs (para. 2.04). The quality of electricity supply in licensees'
systems is generally poor, with voltage levels sometimes substantially below
planned levels, and system losses are generally very high (para. 2.13). In
view of the waste of resources, GOSL has developed a strategy for the
rehabilitation, upgrading and a more rational expansion of distribution
schemes throughout the country (para. 1.03). This strategy involves institu-
tional changes  to  be  facilitated  by  the  enactment  of *new  legislation
(para. 2.05). The power distribution component of the proposed Project would
thus be complementary to the Ninth Power Project and would, in effect, extend
the geographic coverage of that project's low-voltage component. The trans-
mission component is part of CEB's least-cost expansion plan, while the
feasibility study for the proposed Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Project would plan
the optimal mix of hydropower generation and other developments in one of
Sri Lanka's major river basins for which a comprehensive development plan is
yet to be prepared.
Project Objectives
3.02    The proposed Project would  support measures aimed at:  rationalizing
the organization of power distribution; rehabilitating and expanding dis-
tribution systems presently managed by licensees to reduce system losses and
improve the quality of electricity supply; implementing CEB's least-cost
transmission expansion program; strengthening CEB institutionally through the
corporate-wide computerization of its billing system; training staff in
computerized accounts and engineering; and improving CEB's financial perfor-
mance by reducing accounts receivable from licensees. The Project would also
assist in the optimal development of the Kalu Ganga basin's land and water
resources.

Project Description
3.03    The proposed Project would consist of the following components:
(a) a five-year time-slice of CEB's expenditures to rehabilitate, develop
and expand distribution systems to be taken over from selected licen-
sees;
(b) the construction of about 230 km of 132-kV transmission lines, the
reconductoring of about 150 km of 132-kV transmission lines and the
construction and augmentation of related substations;
(c) consulting services to: (i) develop a decentralized computerized
billing system and a management information system (MIS); (ii) assist
CEB in the preparation of the detailed specifications and design of
the 132-kV transmission system in (b) and preparation of bidding
documents for major transmission contracts; (iii) assist CEB in
carrying out a tariff study; (iv) assist in the development of a
training program for middle level technical officers; (v) assist in
the establishment of a consumer relations unit; and (vi) assist in
monitoring the continued implementation of CEB's new organizational
structure; and
(d) feasibility study for the Kalu Canga Multipurpose Project.
A detailed description of the Project is presented in Annex 3.1 and the
geographic area it would cover is shown in Maps IBRD 20551 and 20860.
Project Costs
3.04    The estimated total cost of the proposed Project, including price and
physical contingencies, duties and taxes, is US$113.0 million based on early
1988 prices. It comprises US$61.0 million in foreign exchange, and US$52.0
million in local costs, including US$15.8 million in taxes and duties.
Physical contingencies of 1OZ are assumed for equipment, materials and serv-
ices on the basis of previous experience with similar projects in the region.
Price contingencies for foreign costs are assumed at 5.6.Z for 1988, 5.4X for
1989, -0.3Z for 1990 and 1.3% thereafter. Price contingencies for local
costs are assumed at 7.5Z for 1988, 6.0% for 1989, 5% for 1990, 4.0X for
1991, 3.5Z for 1992 and 1.3Z thereafter. Total price contingencies amount to
13% of the base cost plus physical contingencies. A summary cost estimate is
presented in Table 3.1; detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 3.2.

Project Financing
3.05    The financing  requirements are  US$52.0 million  in local  costs and
US$61.0 million in foreign exchange. Local costs would be financed by CEB
from its internal resources, IDA up to an amount of US$4.5 million and pos-
sibly up to US$6.0 million by the cofinancier. The foreign exchange cost of
the Project would be covered by US$36.0 million from the proposed credit and
US$25.0 million from cofinancing. COSL has formally requested the Government
of Japan to cofinance the transmi sion  component of the Project.  The timely
implementation of the project components to be financed by IDA is not contin-
gent on the satisfactory conclusion of cofinancing arrangements. Table 3.2
summarizes the financing plan.

Onlending Terms
3.06    Although the  takeover of licensees'  distribution systems is  in the
national interest, since it would reduce system losses and improve the
allocation of resources, for a number of years it would have an adverse
impact on CEB's liquidity. This is because while CEB is to provide local
cost financing for the takeover from internal cash generation, its revenues
would tend to be reduced as it would bear the costs of high system losses
before the  impact of  rehabilitation could  materialize.   During  the  same
period, CEB's cash position is projected to become very tight due to the high
level of  its self-financing  requirements (para. 4.11).   To alleviate  this
situation, COSL would relend US$19.6 million equivalent out of the proceeds
of the proposed credit to CEB for financing the distribution component of the
proposed Project at an interest rate of 10% per annum, repayable over 25
years, including seven years of grace; the remaining US$20.9 million would be
relent to CEB at an interest rate of 10% per annum, repayable over 20 years,
including a five-year  grace period.   GOSL would  bear the  foreign exchange
risk in accordance with the  provisions of the 1969  CEB Act.  The conclusion
of the two subsidiary loan agreements between COSL and CEB, under terms and
conditions acceptable  to the  Association, would  be a  condition of  Credit
effectiveness (para. 6.04(b)).
Project Engineering and Consulting Services
3.07    The Project  has the four  components described  in para.  3.03.  The
planning, engineering, construction and maintenance skills necessary to carry
out the Project's distribution rehabilitation component are being developed
under the Ninth Power Project with the assistance of consultants (Ewbank
Preece--UK, and  Lahmeyer International--FRG).   Therefore, no  outside  help
would be needed to implement the component (a) of the Project. As far as the
transmission line component is concerned, CEB would require the assistance of
engineering consultants to prepare the detailed specifications of the lines



-18-
and associated substations and the bidding documents for the major contracts.
CEB would also hire a consultant, possibly from a utility in the region which
has successfully implemented a similar system, to assist CEB in the develop-
ment and implementation of a decentralized computerized billing system and a
management information system (MIS).   Further, CEB would  hire an individual
consultant to define the training program for middle-level technical staff,
specify the optimum delivery methtds and the equipment and material necessary
to implement the program. The consultancy for the consumer relations unit
would also be performed by an individual consultant familiar with this type
of work who would define the staff composition of the unit as well as the
installations needed for it to carry out its function. A tariff study would
also be carried out with the assistance of consultants (para. 4.16). The
E          feasibility study for the Kalu  Canga Multipurpose Project (para. 3.08) would
be carried out by a consulting firm to be selected after the UNDP financed
prefeasibility study now being undertaken by the Department of Irrigation and
the Bank (as the executing agency for the UNDP) is completed. The final
versions of the terms of reference for the consultancies to be financed by
IDA, except for the Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Project feasibility study, were
reviewed and agreed during negotiations (para. 6.03(b)).
The Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Project (KGMP)
3.08    Many  GOSL agencies,  including CEB,  lack experience  in effectively
integrating multipurpose  projects into  sectoral  development  plans.   This
stems from the lack of a coordinated institutional approach and of qualified
personnel in the preparation of multipurpose projects. This issue is being
addressed in the work plan for the prefeasibility and feasibility studies of
the KGMP which provides for the full-time secondnient of planning staff from
CEB and agricultural sector agencies to work with KGMP staff in implementing
the studies.  During  appraisal CEB agreed  to nominate by  the end  of April
1988, and subsequently nominated, a full-time planning engineer to join KGMP
staff and nominees from other GOSL agencies in implementing the project
studies, beginning with the prefeasibility study which started in January
1988.
B. Project Implementation
3.09    During the implementation  of the Ninth Power  Project, CEB will gain
experience in coordinating an extensive program for the construction and
rehabilitation of distribution networks with the assistance of project
management consultants. The implementation of the proposed Project, which
would be spread over much of the island, would occur in parallel but about
one year behind the distribution component of the Ninth Power Project. This
would provide an opportunity for CEB's management and staff to apply the
experience currently being acquired in implementing the distribution com-
ponent of the proposed Project. Local authority staff who join CEB following
the take over of licensees would, in some cases, receive on the job training
by participating in the rehabilitation component of the Ninth Power Project.



-19-
Regarding the implementation of the transmission line component, CEB would
hire consultants to assist in the preparation of the detailed specifications
of the lines and substations and the bidding documents for the major con-
tracts. The transmission lines and substations would be implemented through
supply and erect contracts.
3.10    The Project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 3.3.  Construc-
tion of the  Project would be  finished by  December 1993.   The construction
schedule is considered to be feasible provided there are no civil disturban-
ces in the project area.
C. Procurement
3.11    The procurement of the proposed Project's various components would be
arranged as shown in Table 3.3. Procurement for the transmission system,
excluding the Anuradhapura-Mannar 132-kV line and the new Mannar grid substa-
tion to be financed by IDA, would be in accordance with the cofinancier's
procurement guidelines.   Procurement of  equipment  and  materials  for  the
medium voltage lines, for the rationalization, rehabilitation and expansion
of the low voltage networks, and the other equipment would be grouped into
several supply contracts. Construction would be carried out partly using
local contractors, and partly by CEB using force account. All equipment and
materials financed by IDA, with the exception of buildings, would be subject
to ICB.   Documents for  individual contracts  exceeding US$200,000  would be
subject to IDA's prior review and will apply tr. about 90Z of the estimated
cost of IDA-financed items. Local suppliers and manufacturers competing for
the supply of goods under ICB would have a preference of 15% or the
applicable  customs  duty,  whichever  is   less.   Consultants  for  project
engineering and training would be selected and employed in accordance with
the Bank Group guidelines.   IDA would finance US$4.5  million of local costs
to be applied towards the construction of buildings, erection work for the
low voltage networks undertaken by local contractors, and the Kalu Ganga
Multipurpose Project  feasibility study.   As  the  buildings  are  scattered
geographically and the local construction industry can provide competitive
prices, IDA has agreed that those buildings can be procured under Local
Competitive Bidding  (LCB) procedures.   However, as  per  the  Bank  Group's
Procurement Guidelines, paragraph 3.3. any foreign firms wishing to par-
ticipate will be allowed to do so.

-21-
The planned  schedule fir  procurement of  the equipment  and material  to be
financed  from  the  Credit  is:  (a) first  bid  invitation--November  1988;
(b) first bid  opening--February 1989;  and  (c) first  award  decision--June
1989.
D.  Disbursement
3.12    Disbursements  from the  Credit would  be made  against  (a) 100%  of
foreign expenditures  and 100%  of local  expenditures (ex-factory  cost) for
equipment, materials and erection services procured under ICB; (b) 70% of the
cost of other items procured locally; and (c) 100% of the cost of consult-
ancy and training CEB's  staff abroad.  The estimated  disburse  -;s from the
Credit are  shown in  Annex 3.4.  In  o!der to  facilitate  disbursements,  a
Special Account would be established in accordance with terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. The authorized allocation for the account would be SDR
1,370,000 (US$1.9 million equivalent), representing the estimated average
disbursements for a four-month period for the items financed by the Credit.
Disbursements would be for a five-year program to expand and rehabilitate
those licensees' distribution systems to be taken over by CEB, and the con-
struction of the transmission works financed by IDA. The total disbursement
period for the Project would be seven years, which allows for one year after
completion for the payment of retention monies. The proposed closing date of
the Credit is December 31, 1994. The Bank's standard disbursement regional
profile for the power subsector is applied to the proposed Project until the
sixth year of disbursement; only the retention monies will be left to be
disbursed in 1994. The Project includes retroactive financing of up to
US$1.0 million equivalent to cover CEB's expenditures incurred after January
1, 1988, and prior to credit signing, on the implementation of the decentral-
ized billing system including the consultancy needed to define the system.
E. Project Monitoring
3.13    CEB  would submit  quarterly progress  reports covering  the work  of
consultants, physical progress, project cost, disbursements and administra-
tive aspects of the Project. In addition, it would also submit annual finan-
cial and administrative reports and other pertinent information to IDA. CEB
would also undertake not later than six months after the closing date, or
such later date as may be agreed for this purpose, to prepare and furnish to
IDA a Project Completion Report of such scope and in such detail as IDA shall
reasonably request, on the execution and initial operation of the Project,
its costs and the benefits derived from it, the performance of CEB and the
accomplishment of the objectives of the Credit.



-22-
F. Environmental Effects
3.14    Most of the distribution lines included in the proposed Project would
be constructed adjacent to public roadways and would be similar in visual
impact to existing lines. The routing of the 230 km of new transmission
lines to be constructed under the Project would be selected to minimize the
destruction of  primary forest  and valuable  or  critical  ecosystems.   The
ecological impact of transmission and distribution lines is regulated by
Sri Lanka's existing laws, namely, Section 15 of the Electricity Act, The
Flora and  Fauna Act,  and the  Forestry Ordinance.   These  laws  adequately
regulate any adverse ecological impact which could be associated with the
Project's construction. The feasibility study for the Kalu Canga Multipur-
pose Project would address the major environmental and resettlement issues
identified by the Bank-executed, UNDP-financed, prefeasibility study which
commenced in January 1988.
G. Risk
3.15    Although the  proposed Project involves  a major  institutional reor-
ganization, no unusual risks are foreseen.   The major risk concerns possible
delays in the passage of the legislation enabling CEB to take over licensees'
distribution systems.   However, in  mid-February 1988,  the Cabinet  ordered
required legislation to be drafted on a priority basis. Further, this risk
would be minimized by making the passage of the legislation a condition of
Credit effectiveness (para. 2.05).



-23-
IV. FINANCES
A. Background
4.01    CEB's financial activities are  regulated by the CEB  Act of 1969 and
the Finance Act of 1971. The CEB Act requires the Board to operate along
commercial lines and ensure that revenues generated from electricity sales
cover operating costs, including depreciation, debt service, and an adequate
portion of the  cost of the  development program.   The Finance  Act outlines
procedures for the performance of audits and sets the ceiling on the
remuneration of employees in the public sector. In 1973, following the
approval of the Fifth Power Project (Credit 372-CE), CEB's statutory obliga-
tions were amended to allow depreciation to be based on revalued assets. In
1980, under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE), an 8% rate of return on
revalued average net fixed assets was set as a financial objective for CEB.
The same covenant has been repeated in the subsequent power projects financed
by the Bank Group.
Accounting Systems and Organization
4.02    In 1981 CEB engaged management consultants to redesign its accounting
systems and organization in order to improve financial reporting and control
(para. 2.02). Implementation of the new systems and procedures, based on the
consultants'  recommendations,   started   in   January   1984.    Accounting
activities, with the exception of revenue and fixed assets accounting, are
now decentralized to the divisional level, and significant progress has been
made in the centralized computerization of billing and other areas of
accounting and  financial reporting.   However, despite  these  developments,
their benefits have not been fully captured by CEB because of its continuing
difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified staff to operate the new
systems due to the government-imposed ceiling on remuneration.
Audit Arrangements
4.03    CEB has an internal  audit unit to carry out  revenue audit and other
routine audits in accordance  with a program approved  by the Auditor General
of Sri Lanka. In 1983 the Chief Internal Auditor was appointed to head the
unit; he  reports directly  to the  General Manager.   As with  other  public
corporations, the external audit of CEB's accounts is carried out by the
Auditor General (AG) of Sri Lanka, under the Finance Act No. 38 of 1971
(para. 4.01). The AG is an autonomous agency that reports to the Parliament.
Delays in  the submission  of CEB's  accounts which  occurred in  the earlier
years were eliminated as a  result of CEB's efforts  to streamline its finan-
cial reporting procedures and its 1985 and 1986 accounts were sent to the
Bank Group  within the  covenanted period.   The quality  of the  audits  was
satisfactory. To ensure accountability for resources used by CEB, the exist-
ing audit  covenant would  be repeated  under the  proposed Project.   During



-24-
negotiations, CEB agreed to submit to IDA its unaudited accounts within four
months from the end of the fiscal year under consideration, and audited
accounts accompanied by the Auditor's report within ten months (para.
6.03(c)). Further, GOSL agreed during negotiations to submit to the Associa-
tion not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year the auditors'
report on withdrawals made from the Project Account, including the Special
Account. (para. 6.01(b)).
Fixed Assets Accounting
4.04    CEB's fixed  assets are revalued  annually as per  agreement with IDA
under the Fifth Power Project (Credit 372-CE). However, the annual revalua-
tion is applied to the total value of fixed assets and the records for
individual items became obscured over the years. To improve asset manage-
ment, a fixed asset accounting study was commissioned in 1985 under the Sixth
Power Project. The study covered the physical verification of CEB's assets,
the design of a suitable asset classification system, and the review of CEB's
depreciation policies.   The records  for individual  items have  been recon-
structed and a revised system of asset classification became operative on
January 1, 1987. The study confirmed that CEB's depreciation policies are
sound and no changes are recommended.
Insurance Arrangements
4.05    CEB  self-insures all  of its  own  assets  and  has  established  an
insurance reserve for this purpose. An annual provision of one-tenth of 1%
of CEB's revalued gross fixed assets is made out of net income to the
insurance reserve.   However, in  the past  this reserve  was used  partly to
finance CEB's investment program. In order to ensure that funds are readily
available to replace damaged plant and equipment, the transfer of the balance
in the insurance reserve accumulated as of December 31, 1985, to an escrow
account with a financial intermediary was dade a condition of credit effec-
tiveness for the Ninth  Power Project (Credit 1736-CE).   CEB met this condi-
tion in 1986. Under the Ninth Project, CEB is also required to deposit its
annual provision to the insurance reserve into the insurance escrow account
on or before each December 31, beginning in fiscal year 1986. However, CEB
has been unable to comply with this agreement for technical reasons. The
size of the annual provision to the insurance reserve can only be determined
following the completion of the external audit of CEB's accounts, ten months
after the end  of the  fiscal year.   Consequently CEB  has requested  IDA to
modify the agreement under Credit 1736-CE. During negotiations, CEB agreed
to deposit its annual provision to the insurance reserve into the insurance
escrow account within eleven months of the end of the fiscal year (para.
6.03(d)3.

4.07    CEB's electricity sales  increased by 331  from 1,679 GWh  in 1982 to
2,232 GWh in 1986, representing an average annual growth of 7.4%. Total
sales revenue, excluding the fuel adjustment charge, grew by 154% in the
period 1982-1986 as a result of the increase in electricity sales and the 76%
tariff increase in 1985. The significant 1985 tariff increase also resulted
in relatively high levels of internal cash generation and enabled CEB to
achieve an after tax rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in
use of 10% and 8% in 1985 and 1986, respectively. The rate of return had
been below the covenanted 8% in 1983 and 1984 due to the higher than
projected income tax liability 1/ and inadequate tariff levels.
4.08    CEB's  investment during  the five  year  period  totalled  Rs 17,974
i         million, of  which transfer  of hydropower  projects  constructed  under  the
Accelerated Mahaweli Program (AMP) to CEB  (Victoria in 1984, Kotmale in 1985
and Randenigala  in 1986)  accounted for  Rs 10,306 million  or 57%.   GOSL's
practice has been to transfer, at cost, the power components of the schemes
as equity, (in the case of Kotmale) or part equity/part loan (for Victoria
and Randenigala), and to treat that cost as a part of CEB's investment for
the year of transfer. With respect to the investment projects undertaken
directly by CEB, financing has been arranged following CEB's practice of
meeting the entire local costs from internal cash generation with the excep-
tion of rural electrification schemes financed by government equity and
consumer  connect:on   expenditures  financed   by  consumer   contributions.
However, the local cost component of these projects in the period 1982-1986
was relatively low. This, together with COSL's transfer of Mahaweli assets
to CEB as equity/loan, resulted in high levels of government equity financing
(36%) and  loan  financing  (50%).   CEB's  self-financing  ratio,  including
financing by consumer contributions, averaged only 14% during the period
despite high levels of internal cash generation in 1985 and 1986.
4.09    By  virtue of  the financing  arrangements described  above, CEB  has
maintained a strong capitalization position throughout the period with a
debt/equity ratio of 27:73  as of December 31, 1986.   Long-term debt service
coverage was also satisfactory. The current ratio was 3.6 at the end of 1986
with more than half of the current  assets represented by cash.  CEB plans to
use the cash on hand to finance  its future investment program.  CEB's finan-
cial condition is sound.
1/ Income tax is levied on operating income before depreciation less
interest charges and a depreciation allowance of 12.5% for assets
commissioned in 1981 and afterwards. A smaller than projected
depreciation allowance caused by delays in the transfer of the
Victoria power component to CEB from 1983, as originally planned, to
1984 resulted in a larger taxable income and therefore a bigger tax
liability than estimated for 1983. Starting in 1987, CEB was allowed
to claim an annual depreciation over a three year period on newly
commissioned assets.

C. Future Financial Performance
Investment Program
4.10    Energy sales are projected to grow  at an average annual rate of 7.8Z
from 2,538 GUb  in 1988 to  4,643 GWh  in 1996;  requiring an  average annual
increase in gross energy generation of 7.32. To meet the projected demand,
CEB's total investment for the period 1987-1996 is estimated at about
Rs 53,550 million in 1987 prices (about Rs 69,400 million in current prices).
About 60X of the planned investment would be for the expansion of CEB's
generation capacity, 10 for extension and reinforcement of the transmission
system, and 301 for distribution. The size and mix of the investment program
is considered to be sound in view of the past investment levels in each area.

Financing Plan
4.11    Significant changes are envisaged in the financing structure of CEB's
future investment if CEB continues its practice of meeting the entire local
costs of the investment program from internal resource generation. 1/ This
is primarily due to the projected sharp drop in government equity financing
as most of the planned generation projects will be undertaken directly by
CEB, rather than by GOSL and transferred to CEB upon completion like the
hydropower components  constructed under  the  AMP.   If  CEB  achieves  this
self-financing level, its investment for 1987-1996 would be financed as
follows:
Table 4.3: CEB : FINANCING PLAN 1987-1996

the proposed Project.
1/ With the exceptions of the local costs of che rural electrification
project which is financed by government equity, and the US$4.5 million
local cost financing provided by IDA under the proposed Project. The
impact of possible local cost financing up to US$6 million by the
cofinancier (para. 3.05) on the projected financing structure for
CEB's planned investment program would be very small.



-29-
Borrowings would cover about 511 of the total financing requirements (912 of
the foreign costs), while CEB would provide about 34Z of the total investment
financing with funds generated internally. In view of CEB's and COSL's
recent success in obtaining suppliers' credit and bilateral financing, it is
expected that  foreign loans  would be  secured in  a  timely  manner.   With
respect to the provision of counterpart funds, financial projections indicate
that, following the 19Z tariff increase introduced on January 1, 1988,
average annual tariff increases of about 12Z in nominal terms (61 in real
terms) would be required for 1989 and 1990 to enable CEB to achieve the
projected self-financing level and at the same time maintain the required
liquidity. To ensure adequate resource mobilization within the power subsec-
tor, thereby reducing CEB's dependence on the government budget for invest-
ment financing, it is expected that GOSL would continue to support CEB's
local  cost   self-financing  objective   by  authorizing   necessary  tariff
increases, and agreement has been reached with GOSL/CEB during negotiations
in this respect (para. 4.12). Due to high levels of self-financing require-
ments for the five years 1987 through 1991, CEB's cash balance accumulated in
previous years is projected to be drawn down very rapidly and to approach a
minimum level equal to two months of cash operating expenditure in 1989-1991
despite the projected tariff increases. To provide some relief to this
temporary difficulty, IDA would provide local cost financing of US$4.5 mil-
lion under the proposed Project.
Financial Projections
4.12    Based on the  sales growth, investment level  and financing plan dis-
cussed above and other assumptions set out in Annex 4.3, CEB's pro forma
financial statements for 1987 through 1996 have been prepared and are given
in Annex 4.2. The key financial data are summarized in the following table:

The financial projections indicate that, given the assumed tariff increases,
CEB would continue to produce satisfactory financial results during the
forecast period. The rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in use
would be not less than 82. Cash flow from operations develops strongly and
debt service is covered a minimum of 1.5 times throughout the period.
Despite the build up of long-term debt, CEB would remain satisfactorily
capitalized with a debt to equity ratio not greater than 36:64. However,
CEB's future performance is sensitive to the timely adjustment of tariff
levels. To ensure adequate internal resource generation and the financial
viability of CEB, the existing rate of return agreement would be repeated
under the proposed Project. During negotiations COSL/CEB agreed to take all
necessary actions, including tariff increases, to enable CEB to achieve a
minimum annual rate of return on the current value of its average net fixed
assets employed of 8.01 (para 6.02(a)). Also, in order to ensure that CEB's
debt service coverage would remain satisfactory, CEB agreed to consult the
Association before incurring new debt which would cause its gross internal
cash generation to fall below 1.5 times the debt service requirement (para
6.03(f)).



-31-
D. Other Matters
Accounts Receivable
4.13    A high level of  accounts receivable has long  been recognized as the
weak aspect of CEB's cash flow management. Under the Fifth Power Project,
CEB was required to ensure that its accounts receivable would not exceed
three months' billings.   This requirement has  been retained under  the sub-
sequent power  projects financed  by the  Bank Group.   Up to  1985, accounts
receivable bad  continually exceeded  the covenanted  level.   In  1985,  CEB
initiated a number of measures to reduce accounts receivable. In addition,
in September 1985, GOSL assumed responsibiLity for the payment of arrears and
future accounts for street lighting. As a result, total accounts receivable
declined from 5.4 months' billings at December 31, 1985, to 3.3 months'
billings at December 31, 1986, and were maintained around that level in 1987.
The three categories of consumers which were responsible for most of the
arrears as of December 31, 1987, were: private consumers (431 of total and
2.8 months' billings); corporations (18X of total and 2.2 months' billings);
and local authorities (251 of total and 5.5 months' billings). The institu-
tional reforms under the proposed Project, together with the LECO Phase II
project being financed by ADB (para. 2.04), would address the endemic issue
of high accounts receivable from local authorities.
4.14    A major contributing  factor to CEB's high  level of accounts receiv-
able is the long billing cycle resulting from deficiencies associated with
the existing billing system. At present, about 80Z of CEB's total revenue
from electricity sales comes from about 5,000 heavy supply consumers, for
whom bills are prepared manually at the two regional offices based on read-
ings collected in the areas.   For the rest of  the consumers, meter readings
taken in each area are manually collated at divisional offices and then
mailed to the headquarters in Colombo for input into the computer. Since the
installation of the billing computer in 1983, CEB has not yet hired a
qualified  computer  programmer  and  a   data  processing  specialist.   The
efficiency of the billing function could be improved and the time from meter
reading to billing significantly shortened by decentralizing the billing
activity  to  the  divisional  level.   During  negotiations  CEB  agreed  to
initiate by December 31, 1988 the implementation of a program for the com-
puterization of its billing system at the divisional level and upgrading of
its management information system; to employ consultants to assist in the
design, procurement and installation of the billing system and to provide
staff training under terms of reference as agreed with IDA during nego-
tiations (para 6.03(e)).
4.15    The decentralization of the billing  function to the divisional level
and CEB's take over of local authorities' distribution systems are expected
to reduce accounts receivable to the covenanted level. In order to ensure
that accounts receivable are consistently maintained at a minimum level so
that funds can be utilized in a most efficient manner, the covenant for



-32-
accounts receivable agreed under previous projects would be retained under
the proposed Project. During negotiations GOSL/CEB agreed to take necessary
actions so that by December 31, 1988, CEB's overall accounts receivable for
electricity   supplied    would   not    exceed   three    months'   billings
(para. 6.02(b)).
Tariff Study
4.16    Despite the important revisions made to CEB's tariff structure in the
1980s (para. 1.08), it does not totally conform to the costs incurred in
CEB's supply system when meeting the demands of the various consumer groups.
The principal deficiencies are its failure to signal the substantial dif-
ference in peak/off-peak costs, which exacerbates the continuing needle peak
problem, and the failure of the bulk supply tariff for licensees to reflect
the marginal costs of meeting their demand. In 1985, CEB introduced an
optional  time-of-day  tariff  for  some   hotel  and  industrial  consumers.
However, its effect was to reduce the monthly bills of consumers who opted
for it without giving any incentive for them to reduce their peak demands.
The tariff for supplies to licensees is designed to enable them to charge the
same rates to their residential consumers as CEB charges. Consequently the
tariff does not inform licensees of CEB's supply costs. In addition, the
demand forecast (para. 5.2) indicates that sales to residential consumers
will become relatively more important during 1988-2002. Unless effective
load management action is taken, the projected change in sales to the dif-
ferent groups will reduce the system load factor and increase CEB's capacity
requirements. At present, CEB's data base on consumer characteristics is
inadequate for the formulation of appropriate load management measures. To
assist CEB in identifying such measures and reforming its tariff structure to
better reflect the costs of supplying different loads, GOSLCEB agreed during
negotiations to complete, with the assistance of consultants, a tariff and
load management study by October 31, 1989 under terms of reference as agreed
with IDA, review the results of said  study with IDA upon its completion, and
thereafter implement such recommendations as would be agreed by COSL/CEB and
IDA. (para. 6.02(c)).
Transfer of Licensees' Assets t' CEB
4.17    The assets and liabilities (mainly arrears to CEB) of those licensees
whose distribution systems are to be taken over by CEB must be reflected in
CEB's accounts. Although the assets have some value, it will typically be
very low due to inadequate maintenance expenditures. Most licensees to be
taken over will have large accounts payable to CEB, which they would have no
incentive to settle following relinquishment of the power distribution func-
tion. This issue must be addressed in the context of Sri Lanka's legal
system/conventions which, for example, preclude licensees being given shares
in CEB. The appraisal mission discussed with GOSL/CEB the alternative ways
in which this issue could be addressed. The mission was informed that most
of licensees' assets had been financed out of either Decentralized Budget



-33-
Funds from GOSL or by GOSL grants to Distriet Dedelefment Councils/Pradeshiya
Sabas, neither of which was repayable to GOR-.  Coniequeaitly, the transfer of
assets to CEB would in essence involve COSL taking )ack assets which had been
financed on a grant basis and vesting them in another institution owned by
GOSL. Based on the analysis of the financing of licensees' assets, it was
agreed that assets employed by licensees would be vested in the CEB on the
transfer date free of any compensation payments. Further, licensees would
settle all outstanding liabilities up to the transfer date including the
charges for the bulk supply of electricity by CEB. However, all liabilities
falling due after the transfer date would be borne by CEB, and CEB would then
assume responsibility for the collection of accounts payable for electricity
supplies.   CEB  wou'd  be   authorized  to  disconnect   consumers  for  the
non-payment of arrears  due to licensees.   The total of  such dues  would be
credited against the balance of licensees' accounts payable to CEB for the
bulk supply  of electricity.   Any bad  debts would  be born  by CEB.   These
arrangements are considered to be acceptable to the Association.

V. PROJECT JUSTIPICATION
A. Electricity Demand Forecast
5.01    Total electricity  sales increased  at average  annual rates  of 6.0Z
during 1973-78 and 8.52 during 1978-86 (Annex 2.4). A significant change
occurred in the percentage shares of sales accounted for by CEB's major
consumer groups in the latter period. Annex 2.4 shows that sales to residen-
tial consumers increased as a share of total sales from 9.62 in 1976 to 16.5Z
in 1986, while the share of sales to industrial consumers decreased from
about 52Z to 41.41 during the same period. The increase in sales during
1978-86 was driven by the increase in the number of new connections. The
total number of consumers served by CEB increased by about 152 a year in
1978-86, representing a doubling of the number of consumers in less than five
years. CEB's sales in 1987 were depressed partly because of the extensive
power cuts which were made necessary by the below average rainfall and low
water levels at the main hydropower plants and partly by the closure of
cement plants in the troubled areas of the country.
5.02    The load forecast for  1988-2002 is given in  Table 5.1 and in detail
in Annex 5.1. CEB's total energy sales are forecast to increase at 7.8Z a
year, while energy generated is forecast to increase at the slightly lower
rate of 7.51 a year due to the projected decline in CEB's gross system losses
from about 15.92 in 1986 to about 122 in 1992 and thereafter. Total elec-
tricity sales are projected to be about 7,300 CWh in the year 2002, peak
demand to be 1,634 KW and total generation to be about 8,300 GIh.

The sales forecast incorporates the increased sales projected to follow from
the improvement in the reliability and quality of electricity supply and the
reduction in non-technical losses in areas covered by the proposed Project.
The  Bank's   general  experience   with  loss   reduction   projects   where
non-technical losses are relatively high and the quality of supply is low. is
that the reduction in losses is accompanied by substantial increases in
electricity sales.   In addition,  the load  forecast reflects  the projected
continuing high rate of connections by CEB, which averaged nearly 43,000 a
year during 1983-86 and is projected to be about 46,200 a year in the period
1987-1992 excluding new accounts to be taken over from licensees under the
proposed Project. Significant changes are forecast to occur in the relative
shares of bulk sales by CEB to LECO and other licensees. Purchases by LECO
are expected to increase from 3.6Z of total sales in 1986 to about 13% in
1992, largely as a result of its takeover of local authority areas. Sales to
other licensees decline from 21% of total sales in 1986 to 3% in 2002 because
of the transfer of licensees to CEB and LECO.
B. Least Cost Alternative
5.03    CEB  prepared the  proposed Project  to rehabilitate  and expand  the
distribution systems to be taken over from licensees and to extend its trans-
mission system to meet the forecast demand for electricity at least cost.
The assumptions used, methodology and result for each component of the
Project have been reviewed and found to be satisfactory to the Association.
C. Economic Internal Rate of Return
5.04    Although  the Project  is expected  to play  a crucial  role  in  the
optimal development and operation of the power subsector, its benefits to
consumers caniot be separated from those of other least-cost generation,
transmission and distribution development programs and institutional improve-
ments. In these circumstances, having established that the transmission and
distribution components are part of CEB's least-cost expansion program, it is
appropriate to carry out the cost-benefit analysis on CEB's entire program to
ensure that it is justified. For this purpose a "time-slice" of CEB's
investment programs for generation, transmission and distribution for the
period 1988-2002 has  been analyzed.   Capital costs  for these  programs are
shown in Annex 5.3.   All costs were  expressed in terms  of their equivalent
border values.   A minimum  measure of  the benefits  associated  with  these
programs is given by incremental sales revenue. In January 1988, the average
tariff revenue was Rs 1.76/kWh. CEB recovers the costs of thermal generation
through a fuel adjustment charge (Table 4.1), which was set equal to zero in
the average tariff revenue of Rs 1.76/kWh. The rate of return analysis
assumes that fuel costs of thermal plants will continue to be recovered



-36-
through the fuel adjustment charge. 1/ On this basis, the rate of return is
estimated to be  7.7% (Annex 5.3), which  is less  than the  estimated oppor-
tunity cost of capital of 10% and indicates that tariffs are currently less
than long run marginal costs (para. 1.08).
5.05    The  foregoing revenue-based  measure of  rate of  return is,  by its
nature, more a measure of the adequacy of tariffs than of the true economic
merit of  the investment  program which  includes  the  Project.   Since  the
Project will confer benefits in excess of those aeasured by incremental
revenue 7.71 is a lower bound estimate.
5.06    A better measure of the rate  of return can be obtained by estimating
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the incremental electricity sales. A
conservative estimate of WTP was made as follows: for residential consumers
and street lighting, it was the weighted average tariff rate for incremental
consumption in the respective tariff categories, while for industrial and
commercial consumers, it was the incremental operating cost of captive diesel
plant (in 1986 these consumers had a total installed capacity of about 25
MW). This gave a weighted average WTP of Rs 2.95/kWh. On this basis, the
EIRR is estimated to be about 12%.   However, it should be stressed that this
is still only a partial measure of EIRR. The use of the weighted average
tariff rates of incremental consumption in the residential and street light-
ing categories means that WTP is underestimated since it generally excludes
any measures of consumers' surplus. In addition, no allowance has been made
for consumers' WTP for the improved reliability and quality of electricity
supply.
D. Justification for Bank Group Involvement
5.07     In  addition   to  providing   additional  transmission/distribution
capacity to meet projected load at least cost, the proposed Project would,
through IDA's involvement:
(a) assist GOSL in evolving an institutional framework in which the power
system can be developed, operated and  maintained in an efficient and
reliable way;
(b) improve the efficient use of resources by reducing power system
losses;
1/  Annual fuel costs for the period 1988-2002 were estimated using the
WASP III planning model. The average fuel cost per kWh would be
recouped through the fuel adjustment charge. Consequently, the cost
and revenue effects of using thermal plants would exactly offset each
other.



-37-
(c) rationalize the  consumption of energy  through the setting  of elec-
tricity tariff rates in relation to the costs to the economy of
meeting consumers' demands for electricity;
(d) facilitate the  further institutional strengthening  of CEB  with the
computerization of  its billing  system and  training staff  in  com-
puterized accounts and engineering; and
(e) ensure  that the  Kalu Ganga  Multipurpose Project  feasibility study
appropriately addresses environmental and resettlement issues.



-38-
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01    During negotiations, GOSL agreed:
(a) to carry out, or cause to be carried out, a program satisfactory to
the Association, for the redeployment and retirement of licensees'
staff not offered employment by CEB (para. 2.09); and
(b) to submit to the Association the auditors' report on withdrawals made
from the Project Account, including the Special Account, within six
months from the end of the fiscal year under consideration (para.
4.03).
6.02    During negotiations, GOSL/CEB agreed:
(a) that all necessary actio-s, including tariff increases, would be
taken to enable CEB to achieve a minimum annual rate of return on the
current value of its average net fixed assets employed of 8.0%
(para. 4.12);
(b) that by December 31, 1988, CEB's overall accounts receivable for
electricity  supplied  would   not  exceed  three   months'  billings
(para. 4.15); and
(c) to complete, with the assistance of consultants, a tariff and load
management study by October 31, 1989 under terms of reference accept-
able to the Association, review the completed study with the Associa-
tion, and thereafter implement such recommendations as would be
agreed by GOSL/CEB and the Association (para. 4.16).
6.03    During negotiations, CEB agreed:
(a) to implement a dated program satisfactory to the Association to
retrain licensees' staff transferred to CEB (para. 2.10);
(b) the terms of reference for consultants, except for the Kalu Ganga
Multipurpose Project feasibility study, to be financed by the
Association under the Project (para. 3.07);
(c) to submit to the Association its unaudited accounts within four
months from the end of the fiscal year under consideration and its
audited accounts accompanied by the Auditor's report within ten
months (para. 4.03);
(d) to deposit its annual provision to the insurance reserve into the
insurance escrow account within eleven months of the end of the
fiscal year (para. 4.05);



-39-
(e) to initiate by December 31, 1988 the implementation of a program for
the computerization of its billing system at the divisional level and
upgrading  of  its  management   information  system,  including  the
appointment of consultants to assist CEB in the design, procurement
and installation of the billing system and to provide staff training
under terms of reference and with qualifications and selection
methods satisfactory to the Association (para. 4.14); and
(f) to consult with the Association before incurring new debt which would
cause its gross internal cash generation to fall below 1.5 times the
debt service requirement (para. 4.12).
6.04    The following conditions would be  conditions of effectiveness of the
Credit:
(a) The passage of legislation acceptable to the Association authorizing
CEB to take over licensees' electricity distribution systems. The
legislation would specify the arrangements to be made for the trans-
fer of licensees' assets to the CEB, including the valuation of those
assets, compensation to be paid to licensees, treatment of licensees'
accounts payable to CEB, treatment of licensees' staff, and the
criteria to be used in selecting licensee distribution systems to be
taken over by CEB (para. 2.05); and
(b) The conclusion of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between GOSL and CEB,
under  terms   and   conditions   acceptable   to   the   Association
(para. 3.06).
6.05    Subject to the above conditions, the proposed Project is suitable for
the Association financing of SDR 29.2 million (US$40.5 million equivalent).

POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
ANALYSIS OF LICENSERS' DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
1.      The local authorities  licensed to distribute  electricity are spread
all over the island with a certain concentration in the South West and in the
center of the island, as well as along the East coast and on the Jaffna
peninsula. Originally 217 licensees were registered by the Electrical
Inspector, out of which 12 have been taken over by the Lanka Electricity
Company (LECO), and a further 21 are to be handed over to LECO within the
next four years. These 33 areas stretch along the Western and South-Western
coastal belt of the island near Colombo.
2.      Sizes of the Licensees' Systems.  The size distribution of the licen-
sees' systems in terms of maximum demand are shown in Table 1. The average
demand per consumer in the licensees' systems is 340 VA and this value varies
only sightly in  the individual networks  (mostly in the  range of         IO- 10Z).
The average consumption per consumer is about 900 kWH per year.

Above   3,000 kVA              6                       3
3.      System Losses.  The losses in the licensees' systems have been calcu-
lated as the difference between the units sold b) _EB and the units billed by
the  local  authorities.   Thus   the  losses  include   both  technical  and
non-technical losses, such  as unmetered consumption,  theft, etc.   Based on
data received from a sample of 95  licensees, the levels of system losses are
as shown in Table 2.

4.      Physical State  of the  Distribution Networks.  The high  losses are
largely the result of the poor physical state of the L.V. networks. This is
reflected by the following:
(a) L.V. Switchgear--Almost no circuit breakers are installed, fuses are
missing and bridged with wires;
(b) L.V. Cable-The cable between the L.V. cubicle and the first pole has
been burnt and replaced by several single core PVC cables suspended
between pole and cubicle mostly without outer protection;
(c) Line Supports--Most concrete poles are damaged and reinforcement iron
work is exposed to air and corroded especially in areas close to the
sea. Concrete poles refused by CEB due to their quality appear to
have been sold to the Local  Authcrities.  Wood poles are infected by
insects and show cracks due to exposure to weather and ageing;
(d) Conductors and Accessories--Aluminium conductors are generally in
good condition in suburban areas. However, in some commercial cen-
ters the conductors have been overloaded and show excessive sags with
wooden spacers being used to prevent the conductors from touching
each other in strong winds. Copper No. 8 and copper No. 6 conductors
have been used in old town networks for main lines. These conductors
are too inadequate for the growing load and have to be replaced. In
most cases no current clamps have been used for jumpers and cable
connections, resulting in overheating of conductors and excessive
losses;



-43-
ANNEX 1.2
Page 3 of 5
(e) House Connections--In more than two-thirds of all service connec-
tions, clamps need to be fixed to replace the present practice of
winding the wire round the cosiductors. Long PVC service connections
with poles along the street must be replaced by OH lines. PVC con-
ductors, meters, fuses and burnt meter boards need replacement;
(f) Underground Cables--A great percentage of the underground cables in
municipalities are old and should be replaced before their final
breakdown;
(g) Transformer Stations--In several cases CEB has refused to augment
substation capacity unless the arrears of accounts payable for the
supply of energy are settled. Hence most systems require either
substation augmentation or new S.S. injection; and
(h) M.V. Distribution Networks--Only few municipalities have 3.3 kV or
6.6 kV distribution networks. These installations should be replaced
by 11 kV equipmeL.
5.      Financial Situation
(a) Tariffs. New tariff rates for supplies to licensees were introduced
by CEB on January 1, 1988. The licensees' new tariffs are not pub-
lished yet. Since January 1, 1988, the tariffs of CEB and LECO to
retail consumers are identical. In 1987 the tariffs of the local
authorities were all higher than those of CEB (sometimes by as much
as 30X). On average, local authorities' tariffs are about 202 higher
than CEB's retail tariff.
(b) Operating Profit/Loss. None of the licensees made provision for
depreciation and the profit/loss situation of a sample of 100 licen-
sees checked is as follows:

Total                        100                  100
It can be seen that even without depreciation provision, 65% of the
licensees operate at a financial loss.
(c) Consumer  Arrears.   Consumer  arrears  of  those  licensees  studied
measured in terms of number of months billings are given in Table 4.
The table shows that many licensees have excessive accounts receiv-
able from consumers, part of which are considered bad debts.

POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Staffing Implications of CEB's Takeover of Licensees
The number of local authority staff likely to be affected by CEB's
takeover of licensees' distribution systems and the proposed arrangements for
the redeployment of those staff are shown in the table below. With respect
to all employees of a former licensee employed exclusively in the electrical
undertakings carried out by that licensee, CEB would, within three months of
the takeover of the licensee's system, determine whether such employees would
be offered employment by CEB. For those offered employment the terms of
remuneration would be not less than what they had received from the former
licensee. It was noted that about 601 of the affected staff are expected to
be offered employment by CEB, and that about 81 would be offered alternative
employment by the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction.
All staff leaving the Local Authority service (including those joining the
CEB) would either:
(i) be given early retirement with a pension as would have been awarded
had the employee been retired on grounds of abolition of office on
the date when the licensee was taken over, providing that on that
date the employee had not less than 10 years' pensionable service; or
(ii) if the employee has less than 10 years' pensionable service, be
eligible for an award under the Local Government Service Pension
Regulations 1975 or any rule, regulation or by-law of the former
licensee relating to pensions, etc., as would have been awarded to
the employee on the grounds of abolition of office; or
(iii) be eligible for any payment due under any provident fund to which the
employee was a contributor, such as the Employees' Provident Fund,
the local Service Provident Fund, etc., as if the employee had left
the foritr licensees' service on the grounds other than dismissal.
Items (i) and (iii) would be met from the respective pension schemes
and funds while item (ii) would be financed by the project. In addition, a
further award would be payable to those employees who are not absored by the
CEB. These payments would also be funded by the project. The method of
computation of each redundancy payment would be worked out in consultation
with the Ministry of Local Government.

Note:  1.  Trade tests and interviews will be conducted to ascertain suitability of staff
for absorption by CEB. Based on these these tests and interviews appropriate
grade will be assigned to each person to be absorbed by CEB.
2. All staff taken over by CEB will be given full time training courses of about
3 months for technical personnel and short duration courses for non-technical
personnel.
3. Such staff as could be absorbed by the local authorities in carrying out their
other functions will be retained while some will be relocated to other local
authorities. (This will include the major portion of the clerical staff.)
4. Redundancy payments are included in project costs.

POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Distribution
1.      The  distribution component  of the  Project  would  consist  of  the
financing of a five-year time-slice of CEB's expenditures to rehabilitate,
develop and expand the distribution systems to be taken over from local
authorities all over the country (see Map IBRD 20860). CEB estimates are
that it will be rehabilitating distribution schemes that serve about 180,000
consumers. The project is expected to include,
-   the construction of about 600 km  of new medium-voltage lines and 900
km of new low-voltage lines;
-   the reconductoring of  700 km and  the rehabilitation of  1,500 km of
low-voltage lines;
-   the installation of 650 distribution substations;
-   the rehabilitation of about 70,000 service connections;
-   the replacement  of 90,000 meters,  augmentation and  improvements in
700 distribution substations; and
B.  Transmission
2.      The transmission component of  the Project comprises the construction
of about 230 km of 132-kV lines, the reconductoring if about 150 km of 132-kV
lines, the construction of new substations and the augmentation of existing
ones (see Map IBRD 10551). The new transmission lines will be double circuit
with single  175 mm   ACSR conductor  (Lynx) and  7/3.25 mm2  earthwire.  The
towers will be self-supporting broad based lattice towers with the two cir-
cuits in a vertical formation, with at least 15 m of clearance from the
lowest conductor to the ground. The ground clearance of the lowest conductor
point will  be at  least about  7 meters.   The following  132-kV  lines  are
included in the Project:
-   in and out of Polpitiya-Anuradhapura 132-kV line I at Ukuwela Substa-
tion
-   Anuradhapura-Mannar (72 km)
-   Kankesanthurai-Chunnakam (9 km)

ANNEX 3.1
Page 2 of 2
-   Puttalam-Anuradhapura (80 km)
-   Embilipitiya-Matara (62 km)
- Reconductoring of 150 km of 132-kV lines.
3.      The grid substations will be 132/33kV single bus bar grid substations
with two 132-kV feeder bays, two 2 x 20 MVA transformer bays and six 33-kV
outgoing feeder  bays.  The  132-kV switch  bay will  be comprised  of  1250A
disconnectors and 1250A SF6 circuit breakers  with 25kA fault level and coup-
ling of the two bays through 1250A disconnectors.  The 33-kV switch bays will
be comprised of  1400A SF6 circuit  breakers for  transformers and  630A 25kA
fault level circuit breakers for feeders and bus coupling through 1600A
disconnectors. The following protection will be provided for: distance and
directional protection, over current, bus zone, sensitive earth fault,
restricted earth fault, and transformer biased differential protection.
Earthing will be by solidly earthing or earthing through resistors.
4.      The following new substations will be constructed:
-   Mannar
-   Kankesanthurai
-   Matara
The existing substations at Ukuwela,  Kilinochchi, Anuradhapura, and Puttalam
will be augmented by the additions of new bays.

derived from energy balance projections as
per 70X probability of hydrological condition
and the 1986 fuel cost per unit of thermal
power escalated by Bank's projections of MUV
index.
6.   Administration Costs:    : assumed to increase by 10% p.a.
7.   Depreciation              : equal to 3%  of average gross fixed assets in

ing income before depreciation less interest
charges,  depreciation   allowance  and   tax
losses  carried  forward  from  the  previous
year; annual depreciation allowance is 12.5Z
for assets commissioned during 1981-1986 and

ASSUMPTIONS
1.      Total  local authority  customers in  1987 was  400,000.   Of  these,
50,000 were token over in LECO I, with another 70,000 expected to be
taken over in PHASE II.
2.      During PHASE II (1998-1991) LECO Lill also take over 16,000 customers
from CEB. The total number of LECO customers will reach 200,000 in
1991, including new connections.
3.      Excluding LECO I and II customers, there were 275,000 local authority
customers in 1987, who will be allocated between CEB and the remain-
ing licensees in the ratio 75X:25Z.
4.      To account for distribution losses  in local authority systems, sales
to customers taken  over by CEB  have been  reduced by  102; existing
losses of 25  are  estimated to decline to  102 due to rehabilitation
measures, with technical losses  expected to fall from  IOZ to 5X and
non-technical losses  from 152  to 5Z.   In estimating  CEB sales  to
former local authority customers, a 72 increase in sales is assumed
to account for improved reliability and lower non-technical losses.
S.      Customers transferred from local authorities  to CEB are allocated to
customer  categories  based  on   the  1985  LECO   survey  of  Local
Authorities.
6.      Tariffs will reflect long run  marginal costs over the entire period.
Moderate efforts towards energy conservation will be maintained in
all sectors.
7.      Shifts in  the relative  composition of  industry towards  medium and
small sized organizations will continue.
8.      LECO  sales figures  from ADB  Appraisal  Report  of  November  1987,
adjusted for IDA assumptions for GDP growth and loss reduction.
9.      GDP growth rates  of 3.22 and 5.1X  in 1987 and 1988,  and 5  for the
rest of the forecast period.

POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Economic Internal Rate of Return
As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an
integral part of CEB's least cost expansion plan and, therefore, cost-
benefit analysis needs to be carried out on the whole plan rather than on
the  project  in isolation.    CEB's  investment  program  for  the  period
1988-2002 has,  therefore,  been analyzed.   Incremental  capital  costs,
operation and maintenance costs, and benefit streams (all in terms of
early 1988 prices), are shown in Table 1.  Assumptions underlying these
figures are detailed below.
Capital Costs
Anticipated  capital  expenditure  on  generation  (from  the
WASP-III generation planning model), transmission and distribution at
financial prices was converted to economic prices by: (i) expressing the
import content at c.i.f. prices; (ii) valuing unskilled labor at 0.80 of
the market wage rate; and (iii) applying the estimated standard
conversion factor of 0.75 to local costs.
Operation and Maintenance
Annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were estimated as
the following percentages of cumulative capital costs:  generating plant,
2%; transmission,  2%; distribution,  3%; and other,  5%.   To vaLue O&M
costs in economic terms, the distribution of costs was assumed as
follows: foreign, 10%; local, 40%; and local unskilled Labour, 50%.
Benefits
Benefits in the base case were estimated initially in terms of
revenue using the average revenue per kWh in early 1988.  The forecast
allows for the impact of the projected reduction in system losses in
accordance with the targets given in para. 2.14. The average revenue of
Rs 1.76/kWh in 1988 was taken to represent the weighted average tariff
rate defined over existing tariffs.   Projected fuel costs for thermal
generation were assumed to be recouped through the fuel adjustment charge
in the tariff, in line with CEB's tariff policy. On this basis, and with
costs measured in economic terms, the rate of return is about 8%.  The
costs and benefit streams from the base case (using average revenue as
the sole measure of benefits) are shown in Table 1.

The foregoing rate of return is not based on estimates of
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for etectricity.   It is thus more a
measure of the adequacy of tariffs than of the worth of the proposed
Project.   A better measure of the rate of return can be obtained by
estimating consumers' WTP for the incremental electricity sales. A lower
bound estimate of WTP was derived as follows: for residential consumers
and for street lighting, it was the weighted average tariff rate for
incremental  consumption  in  the  respective  tariff  categories.    For
consumers in the industrial, commercial, and hotel tariff categories, WTP
was measured in terms of the incremental operating costs of meeting their
demands for electricity using auto-generators which are displaced by the
public supply of electricity.   Calculated on this basis, the weighted
average WTP for all-consumer groups is Rs 2.95/kWh. The economic rate of
return (EIRR) on this basis is about 12.0%.  It should be stressed that
this is only a partial measure of EIRI, since the use of the weighted
average tariff rate for incremental consumption in the residential and
street  Lighting  tariff  categoiries  means  that  WTP  is  generally
underestimated since no allowance is made for consumers' surplus in these
categories. In addition, the measure assumes that consumers' WTP for the
improved reliability and quality of electricity supply is zero.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming a 10Z reduction
in WTP, a 10 increase in capital costs, and variations in projected
sales by '102 and -102. The results are summarized in Table 2.
