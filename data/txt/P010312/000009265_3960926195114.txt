MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SRI LANKA
FOR A POWER DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.      The following  report on a  proposed development credit  to Sri Lanka
for SDR 29.2 million (US$40.5 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with
40 years maturity is submitted for  approval.  The proposed credit would help
to finance a power distribution and transmission project. The Government of
Sri Lanka is seeking cofinancing for SDR 22.3 million (US$31.0 million equiv-
alent) for the transmission component of the proposed project.
2.      Background.  The efficient  operation and development  of Sri Lanka's
power subsector has been impeded by the fragmentation of responsibility for
electricity supply among CEB, Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Ltd. (LECO)
and about 210 licensees (local authorities). Many licensees' distribution
systems face serious problems, including high system losses, unreliable and
poor quality of supply, high accounts payable to CEB (averaging 5.5 months'
billing in 1987), and shortages of competent staff. In 1980 GOSL deferred a
proposal for CEB to take over all licensees' systems because of CEB's own
institutional weaknesses. In 1983, as an interim measure, LECO was estab-
lished to  take over  some licensees.   GOSL now  plans to  address the  poor
performance of licensees by transferring about one-third of their consumers
to CEB (which is now institutionally stronger) and one-third to LECO, leaving
one-third with  the more  efficient licensees.   The  project's  distribution
component would support CEB's adoption of about 180,000 consumers currently
served by about 130 licensees. The transmission component is part of CEB's
least-cost expansion plan, while the feasibility study for the Kalu Ganga
Multipurpose Project would plan the optimal mix of hydropower generation and
other developments in Sri Lanka's only major river basin for which a com-
prehensive development plan has not yet been prepared.
3.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has supported nine power projects
to help Sri Lanka develop an efficient power subsec._or. The project would
complement Power IX (Credit 1736-CE), which addresses energy conservation and
resource use efficiency issues through the reduction of system losses in
CEB's distribution system and is assisting in the institutional strengthening
of CEB.  The priority now is to  address those issues in licensees' distribu-
tion systems and to reform the institutional arrangements for power distribu-
tion. IDA's involvement in the project would support speedy, effective
implementation of COSL's reform program, which is justified to reduce the
waste of resources associated with high system losses--often exceeding
20%--and to address the endemic problem of high accounts payable by licensees
to CEB. It would also facilitate CEB's further institutional strengthening
and ensure that the Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Project feasibility study
appropriately addresses environmental and resettlement issues.



-2-
4.      Project  Objectives.  The  project would  support measures  aimed at:
rationalizing the organization of power distribution; rehabilitating and
enpanding distribution systems presently managed by licensees to reduce
system losses and improve the quality of electricity supply; implementing
CEB's least-cost transmission expansion program; strengthening CEB institu-
tionally through the decentralized computerization of its billing system and
training staff in computerized billing and engineering; and improving CEB's
revenue collection  by reducing  accounts  receivable  from  licensees.   The
project would also assist in the optimal development of the land and water
resources of the Kalu Ganga basin.
5.      Project  Description.  The  proposed project  would  consist  of  the
following components: (a) a five-year time-slice of CEB's expenditures to
rehabilitate, develop and expand distribution systems to be taken over from
selected licensees; (b) the construction of about 230 km of 132-kV transmis-
sion lines, the reconductoring of about 150 km of 132-kV transmission lines
and the construction and augmentation of related substations; (c) consulting
services to: (i) develop a decentralized computerized billing system and a
management information system; (ii) assist CEB in the preparation of the
detailed specifications and design of the 132-kV transmission system in (b)
and preparation of bidding documents for major transmission contracts; (iii)
assist CES in carrying out a tariff study; (iv) assist in the development of
a training program for middle-level technical officers; (v) assist in the
establishment of a consumer relations unit; and (vi) assist in monitoring the
implementation of systems initiated when CEB was reorganized in 1984; and (d)
undertake a feasibility study for the Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Project. The
project would be implemented over six years. The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$113.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$61.0 million (54%). A breakdown of costs aad the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. The transmission component of the proposed project,
excluding the Anuradhapura-Mannar 132-kV line and the new Mannar grid substa-
tion to be financed by IDA, would be financed by the cofinancier. The timely
implementation of the project components to be financed by IDA is not contin-
gent on satisfactory conclusion of cofinancing arrangements. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million for
expenditures incurred after January 1, 1988 is included. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Sri Lanka are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps highlight-
ing the project  area, IBRD Nos.  20551 and 20860,  are attached.   The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7192-CE dated June 2, 1988 is being distributed
separately.
6.      Agreed Actions.  Agreement  has been reached with  GOSL that it will:
(a) review with IDA the results of the tariff and load management study upon
its completion by October 31, 1989 and thereafter implement the agreed recom-
mendations; (b) carry out a program satisfactory to IDA to redeploy or retire
ex-staff of local authority distribution systems taken over by CEB; (c) take
all necessary actions, including tariff increases, to enable CEB to continue
to earn a minimum rate of return of 8% on the current value of its average



-3-
net fixed assets employed; and (d) pass legislation enabling CEB to take over
licensees' electricity distribution systems, to meet the condition of credit
effectiveness. Further, CEB has agreed to: (a) complete by October 31, 1989
a tariff and load management study under terms of reference as agreed with
IDA during negotiations; (b) initiate by December 31, 1988 the implementation
of a program for the computerization of its billing system at the divisional
level and upgrading of its management information system; (c) implement a
dated program to retrain licensees' staff transferred to CEB; (d) continue
the action program to reduce overall accounts receivable for electricity
supplied to a level not exceeding three months' billings by December 31,
1988; (e) subm-t to IDA its unaudited accounts within four months from the
end of the fiscal year and audited accounts within ten months; (f) deposit
its annual insurance provision into the escrow account within eleven months
of the end of the fiscal year; and (g) consult with the Association before
incurring new debt which would cause its long term debt service coverage to
fall below 1.5 times.
7.      Benefits.  Benefits  would include the  more efficient  operation and
development of the power subsector through its restructuring; resource
savings by reducing power system losses; improved reliability of electricity
supply; and increased subsector revenues and lower operating costs. Other
benefits would include institutional strengthening of CEB through the com-
puterization of its billing system at the divisional level and staff train-
ing. Furthermore, the proposed feasibility study for the Kalu Ganga Multi-
purpose Project would assist in the optimal development of the land and water
resources in the Kalu Ganga basin.   The least cost power development program
of CEB, which includes the proposed project, is expected to have a minimum
quantifiable economic rate of return of 11.7%.
8.      Risks.  Although the proposed  project involves a major institutional
reorganization, no  unusual risks  are foreseen.   The  major  risk  concerns
possible delays in the passage of the legislation enabling CEB to take over
licensees' distribution systems. This risk would be minimized by the passage
of the required legislation before credit effectiveness.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

a/  The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IDA-financed projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
b/  As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment IV), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar
and the SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar
amount greater than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
