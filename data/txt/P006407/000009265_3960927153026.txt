BRAZIL
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE WATER COMPANY OF SAO PAULO (SABESP)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A WATER SECTOR PROJECT IN THE STATE OF SAO PAULO
*       1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
SABESP for US$280 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including five years grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The loan would help finance a
water supply project.
Background
2.       The demand for basic sanitation services in urban areas of Brazil
is now growing faster than supply, and the ability of the sector to meet
the needs for these services over the next several decades iN uncertain in
view of financial constraints and evolving institutional arrangements in
the country. The present national water and sanitation plan
(PLANASA)--implemented by Caixa Economica Federal (CEF), state water
companies (SWCs), and state funds--has provided over 55 million new water
connections since 1970, with investments concentrated on water, as opposed
to waste water disposal, by a ratio of about two to one. However, demand
is outpacing supply because of rapid urbanization and an accelerated
household formation which will add another nine million urban households by
the turn of the century. Meeting national sector goals of 90? coverage in
water supply and 65? in sewerage will require a rate of investment even
greater than in the past. Due to the inter-governmental and fiscal
reforms resulting from the new constitution, starting in 189 the federal
government is allocating greater resources and responsibilities--such as
tariff setting--to states and municipalities while curtailing its own
expenditures and activities in the sector. Although the effects of the
reform on state revenues are not clearly known, this receding federal role
requires state and municipal entities to become more active and efficient
in both resource mobilization and allocation.
3.       More emphasis must thus be placed on the strengthening of sector
financial viability and the institutional capacities of the SWCs, the
state-owned corporations which are concessionaires of a majority of the
municipalities in Brazil. SABESP, the Sao Paulo state water and sewerage
company, is responsible for services in 416 (73%) of the State's
municipalities, covering about 662 of urban population. SABESP has
concentrated its actions in high-density medium-income areas but has not
properly addressed the large service deficits in the peripheral poor areas
of the cities. TI metropolitan area of Sao Paulo has one of the largest
concentrations of irban poor of the country. To be able to expand into
these areas, SABESP must improve its financial, operational, and managerial
performance and has developed an action program for this purpose, which has
been agreed to with the State.



- 2 -
4.       The sanitation sector is regulated by a National Tariff Law (NTL),
which requires tariffs to be set so as to cover all operating costs,
depreciation and a remuneration at least equal to debt service costs.
SABESP is in compliance with the NTL. and thus has satisfactory financial
performance. This will enable the company to genetate about 32Z of the
required funds for the proposed project in contrast to past practice of
near total debt financing.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.       The Bank's assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies
and investments that will encourage economic growth and social development
in the context of macroeconomic stability. Our emphasis is on efficient
resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector and the
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. The
Bank's long-standing involvement with Brazil in the sector provides a
strong basis for such an operation during this current critical period.
Bank involvement in the proposed project would lead--through a cash
generation requirement and the utilization of a Letter of Agreement with
the State on operational and investment goals--to substantial improvements
in operational efficiency and policies regarding the financing of
expansion. Bank participation would also support the development of an
improved pricing structure, better project selection, and the extension of
sewerage services to economically important regions outside the main
metropolitan areas.
Project Objectives
6.       This project would strengthen the capacity of the state water
company to carry out more efficient planning of investments, improved
internal revenue mobilization and increased efficiency of operations, while
covering urgently needed extension of services. Specific objectives are
tos (i) help optimize the allocation of scarce sector resources through
better investment planning and marginal cost analysis and pricing; (ii)
increase SABESP's operational efficiency; (iii) improve environmental and
health conditions in urban areas through water and waste water disposal and
assessment of waste water treatment; (iv) help develop new strategies to
improve the viability of projects with high social importance but low
financial returns as project 3 directed to the poor; and (v) support
government efforts in decentralization by commitment of resources from the
company and from the State.
Project Description
7.       The project would consist of:  (i) selected water supply and
sewerage subprojects; (ii) engineering and consulting services as required
for design and construction supervision; (iii) studies and technical
assistance to strengthen capacities for planning, marginal cost analysis
and pricing, and reductions in costs; (iv) institutional development to
improve operations and maintenance; and tv) domestic waste water pollution
assessment. Parts (i) and (ii) account for 902 of the project cost.
8.       The project covers selected portions representing about 35? of
SABESP's total investment program for the period 1989-1993. Financing for



remaining investments would be provided by the State, CEF and the IDB. The
project provides funds for civil works, equipment, technical assistance,
studies and training amounting to US$600 million equivalent, and with a
foreign exchange component of US$150 million. Compared to past programs,
increased emphasis is given to sewerage works and to small and medium
cities rather than metropolitan areas. Subproject preparation and project
supervision would be carried out mainly by consultants retained by SABESP.
In the past these arrangements have been satisfactory. Project costs and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods and
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of project
processing events and status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. IBRD Map No. 21459 is attached, as is
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7650-BR, dated May 17, 1989.
Actions Agreed
9.       The following was agreed with the State of Sao Paulo:  (i) to
provide US$126 million equity contribution to be disbursed by June 30,
1994; (ii) to undertake legal/administrative actions by December 31, 1990
to enable SABESP to adjust or otherwise compensate for losses due to
overdue bills; (iii) to authorize tariff increases as necessary to enable
SABESP to comply with the NTL. With SABESP, the following was agreedT
*i) to change the annual investment program by no more than 20? without
approval of the Bank; (ii) to reduce average accounts receivable to 70 days
by December 31, 1993; to adjust for inflation (or take other measures to
compensate for financial losses from) overdue bills by December 31, 1990,
and to ensure that bulk supply consumers' receivables do not individually
exceed the agreed annual average; (iii) to comply with the NTL; (iv) to
generate sufficient internal cash to cover annually 32? of total project
costs and that the Letter of Agreement between SABESP and the State of Sao
Paulo, will ensure that the net level of SABESP's internal cash generation
would be equal to a minimum of 20? of the value of SABESP's total
investment program in 1993 and thereafter; (v) that its debt/equity ratio
would not exceed 70130 in 1989, 65/35 in 1990 and 60/40 in 1991 and
thereafter, and its debt service coverage would not fall below 1.5 during
the project period; (vi) to submit to the Bank an updated five-year
financial projection by November 30 annually, including an analysis of
compliance with its self-financing ratio requirement; (vii) to undertake a
study on the valuation of fixed assets to be incorporated into end-year
1990 financial statements and updated every four years; (viii) to achieve
unaccounted-for water level of 222 and a consumers/employee ratio of 235 by
December 31, 1993; (ix) to complete marginal cost pricing study by 1989 and
to implement the agreed  recommendations by December 31, 1990; (x) to
complete by December 31, 1991 a study assessing the degree of treatment for
sewage effluents in the state, the benefits and costs of such a program and
the source of revenues to meet its investment and operational costs; (xi)
that eligibility criteria which are satisfactory to the Bank and which take
into account least cost alternatives and long-run average incremental cost
would be used for project selection; and (xii) to hold with the Bank an
annual review of compliance with the operational targets agreed to in the
Letter of Agreement with the State no later than year-end. Prior to Loan
Effectiveness, SABESP should have signed the Letter of Agreement with the
State. Prior to Loan Disbursement for each subproject, SABESP should
demonstrate evidence of compliance with the agreed subproject selection



- 4 -
criteria. Prior to Loan Disbursement for the subprojects involving the
construction of dams, the Bank should have received: (i) satisfactory
evidence of compliance with Bank guidelines on dam safety; and (ii)
satisfactory reports on the environmental impact, mitigation measures and
relocation plans connected with the construction of dams in the State of
Sao Paulo.
Benefits
10.      The project would help benefit about 6.1 million people with water
and 2.9 million with sewerage in the State. An estimated 2.4 million
people connected to water, and 1.1 million connected to sewerage services
would be at the poverty level. In addition, the project would introduce
improved policies regarding investment financing and operational
efficiency, enhance the efficiency of supply, and ensure a continued
financially viable basis of operations. The internal rate of return is
estimated to be about 122 on a weighted average basis.
Risks
I1.      There are no serious technical risks in the propc ed project.  The
main risks are associated with: (i) the unknown effects of inter-
governmental and financial reforms on the state's revenues, and their
impact on counterpart funds; (ii) the impact of inflation on project costs,
tariff levels and the financial viability of the company; and (iii)
political interference in the setting of tariffs and priorities for
investments. As a result of the fiscal reform, the State of Sao Paulo is
expected to benefit proportionally more than other states, which diminishes
the counterpart fund risk. In 1988 tariffs were raised to adequate levels
in real terms, and the State and SABESP would continue the successful
strategy of frequent small increases to maintain the real value of tariffs.
In addition, close supervision of progress in the Letter of Agreement, the
annual review of investment program and financial situation with the Bank,
and prompt completion of tariff studies would further mitigate these risks.
Recommendation
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of.the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
