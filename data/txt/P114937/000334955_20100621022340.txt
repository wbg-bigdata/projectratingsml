Program Development      The main development objectives of the proposed grant are to: (i) promote
Objectives and           efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources
Contribution to CAS      through improved Public Financial Management (PFM); and (ii) improve
                         specific aspects of the investment climate, including streamlined procedures
                         for business registration and targeted reforms of the legal framework for
                         private investments. The development objectives are consistent with pillars 1
                         (good governance, macroeconomic stability, public administration reform),
                         and 2 (private sector-led growth) of the government's national development
                         program outlined in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). An
                         immediate objective is to protect basic service delivery that remains currently
                         under threat by the negative impact of the global financial crisis on

Risks and risk   In the current environment of the country emerging from conflict, the
mitigation       proposed operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks. The
                 Bank's active engagement in Guinea-Bissau during this period of recovery is
                 a high-risk and potentially high-gain enterprise. The specific risks that could
                 jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of the proposed grant relate to:
                 (i) political and policy slippage; (ii) macroeconomic performance-notably
                 the possible impact of a slower than expected recovery from the global
                  slowdown; and (iii) capacity constraints (human resources, financial and
                 material) and fiduciary risks. The greatest risk in the current situation,
                 however, would be failing to support the stabilization and recovery process
                  and missing a window of opportunity for helping to stabilize a fragile country
                  in an unstable region.

                 The proposed operation seeks to mitigate the above risks in several ways:
                             Reforms supported by the proposed operation have been chosen
                             carefully in the government's own PRSP, among measures that were
                             technically ready (having benefitted from extensive analytical work
                             and proven technical assistance) and politically achievable (having
                             benefitted from numerous consultations with stakeholders and
                             internal governmental discussions). Most measures also build on
                             governments' longstanding commitments towards regional
                             integration in the context of WAEMU and OHADA, which mitigates
                         '   risks of reversibility.
                     0       In addition to public financial management reforms, the operation
                             supports efforts to foster the development of the private sector to
                             rekindle economic growth and achieve visible results for the
                             population.
                     0       The track record of the successive governments in the last couple of
                             years shows that, despite political instability, policy makers are
                         ,   committed to restore and sustain fiscal discipline. Moreover, as the
                             political situation has stabilized over 2009 favoring the consolidation
                             of the new administration, now more than one year in office, the
                             probability of policy slippage is lower.
                             Performance under the IMF EPCA program has been broadly
                             satisfactory. Based on the Guinea- Bissau's performance, the IMF
                             approved in early May 2010 an ECF-supported program for 2010-


                                            vii
                       2012. The government is also committed to a rapid attainment of the
                       HIPC completion point and to adjust the macroeconomic program to
                       address possible exogenous shocks. Given the vulnerability to
                       exogenous shocks and the volatile global environment, the IMF and
                       IDA will continue to closely monitor the government's
                       macroeconomic performance.
                       Continued future donor engagement, in the context of the Fund-
                       supported ECF arrangement, would help support reformers' efforts to
                       sustain fiscal consolidation, a pre-requisite for a broader
                       normalization of public sector performance.
                       The operation has a focused coverage in terms of policy areas and
                       number of reform measures, and it emphasizes building on ongoing
                       initiatives as opposed to introducing new ones. Finally, it relies
                       extensively on Bank and other donors instruments for alleviating
                       capacity constraints.
                       The focus of the proposed grant on the improvement in fiduciary
                       standards and continued IDA and other donors' assistance in public
                       financial management and public administration would help to
                       improve budget execution processes over time.

                    SECOND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT

                                                1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     This program document proposes the second of a programmatic series of two
Economic Governance Reform Grants (EGRGs) for the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. The
first EGRG (EGRG I), in an amount of US$8 million equivalent, was approved by the Board on
June 16, 2009 and disbursed in early September 2009. The series aims to support the
government's efforts to implement the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).'
Specifically, the proposed one-tranche development policy grant (EGRG 11) in the amount of
SDR4 million (US$6 million equivalent) from the pilot IDA Crisis Response Window (CRW),
focuses on reforms that would help promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the
use of public resources (a Public Financial Management, PFM, plank), and foster private sector
development by reducing the up-front costs and uncertainties of business creation and promoting
a level playing field for private investors (a Private Sector Development, PSD, plank). These two
planks are critical components of PRSP pillars one (good governance, macroeconomic stability,
public administration reform) and two (private sector-led growth). The grant is an integral part
of International Development Association IDA'S Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Guinea-Bissau
for FY09/10 which was discussed by the Board on June 15,2009.

1.2     The proposed operation supports the continuation of the selective reform agenda
initiated by the Government in 2009 with the support of the EGRG I. The reform
momentum under both the PFM and the PSD planks has been sustained. The PFM plank aims at
consolidating the setting up of a modern legal framework for public financial management that is
consistent with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) standards, and
promoting compliance with this legal framework through systems, controls and operational
reforms. The PSD plank aims.at consolidating the setting up of a modern legal framework for
private investment and improving the administrative environment for business. Both PFM and
PSD reforms are needed jointly to restore confidence in public policy and institutions and
support macroeconomic stability. The design of the reform program builds on analytical work in
these two areas and leverages activities supported by other IDA-funded instruments, including
Low Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) and State and Peace-building Fund (SPF) grant-
funded operations and the IDA Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project (PSRDP).
The operation also complements support provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB),
Portugal, the European Union (EU), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other donors in
related critical areas.

1.3    Consistent with the ISN for Guinea-Bissau, the operation would provide financial
support to the government whose annual debt service to the World Bank will remain
considerable until attainment of the High Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion
point. Guinea-Bissau's external debt burden remains excessive, at about 127 percent of GDP
(2009), underscoring the importance of debt relief to alleviate the debt overhang. Guinea-Bissau

'The PRSP and accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive
Directors on May 3, 2007. This was the country's first PRSP; a first Progress Report was adopted by the Council of Ministers in
December 2009.
has made progress in meeting the HIPC completion point triggers laid out in the HIPC decision
point document (the country reached the decision point in December 2000), but, until recently,
the country has been unable to sustain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework under the IMF
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for 2000-03 (see Box 3.1 and Annex 6 detailing
the status of implementation of the HIPC triggers). With broadly satisfactory performance under
the 2009 Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) making a transition to a medium-term
program a feasible option, the government requested, and the IMF Board approved in May 2010
three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Good performance under an ECF-
supported program would advance the country towards the HIPC completion point. In this
context, the ISN proposed a programmatic series of two development policy operations as
stepping stones on the path towards the completion point. The series' focus is on a platform of
critical reforms in PFM and PSD, with this proposed second operation building on progress
achieved under the first one. Since Guinea-Bissau is in a situation of debt distress, IDA
resources are provided on grant terms, per the stipulations of the grant allocation system agreed
with IDA donors for the IDA 15 period (FY09-FY11). Nonetheless, the recent improvement
remains fragile, with continued risks arising from the lingering negative effects of the global
crisis on the Bissau-Guinean economy and particularly i,n government revenues. The worldwide
economic slowdown has been transmitted to the country mainly through export and remittances
channels. Lower world prices for cashews, the predominant export, and lower remittances from
abroad, reduced nominal economic income and government revenues in 2009. This said,
Guinea-Bissau has so far weathered the effects of the global crisis better than originally feared.
The government took early measures in 2009 in tax collection and expenditure controls to keep
the fiscal stance on a stable track, and it has committed to doing the same in 2010. However, the
space for additional adjustments on the revenue and expenditure sides is limited. Further
improvements in revenue collection depend in large part on the recovery of economic activity
while additional spending cuts would put under risk the already limited provision of basic
services which could affect disproportionately the poor, the main users of these services. In this
regard, the proceeds from this proposed operation financed by the CRW would help the
government to secure core services delivery benefiting the poor.

1.4     Despite recent progress on the political, economic and structural front, and more
favorable prospects for reaching the HIPC completion point, the country will continue to
face considerable development challenges. The Bank ISN discussed at the Board in June 2009
argued that the country is locked in a low-equilibrium trap of instability, weak governance and
disappointing economic performance. At the top of the government priorities is the elimination
of severe infrastructure bottlenecks. The ISN argued that donors, and the Bank among them, will
have to move to a more forceful engagement-a High Impact Program (HIP) capable of actually
bringing about systemic change in Guinea-Bissau. To support this Program, the Bank team has
initiated the preparation of a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) which aims to identify
policy reforms and investments that could achieve direct and visible results over the next few
years. On this context, while the proposed operation complements other current Bank operations
addressing infrastructure needs, it would represent a transition to a more ambitious and
integrated Bank program aimed at helping Guinea Bissau to break from the low equilibrium in
which it has been trapped for over a decade. (see Box 5.1 in Section 5 for more details on the
envisaged HIP).

                     A. BACKGROUND RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
                                AND

2.1     Guinea-Bissau is a small country in West Africa with an estimated 1.54 million
inhabitants and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$55OS2The population is
young-about 42 percent is under 14 years of age-and has been growing fast, at an average rate
of 2.2 percent in recent years. The economy remains largely dependent on the agricultural sector
and is vulnerable to weather fluctuations-agriculture represented about 55 percent of GDP in
2009 and virtually all exports, and it remains the main source of employment in rural areas.
Cashew is the main cash crop (representing 98 percent of exports), with linkages to other sectors,
such as labor intensive cashew processing, trade and transportation.

2.2     Guinea-Bissau is a fragile state barely emerging from conflict. A brief civil war,
starting in June 1998, ended with the ouster, in May 1999, of President Jog0 Bernard0 Vieira,
who had ruled the country for 20 years. Since then, political instability has continued to be high.
There were frequent changes in government in the aftermath of the conflict-with 14 successive
governments over 1999-2009-and a bloodless coup in 2003. Presidential elections in June
2005 brought back Mr. Vieira from exile. With the presidency constitutionally independent from
the legislature but the government subject to parliamentary confidence, political rivalry between
the presidency and prime ministry has been a source of frequent tensions.

2.3     Political tensions ran high over 2008-09, climaxing in the death of President Vieira
in March, but there is now hope that an era of enhanced stability has opened. The
parliamentary elections that took place on November 16, 2008 were deemed fair and transparent
by international observers, with a large turnout and participation from all political parties. The
historic African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) won with a
convincing margin, garnering 67 of the Assembly?s 100 seats and slightly under 50 percent of
the popular vote. The back-to-back assassinations of former President Vieira and the Army
Chief of Staff in March 2009 had appeared to precipitate another bout of unusually high tensions,
following more than a decade of persistent instability since the 1998/99 civil conflict. As
provided by the Constitution, an Interim President was sworn in soon thereafter, and the first
round of presidential elections took place at end-June 2009. A convincing win in the runoff
election, held at end-July, gave the presidency to Malam Bacai Sanha of the PAIGC, who was
sworn in early September.

2.4    The political situation appears to be easing, but deep sources of tensions remain. The
peaceful presidential election in the summer seems to have alleviated tensions and favored the
consolidation of the new administration, now almost a year and a half in office. Nonetheless, in
keeping with the notion of a low equilibrium of instability, weak governance and low economic
performance, sources of tensions remain and a convincing exit from this equilibrium will take
time, while the exit path should be expected to be punctuated by recurring incidents of political

  The National Institute of Statistics (INE) revised national account data for 2003-08, based on the new
National Account System (SNA) methodology of 1993. The new data has a broader coverage of all the
sectors in the economy, including in particular the non-cashew agricultural sector which had been
significantly underestimated in previous data. The result is an approximate doubling of the level of GDP.
This revision affects fundamentally GDP ratios. The data presented in this document reflects this revision
and cannot be directly comparable to the previous version or other Bank documents.
instability. Indeed, in early April 2010, such an incident took place, with the arrest of the Prime
Minister and the Chief of Staff of the Army by the Army's number two. Though the Prime
Minister was quickly released, the military apologized for the incident, and the situation
promptly normalized, the challenge to a legitimate civilian authority by members of the military
has only reaffirmed the urgent need for, and the complexity of, the reform of Guinea-Bissau's
security sector.

2.5     Progress towards macro-economic stabilization has been uneven since the war,
complicated by a difficult domestic political context, and more recently, by external shocks.
Since 1997, Guinea-Bissau has been part of the regional WAEMU. A common currency and a
peg to the Euro have delivered monetary and exchange rate stability over the last decade. Thus,
the main macroeconomic policy instrument is fiscal. Attempts at stabilization in the early years
of the decade faltered in the wake of political disturbances and weaknesses in fiscal
management. Since early 2007, however, successive governments have reaffirmed the
importance of bringing the budget under control to foster stability and improve the functioning
of the state. Efforts have been made to mobilize revenues, seek additional donor assistance, and
control spending, along with structural reforms in public financial management, notably in the
areas of expenditure control, cash management, revenue collection, and administrative capacity
in the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

2.6     Economic growth has been anemic since the end of the civil war in 1999. Real per
capita GDP in 2007 was still about one sixth below its 1999 level. Average total GDP growth
over the period 1999-2007 stood at only about 1 percent per year, but this masks a high
variability, with short periods of recovery followed by sharp drops (-7 percent in 2002). Growth
appears to have stabilized over the last four years, but at a rate-an average real GDP growth
rate around 2% percent-that is unlikely to translate into a material difference in Guinea-
Bissau's economic prospects and its population economic aspirations.

                              B. RECENT      DEVELOPMENTS

2.7    In a difficult international environment and continued challenges on the political
and macroeconomic policy fronts, economic performance improved somewhat in 2008-09.
GDP growth in 2008 accelerated to 3.3 percent, driven by a good cashew crop and a gradual
normalization of the fiscal situation, allowing public sector wages to be paid at a better pace and
government spending for supplies and investment to increase. With the continued rise in food
and energy prices in the first half of the year, inflation reached an average annual rate of
10% percent for the year as a whole-ne        of the highest rates in the regional monetary union.
Despite strong cashew exports in volume and value, a sharp increase in the import costs of food
and fuel led to a widening of the external current account deficit to about 5 percent of GDP
(US$43 million), financed by official transfers and loans, and some drawdown on external
reserves.

2.8     In early 2008, the government started a one-year program under the IMF EPCA.
The program aimed to restore fiscal stability, targeting a reduction in the domestic primary
deficit to just above 4 percent of GDP and a strict policy of no new accumulation of domestic
arrears. The program had a strong structural plank in the revenue and expenditure management
areas on which there was broadly satisfactory implementation progress throughout the year,
underlining government commitment to reforming public financial management. Revenue-

enhancing measures already enacted include (i) limiting tax exemptions; (ii) improving customs
collection; (iii) increasing taxes on 14 products; and (iv) enforcing the collection of the stamp
tax. Initial expenditure control measures already implemented include: (i) processing all
payment orders through the Budget Directorate; (ii) restricting extra-budgetary expenditures only
to emergency situations and regularizing them within 48 hours; (iii) normalizing budget
execution procedures; and (iv) requiring Treasury approval for the settlement of any purchase of
goods and services by line ministries, in line with the new WAEMU-based organic finance law.

2.9     In 2009, Guinea-Bissau was hit by the global recession combined with an unstable
political situation. Real GDP growth in 2009 is estimated to have come out at about 3 percent
for the year. On the upside, growth was supported by a record cashew crop, despite lower export
prices and a moderate expansion of food crops. Sharply lower food and fuel prices also provided
a compensating boost and contributed to contain inflation (about -1.2 percent y-o-y by end-
September). The negative impact of the global slowdown was transmitted mainly through export
values and remittances, both cutting into domestic demand at a time when room for fiscal
stimulus was sharply limited. Export prices for cashew nuts, the main export crop, fell by almost
30 percent compared with 2008 and led to a sharp loss in terms of trade of 13 percent. As a
result, the total value of exports plummeted by 10 percent. Remittances, which are currently
equivalent to about 4 percent of GDP, also declined. The external current account deficit
(excluding official transfers) is estimated to widen to about 6.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal
impact of the global financial crisis has been also significant. Slower economic activity and low
cashew nut prices (about a third of the government's fiscal base) negatively affected tax revenue
prospects, leading the government to accelerate tax collection efforts and to tighten spending
controls.

2.10 Fiscal performance under the 2008 EPCA program was broadly satisfactory until
mid-2008, but weakened in the latter part of the year in the face of external and political
shocks. At the outset, the authorities committed themselves to maintain a nominal freeze of the
wage bill for 2008, and to stay current on wage payments. With the sharp increase in food and
energy import prices, the government took steps, in March 2008, to mitigate their impact on the
p~pulation.~  Wage spending came out above original targets, mainly owing to recruitments of
contractual teachers in the education sector, but some wage bill compression was achieved in
relation to GDP, with a 0.5 percentage point decrease reflecting a reduction in real wages due to
the lack of adjustment of nominal wages to high inflation. Overall, despite some slippage,
spending envelopes remained within program targets. However, with the repeated bouts of
political uncertainty, domestic revenues losses late in the year could not be offset by expenditure
cuts and thus led to a higher domestic primary fiscal deficit than envisaged, estimated at about
6 percent of GDP from a target of about 5 percent of GDP. In turn, lower revenues than
expected, together with a shortfall in budget aid, led to the accumulation of new arrears, mainly
on wages, equivalent to about 4 month^.^

2.11 Fiscal policy broadly improved in 2009 and the performance under the 2009 EPCA
has been satisfactory and paved the way for the approval of the ECF in May 2010. In early
2009, the new government immediately reaffirmed its commitment to sound macroeconomic

  All rice imports were temporarily exempted from import taxes (except for a small 2.5 percent duty based on a reference price
for rice well below actual market prices) and customs duties were reduced on diesel imports.
 As a result, EPCA program targets were missed on revenue, the primary fiscal balance, payments of previous year's arrears, and
new arrears accumulation.

management and requested further support under the IMF's EPCA. The EPCA-supported
economic program focused on meeting current year expenditures with available resources and
avoiding new budgetary arrears. The domestic primary fiscal deficit was targeted to stay at 4.5
percent of GDP in 2009. Despite the sharply lower cashew nut prices (taxes on cashew account
for some 25 percent of tax revenues), the domestic primary deficit closed 2009 at 2.9 percent of
GDP, reflecting the good cashew campaign in volumes and improved revenue administration.
Current expenditure declined in relation to GDP, with the wage bill again frozen in nominal
terms, stricter controls on wage payments, and tighter budgetary controls, made possible by the
use of the new budget execution system and new surrender rules of "restitutions" (administrative
revenues collected and partially retained by the originating administrations).

2.12 Despite the difficult political and economic context, there was also progress on the
structural agenda, with important steps taken on public financial management, civil service
reform and private sector development. Gradual progress on public financial management is
gaining traction, and the government adopted a priority action plan for the short term, drawing in
part on the Bank's recent Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) report. The government launched a biometric survey of civil servants to control the
wage bill and detect fraud which could support some reduction in the still oversized wage bill.
The government appears set to launch the long awaited reform of its security sector. Some
measures were taken to remove regulatory or administrative obstacles to business development,
including the adoption of a more streamlined investment code, and, more recently, some progress
towards a simplification of administrative procedures and the legal creation of the one-stop-shop.

relief under the HIPC initiative from IDA and the AfDB (about 2.7 percent of GDP), but it
continues to accumulate new external debt arrears (of about US$9 million in 2009, or 1 percent
of GDP) towards other, mainly bilateral creditors. It should be noted that, at end-September
2009, Guinea-Bissau had received only about 50 percent of the budget support pledged from
donors for the year 2009, due mostly to temporary delays.

2.14 For 2010, projected budget support amounts to 3.1 percent of GDP which is expected to
be provided by an AfDB Fragile State Facility (FSF) grant, approved in March 17, the EU and
the proposed EGRG I1 grant. With domestic financing equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP, a gross
financing gap amounting to 3.2 percent of GDP is expected to be financed by an additional EU
Vulnerability-Flex grant amounting to 2.3 percent of GDP and a drawing under the IMF
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) amounting to the remaining 0.9 percent of GDP.

2.15 The financial sector has recovered in recent years, but remains underdeveloped.
With the opening of three new banks (all foreign private) in recent years, bank deposits and
credit have increased. The fairly high rate of growth of money over 2004-09 reflects mainly a
continued process of re-monetization. Nonetheless, financial intermediation remains
embryonic-total domestic credit at end 2009 is equal to only 7 percent of GDP, the lowest in
the WAEMU region. Protracted political instability, a large informal sector with firms lacking
basic accounting reports, limited collateral, and banks only located in the capital Bissau are key
obstacles to deepening financial intermediation. By the same token, the local banking sector has

                                OUTLOOK AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

2.16 Going forward, the medium-term macroeconomic outlook is moderately favorable,
assuming that the negative impacts of the global crisis do not markedly intensify. Under the
baseline medium-term scenario, GDP growth over 2010-12 could accelerate to the range of 3%
to 4% percent per year under the fiscal and external support profile of the last two years and the
assumption that domestic political stability gains traction. Political stabilization remains the pre-
eminent factor behind evolving growth prospects for the foreseeable future. There is, however,
considerable uncertainty over other factors likely to affect economic performance, and even this
unambitious growth outlook will be highly contingent on the global recession having not
deepened, fiscal stabilization being sustained and further donor support materializing at a steady
pace. A stabilization of cashew nuts prices and continued high prices for rice above their recent
trend levels, along with recent efforts to improve food security, would support continued growth
in agriculture. If political and fiscal stabilization take hold, even gradual gains in investor and
donor confidence could translate into some moderate momentum in private and public
investment which could drive' agriculture diversification, some agro-industrial rebound and
construction. With Guinea-Bissau's participation in the regional monetary union, medium-term
inflation rates should return to the regional average-about 2% percent per year-provided large
food and energy price increases do not re-emerge. The external current account balance,
including grants, would remain in the 0-lpercent of GDP range.

2.17 The baseline medium-term fiscal scenario assumes conservatively a continuation of
recent trends. Revenues would recover some lost ground, and current spending would be
contained, with a combination of improved controls, a modest decrease in the weight of civil
service wages in GDP, and cuts in the interest costs of domestic and foreign debt. Even this
fiscal consolidation scenario assumes continued engagement of donors at a high level. Project
grants and loans equivalent to about 13 percent of GDP would be required to finance a minimal
level of capital expenditures. Additional grant resources would be needed to increase priority
spending on social sectors, infrastructure, and capacity building to the levels envisaged in the
government's PRSP. Budget support would need to reach a level of at least 8% percent of GDP

    over the next 3 years to cover the domestic primary deficit. With sustained policy reform
    implementation, Guinea-Bissau could also receive comprehensive debt relief under the HIPC
    initiative and MDRI.5

    2.18 There is scope for faster progress on the fiscal front over the medium-term, but it
    will require difficult internal agreements on public administration reform and downsizing
    security forces. A lasting solution to Guinea-Bissau's fiscal problems will require decisive,
    sustained progress on containment of the wage bill. The large size of the wage bill limits fiscal
    space to finance critical non-wage expenditures and to absorb revenue shocks. Shortfalls in
    domestic revenues or donor support may lead to episodes of accumulation of wage arrears,
    threatening social peace. The public sector wage bill stood at 5 percent of GDP and 58 percent
    of domestic revenues in 2009 (down from 82 percent in 2007), though mainly on account of
    repeated and unsustainable wage freezes.

    2.19 The 2009 PEMFAR, prepared jointly with the AfDB, the EU and the World Bank,
    also notes that nearly half the public sector wage bill goes to the security sector (military,
    ex-combatants and police), heightening the political sensitivity of fiscal tensions.6 There is a
    broad consensus among observers that, unless the issue is addressed, the security sector will
    remain a critical source of political instability. However, the ability of individual governments to
    act will remain constrained until an internal agreement can be reached with the military and other
    forces on the need for reform. The authorities and donors have started to implement some
    actions in support of the security sector and peace building in the country. In particular, a census
    of the armed forces was conducted in 2008 which has already allowed the identification of
    savings on the military payroll. On February 12, 2008, the EU announced the establishment of a
    permanent mission in support of security sector reform in Guinea-Bissau. The overall objective
    of this initiative is to provide advice and assistance to the authorities on reform of the security
    sector, and help implement the reforms, in close cooperation with EU members, and other
    international and bilateral actors. A key specific objective is to make operational the national
    security strategy by assisting in downsizing and restructuring the armed forces and security
    forces. About Euro 6 million are available to fund the mission. In addition, the EU is providing
    about Euro 8 million to fund demobilization. Parallel to the EU initiative, the UN Peace-
    Building Commission has created a specific configuration for Guinea-Bissau headed by the
    Brazilian Ambassador to the UN. Until February 2010, six missions have visited the country to
    explore areas for quick-win activities and medium-term peace-building activities to be financed
    through the Peace-Building Fund.

    2.20 A critical component of the authorities' medium-term reform agenda is their public
-   administration reform program. Though the authorities are well aware that the size and cost
    of their civil service are neither financially sustainable nor conducive to the development of an
    efficient public administration, reforms in this area stalled in recent years in the face of political
    and macroeconomic instability. The authorities intend to revive this agenda. Their dual
    objective is to modernize the public administration and reduce its size, though specific objectives

      The medium-term macroeconomic framework tentatively assumes that Guinea-Bissau would reach the Completion Point at
    end-20 10.
      While a number of political and social factors may be at play, economic factors affecting the troops appear to have been a major
    source of discontent despite the relatively large proportion of the security sector in the public sector wage bill. Issues include
    unresolved pension payments and other compensations for military personnel (especially those who are retired); and squalid
    living conditions facing present members of the armed forces.

                                                               -9-
and modalities remain to be developed. In the authorities? preliminary thinking, staffing
reduction could be achieved by different means, including strict enforcement of retirement rules,
voluntary departures supported by cash packages and retrainingheinsertion programs, well
targeted involuntary separations, privatization of functions and services, and attrition. However,
given the country?s fragile political and social environment, the authorities do not believe that
this objective will be achievable, and politically or socially acceptable, without financial support
from donors to their retrenchment program and a gradual implementation schedule. At the same
time, they are aware that donor support will require a coherent strategy and determined
implementation backed by full political support. One of the goals of the design of a public
administration strategy will be to develop an internal consensus, as well as an articulated action
plan, as a basis for further progress. The EU, together with the UN, AfDB and bilateral donors
are making considerable efforts to assist the government in reforming the public administration.
The EU Program to support Public Administration Reform (PARAP) has been assigned the task
of mapping a multi-year strategy that would address performance and incentive issues, as well as
supporting interventions such as training. The 2009 PEMFAR has also provided analytical input
for the preparation of the strategy.

2.21 The authorities have prepared a medium-term plan to address domestic arrears.
Domestic arrears are sizable, and while estimates vary, the stock that has been identified amounts
to about 24 percent of GDP. These include wage arrears, arrears to domestic banks, the West
African States Central Bank (BCEAO), the West Africa Development Bank (BOAD), and
commercial arrears to the private sector. The authorities? plan has two steps. In the first step, it
addresses well identified and verified arrears. These include arrears to commercial banks and the
BCEAO which entail high financial costs to the government, as well as wage arrears of 2008,
and pre-civil war arrears to the private sector. These arrears will be settled through a combination
of cash payments and rescheduling, using available financing consisting of donor support lined
up for 2010 and BCEAO lending to the Government of the IMF additional SDR allocation for
                  In
Guinea-Bi~sau.~ the second step, the government intends to complete the audit of post-civil
war arrear, and address them after they have been fully audited and verified. In any event, the
government plans to identify existing creditors, and offset the stock of arrears against tax arrears
owed to the government.

2.22 Downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook are primarily political. Political
instability could flare up again and commitment to fiscal stabilization and to reforms, which has
been demonstrated in the recent past, could come under pressure either from within or from
outside the government?s political base, especially if tangible benefits of reforms do not become
apparent to the population, or if costs of reform to narrow constituencies become too high.

2.23 A slower than expected recovery from the global slowdown would also negatively
affect Guinea-Bissau?s economy, especially as its fragile stabilization relies heavily on high
sustained donor support. Specifically, a drop in the world price for cashew nut, Guinea-
Bissau?s sole commodity export, could stifle the nascent recovery in agriculture. Lower food
and fuel prices could partly offset these effects on the economy at large-the aggregate demand
and inflationary impact of recent price increases was particularly high in Guinea-Bissau,
compared to other African Financial Community Franc (CFAF) zone countries. By the same
token, however, a resurgence of food and fuel price increases could negatively affect medium-

term growth prospects. In addition, a fall in remittances would also weigh heavily on the
economy. The most significant risk for Guinea-Bissau, however, would be a severe drying up of
foreign aid over the medium term.

2.24 On the upside, medium- to long-term growth, investment and exports could receive
a significant boost from possible mining ventures to exploit the country's bauxite and
phosphate resources. Angola Bauxite was reported to be considering an investment of close to
US$300 million in developing bauxite deposits in Guinea-Bissau, which would require the
development of a deepwater port and a railway line linking the mine to the port. Phosphate
mining also offers serious prospects for expansion of the mining sector, but requires equally
large infrastructure development.' The current scenario does not include these possible ventures,
given the limited information on the scope for these projects to go forward, the large
infrastructure prerequisites, and the difficult global context. Though mining is an opportunity,
mining is also fraught with risks to sustainable development prospects in Guinea-Bissau, and
there will remain a need to identify and implement structural and institutional reforms to ensure
that the development benefits of mining projects are maximized and potential downsides are
mitigated.

2.25 Guinea-Bissau is currently in a situation of debt distress. At end-2009, Guinea-
Bissau's stock of external debt amounted to US$1.057 billion, of which US$383 million were
arrears. The external debt to GDP ratio has decreased over the last five years from 195.8 percent
in 2003 to about 127.9 percent in 2009, reflecting mainly a low rate of new debt accumulation
against nominal GDP growth and the effect of exchange rate changes on the value of debt.' The
latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)" points to a situation of continued debt distress that
could only deepen with borrowing on non-concessional terms, exchange rate depreciation and
lower growth of exports. Overall, while quantitative debt indicators show modest improvement
in recent years, there has been no significant qualitative change in the extent of external debt
distress, while domestic debt ratios have been deteriorating owing to the accumulation of new
domestic arrears and increased borrowing from regional financial institutions. The cash flow
impact of the large external debt on the budget has been limited, as Guinea-Bissau benefits from
interim relief from IDA and the AfDB, and has continued to accumulate external arrears on its
bilateral debt. The huge debt overhang remains a severe obstacle on the path to fiscal
normalization and clouds prospects for an acceleration of external private investment. Finally, a
resolution of the debt problem would enhance the external and domestic credibility of the
authorities' economic management.

2.26 Chances of a permanent solution to debt distress would be enhanced if the HIPC
Completion Point were reached in 2010. Since reaching the Decision Point under the HIPC
initiative in December 2000, the authorities have made good progress in reaching Completion
Point triggers (see Annex 6) and, with the approval of the EPCA program, have committed to
maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic performance. A satisfactory performance of the
recently approved IMF ECF would pave the way for reaching the Completion Point, possibly by

current situation of debt distress for the medium term.

2.27 In summary, Guinea-Bissau's macroeconomic framework provides an adequate
basis for the proposed operation. However, critical to reaching even its modest goals, policy
implementation will need to continue to improve. This will require sustained commitment to the
goals of fiscal stabilization and reforms, as well as efforts toward continued capacity building.
Revenue enhancing efforts under the current fiscal stabilization program include measures to
strengthen customs controls and valuation (with the installation of the Automated System of
Customs Data (ASYCUDA++) customs system and the recruitment of a pre-shipment inspection
agent), a tax arrears collection drive, and stepped-up enforcement actions on fishing license
revenues. Measures planned by the authorities on the expenditure management fronts are
detailed in section 4 below and in the government's policy matrix in Annex 3.

                                              OF

3.1    The impact of the 1998-99 conflict, subsequent political instability and poor
economic performance over the last few years have contributed to high rates of poverty.
Guinea-Bissau is one of the world's poorest countries. It ranked 173st out of 182 countries on the
2009 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index and poverty
is widespread, with a higher incidence in rural areas. At the household level, 66 percent of the
population was living in poverty in 2006, with 22 percent living in extreme poverty.'' About 80
percent of the poor live in rural areas and practice subsistence agriculture. While poverty remains
lower in urban than in rural areas, urban households have become more vulnerable to particular
shocks, such as the recent food and energy price increases, because, unlike rural populations,
they cannot survive on subsistence agriculture. The country is not likely to reach any of the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 at current trends and without significant donor
support. Poverty in Guinea-Bissau is characterized by poor quality and access to health services.
Life expectancy was estimated at 47 years in 2007 (down from 55 years in 1995). Households
headed by older people, the urban unemployed, and farmers in general are particularly
vulnerable. Vulnerable groups such as street children, beggars, widows, the handicapped, ex-
combatants and people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) often survive in a calamitous situation.

                           B. OVERVIEW OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

3.2    Guinea-Bissau's Poverty Reduction Strategy (or DENARP in Portuguese) is built on
four pillars: (i) strengthening governance, modernizing the public administration and ensuring
macroeconomic stability, (ii) enhancing economic growth and job creation, (iii) increasing
access to social services and basic infrastructure, and (iv) improving the living conditions of
vulnerable groups.

population with levels of consumption per equivalent adult below a purchasing power parity adjusted at US$2 per day.

3.3     Guinea-Bissau's first PRSP Progress Report provides a candid review and analysis
of the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) during the period
2006-2008. The Progress Report was prepared through a broad participatory process and covers
the progress made in the implementation of the DENARP focusing on its main pillars and cross-
sectoral themes. The Progress Report acknowledges that implementation has been uneven, which
was to be expected given the continued political instability and rapid turnover of political
personnel over the period in review.

3.4     Nonetheless, the implementation of the DENARP has been encouraging. The
expected real annual GDP growth rate of 5 percent in the PRSP was not reached due to protracted
political instability, difficulties in the cashew campaign in 2006, the increase in food and fuel
prices in 2007, and the impact of the financial crisis in 2009. Still, output growth reached 3.3
percent in 2008 and about 3 percent in 2009, a result that, though a long way from placing
Guinea-Bissau on a poverty reducing growth track, implies that a decade-long decline in living
standards has at last been arrested. The Government achieved some progress towards improved
macroeconomic policies during 2006-2009. New poverty data are not available that could
indicate any significant reduction in poverty.

            Box 3.1: Guinea-Bissau Progress Towards the HIPC Completion Point

In the ten years following the 2000 Decision Point, deep political instability, with numerous security incidents and
frequent changes in governments and the resulting protracted failure to sustain good performance in macroeconomic
management preempted the establishment of a track record under IMF programs, one of the triggers toward HIPC
completion. As Annex 6 indicates, eight of the 11 triggers are currently met. The three triggers that are currently not
met are: (i) the maintenance of satisfactory macroeconomic stability, for which good performance under an IMF
ECF program would be required for it to be considered met; (ii) the satisfactory implementation for one year of the
PRSP strategy finalized in 2006 as evidenced by the joint staff assessment of the country's annual progress report
(APR) and (iii) that the findings of the external audit to the 1997-99 budgets outturns have been submitted to
Parliament and an action plan of corrective measures has been adopted. Two ((i) and (ii)) out of the three remaining
triggers are likely to be achieved by the end of 20 10 while the third one can no longer be met in the letter.
Regarding the first trigger, in 2009, the performance under a second IMF Emergency Post-Conflict Arrangement
(EPCA) was satisfactory, paving the way for Fund approval of an arrangement under the IMF's Extended Credit
Facility (ECF). Fund staff has indicated to the authorities that satisfactory performance under the ECF-supported
program in the frst half of 2010 would provide the necessary track record for reaching the HIPC completion point in
the fourth quarter of 20 10.
Regarding the second trigger, the government will prepare a new APR by mid-year to reflect recent progress.
Progress on implementing the PRSP has been uneven so far, particularly in the social sectors, given the difficult
political, economic and financial context of the second part of the decade. Nonetheless, the new government
endorsed the PRSP's main objectives and has committed to accelerate its implementation throughout 20 10, while
launching the preparation of a new PRSP to be finalized in 20 1 1. This trigger is likely to be achieved at the end of
2010.
The third trigger can no longer be met as stated. The findings of the original audit and a remedial action plan were
submitted to Parliament in 2003, but limited steps were taken to implement the action plan in ensuing years, not only
because of frequent changes in governments, but also because these remedial actions were viewed as inconsistent
with ongoing PFM reforms. Recently, the country has accelerated the pace of progress has taken place since 2008,
with technical assistance from donors, including under a grant from the Bank-managed LICUS trust fund, followed
more recently by an SPF-fimded project. Progress on this agenda was also supported under the IMF EPCA program
and recent IDA Economic Governance Reform DPOs. The set of PFM reforms recently implemented signal the
authorities' commitment to subject their own fiscal accounts to external audits and would also establish a sound
basis for timely external audits of public accounts to be performed in future years.

                  c. PROGRESS WITH POVERTY REDUCTION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Policy Actions to strengthen governance, modernize the public administration, and ensure
macroeconomic stability

3.5     The Government has achieved progress in macroeconomic stabilization and the
implementation of public finance management reforms. In early 2008, the government
reached agreement with the IMF on a one-year program under the Fund?s Emergency Post-
Conflict Assistance. The program aimed to restore fiscal stability. Fiscal performance under the
EPCA program is broadly satisfactory. There has been some progress towards improving public
financial management. Concrete measures taken have been: (i) the adoption of a new budget
classification system in line with WAEMU directives, and of an Organic Law for Budget and
Public Accounting Decree; l2 (ii) the introduction of the Integrated Public Financial Management
System (Sistema Integrado de Gestgo das Finanqas Publicas, SIGFIP);13(iii) the tightening of the
recourse to simplified and emergency (extra-budgetary) spending procedures; (iv) the closing of
Sectoral Ministries? revenue accounts in commercial banks; (v) the transfer of all sectoral
ministries non-project spending accounts in a single treasury account at the BCEA0;14 (vi) the
implementation of the action plan to reform the public procurement system in six ministries
(education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, finance and defense); (vii) the systematic control
missions on the wage bill in the ministries; (viii) the creation of a follow-up committee on the
internal public debt that has completed the first phase of an audit on internal debt;15and (ix) the
ongoing implementation of a computerized debt management system (SYGADE) with United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)?s support.

3.6     The government recently launched an administration reform program supported by
an EU-funded project (PARAP), under the joint leadership of the ministries of Finance and
Public Administration. The government is aware that the size and cost of the civil service is
neither financially sustainable nor prone to permit the development of an efficient and effective
public administration. The dual objective of the program is to reduce their size, and modernize
the public administration. With regard to downsizing, the authorities have selected three
ministries to pilot the reforms - the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Service and the
Ministry of Public Administration Reform. The project also has financed the bio-metric census
of the civil service and activities aimed at easing the reintegration of retrenched workers in the
private sector. The staffing cuts could help reduce the ratio of the wage bill to GDP from his
current level of 10 percent in 2008 to the current level of WAEMU average of 6 percent by 2012.
The biometric census of the civil servants has been completed at the end of August 2009
functional reviews of departments have been carried out. The final results should help to know
the exact number of civil servants and identify those who have to retire fiom the public
administration.

3.7   Different measures have been initiated to increase capacity in the public
administration. A diagnostic study on capacity building activities has been conducted in the
view of transforming the National Center of Training on Administration (CENFA) into a

?? 2009 Budget has been elaborated under the new WAEMU-based budget classification.

National Administration School (ENA). The AfDB agreed to finance the creation of the school
that should be operational in 2010. The elaboration, adoption and promulgation of the law on the
national statistic system in 2008 will contribute to increase the capacity of the public
administration. The government has also completed the general population census and the
preliminary results have been published in July 2009.

3.8     Many of the measures identified to reform the judiciary system have not been
implemented due to lack of resources. With regard to the rule of law and judiciary reform, the
main areas of intervention identified were the following: (i) rehabilitate the regional justice
buildings, (ii) build human resource capacities and provide equipments necessary to administer
justice properly, (iii) promote knowledge of the law, and access to justice, and (iv) build capacity
for Members of Parliament (MPs). The Parliament did not receive adequate resources intended to
reinforce its economic and financial commissions and create a documentation center that will
make available to the public all the voted texts and laws.

3.9     In order to improve political stability necessary for economic and social
development, the Government has started to implement a security sector reform which
aims at: (a) reducing the size of the military for the establishment of a smaller, professional
army, and a reduction of the military expenditures on wages; (b) achieving a gradual change in
the ethnic composition of the military; and (c) improving housing, sanitary, and health facilities
in military barracks. In 2007, the government has created the institutional framework, comprised
of an inter-ministerial committee and a technical committee, for the implementation of the
strategy. In 2008, a biometric census of the armed forces was conducted and has already allowed
the identification of savings on the military payroll. On February 12, 2008, the EU announced
the establishment of a permanent mission in support of security sector reform in Guinea-Bissau.
In addition, the EU is providing about EUR8.0 million to fund demobilization. Parallel to the
EU Council initiative, the UN Peace-Building Commission has created a dedicated configuration
for Guinea-Bissau headed by the Brazilian Ambassador to the UN.

3.10 A peace building program-called VOZ DE PAZ (Voice of Peace)-which aims at
making a tangible contribution to the consolidation of peace and stability in Guinea-Bissau
is being implemented with support from Interpeace and the National Institute for Studies
and Research (INEP). The capacity of the state and civil society to identify and address
divisive issues in a peaceful manner has increased somewhat with the activities supported by the
program, which have included:

       A Coordination Committee for the program composed of key representatives of civil
       society and state institutions has been set up; participating organization covered a broad
       cross-section of society: the Presidency of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, the Parliament,
       Parliamentary commissions and relevant experts, the Office of the Prime Minister, the
       Supreme Court, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, the late Chief of
       Staff of Armed Forces, the Non Governmental Organizations Platform for Consultation in
       Guinea-Bissau (PLACON), the League of Human Rights, the Institute for the Woman and
       Child, the National Islamic Association, and representatives from the Catholic Church and
       Protestant Churches;

       Multi-stakeholder consultations around the main priorities of conflict prevention have
       been conducted in Bissau and the provincial capitals (Cacheu, Oio, Bafata, Gabu,

 0    The VOZ DI PAZ program launched a campaign in July 2008 to help ease tensions in the
      run up to the parliamentary elections that were held on November 16*, 2008. The
      initiative involved research and discussions among traditional leaders, imams, youth
      organizations as well as representatives of political parties at the local level. Subject
      themes were good governance and the rule of law, participation of citizens in issues of
      national relevance and sound management of natural resources. Thirty two session of
      "democratic dialogue" were organized in different regions of the country, including
      Bissau.


Policy Actions to promote economic growth and job creation

3.1 1 Progress on the second pillar of the PRSP has also been uneven with some advances
made on the legal framework for private investment and slower efforts on infrastructure
development. The authorities recognize the need to foster private sector development in order to
achieve equitable economic growth and to encourage job creation. During the past year, the
government has initiated a series of actions to improve the business climate.

 0    Progress in the Government's privatization program has been positive: 3 1 out of 44 small
      and medium State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have been PrivatizedAiquidated and the
      necessary environmental assessments have been completed and distributed to the new
      owners;

      Important progress was also achieved with the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the
      nine Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) Acts, the
      establishment of a Commercial Tribunal, the adoption of a draft Public-Private
      Partnerships (PPP) Law prepared with assistance from Public-Private Investment
      Advisory Facility (PPIAF), and the adoption of a new Investment Code developed with
      Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) assistance.
3.12 Basic infrastructure development is the cornerstone of the entire poverty reduction
strategy in Guinea-Bissau because it is the structure on which all of the other productive as
well as social sector approaches are based on. All the evaluations that have been performed
have identified insufficient or deficient preservation of basic infrastructure as the greatest
obstacle to improving the country's economic and social development. The poverty reduction
strategy has included on the top priorities the development of infrastructures and facilities to
support economic production.

3.13 The government has not defined a clear strategy for the development of the energy
sector. Bissau has generation capacity of 5.5 Mega-Watts (MW), down fiom 25 MW in 2000,
though it is operating at less than 1.5 MW today. Only one of the five available generators is
operational, leading to more power cuts, with obvious negative impacts on prospects for private
sector investment, the basic functioning of administrative offices, and the living conditions of the
population. New legislation on production and distribution of electricity was approved in June

2007 by decree, but even donor-supported efforts today have not been able to more than
marginally improve the situation.

3.14 A major improvement in transportation has been the construction of the
EUROAFRICANA bridge at the Cacheu river in SPo Vicente. This bridge is facilitating the
circulation of goods and persons between Senegal and Guinea-Bissau and vice-versa. Road
network development has been uneven. While the primary road network is in relatively good
shape, most secondary dirt roads are unusable during the rainy season, hampering transport of
agricultural production and economic activity. Different studies are ongoing for the
rehabilitation of the secondary roads in Quinara and Tombali regions, the maintenance of the
roads in Bissau, and the special program for Guinea-Bissau to interconnect the country with
other common borders countries.

3.15 Telecommunication has experienced the greatest growth during the DENARP
implementation period. Three mobile phone operators are providing services in Guinea-
Bissau. The sector has created many jobs for the young population. The main challenge is to
consolidate an enabling regulatory framework for further growth and competition.

3.16 The port of Bissau is in disrepair and its rehabilitation is the most pressing
infrastructure challenge. The Bissau port is the only major functioning port in the country and
the gateway for 85 percent of all exports and 90 percent of all imports. Originally constructed to
move 5,000 containers, it is now moving 20,000 with considerable delays. Its operations suffer
from a lack of capacity, insufficient depth of port and approaches, lack of navigation
instruments, and obsolete and inadequate container equipment. This has resulted in declining
activity, lower revenues, which in turn has led to less maintenance. The ensuing cost on other
sectors of the economy is substantial.

3.17 In the area of aviation, a recent milestone was reached with Guinea-Bissau joining
the Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA). ASECNA's
operations have contributed to an improvement in services, and enhanced aviation security.

Policy Actions to increase access to social services and basic infrastructures
3.18 Improvements in the third pillar have been less evident, providing an important item
for the agenda of the second PRSP. Spending toward basic social services has been modest
during the period 2006-2008, both in terms of GDP and as a share of total public expenditures.
Spending on health and education together represents 14 percent of total spending on average.
The country is not likely to reach any of the MDGs by 2015 at current trends. Poverty in
Guinea-Bissau is characterized by poor quality and access to health services. In 2005, only 38
percent of the population had access to health services in good quality. Life expectancy was
estimated at 47 years in 2007 (down from 55 years in 1995) with the decrease being attributed to
higher infant mortality and the toll of HIV/AIDS. Nearly 88 percent of the heads of poor
households have not completed primary education and the gross primary enrollment of children
in poor households is less than the national averages (85 percent for males and 45 percent for
females). The illiteracy rate of women is higher than that of men (at 85 percent compared to 56
percent for men). The disparity in access to basic education between men and women was less
pronounced. The ratio between men and women was 0.9 in 2005/2006. Social indicators,
especially child and maternal mortality, are worse in rural than urban areas. There are frequent
cases of death link to malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera.

                                            - 17-
Policy Actions to improve the living conditions of vulnerable groups

3.19 Vulnerable groups are numerous and diverse in Guinea-Bissau, including women,
youth, female-leaded households, orphaned children, people with disabilities, people
living with HIV/AIDS, and veterans of war that often survive in a calamitous situation. The
PRSP had emphasized the need to improve the lives of vulnerable groups and prescribed actions
to ensure that these groups are effectively able to benefit from wealth creation and access to
social services. The broad strategy in this area is to (i) increase access to basic social services,
and (ii) develop programs to assist with income-generating activities aiming at economically
integrating the most vulnerable populations, mainly through micro lending and community
development.

3.20 As noted in the PRSP Progress Report, this PRSP pillar has also received
insufficient attention from successive Bissau-Guinean governments over the past three
years. Little references to actions or policies undertaken to improve the living conditions of
vulnerable groups in Guinea-Bissau during 2006-2008, have been reflected in the report.
Nonetheless, some progress towards reducing the disparity between men and women has been
achieved. The government has created a ministry in charge of women issues and has ratified
many international conventions and declarations on women rights. Concerning youth initiatives,
a national action plan for youth 2008-2012 has been adopted and training of about 250 young
children took place on project management, agricultural activities, environment and other topics.
The capacity, dynamism, and creativity of the youth movement in the country contributed to
Guinea-Bissau being the choice of resident country to host the executive secretariat of the youth
movement in ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States).

               4. THE REFORM AGENDA SUPPORTED BY THE EGRG I1

4.1     While the PRSP is the reference strategy framework for the medium term, its
immediate policy relevance was quickly hijacked by growing fiscal imbalances that
emerged in 2006 and 2007. In this context, the new government installed in April 2007
launched a "minimum economic reform program" to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and
reactivate economic growth. This program was in turn followed by a program under the IMF
EPCA whose main goal was to restore macroeconomic stability by placing fiscal policy on a
sustainable track and pursuing fiscal structural reforms to improve revenue and expenditure
management. For 2010-2012, the Guinea-Bissau government prepared a medium-term economic
program centered on reinforcing public finances through enhancements in public financial
management to contain fiscal deficits and support macroeconomic stability, modernizing public
administration to create space for priority spending and raise the quality of public service
delivery and removing impediments to private sector development. This program is being
supported by an IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF).

4.2    At the current juncture, macroeconomic stabilization and growth are
complementary Government's objectives, stabilization being needed for improving growth
prospects, and, in turn, a more robust economic growth being needed to ease or reinforce the
achievement of fiscal targets and build support for reforms. In this context, beyond the specific
objectives of the fiscal program to achieve debt sustainability, and as critical pre-requisites to


                                             -18-
boost economic growth and reduce widespread poverty in the country, the authorities intend to
focus their efforts on: (i) promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of
public resources through public financial management reforms; and (ii) improving the
investment climate by reducing the up-front costs and uncertainties of business creation and
promoting a level playing field for private investors.

4.3     The focus on PFM and investment climate reforms is critical to help break the
current vicious circle of political instability, weak governance, low economic growth and
fragile finances. Improvements in public financial management are needed to restore
macroeconomic stability, support the implementation of government priority policies through the
definition of strategic allocation of public resources, improve predictability, governance and
transparency in budget execution and secure basic service delivery. Improvements in the
investment climate, together with political stability, would support economic recovery and
employment creation. Increased private employment options in turn would create a more
favorable environment for public administration and security sector reforms. Economic recovery
would also translate into buoyancy in state revenues, thus facilitating fiscal adjustment and
reducing vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks. The proposed operation thus supports the
continuation of selected PFM and investment climate reforms, building on the government's
efforts under the EGRG I, reforms that are mutually reinforcing to break the current vicious
circle in which the country currently finds itself.

                                    PUBLIC
                         A. IMPROVING            MANAGEMENT
                                         FINANCIAL
4.4    The public financial management system in Guinea-Bissau remains weak. Conflict
and political instability have taken a heavy toll on the critical investments in the human and
physical resources needed to operate the budget system and implement the kind of permanent
reform agenda that is required to improve budget performance, to exert effective control on
government spending and to enhance accountability on an ongoing basis.

4.5    Weaknesses in PFM are pervasive, affecting virtually all the system's components.
There have been years where budgets were prepared and adopted with long delays. Budget
planning is essentially means-oriented rather than results-oriented. Standard budget execution
procedures have often given way to non-standard or "simplified" ones to execute significant
portions of the budget of a non-emergency nature. Supporting documentation is not
systematically provided to Treasury officers charged with effecting payments. Until recently,
there had been a proliferation of bank accounts operated by sectoral Ministries for collecting
revenues and making payments. Control agencies (Finance Inspectorate and Auditor General)
exist but cannot perform their role. Overall, the weak monitoring, execution and control
apparatus compounds policy slippage in fiscal conduct, hampering the achievement and
maintenance of fiscal discipline, allocative efficiency in public spending, effective
accountability, and mobilization and absorption of external resources.

4.6     The legal framework for public financial management remains incomplete. At issue,
besides the deleterious effects of protracted political instability, is an incomplete transition from
the PFM system inherited from colonial times toward the legal, institutional, administrative and
policy compact to which Guinea-Bissau committed itself upon joining the WAEMU in 1997.
Guinea-Bissau is only starting to implement this compact in the PFM area. The implementation
of this framework now requires, to be fully established in law and practice, the adoption of


                                             - 19-
implementing regulations (decrees) specifying procedures and the legal roles and obligations of
budget managers and accountants, the development of operational tools and procedures manuals,
and training programs.

4.7  The authorities made progress over 2007-09 in improving public financial
management:

       e    Following a comprehensive audit of all revenue sources, including sectoral ministries'
            administrative revenues and receipts of public agencies (such as the civil aviation
            authority), all public revenues are now accounted in the general budget. Sectoral
            Ministries' revenue accounts in commercial banks have been closed and administrative
            revenues are now collected by the Treasury (however, sharing rules remain in place);
       e    Significant efforts have been made to move towards a single treasury account at the
            central bank (BCEAO) by closing or transferring all sectoral ministries non-project
            spending accounts at the BCEAO (one account remains open in a commercial bank and is
            expected to close in the near future);
       e    Treasury management has been strengthened through the establishment of an independent
            treasury committee which is in charge of controlling revenue collection and ensuring that
            expenditure commitments are consistent with financial resources;
       e    The Treasury is now in a position to produce a monthly ledger, while the Economic
            Forecasting department produces a monthly synthetic government financial operations
            table;
       e    Starting in early 2008, the recourse to simplified and emergency (extra-budgetary)
            spending procedures was tightened, and the Ministry of Finance has ensured that
            remaining instances were regularized within a two-day period;
       e    The Council of Ministers approved in May 2008 a new budget classification system in
            line with WAEMU directives;
       e    Progress has been made in implementing the action plan to reform the public
            procurement system in six ministries (education, health, agriculture, infrastructure,
            finance and defense);
       e    A draft Organic Law for Budget has been submitted to the Parliament and a Public
            Accounting Decree has been adopted. The implementation of the provisions of the
            Organic Budget Law would require all Ministries' Financial Directorates to provide
            authorizing documentation to Treasury with payment orders, thereby putting in practice
            the clear separation of responsibility between budget executors and payment officers that
            is at the core of the WAEMU public financial management model.

4.8     The government has opted for a more systematic approach to deal with the various
shortcomings in its PFM system. The strategy is based on the introduction of an integrated
financial management system upon which operational and procedural reforms can be tagged. l 6
The implementation strategy for this system would allow Guinea-Bissau to accelerate a
significant package of reforms to: (i) develop and integrate budget preparation and execution
computer systems; (ii) make operational the WAEMU-mandated budget classification standards

l6   The system chosen by the authorities is based on the SIGFIP software developed in CBte d'Ivoire.

                                                            - 20 -
recently adopted; (iii) develop consistent reporting tools for monitoring budget execution and, at
a subsequent stage, treasury operations; and (iv) effect procedural reforms for budget managers
that ensure compliance with legal and PFM regulation standards.

4.9    The platform is also expected to interconnect with revenue monitoring and accounting
systems at the Customs and Tax department; with a SIGFIP accounting module; and with a
unified payroll and personnel management system to be implemented with assistance from
Portugal. In addition, the authorities are making efforts to strengthen controls of the wage bill
through systematic control missions of pay and employment rolls in ministries and a PARAP-
supported biometric census of the civil service, ahead of the implementation of a unified payroll
system and the launch of a medium-term public administration reform program. Both, the
computerized debt management system (SYGADE) and the Integrated Public Financial
Management System (SIGFIP) are advancing well. An Information Technology IT department
was created in the Ministry of Finance early in 2008, and technical assistance was provided by
financial partners (EU, France, IMF and World Bank) in IT, budgeting and accounting. In all,
with these undertakings, significant gains in transparency and controllability of budget execution
can be achieved in a fairly short time.

4.10 Further progress is also needed on public procurement. A first procurement reform
action plan was prepared in 2006, and has formed the basis for a preliminary set of reforms that
have started to be implemented. Pilot reforms were targeted at a few important ministries, and
included the training of staff and the preparation of a procurement guide. Beyond continued
capacity building efforts, the government has started to update the existing procurement code
with a view to harmonizing it with WAEMU standards, and to strengthen enforcement of the
code and monitoring of procurement transactions. WAEMU directives also envisage the
establishment of a procurement regulatory body that comprises representatives from public and
private sectors and the civil society, independent procurement audit, and the development of an
appropriate appeal mechanism for dealing with complaints from bidders. The authorities have
conducted, in the context of the PEMFAR, an in-depth review of the overall country
procurement system, including an overview of the legislative, regulatory and institutional
frameworks, procurement operations and capacity management, market performance, and
integrity and transparency of the procurement system, with a view to incorporating critical
priority recommendations in the PFM reform agenda.

Prior Actions under the Proposed EGRG I1

4.11 Under the first EGRG, the government initiated four policy actions critical to
consolidate recent progress in developing the legal framework. These were: (i) the adoption
by the Council of Ministers of the draft Organic Law for Budget and a Public Accounting
Decree; (ii) the installation of the budget preparation and execution modules of the SIGFIP
system in the budget units of the central administration to,improve efficiency and transparency in
budget execution; (iii) the preparation of the 2009 Budget under the new WAEMU-based budget
classification to improve and make more transparent the presentation of budget allocations; and




                                            -21 -
(iv) the conduct by the General Finance Inspectorate of control missions for the payment of civil
service wages over sectoral Ministries' personnel data for at least half of all Mini~tries.'~

4.12 The proposed EGRG I1 would support the continuation of this agenda by focusing
on critical actions needed to make operational the legal and institutional changes supported by
the first EGRG and further strengthen controls of the wage bill. The proposed actions are also
consistent with recommendations from analytical work, and Government's already evident
commitment to implement them, through the EU-supported PARAP and PEMFAR (see Section
4). Prior actions would include:

              (i) The submission to Recipient's Parliament of the draft Organic Law for Budget
                  Framework;

              (ii) The adoption by the Council of Ministries of: (i) a decree defining the
                   organization, attributions and functioning of the Recipient's Financial Controller;
                   and (ii) a decree reorganizing the Recipient's Budget General Directorate and
                   redefining its attributions;

              (iii) The Recipient's Council of Ministers has adopted a decree: (i) defining the role of
                   administrative and financial officers in all of its ministries and public entities in
                   accordance with the Public Accounts Decree;

              (iv) The issuance by the Ministry of Finance of a manual of procedures for budget
                  execution for the use of all Recipient's ministries;

              (v) The Recipient's Ministers of Finance and of Public Administration Reform have jointly
                   selected an appropriate IT payroll system to be acquired, installed and integrated within
                   SIGFIP ratified by the Recipient's Council of Ministers; and

              (vi) The Recipient's Council of Ministers has adopted: (i) a draft bill approving the new
                   procurement code defining the regulatory and control functions thereof in line with
                   WAEMU's procurement directives; and (ii) an official communication establishing the
                   Recipient's central procurement unit.

4.13 Ongoing dialogue between the authorities, the Bank and other donors are seeking to
broaden the PFM reform agenda to the extent that capacity constraints allow. A recent
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) explored the
need and scope for progress in other areas, including measures to improve budget preparation,
ensure budget comprehensiveness, foster transparency and public availability of information on
the budget and its execution, strengthen internal and external controls on the budget process and
public accounts, as well as initial steps towards developing a medium-term expenditure
framework. A comprehensive multi-year action plan drawing on the recommendations of the
PEMFAR is expected to be prepared in early 2010. The preparation of the Action Plan will also
identify and evaluate the considerable capacity building efforts needed to implement medium-
term reforms, and assist the authorities of Guinea-Bissau in soliciting donor support.


" This was a stop-gap measure to strengthen controls of the wage bill, by helping prune the payroll database from obvious
inconsistencies between entered data and actual physical presence of employees, ahead of a PARAP-supported biometric census
of the civil service, and the implementation of a unified payroll systedpersonnel management system.

                                                       - 22 -
4.14 Expected results. The specific measures supported by the proposed programmatic series
are expected to contribute to (i) the adoption of a modern and stable legal and accounting
framework for public financial management that is consistent with good international practices,
(ii) the operation of the Integrated Financial Management System that enhances budget
execution, monitoring and reporting, and (iii) the strengthening of some actionable control
instruments on the payroll, the most important expenditure category, as well as on non payroll
spending. With the legal framework largely in place, and initial progress in operating SIGFIP,
observable outcomes should include increased readability in budget data owing to the reliance on
an improved budget classification system, stricter compliance with budget procedures and related
improvements in budget execution, higher effectiveness in internal controls, more frequent
disclosure of budget execution and debt data, better control on the payroll and faster turnaround
time to prepare annual accounts for the external control of the Tribunal de Contas. Specific
outcomes for the proposed grant are detailed in Annex 3.

4.15 Guinea-Bissau scores very low on internationally recognized measures of ease of
doing business, being the lowest of any country in WAEMU and third from the bottom in the
world overall. At the broadest level, political instability and fiscal fiagility have undermined the
rule of law and security of property; have aggravated the huge infrastructure deficits - energy, ,
the port, and roads; have fostered a policy environment marked by reversals and uncertainty, and
the blurring of political accountability; and have contributed to exacerbate severe capacity
shortcomings in the public administration.

4.16 This plank complements other Bank initiatives to improve the provision of
infrastructure. Direct Bank investment instruments as the Multi-Sector Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project (for which an additional finance proposal is being prepared in parallel with
the EGRG 11) aims at addressing the infrastructure challenges of the country. Work under a
previous Bank-supported private sector development project, and a recent Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study have gone a long way in identifying which economic sectors were the most
promising candidates of a medium-term growth rebound in Guinea-Bissau, being either sectors
where the country possesses comparative advantages-agriculture, biodiversity and fisheries, or
mining-or sectors that constitute a significant constraint to private investment-nergy         and
transport, especially the port. In this context, recognizing that the elimination of severe
infrastructure bottlenecks is the top country priority to foster growth and poverty reduction, this
proposed operation supports targeted reforms directed to facilitate the development of business
and improve the regulatory framework for the provision of infrastructure by the private sector.

4.17 At a more narrow level, the legal and administrative environment for business
remains weak and unstable. Here too, Guinea-Bissau still needs to complete its transition from
the legal and institutional framework inherited from colonial times towards one reflecting its
regional commitments toward integration. Important progress was already achieved in 2008
with the adoption by the Council of Ministers of draft Laws enacting into national law nine
OHADA Acts, while a Commercial Tribunal has also been established and judges have been
trained. l8 There was strong progress in developing a new legal and regulatory framework for the
telecommunications sector, for which only the final steps need to be taken-steps that are critical

'*The offices of the Tribunal have been opened and the new judges have been formally integrated as civil servants, but their
investiture is under the purview of the Supreme Court of Guinea-Bissau.

to seal progress in one of the authorities' most successful reform efforts and would send a much
needed signal of government commitment to fostering private sector-led growth under a good
practice regulatory framework and securing an open and even playing field and arms-length
public sector involvement for a rapidly expanding and employment generating sector. The
authorities have prepared legislation for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), drawing on support
from the Bank's PPIAF. In a country with deep infrastructure deficits, precarious finances, and
                         '


limited internal managerial capacity, PPPs are viewed as potentially critical instruments to attract
finance, technology and management skills in sectors such as the port, airport, railway
transportation, and energy.

4.18 Incomplete reforms in the legal and regulatory framework have also prevented the
development of a level playing field for private investors. The Investment Code of 1991,
itself an improvement over a previous law, was rife with potential for abuse and discretionary
preferential treatment. Regarded by government and private partners as obsolete, it was recently
replaced by a revised draft Code developed with FIAS assistance. The new Code ensures that
incentives are considered automatic, removing the discretion that could be exercised by
government officials under the old law; that there is no discrimination among projects on the
basis of size; that the multiplicity of investment regimes is eliminated to remove confusion and
reduce fraud and evasion; and that the opacity of rules regarding sanctions and the uncertainty
with which they were applied are ended. Fiscal risks related to tax incentives would also be
mitigated with the consolidation of incentives and taxes in an automatic and transparent manner.
Once the Investment Code is adopted into law by Parliament, the authorities will adopt its
implementing regulations, and initiate a reform action plan to transform and modernize the
Investment Promotion Directorate of the Ministry of Economy.

4.19 Completing the legal transition is expected to be a multi-year undertaking, going
beyond the timeframe of the proposed operation. The transition will require not only the
adoption `of relevant legal texts, but the development of judicial and administrative structures and
practices that allow the laws to become operational-some of which was supported under the
IDA-financed Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project-and it will also require
that legal information becomes accessible to the population.

4.20 In addition to the preeminent roles of political instability and dilapidated
infrastructure, red tape is also another impediment to private sector investment and
growth. In the global 2010 Doing Business Report, Guinea-Bissau was ranked at the 181St       place
out of 183 countries. The series of procedures that must be followed to open a business takes a
very long time (16 procedures taking 213 days), and the costs and delays involved contribute to
discouraging private sector activity, domestic or foreign-in fact, on the "starting a business"
indicator in the 2010 Doing Business Report, Guinea-Bissau is ranked at the 183th place. Red
tape, especially complex tax payment procedures, also foster informality: a large percentage of
micro firms in Guinea-Bissau (defined as firms with less than 5 employees) cite the
administrative burden linked to the payment of taxes and the financial costs of registration as
reasons for not registering. Regulations and procedures applicable to employing workers and
registering property are also among the world's most rigid in Guinea-Bissau-on these two
indicators, Guinea-Bissau was ranked respectively at the 175fhand 177thplace in the 2010 Doing
Business Report. Outside the capital city, there is a complete absence of such services as
notaries that are required to register a business. Procedures are based on a statist approach
towards control and regulation of the private sector, relying on ex ante controls requiring onerous

                                             - 24 -
bureaucratic procedures with little or no capacity for regulatory follow up. Moreover, the large
gap between requirements and enforcement capacity creates incentives on firms to avoid the
legal requirements, and incentives on officials to seek compensation for turning a blind eye.
Simplifying legal requirements would go a long way towards bridging the gap with enforcement
capacity, and improving governance in the public sector by removing opportunities for rent
seeking.

4.21 The government views the improvement of the business environment as a critical
prerequisite to boost economic growth and reduce widespread poverty in the country. Its
private sector development agenda is reflected in the PRSP, has been built over several years on
the basis of successive diagnostic studies and consultations with stakeholders (including in a
2007 Public-Private Forum meeting) and has benefitted from technical support under the IDA-
funded Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project.

Prior Actions under the Proposed EGRG I1

4.22 Under the first EGRG, the government initiated three policy actions judged to be
critical to advance reforms in private sector development, namely: (i) the adoption by the
Council of Ministers of nine OHADA acts of business law; (ii) the adoption by the Council of
Ministers of a draft Investment Code consistent with good international practices to promote a
level-playing field among private investors and remove discretion in the granting of fiscal
privileges for investment; and (iii) the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the draft Law on
Public-Private Partnerships, thus sending a much needed signal of Government commitment to
fostering private sector-led growth.

4.23   The proposed EGRG I1 would support the continuation of this agenda through:

       (vi)     the adoption by the Council of Ministers of a decree simplifying procedures for
                business registration;

       (vii)    the adoption by the Council of Ministries of a decree establishing the formal
                constitution of a one-stop shop for business registration; and

       (viii)   the enactment by the President of the Republic of the Telecommunications Law
                adopted by the Recipient's Parliament on March 9,2010.

4.24 The first two measures aim to lay the basis for a reduction in the costs and delays in
business registration, thus reinforcing the impact of the ongoing legal reforms on the
investment climate. The third measure would help cast into law the authorities' regulatory
framework for telecommunications, thus supporting a rapidly expanding and employment
generating sector.

4.25 Expected Results. The reform measures supported by the programmatic series are
expected to lay the foundations for a more stable, simple and transparent legal and policy
environment for private investment, for reduced transactions costs for paying taxes and creating
new firms, for progress toward a level playing field for all (domestic and foreign) private
investors, and, to some extent as well, for the mitigation of fiscal risks on the budget associated
with the granting of fiscal privileges-discretionary or statutory-to private investors. The
modernization and alignment on regional norms of business laws, Investment Code and Public-

                                             -25-
Private Partnership laws and the expected reduction in red tape are two critical building blocks
toward the gradual improvement in the environment for business in Guinea-Bissau, both
complementary to progress on the political and macroeconomic stability fronts and on
infrastructure rehabilitation. Specific outcomes for the proposed grant are detailed in Annex 3.

    5. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S CORE REFORM PROGRAM

                           A. LINKS THE INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE
                                  TO

5.1      The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) discussed by the Board in June 2009 sets out the
Bank Group's support to the government's reform program for the period FY09-10. The
ISN aims at helping the Government address select and immediate challenges within the
confines of IDA'S limited resource envelope for the country by supporting the Government in its
efforts to implement a basic transitional program in a challenging environment. Its goals are
aligned with the 2006 poverty reduction strategy, the DENARP, and the Government Program,
and articulated around two pillars: (i) strengthening economic management and laying the
foundations for growth in existing productive sectors, and (ii) increasing access to and quality of
basic services. Capacity development will be a cross cutting theme, and building partnerships a
guiding principle. The ISN foresees the use of this development policy operation, investment
projects and trust fund resources, and the undertaking of analytical and advisory activities.

5.2    By contributing directly or indirectly to the first two pillars of the PRSP, the
proposed operation is an integral part of the Bank Group's strategy and is seen as an
important step in helping stabilize the economic situation in Guinea-Bissau, support economic
recovery and pave the way for achieving the HIPC completion point. In particular, the EGRG
supports the core objectives and expected outcomes of the ISN of strengthening economic
management with its focus on improving governance, transparency and efficiency in public
expenditure management, and that of laying foundations for improvements in productive sector
by advancing legal and administrative reforms aimed at fostering private sector development.

               Box 5.1: The Case for a New Donor Engagement Model:
                      A High Impact Program in Guinea-Bissau

With a population of 1.6 million, Guinea-Bissau is a small and one of the poorest countries in the
World. In 2009, its per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was US$550. It has one of the
highest poverty rates, with 2/3 of its population living under the national poverty line, and over half
the population living under the $2 dollar-a-day. The country ranked 173rd out of 182 countries on
the 2009 UNDP Human Development Index. More worrisome, medium-term trends have not been
favorable. While Africa and the West Africa Region have reasonably managed to seize new
economic opportunities in recent years, Guinea-Bissau has not. Its economic growth over the last
decade has lagged both the regional and continental averages. In the ten years since the 1998-99
internal conflict-a conflict that is estimated to have cut national income by 25 percent-conomic
growth has barely exceeded -population growth. Infrastructure has decayed in several areas,
notably energy and the port. The country's entire public power system is operating on less than 5
megawatts of generation capacity-20 percent of what it had been before the conflict. The port of
Bissau is in need of major rehabilitation, lest its poor performance continues to translate into a
large and growing wedge between domestic and international prices for the sole export commodity
currently produced in Bissau, cashew nuts. Social and economic stagnation are likely to persist
unless major reforms are undertaken. Overall, the achievement of most Millennium Development
Goals is out of reach, and will remain so well beyond the 2015 horizon.

Guinea-Bissau has been locked in a political, governance and economic trap and it is becoming
increasingly evident that a different, more forceful approach to foreign assistance is needed to
break the country low equilibrium. The Bank Interim Strategy Note, discussed at the Board in June
2009, called, in particular, for a Bank-supported High Impact Program designed to achieve
transformative change in key sectors of the economy, including agriculture, energy and transport
infrastructure, to be implemented over a 3-5 year period. That program would be the Bank's
contribution to a wider, multi-donor, medium-term engagement to help Guinea-Bissau to abandon
its low equilibrium trap of political instability, weak governance and low economic growth.

A High Impact Program could rest on two main pillars: boosting economic growth ind fostering
stronger institutions. The first pillar covers a few select areas where government-led, donor-
funded, private sector-supported interventions, albeit of a more forceful type than in the past, could
help boost the economy and take Guinea-Bissau to a higher growth path. Work under a previous
Bank-supported private sector development project, and a recent Diagnostic Trade Integration
Study have gone a long way in identifying which economic sectors were the most promising
candidates of a medium-term growth rebound in Guinea-Bissau, being either sectors where the
country possesses comparative advantages-agriculture, biodiversity and fisheries, or mining-or
sectors that constitute a significant constraint to private investment-nergy             and transport,
especially the port. The focus on a second pillar draws mainly on the Bank's experience on fragile
States, and it rests on three inter-related premises: that a less fragile private-led economy demands
a less fragile State, that growth in a fragile country is more than the sum of growth in a few key
sectors, and that the growth impact of a boost to sector hardware will only be short-lived, as
Guinea-Bissau's experience itself evidenced in the past decade, if that boost is not accompanied by
a rapid upgrade in the essential software of good State governance. This will require a range of
undertakings-reforms and capacity building-to achieve financial normalization of the State,
strengthen public institutions, foster transparency, and promote accountability in a low-capacity
environment, drawing on all available public and civil society resources.

                B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

5.3      The staffs of the IDA and the IMF collaborate closely on Guinea-Bissau. IDA
typically takes the lead on sectoral issues, including private sector development, while the IMF
takes the lead on macroeconomic policies. Both institutions support structural reforms in public
finance, and staffs collaborate in identifying and supporting reforms in budget systems,
accounting and treasury. The specific PFM reforms supported by the proposed operation are
fully consistent with IMF policy and technical advice. Moreover, efforts are made to ensure
complementarities between Fund and Bank supported reforms: first, the Fund takes the lead in
tax policy and administration, while reforms under the proposed operation focus on expenditure
management; second, Fund-led reforms aim at addressing structural issues critical to improving
fiscal policy outcomes, while Bank-led reforms aim at addressing foundational and systems
issues that underpin the authorities' capacity to implement their PRSP. The staffs also intend to
closely collaborate on the preparation of a structural agenda that could be supported by both
institutions in the context of a three-year program under the Fund's ECF, and in the preparation
of the HIPC Completion Point and DSA.

5.4     As indicated above, the EU is supporting the implementation of the security sector
reform and is funding a technical assistance project for the reform of the public
administration. On the former, the EU is funding the establishment of a permanent mission and
army downsizing. The UN-Peace Building Commission is providing complementary support.
Also, the EU is supporting the authorities in designing a comprehensive multi-year reform action
plan to reform and modernize the public administration and reduce its size. A project unit was
put in place in 2008.

5.5     Engagement from other donors is evolving towards a more harmonized approach.
Guinea-Bissau still benefits from financial support from a range of aid agencies with different,
often uncoordinated instruments, given the complex political environment and uneven
macroeconomic performance. In addition to the EU, project or budget support has been provided
by UN organizations, regional economic organizations (WAEMU, the BCEAO) and
development banks (African Development Bank, West African Development Bank) and bilateral
donors, including Portugal, Spain and France. All donors currently align their budget support on
the policy platform and performance assessments of the EPCA-supported program. A
framework agreement among donors, the Bank and IMF providing budget support has been set
up in 2009 to ensure better coordination and information sharing. The recently completed
PEMFAR, a joint undertaking with the African Development Bank and the EU office in Bissau,
will also provide an important opportunity for enhancing collaboration with other donors
aligning donor technical assistance on the country's key PFM and public administration reform
priorities.

   c.     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL
                                                           UNDERPINNINGS

5.6     The proposed development policy grant builds on and complements other Bank
capacity building and investment operations. The PSD plank of the proposed operation builds
in its entirety on a multi-year program of analytical, policy and technical assistance supported
under the IDA Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project (PSRDP); this project has
been instrumental in advancing far-reaching legal and policy reforms including the preparation
of business laws consistent with the OHADA Acts, the Investment Code and the proposed Law


                                           - 28 -
on PPP, privatization, and initiatives to improve the business climate based on project-supported
analytical work (including a 2007 update of a 2001 FIAS "road map" study of administrative
procedures for opening a business). The PFM policy plank of the proposed operation
complements capacity building activities funded under a past US$1.2 million LICUS grant
which closed in December 2008 and an ongoing US$1.7 million SPF grant approved in
December 2008. The operation also complements, in its development objectives, a multi-sector
infrastructure project, funding the restoration of a minimum of critical investment requirements
in transport and energy infrastructure. The proposed DPO focuses on reforms that would
leverage actions supported through technical and financial assistance provided by these other
instruments and reinforce commitment to the reform agenda.

5.7    While the proposed operation does not provide direct support to the government
efforts in lessening infrastructure bottlenecks, it complements other Bank investment
lending operations supporting infrastructure sectors. In particular, improvements in
government budget predictability, expenditure management and procurement systems would
favor, in the medium term, a better execution of government infrastructure investment and
maintenance. In addition, it is expected that a more effective control of the payroll would
generate savings that could free up space to finance government infrastructure and social sector
investments. The selection of the PSD plank actions, focused on administrative and legal
procedures and regulatory frameworks to foster private sector activities, has taken into account
the fact that the Bank is already preparing an additional financing proposal under the Multi-
sector Rehabilitation Project (P097975) aimed at addressing the crucial electricity generation
shortfall.

5.8     A number of analytical studies provide the basis for the design of the proposed
operation. They include core diagnostic assessments by the World Bank in collaboration with
the government and other donors as well as various studies conducted by the government with
donor support. The studies include (i) Public Expenditure Reviews (2005 and 2006) and the 2006
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) which document fiscal policy issues as well as the numerous weaknesses in
PFM, and provide a range of recommendations on the legal framework and operational
approaches for reforms, on which this programmatic series of two development policy grants has
drawn extensively, including the adoption of WAEMU directives on PFM in national law and
the installation of an integrated PFM system; and (ii) various FIAS studies and project
documents and aide-memoire of the IDA-financed private sector PSRD Project, which have
provided analytical background and specific recommendations on business environment reforms,
the investment code and other PSD reforms. Project-related studies, as well as early input from a
planned Investment Climate Assessment, have all confirmed the crucial roles of political and
macroeconomic instability, business environment and infrastructure deficits as impediments to
private investment. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study also highlighted red tape and related
petty corruption as a barrier to private activity and investment. In addition, (PEMFAR), recently
completed, and drawing on an early 2009 EU-supported Public Expenditure Financial
Accountability (PEFA) Diagnostic Assessment provides: (i) an updated diagnostic analysis of
the current strengths and weaknesses in the country's public financial management system and
practices, including public procurement; (ii) a considerable range of inputs for the design and
preparation of the next phase of the PFM and public procurement reform strategy; and (iii) a
rating of all key components of the PFM and procurement system against international
benchmarks which can be used to judge future progress of PFM reforms.

                                                    LESSONS

5.9    The design of the proposed operation has benefited from a number of lessons drawn
from guidance from Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) and the implementation of
a Low Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) grant on PFM reforms, the PSRD project, the
Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit, a quick disbursing credit of US$25 million that
supported the implementation of Guinea-Bissau's National Reconciliation and Reconstruction
Program and which closed in June 2004, and the EGRG I. Key lessons are highlighted below:

    There is a need for a realistic program design to avoid overloading the very limited
    institutional and implementation capacity of Guinea-Bissau. Thus, selectivity in objectives
    that are mutually enhancing and realism in targeted outcomes are important to keep the
    program focused on fundamentals of the reform agenda;"
    Fragile states may require more detailed implementation programs than usually seen in other
    development policy operations, particularly during periods of political transition. Detailed
    action planning and monitoring may be needed to help the government and program partners
    track progress, address bottlenecks and adjust to delays in program implementation; and
    Financing for policy reforms should not rely on conditionality alone to catalyze and
    implement reforms. To be fully effective, the policy dialogue must be supported by other
    instruments that identify institutional weaknesses and help build country capacity step by
    step (OPCS, 2001). As indicated above, the proposed operation is complemented by support
    and technical assistance provided by other ongoing Bank instruments (see paragraph 5.7).

                                   6. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                           A. OPERATION
                                                      DESCRIPTION

6.1   The proposed operation of SDR4 million (US$6 million equivalent) in pilot CRW
resources is the second of a programmatic series of two Economic Governance Reform
Grants (EGRGs) for the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. This one-tranche development policy
IDA grant is equivalent to about 1 percent of projected GDP and about 2 percent of total
government expenditures in 20 10.

6.2     The main development objectives of the proposed grant are to: (i) promote
efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through improved
budget and public financial management (PFM); and (ii) improve specific aspects of the
investment climate, including streamline procedures for business registration and targeted
reforms of the legal framework. The development objectives are consistent with pillars 1 (good
governance, macroeconomic stability, public administration reform) and 2 (private sector-led
growth) of the government's national development program outlined in its DENARP.

6.3   The proposed EGRG I1 would support selected reform measures in the
government's program described in Section 5 and in its Letter of Development Policy
(LDP) (Annex 2) that are deemed essential for its successful implementation. The rationale for

their selection has been discussed in the previous sections, namely their importance to the
achievement of the program development objectives, the relation with other Bank activities and
expressed government's commitment and feasibility. Several principles underpin the design of
the operation and the specific choice of policy areas and measures that it supports:

       Drawing on Bank lessons for engagement in fragile states, the design of conditionality
       reflects first and foremost a high degree of selectivity, with a focus on a small number of
       measures that are technically ready, and feasible given the complex political and
       institutional context. In particular, the operation focuses on a select number of concrete
       reforms that (i) are backed by extensive analytical work, (ii) have been subject to
       repeated consultations with stakeholders, (iii) have benefitted from technical assistance,
       and/or (iv) are leveraging reforms supported by other Bank and donors instruments (such
       as the CFAA-CPAR and PEMFAR diagnostic reports, a SPF Economic Governance
       Support Grant, and the Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project);
       To avoid placing an excessive burden on the government's thin capacity for policy
       formulation and implementation, yet ensure that its overall program has no critical gaps,
       reforms supported by the operation are consistent and complementary with undertakings
       under the IMF Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance and Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
       programs and with activities funded under the EU supported Public Administration
       Reform program.

       The operation focuses on PFM and business law reforms that constitute the
       implementation of fundamental commitments towards regional integration that
       successive governments of Guinea-Bissau have made in the past decade. While the pace
       of implementation of these commitments has been and may continue to be delayed by
       political instability and even suffer from occasional backtracking, their general direction
       has not been questioned by successive governments and enjoys broad political support.
       PFM reforms follow this principle, as Guinea-Bissau has only recently started to
       implement its legal, economic and institutional commitments under WAEMU. Similarly,
       business law reforms rest on the country's commitments under OHADA.

6.4     As indicated in para. 4.3, the proposed operation focuses on selected PFM and
investment climate reforms which are mutually reinforcing to help break the current vicious
circle of political instability, weak governance, low economic growth and fragile finances.

6.5    There have been some limited adjustments in the selection of prior actions for
EGRG-I1 relative to the triggers envisaged for this second operation at the time of the first
operation, EGRG-I. These adjustments were made to take into account exogenous factors not
under control of the Government, or capacity constraints that have affected the speed of program
implementation. Specifically, technical issues that have arisen on the building up of the payroll
system resulted in the postponement of the planned acquisition and installation of a new payroll
system and political developments in advancing consensus-seeking discussions between the
executive and judiciary branches of government over the reform of the Court of Accounts
(Tribunal de Contas). The authorities remain committed to move forward on both fronts.
Portugal has offered to finance the acquisition and installation of the payroll system. A medium-
term program for strengthening the Court of Accounts has been discussed in the context of the
PEMFAR and will require legal and operational reforms, backed up by significant capacity


                                           -31 -
building. In the meantime, the proposed procurement reforms would significantly strengthen
oversight and control over public procurement transactions.

                         Box 6.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The reform agenda underpinning the proposed operation is rooted in both the fundamental commitments
of successive governments towards regional integration (under the West African Economic and Monetary
Union and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Laws in Africa) and on the country's own
PRSP which was prepared through a highly participatory and consultative process. For the latter,
stakeholder consultative workshops and focus group discussions were held with representatives of the
public and private sectors and civil society, down to the level of local communities. There has also been
extensive analytical work which has informed policy formulation, and further consultation exercises, such
as a 2007 Public-Private Forum.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework
There are only a limited number of financial partners involved in providing budget support, facilitating
joint understanding of areas of common and special interest (see paras. 5.3-5.5). A framework agreement
among donors providing budget support has been set up to ensure better coordination and information
sharing. The recently completed PEMFAR will also provide an important opportunity for enhancing
collaboration with other donors aligning donor technical assistance on the country's key PFM reform
priorities.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy matrix was developed in close coordination with the government, thus ensuring that it reflects
the government's expressed policy intentions and the country circumstances - including weak capacity
for policy formulation and implementation. The design of policy reforms has been backed by analytical
work and technical assistance in place. Most of the reforms are longstanding and ongoing government
initiatives which were prioritized in the PRSP. Donor coordination on the budget support has reduced
transaction costs and the expected timing of the IDA disbursement is aligned with the government's
domestic budgeting process.

Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
Prior actions for the proposed grant focus on a selected number of measures that are critical to achieving
the objectives of the government's reform program as detailed in Section 5 (see details in para. 6.3).

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
The existing institutional structure for the PRSP process will be used to implement and monitor the policy
reforms supported by the proposed development policy operation. The limited number of active
development partners providing budget support allows for easy coordination and monitoring of actions
and progress reviews of the implementation of the policy matrix. After the disbursement of its single
tranche, IDA plans to continue working with the government and other participating development
partners to monitor implementation and help determine whether adjustments to the policy matrix need to
be made to take into account the latest country developments, stakeholder support and alternative options
for realizing the intended development goals. The disbursement of the proposed IDA grant is targeted
towards mid CY 10, in line with the domestic budgeting process which is based on the calendar year. The
disbursed funds are expected to be used in filling the CY 10 budget financing gap.

                                        B. MONITORING

6.7     The government's program matrix in Annex 3 contains baseline and target values
including performance monitoring indicators for the EGRG series supported actions. The
EGRG I1 will focus on 6 indicators on public financial management, and 3 on private sector
development, for a total of 9 indicators (see Annex 3). The indicators on public financial
management consist mainly of measures of improved performance in budget execution,
compliance with new procedures, and reporting, several drawing on a recent PEFA assessment.20
In particular, the program will monitor progress in compliance with defined calendars for budget
formulation and approval, and on the active participation of the different ministries in this
process. The PEFA assessment of 2008 indicated that the Guinea-Bissau budget preparation
suffers frequent and long and limited participation of sector ministries, departments and
agencies. As a result, the PEFA assessment rated the orderliness and participation in the annual
budget preparation with the score C (the second lowest score). The actions supported by the
proposed operation, specially the implementation of the Organic Budget Law aims at improving
the orderliness and participation in the budget formulation. The target on this area is to improve
the PEFA score from C to C+ or B in 20 10.

6.8     The PEFA assessment on Guinea-Bissau PFM also found an even more precarious
situation regarding the effectiveness of internal controls for non salary expenditures.
Committed controls and rules are generally lacking or are frequently violated. As a result, this
category was rated with a D+ score. The series of decrees, creating the Financial Controller,
defining the roles of credit managers and public accountants and the issuance of the manual of
procedures for budget preparation are directed at enhancing internal controls for budget
execution. The expected target on this area is to improve the PEFA indicator to C in 2010. In
addition, it is expected that 50 percent of the ministries will be using the manual of procedures
for budget preparation.

6.9     The indicators on private sector development are measures of the depth of
administrative barriers to private investment, including the number of days and procedures to
start a business, which would be easily monitored through reviews of government procedures
and surveys of business climate (as the Doing Business) and the approval and implementation of
the law on the telecom sector that is aimed at fostering competition and transparency.




20
   PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability), is an integrated monitoring framework that allows
measurement of country Public Financial Management performance over time. It comprises six core dimensions of
PFM performance containing 3 1 indicators measuring the operational performance of the key elements of the PFM
systems. A rating that varies from "A" (the highest score) to "D" (the lowest score), is set for each one of the 31
indicators.

                                                                        A. COUNTRY

7.1     The proposed operation is fully owned by the authorities. Extensive discussions were
held with key successive government counterparts in developing the reform agenda of the
operation. The specific reforms supported by the operation and detailed in the government's
Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 2) are critical elements of its national development
strategy as outlined in the country's PRSP. The PRSP was the result of an extensive participatory
and consultative process. Stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions were held with
representatives of the public and private stakeholders and civil society, reaching down to the
level of communities. Workshops and public consultations strengthened the PRSP in two main
aspects: (i) awareness by the population of infrastructure needs which made the resolution of
infrastructure weaknesses a top priority of the strategy and; (ii) the introduction of local
mechanisms for the implementation of the PRSP.

7.2   Specific workshops and public consultations were held on several components of the
agenda supported by the EGRG-11. A recent (February 2010) validation workshop for the
PEMFAR diagnostic report was held in Bissau. Discussions during this .workshop clearly

                                                                                           - 36 -
confirmed the government's commitment, and stakeholders' support, to accelerate the reforms
proposed in the PEMFAR report, some of which are supported by the proposed operation. Also
in February, a workshop to discuss the implementation of the one-stop-shop was held in Bissau.
Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture of Guinea-Bissau
(Cdmara de Come`rcio de Guinea Bissau), the largest private sector organization, participated in
the event and strongly supported the agenda of business entry simplification and the one-stop-
shop (Centro de Formaqiib de Empresas) supported by the proposed operation. An agreement
letter has been signed by the Ministries of Justice, Finance, Economy and Industry, Commerce
and Tourism and the Guinea-Bissau's Chamber of Commerce. The agreement letter includes a
set of suggestions that have been incorporated in the decree that was presented to the Council of
Ministries establishing the formal constitution of the one-stop shop.

                                 B.   POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

7.3    The reform measures supported by the proposed EGRG I1 are expected to have a
positive direct impact on poverty reduction. The EGRG I1 builds on the findings of the May
2006 World Bank report "Integrated Poverty and Social Assessment (IPSA), Vol. 11, Conflict,
Livelihoods and Poverty in Guinea-Bissau" that found that poverty is widespread (66 percent of
the population in 2006), with a higher incidence in rural areas, and that more than 90 percent of
urban families live essentially from activities in the informal sector, or of a mix of informal and
formal, mainly public sector, activities.

7.4      Currently, the quantitative measurement of the poverty impact of government
interventions is limited by the weak statistical capacity of the country that prevents the
monitoring and evaluation of government policies. In this respect, the Bank expects to support
a priority statistical program related to the most urgent data needs, namely economic statistics,
poverty, social statistics, including household survey program to strengthen the-country
statistical development with possible funding under the Bank's Trust Fund for Statistical
Capacity Building (TFSCB). This would allow the monitoring of poverty and other
socioeconomic indicators and the quantitative measurement of government policies and reforms
supported by the Bank.

7.5     From a qualitative perspective, there are likely indirect positive distributional
effects from the improved public financial management and private sector development
reforms which the proposed operation supports. Specifically, efforts to improve the capacity
of the State to implement its budget priorities and strengthen public financial management would
help restore fiscal stability, enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in public
resource use, and increase the country's absorption capacity for external resources. In the short
run, given the lingering risks of negative impacts of the global financial crisis on government
revenues, the grant would help fund the provision of basic public services with a beneficial
impact on the poor as its resources will guarantee the regular payment of civil servants' wages
and domestic suppliers and avoid a damaging interruption in the provision of social services.

7.6      In the medium run, to reduce poverty and improve income distribution consistently,
it is critical to increase the coverage and quality of education and health services as well as
the access of the poor to basic infrastructure services, all of which are mainly provided by
the government. Indeed., to the extent that the policy reforms supported by the proposed
operation will help Guinea-Bissau to resume fiscal sustainability, increase the government fiscal


                                            - 37 -
space for investments and enhance the efficiency on the use of public resources, the operation
would have a positive impact on the government's ability to increase access to and the quality of
social and infrastructure services removing a critical impediment to investment, growth and
poverty reduction.

7.7     The prior actions supported by this operation do not have negative impact on the
poor. The operation supports. operational measures on personnel management such as the
completion of the biometric survey of civil servants, the identification and appropriate handling
of irregularities found by the biometric survey and the acquisition of a new human resource
system that will allow a better control of personnel expenses. In this regard, the proposed
operation's focus is strictly on supporting efforts to remove irregularities, such as ghost workers
and double dippers and therefore has not envisaged measures negatively affecting legitimate
employment and earnings prospects of civil servants.21 In addition, the government's civil
service administration strategy, which is still at an initiation stage, is supported by the European
Union (EU) and encompasses compensation schemes for potential losses. Furthermore, given the
distributional implications of reforms in human resource management which is the most
important and unavoidable medium term challenge faced by the Guinea-Bissau government, a
stakeholder assessment to understand the view of the different actors and potential reaction to the
civil service reform and a government communication strategy will be needed to be built as part
of the preparation of the ground if the government were committed with this difficult reform.
The measures targeted by the operation to foster private sector development--largely of a
regulatory and institutional nature--would contribute to boost private investment and business
creation, and increase labor demand with positive sustainable impacts on poverty.

                                            C. ENVIRONMENTAL
                                                         ASPECTS

7.8     The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy operation,
which are mainly regulatory and institutional, are not likely to have significant positive or
negative effects on the country's environment, forests and other natural resources. The
priority environment issues in the country include depletion of fish resources and risks associated
with potential future mining development projects. The PFM and PSD reforms supported by the
proposed operation are unlikely to either exacerbate these problems significantly or contribute to
their remediation.

                            D.   IMPLEMENTATION,          MONITORING EVALUATION
                                                                   AND

7.9    The existing institutional structure for the DENARP process will be used to
implement and monitor the policy reforms supported by the proposed development policy
operation. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, jointly with the Project
Implementation Unit of the PSRDP, will assume overall responsibility for coordinating the
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the policy matrix. They will be ultimately
responsible for reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned Ministries
and agencies. The government's policy matrix presented in Annex 3 identifies ministerial
departments for each policy reform and benchmark outcome indicators. The Council of Ministers
provides overall guidance for the budget support program. Periodic stakeholders consultations

   While cuts in illicit payments are not expected to be large in aggregate terms, it is fair to say that, because of their
illicit nature and limited poverty data, it is almost impossible to trace out the full impact of these cuts on the poor,
some of which may partly and indirectly benefit from

contemplated in the implementation of the Bank ISN will serve to provide additional feedback
on the impact of the proposed operation.

7.10 The limited number of active development partners providing budget support
allows for easy coordination and monitoring of actions and progress reviews of the
implementation of the policy matrix. After the disbursement of its single tranche, IDA plans to
continue working with the government and other participating development partners to monitor
implementation and help determine whether adjustments to the policy matrix need to be made to
take into account the latest country developments, stakeholder support and alternative options for
realizing the intended development goals.

                                      E. FIDUCIARY
                                                 ASPECTS

7.1 1 The public financial management system in Guinea-Bissau remains weak. As
indicated in Section 4, conflict and political instability have taken a heavy toll on the critical
investments in the human and physical resources needed to operate the budget system and
conduct the kind of permanent reform agenda that is required to improve budget performance
and accountability on an ongoing basis. The improvement in fiduciary standards is a central
objective of the public financial management component of the proposed operation and the
government has made encouraging progress in these reforms. These measures are drawn from
the 2006 CFAA and other analytical inputs provided through technical assistance (and validated
by the 2009 PEMFAR), ongoing IDA and other donors' interventions for PFM capacity building
              )
(see Section 4 . Their implementation is closely monitored under this technical assistance and
under the ongoing dialogue between the government, the IMF, the Bank and other donors.
Lessons drawn from past diagnostics and ongoing implementation feed back in
recommendations, and will be incorporated in a revised multi-year reform agenda that the
Government is preparing being developed as part of the recently completed PEMFAR.

7.12 In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment of the BCEAO,
the common central bank of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes
Guinea-Bissau. The assessment found that progress had been made in strengthening the
BCEAO's safeguards framework since 2002 when the last safeguard assessment was undertaken.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO has improved the explanatory notes to the financial
statements and further changes are scheduled for the next fiscal year, with a view toward a
gradual alignment with International Accounting Standard, as adopted internationally by other
central banks. Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management and risk prevention have been established and follow-up on internal
and external audit recommendations has been strengthened. The assessment identified a number
of areas where further steps would help solidify the progress made in recent years. The main
recommendations relate to: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a formal rotation
policy and further enhancing the transparency of the financial statements by adopting IFRS in
full; and (ii) enhancing the effectiveness of the internal audit function by further strengthening
the reporting to management of the BCEAO. The status report of the implementation of
recommendations, received from the Bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress was
achieved.

                          ADMINISTRATION,       AND

7.13 Disbursement and accounting. The proposed operation would consist of a single
tranche grant of SDR4 million (US$6 million equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness and
disbursed on the basis of a withdrawal application. The proposed operation will follow IDA'S
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Upon approval of the Grant and
effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, the proceeds of the Grant would be disbursed by
CRW into a dedicated account of the Government for budget support. The proceeds of the Grant
would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the Agreement. The Recipient shall
ensure that upon the deposit of the Grant into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in
the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipient will
report to IDA on the amounts `deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local
currency to the budget management system. Assuming that the withdrawal request is in Foreign
Exchange, the equivalent amount in CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be based on the
market'rate at the date of the transfer. The Recipient will promptly notify IDA by fax or email
that such transfer has taken place, and that proceeds have been credited in a manner satisfactory
to IDA.

7.14 Auditing. Through the Ministry of Finance, the Recipient will (a) report the exact sum
received into the deposit account; (b) ensure that all withdrawals from the deposit account are for
budgeted public expenditures, except for purposes such as military expenditures or for other
items on IDA's negative list; (c) provide to IDA evidence that the CFA franc equivalent of the
grant proceeds was credited to the Treasury account and disbursements from that account were
for budgeted public expenditures. The dedicated deposit accounts could be audited on terms of
reference acceptable to IDA" with" Upon request from IDA, the dedicated deposit account shall
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA in accordance with consistently applied
auditing standards acceptable to IDA. If, after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of
the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require the recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b)
refund the amount directly to IDA. The Tribunal de Contas (Supreme Audit Institution) will
provide IDA with its annual report on the public accounts to the Parliament by the end of the
year following the execution of the budget. The expected closing date of the Grant is December
31,2010.

                                  G.   RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

7.15 In the current environment of the country emerging from conflict, the proposed
operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks. The Bank's active engagement in
Guinea-Bissau during this period of recovery is a high-risk and potentially high-gain enterprise.
The specific risks that could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of the proposed grant
relate to political and policy backsliding, macroeconomic performance, capacity constraints and
fiduciary risks. The greatest risk in this situation, however, would be failing to support the
stabilization and recovery process and missing a window of opportunity for helping to stabilize a
fragile country in a challenging .transition.

7.16 Political risks and policy slippage. Political instability could flare up again and
commitment to fiscal stabilization and to reforms, which has been demonstrated in the recent
past, could come under pressure either from within or from outside the winning political party,


                                            - 40 -
especially if tangible benefits of reforms do not become apparent to the population, or if costs of
reform to narrow constituencies become too high. To mitigate these risks, the UN and several
donors are supporting the country in its political transition (see the ISN for a more in depth
discussion of this risk). Also, reforms supported by the proposed operation have been chosen
carefully in the government's own PRSP, among measures that were technically ready (having
benefitted from extensive analytical work and proven technical assistance) and politically
achievable (having benefitted from numerous consultations with stakeholders and internal
governmental discussions). Most measures build on government's longstanding commitments
towards regional integration in the context of WAEMU and OHADA, which mitigates risks of
reversibility. Also, and in addition to public financial management reforms, the operation
supports efforts to prop up the development of the private sector to rekindle economic growth
and achieve visible results for the population.

7.17 Macroeconomic risk. A slower than expected recovery from the global slowdown could
undermine the country's already challenging stabilization efforts which rely heavily on high and
sustained donor support. In this context, the government's sustained commitment to fiscal
stabilization remains a potential risk, as the cash position of the government remains
extraordinarily tight. The proposed operation's financial support is itself a crucial element in
enabling the government to meet its financial obligations and execute its budget. This said,
given the vulnerability to exogenous shocks and the volatile global environment, the IMF and
IDA staff will continue to closely monitor the economic environment and macroeconomic
performance, and assist the authorities, if needed, to adjust the macroeconomic program.
Additional risks are a failure of the ECF-supported program to materialize (itself the result of
possible reform backsliding) or a lack of supply response from the private sector. The track
record of the successive governments in the last months shows that policy makers are committed
to restore and sustain fiscal discipline and a growth response is possible and to a rapid attainment
of the HIPC completion point. Furthermore, continued future donor engagement, in the context
of the IMF ECF arrangement, would help to support reformers' efforts to sustain fiscal
consolidation, a pre-requisite for a broader normalization of public sector performance. The PFM
reforms supported by the proposed operation will also help enhance controls in the execution of
overall and sectoral budget envelopes.

7.18 Capacity constraints. Public sector capacity constraints are considerable in Guinea-
Bissau and constitute a major challenge to successful implementation of the reform program.
The proposed operation seeks to mitigate this risk in several ways: first, the operation has a
focused coverage in terms of policy areas and number of reform measures; second, it emphasizes
building on ongoing initiatives as opposed to introducing new ones; and third, it relies
extensively on Bank and other donors instruments for alleviating capacity constraints, including
a SPF grant. The recent track record with both PFM and PSD reforms indicate that progress on
capacity building is possible but requires a long term donor engagement and sustained
government's political commitment.

7.19 Fiduciary risk. The financial management assessment has concluded that fiduciary risks
are substantial mainly because of political instability and governance issues. This risk is
mitigated by the focus of the proposed grant on the improvement in fiduciary standards and
continued IDA and other donors' assistance in public financial management and public
administration reforms which will help to improve budget execution processes over time. In this
respect, the recent PEMFAR, drawing on the EU-supported PEFA, provides benchmarks against

                                             -41 -
which to measure progress and identifies additional areas in need of remedial actions and
technical and financial assistance provided under the above mentioned SPF grant is expected to
facilitate the amelioration of fiduciary standards.

7.20 In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY-

Bissau, April 21,2010

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President
The World Bank
Washington, DC

Dear Mr. Zoellick:


This letter of development policies presents the government economic reform program in the
areas of public finance management and private sector development as part of our poverty
reduction strategy. This program focuses on actions directed to promote efficiency and
transparency in the use of public resources and to foster private sector development by reducing
barriers to the establishment of business in our country.
To guarantee the continuity and success of our reform program, it is necessary to request
financial assistance from the IBRD in the form of the Economic Governance Reform Grant. The
grant resources will finance expenditures in priority areas thus helping the government to secure
core services delivery. It is our belief that this program is fundamental to promote economic
growth and to improve the Guinea-Bissau population's quality of life, as an important initiative
to be supported by the World Bank group through this grant
Despite political uncertainty in the first half of 2009, Guinea-Bissau has been experiencing a
period of relative political and economic stability. After a decade of persistent instability and
political discontinuity that followed the 1999 Civil War, the peaceful presidential and legislature
elections in 2009 seem to have alleviated tensions and favored the consolidation of the new
administration. On the economy, Guinea-Bissau has weathered well the effects of the global
crisis. The structural reform agenda has been continued with important steps on public financial
management, civil service reform and private sector development. The upshot from the recent
episodes occurred in the begirining of April, seem to confirm the country's commitment and
aspiration to build a period of stability and peace.

This letter presents an overview of the socio-economic situation of Guinea Bissau, the
government actions undertaken in the last year that followed the reforms supported by the First
Economic Governance Reform Grant, the recent progress obtained in several areas and the
challenges in the next -years. While we recognize that this is only the beginning of a long way to
improve the government performance and to secure a more favorable environment for private
sector development, we believe that significant progress has been achieved in the last two years.
We welcome the support received from the World Bank through the Economic Governance
Reform Grant series and from other development partners to our government's reform agenda.




                                              - 50 -
Economic and Social Background

With a population of 1.5 million and a GDP of US$850 million, Guinea-Bissau is a small and
poor country. Since its independence in 1973, Guinea-Bissau has failed to construct a solid
foundation for socioeconomic development. The economy remains dependent on the agricultural
sector, thus being highly vulnerable to weather fluctuations. The lack of a robust domestic
market and the low competitiveness explain the low industrial development. As a result, public
administration and services mainly provided by informal economic units are the activities that
absorb most of the active economic population in the urban areas.
Economic growth has been disappointing in the last decade. Since the political and military
conflict in 1999, conflict that is estimated to have cut national income by 25 percent, economic
growth has barely exceeded population growth. Per capita GDP in 2007 was still about one sixth
below its 1999 level. Average total GDP growth over the period 1999-2007 stood at only about
1 percent per year, but this masks a high variability, with short periods of recovery followed by
sharp drops (-7 percent in 2002). Growth appears to have stabilized over the last four years, but
at a rate-an average real GDP growth rate around 2% percent-that is unlikely to translate into
a material difference in Guinea-Bissau's economic prospects and its population economic
aspirations.
Today Guinea-Bissau is one of the least developed countries in the world. In 2009, its Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita reached US$550 in 2009. The low economic growth
experienced in the last decades confers to the Guinea-Bissau's people one of the worst standards
of quality of life in the world. In 2009, Guinea-Bissau's Human Development Index ranks in the
173 position among the 182 United Nations countries. Chronic poverty is deep and entrenched-
66 percent of the population was estimated to be living under the $2 dollar-a-day poverty line in
2002 (the last time it was estimated), and 22 percent living in extreme poverty-with a higher
incidence in rural areas.
Permanent political instability with numerous security incidents and frequent changes in
governments and the resulting protracted failure to sustain good performance in macroeconomic
management and social progress have put Guinea-Bissau in this situation. Guinea-Bissau is not
only one of the poorest countries in the world, but the worrying thing is to know that it has
experienced a trend of relative socioeconomic deterioration. Thus, Guinea-Bissau seems to be
increasingly distancing itself from the rest of the world.
The poor performance of the public sector is one of the main causes for the country's precarious
economic and social conditions: Chronic fiscal disequilibria, poor policy choices and managerial
inefficiency are behind the inability of the government of Guinea-Bissau to improve the state's
economic and social situation.
Consequences of the ineffective state were clearly felt in the behavior of private economic
agents. A main driver of Guinea-Bissau's poor performance has been the uncertain investment
climate that had been brought about by several events related to government policy including the
default on the domestic private debt and the permanent generation of arrears with private se.ctor
providers.




                                             -51 -
Nonetheless, since 2009 Guinea-Bissau has been experiencing a period of uncommon political
and economic stability that is improving the country perspectives and generating cautious
optimism on its ability to improve its economic and social performance. After a decade of
persistent instability and political discontinuity that followed the 1999 political-military conflict,
the peaceful presidential and legislature elections in 2009 seem to have alleviated tensions and
favored the consolidation of the new administration. As a result, changes in government
authorities have been less frequent allowing the reduction of turning round of technical staff thus
creating the basis for the enhancement of government efficiency.
In this context, despite the difficult external environment and its political challenges, Guinea-
Bissau made progress in stabilizing its economy in 2009. Real GDP growth reached 2.9 percent
driven by a favorable cashew harvest and a pick-up in construction activity; inflation slowed, and
the budget was stabilized. In short, Guinea Bissau is at a turning point and keen to start focusing
on developing and implementing a structural reform to initiate a period of peace, economic
development and poverty alleviation.


The Government Reform Agenda in 2009-10

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) or DENARP is built in four pillars for government
action: i) enhancement of governance, modernization of public administration and
macroeconomic stability; ii) fostering economic growth and job creation; iii) strengthening the
access to social services and basic infrastructure and; iv) improvement of the living conditions of
vulnerable groups.

As the government is seeking World Bank support o the actions under the first and second pillars
through the Economic Governance Reform Grant we will refer only to those measures included in
those blocks. The measures prov.ided for under the first pillar are: (a) pursuance of improvements in
budgetary management; (b) strengthening macro-economic management; (c) public administration
reform; (d) capacity building; (e) promotion of efficient, transparent, accessible and independent
justice; (f) promotion of rural development and social cohesion; (g) demobilization, redeployment
and improvement of the living conditions in barracks; and (h) the transformation of the security
and defense forces into agents for pacification and consolidation of the rule of law.

The second pillar aims to promote economic growth and employment creation. The measures
envisaged under this strategic, domain are: (a) improvement of the business and investment
climate; (b) activation of the productive sectors of the economy and promotion of diversification
and competitiveness of the economy; (c) rehabilitation of the energy sector; (d) development of
road infrastructure; (e) development of overland and waterways infrastructure; and (f) supporting
the sectors of air transport, weather forecasting and communications.

Based on these pillars, the government's program of economic reforms focuses in 2009-10 on
strengthening public finances, modernizing the public administration and removing impediments
for private sector development.

  i.   Public Financial Management


On the first block, Guinea-Bissau has achieved progress in macroeconomic stabilization and the
implementation of public finance management reforms. Fiscal performance has been satisfactory
despite the difficult external environment and unfavorable political situation. Better-than-
expected revenue collection throughout the year partly compensated for delays in donor
financing. As a result, the country performance under the EPCA program with the IMF has been
broadly satisfactory.
There has been strong progress towards improving public financial management seeking to
achieve fiscal discipline and improve the efficiency and transparency in the use of public
resources. Reforms will be pursued in light o f technical assistance and support received from the
IMF and development partners in recent years, including the World Bank in the context of a
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), the AfDB,
the EU and bilateral donors.
In 2009-2010, progress toward the adoption of a modern and stable legal and accounting
framework for public financial management consistent with good international practices has
been continuous. The Council of Ministers adopted the draft Organic Law for Budget and a
Public Accounting Decree and submitted to the National People's Assembly (ANP) which
should approve it in 2010. In the same direction, the Council of Ministries has adopted the
decrees-law establishing the Financial Controller and the reorganization of the General
Directorate of Budget in line with the recommendations from the PEMFAR. Furthermore, the
roles of credit managers and public accounts have been regulated through government decrees
and official communications issued by the Ministry of Finance.
In parallel, operational advances in budget management have accompanied the institutional
strengthening of budgetary execution. The installation of the budget preparation and execution
modules of the SIGFIP system in the budget units of the central administration to improve
efficiency and transparency in budget execution, the issuance of manual of procedures to be
observed by all the ministries and government agencies have made operational the legal and
institutional changes supported by the World Bank. The government has also worked in the
installation of the SIFGIP accounting module. In addition, the budgetary classification according
to WAEMU codes has been already applied in the 2009 budget.
The government recently launched an administration reform program supported by an EU-
funded project (PARAP), under the joint leadership of the ministries of Finance and Public
Administration. Personnel expenses consume more than 75 percent of government revenues. The
government is aware that the size and cost of the civil service is neither financially sustainable
nor prone to permit the development of an efficient and effective public administration. On this
direction, the government completed the biometric census of the civil servants and currently is
validating its results to proceed with the corrective measures. Final checks are being
implemented to guarantee the accuracy of the findings. The final results should help to know the
exact number of civil servants and identify those who have to retire from the public
administration. In fact, some corrective measures have been already adopted that generated
significant savings that should be increase with the adequate handling of irregularities found by
the biometric census.



                                              - 53 -
With the legal framework largely in place, and the progress in operating SIGFIP, it is expected a
more effective budget execution, higher effectiveness in controls, the production of reliable
budget reports and faster turnaround time to prepare annual accounts.

In addition, the government is completing the technical assessment for the acquisition of a new
payroll information system that will consolidate the information generated by the biometric
census and strengthen the control on personnel expenses. The expected benefits of the civil
service census and the payroll system are expected to be substantial.

Related with the wage bill, the government is also committed to modernizing the defense and
security sector and its restructuring to adapt it to the financial capacity of the country. The cost of
defense and security forces is about a third of the payroll and the government is committed to
reducing the burden on the budget of the security sector. The EU is providing about
EUR8.O million to fund the military demobilization.

The public financial management reform actions also include improvements in government
procurement. In 2009, pilot reforms were targeted at 5 ministries. The government has started to
update the existing procurement code with a view to harmonizing it with WAEMU standards
with the adoption by the Council of Ministries of a Decree Law to turn the existent system
compatible with WAEMU principles. Regulatory and control functions also have been adapted
in line with the WAEMU's procurement directives. Finally, the Council of Ministries adopted a
decree establishing the Central Procurement Unit (CPU).



  ii.   Private Sector Development

The second block of government actions for which we request World Bank support are aimed at
improving the business environment in Guinea-Bissau. On this regard, we recognize the
precarious climate for private investments. Guinea-Bissau ranks at the 181 position among the
183 countries of the Doing Business 2010.

The government recognizes that a more dynamic public sector will require improved
infrastructure and a more conducive environment for business as necessary conditions to boost
economic growth and reduce widespread poverty in the country. Our private sector development
agenda is reflected 'in the poverty reduction strategy and has experienced an accelerated progress
in 2009-2010. In 2009 we adopted a new Investment Code, which removes the multiplicity of
investment regimes, eliminates the discretion of granting incentives under the old law, and
provides for a level playing field for private investors.

Led by the Ministries of Economy, Plan and Regional Integration and Justice, the government
reaped strong progress on the simplification of administrative procedures. In March 2010, the
Council of Ministries adopted the Decree Law including several measures to simplify steps for
business creation, development and dissolution improving the ease of doing business in Guinea-
Bissau through the Decreto de SimplijkaqZo de Procedimentos.




                                                - 54 -
Another important step with World Bank support was the establishment of a one-stop shop for
business. In fact, the Council of Ministries approved in March the establishment of the Guichet
Unique or Centro de FormaqEo de Empresas. This center brings together different entities of the
government in the same physical space, and thus enables taxpayers to obtain their records from
all the entities in one step. Its objective is to provide, through the offer of better channels of
access to the state, solutions. to facilitate the operation, expansion and modernization of
established business, as well as start of new businesses in Guinea-Bissau including areas such as
tax, credit, environmental regulations, infrastructure, and the registration of businesses. The
Guichet Unique will be fully operational by the end of 2010.

Finally, the ANP just approved the Law on Information and Telecommunications Technology
that sets the regulatory framework for telecommunication services a sector that rapidly expanded
in the last years. It is expected that this law will lay the foundations for a more stable, simple and
transparent legal and policy environment for private investment in the sector

Overall, the modernization and alignment on regional norms of business laws, Investment Code,
business simplification will facilitate the gradual improvement in the environment for business in
Guinea-Bissau.



Request for Financial Assistance

The Government of Guinea-Bissau remains firmly committed to its program of reforms on the
public finance management and private sector development areas outlined above and would
welcome World Bank financial assistance. We appreciate the prompt consideration of an
economic governance reform grant in support of the measures that have already been adopted
and those which are under implementation.

Press Release No. 10/185                                      International Monetary Fund
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                         Washington, D.C. 2043 1 USA
May 7,2010


  IMF Executive Board Approves US$33.3 Million Arrangement Under the Extended
    Credit Facility and Additional US$1.5 Million in Interim HIPC Assistance for
                                   Guinea-Bissau

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in an amount equivalent SDR 22.365 million
(US$33.3 million) to support Guinea Bissau's medium-term economic program. The
Executive Board also approved the second tranche of interim assistance under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of SDR 1.O 16 million (US$1.5 million).

The authorities' economic program aims at helping the country move towards fiscal and debt
sustainability, as well as achieving stronger economic growth and poverty alleviation. The
program focuses on reinforcing public finances, modernizing public administration, and
raising the quality of public services. It also seeks to promote job creation by removing
impediments to private sector development and enhancing the provision of financial
services. Satisfactory performance could pave the way for Guinea-Bissau to benefit from
debt relief by the end of the year through the enhanced HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives (MDRI).

Following the Executive Board's discussion on Guinea Bissau, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:

"Despite difficult external and domestic circumstances, economic growth has been resilient
in Guinea-Bissau and macroeconomic performance has improved in recent years. The
authorities achieved most targets of their 2009 economic program, and implemented
important structural reforms. The Fund supported these efforts through a disbursement under
the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance.

"To build on these achievements and provide the basis for stronger economic growth and
poverty alleviation, the government has defined a medium-term macroeconomic and
structural reform program for 2010-2012. This program aims at raising economic growth,
keeping low inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and gradually narrowing the external


                                           - 62 -
current account imbalance. Political stability, effective governance, and strong commitment
to reform are essential to the success of the program and the full engagement of donors.

"The 2010 budget is an important first step in the medium-term macroeconomic program that
would help move Guinea-Bissau toward sustainable fiscal and external positions. In order to
achieve that objective, the budget introduces strong revenue measures, reallocates
expenditure in favor of priority areas, including social spending, and addresses more
decisively the accumulation of domestic arrears.

"The government's program of economic reforms appropriately emphasizes enhancing
public financial management, strengthening fiscal controls, broadening the tax base,
modernizing tax administration, and raising the quality of public services. It also seeks to
remove impediments to private sector development, improve the provision of financial
services, step up access to social services, and alleviate poverty.

"Satisfactory performance on the medium-term economic program will help pave the way for
Guinea-Bissau to reach the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion
point in late 2010. Debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), together with additional debt relief from bilateral
creditors, will significantly alleviate the debt burden and help Guinea-Bissau advance toward
external and fiscal sustainability," added Mr. Portugal.
